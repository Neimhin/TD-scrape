          <p eId="para_1">I have notice from Senator Kitt that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to indicate if he will sanction the contract for a new swimming pool at Tuam, County Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Paddy Burke of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to clarify how a new waste water treatment plant and drainage system for Castlebar, County Mayo, will be funded and how it will benefit Castlebar since it has been granted as a build, design and operate scheme rather than a conventional scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the position in regard to St. Patrick's national school in Diswellstown, Castleknock; if provision is being made for the purchase of a site; and to report on progress as to whether a public private partnership is being entered into with a housing developer in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to proceed with Ireland's accession to the Antarctic Treaty 1959.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_10">In view of the recent shocking report on the higher than average use of illicit drugs in Ireland in comparison to Europe, the need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to outline when the regional drugs task force will start work on the ground, as a budget of only €60,000 has been allocated; and when there will be a real commitment to preventing the spread of the scourge of drugs in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_12">The urgent need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to intervene with ESB International and Hibernian Wind Energy who are developing a wind farm at Derrybrien in County Galway so as to allay the fears of local residents that no further danger will occur as a result of development works on site; and if he will satisfy the residents that these companies have complied with their statutory duties and have not violated conditions of planning associated with this development.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Kitt, Paddy Burke and Morrissey and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Ross, Feighan and Ulick Burke may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_15">The Leader will be aware that the Government is planning to roll out electronic voting next year for local and European elections to ensure people can vote by the electronic method in each polling station throughout the country. There is general support for this even though it will cost approximately €38 million this year to implement the proposal. Both principal Opposition parties have raised questions about the security system in place for the new system of voting. It is important to have a debate in this House with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who can take questions on the issue from all sides over approximately 40 minutes. As the integrity of the ballot is the cornerstone of our democracy, it is important that there is confidence in the security system and that there is acceptance from all parties. Will the Leader make time available for such a debate over the next week or so? It would be a worthwhile debate because it is important that all the questions on the issue are answered before the system is rolled out.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">I agree fully with Senator John Paul Phelan's comments yesterday when he asked the Leader to organise a debate on the arts and funding for the arts. We are approaching the centenary of the founding of the Abbey Theatre, our great national theatre in Dublin, which was established in 1903. The first performance took place in 1904. The Leader will be aware that there is a huge debate in Dublin and throughout the country about the future of the Abbey – whether it is to be moved, future funding for the theatre and the proposals from the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism about this great national institution. Will she make time available for a debate in this House to allow discussion not just on the general issue of arts but also to allow the Abbey Theatre and its future role in this great city to be debated and teased out?</p>

          <p eId="para_21">There is an article in yesterday and today's newspapers about the proposal to build a golf course on Bartragh Island off Ballina. I do not play golf and I wonder about people who spend a lot of time at it. On the other hand, it is a hugely important tourism attraction and one of the most eco-friendly pursuits. I am aware it is very important to protect the Kerry slug, the natterjack toad and other creatures. If there were damage to the environment, I would be very clear on my position. There is no hotel along the coast of north Mayo from Belmullet. Mayo has now lost the gas pipeline and has experienced a landslide. The golf course is proposed for an area a little further along the coast where the people seem to get no breaks. We could pick any acre of Ireland and find a good reason for not putting a shovel in the ground. We should take a compromise position on these issues; the truth is that if we were to take the extreme position, we would not even be cutting our lawns. I would like to hear the Government's view on the national plan and where it stands on this type of proposal which will damage the area.</p>

          <p eId="para_24">—because of an extraordinary succession of decisions by the High Court and Supreme Court in the case of the property rights of perhaps the most exclusive golf course in the country. I do not know if Senator Callanan is a member, but he obviously knows more about it than I do. I am not prepared to accept that golf courses are necessarily eco-friendly if the price of that eco-friendliness is to exclude the vast majority of local people.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">Earlier this week the heads of the Irish universities raised, as they have done on a number of occasions, the question of cutbacks in third level education. It is probably correct to say that primary education is more important, which it is, but the truth is that all levels of education are extremely important. However, the area which will have an immediate effect on national competitiveness is a cutback in third level education. It is a matter for the Government to sort out what it believes in. If it is saying that fewer people will graduate from our third level institutions, then it is effectively saying it is going for a lower skilled workforce. As this will have an immediate effect on the country's capacity to develop economically, there is an urgent need for a debate on funding for third level education in particular, and also the funding of research in third level education. I would like the Leader to consider this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">Last night a leaflet from Sinn Féin was put through my door. The last paragraph read, "Sinn Féin is dedicated to forcing a British withdrawal from the occupied Six Counties." I heard the President of Sinn Féin say the direct opposite less than two weeks ago. All of us on this island are entitled to know which is the real Sinn Féin. Is it the one which is dedicated to forcing a British withdrawal, which means forcing one million people who are British to withdraw or, alternatively, is it the nice, touchy feely language of inclusion which is articulated in Belfast when it is politically necessary? Is this a case of Sinn Féin revealing a different side because it is 200 miles south of the Border? Oireachtas Members would like to know which is the real Sinn Féin.</p>

The confidence of people not just in south Dublin but throughout Ireland has been undermined by the fact that subsidence in footpaths may damage old piping. While I am not an alarmist, this could happen in any part of Ireland. Having discussed the matter with the various agencies, whether Eircom, Bord Gáis or the local authorities, the Minister should make a statement in this House on the condition of the piping in various parts of the country.

Let us congratulate the Government as things are going rather better than expected. There is one problem to which I should draw attention and it would be useful if the House were to debate it. Some figures were produced last week on what is known as private sector debt, indicating that individuals in their personal lives are borrowing phenomenal amounts of money. That is manifesting itself most obviously in the housing market. What we see here is a real problem of debt, growing by about 25% per annum, particularly among young people. A problem will arise if interest rates increase. If they rise steeply, the problem will be critical and will lead to the repossession of houses and people being bankrupted. It will lead to people not being able to pay their credit card bills. I suggest the Minister comes into the House to address this problem. I ask, in particular, that he address the problem of lending by the banks and the building societies which is so rash and reckless that these institutions no longer look for multiples of income when lending money for houses. They do not care about multiples of income but about how much equity or value is in the house, as opposed to the loan. This indicates they are looking at repossessions, not at ability to pay. At the end of the day, the price we will pay could be appalling. We could get into a negative equity situation in this country which would be a massive economic problem. I do not wish to denigrate the Government's achievements in turning the economy around—</p>

It should be possible to allow these discos to continue by closing down a bar where no alcoholic drinks would be served. Young people would still have the buzz and the atmosphere of the disco. Under the current legislation, there is a difficulty for organisations such as the No Name club in holding a disco. This issue should be examined. I understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is favourably disposed towards making a slight change in the law to allow those discos to continue.

In addition, the Minister proposes to introduce a new €600 fee for the emptying of septic tanks. These two stealth taxes follow the abolition of housing grants last year.

          <p eId="para_52">I also add modest support to Senator Quinn's call for a rethink of our national anthem. The national anthem was fine for its time and expressed the spirit of that time. However, I am not sure it still expresses the ethos of the nation, which is largely pacifist and anti-violence. I find it difficult to explain to my children living in the North the importance of abjuring violence and the futility of armed struggle while at the same time encouraging them to sing the national anthem. The same is true of other national anthems. The <i>Marseillaise</i> is an absolutely bloody affair and if one goes past the first stanza of <i>God Save the Queen</i> it is horribly sectarian and narrow. These anthems have had their day. The spirit of the nation is rather different now and it is time to move on.</p>

While I recognise there is a shortage of national school teachers and that many schools have had to rely on untrained teachers for years, I hope the Minister will come in and clarify his position regarding the future of a course such as that being provided by Hibernia College and also his failure to consult established and traditional bodies as to their future. If it is the situation that the cutbacks in education manifest themselves through the shortcutting of teacher training, the issue should be debated. I hope this debate takes place quickly in order to focus people's attention on what we should be doing rather than on outside protests.

We have many traditional music weekends around the country, especially in the summer, where skills are handed down at workshops by day.

          <p eId="para_62">The Opposition called for an arts debate yesterday. This is a good call, particularly in this centenary year of the Abbey Theatre. Senator O'Toole raised the issue of Bartragh Island. The divergence of opinion on the issue is interesting. Everybody has their own opinion. I was surprised to hear people were against a plan which I thought sounded good. Senator Ryan urged caution on the matter of golf courses. Where there are good golf courses people, particularly tourists, have come to play and have brought a lot of money to local areas. Senator Ryan also raised the topic of third level colleges, particularly the cutbacks in research, and stressed the necessity of research for third level colleges. The Senator also discussed the matter of the Sinn Féin leaflet which, I believe, is of a local nature. He asked which was the real Sinn Féin, the one that co-exists with other parties or the one that wishes to root out everybody else. Perhaps the Senator might show the leaflet to me, as I have not seen it.</p>

The Senator also raised a very interesting point about a new national anthem. It is instructive to see the way Ireland's Call is treated and sung. So often, national anthems are not sung on pitches but everyone still knows them. The sentiment of actually being at a match, with the crowds and the anthem rolling is quite strong.

I hope to make contact with him today to ask him to attend this House because there is general concern about these matters. I feel that he would be keen to accept our invitation. He spoke about the general increase in burglaries, which rose by 18% and 25% throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">Senator Minihan echoed the call for a debate on the arts. That would be very useful and it is amazing that we have not had one to date. We had a Bill on tourism from the Department. The Government will be glad to hear the kind words of Senator Ross on the Exchequer returns. The Senator also expressed concern at the way banks are operating lending policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">While I did not initially understand Senator Kitt's point, it is well made. After 9 p.m. young people cannot go into a premises with a bar, even if the bar is not open.

          <p eId="para_73">Senator Maurice Hayes supported the call for a debate on stem cell research and also raised the matter of a new national anthem. National anthems are all rather bloodthirsty in recalling past glories, if one could term them that. I do not know how one would go about having a national debate on the choice of national anthem. It is interesting that the question is arising now.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">Senator Ulick Burke raised the matter of teacher training at primary level and asked for the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to attend the House to debate the matter.

However, he has asked me to thank the House for the opportunity to discuss the crucially important issue of waste management.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">As Senators will know, since coming into office, the Minister has placed waste management at the top of his environmental agenda. It is heartening to see that Members of the Seanad are equally conscious of the importance of this issue and have demonstrated this by setting aside time for this debate this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">Waste management presents one of our greatest environmental challenges to which we must respond in a comprehensive, multi-faceted way. Unlike certain other environmental challenges which have a much more global dimension, we are fortunate in the sense that waste is an area where the scope for progress rests significantly within our own control. This applies to all of us, Government, the wider political system, statutory authorities, providers of waste services and every member of the public. Waste is a collective responsibility and requires collectively-based solutions. There are several key factors in addressing successfully the waste challenges. We need a clear policy approach, to plan in order to provide a basis for turning our policies into reality and to ensure that our approach is backed up by a strong, comprehensive legislative code which will provide the necessary degree of environmental regulation. Finally, we need to ensure that we achieve the required scale of "on the ground" transformation, in other words, we need to focus on implementation. At this stage, we measure up reasonably well under the policy, plans and legislation headings.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">In so far as policy is concerned, we have laid out our stall very clearly in the Changing Our Ways and Delivering Change policy statements. The approach on which they are based is centred on respect for the waste hierarchy of prevention, minimisation, re-use, recycle, recovery and safe disposal. We took this approach because it is widely respected and applied internationally, not least at EU level where it forms the basis of the EU Community Waste Management Strategy. It has provided the basis for the successes of the best waste performers in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">We are all well aware of the difficulties which delayed the adoption of waste plans around the country. Firm action was required to bring the process to a conclusion and the Government was not found wanting on that score. Since late 2001 we have had full national coverage in terms of waste management plans, allowing the important work of delivering on the plans to begin in earnest. We have made major progress on the legislative code governing the waste sector. A comprehensive system for regulating the waste sector was introduced under the Waste Management Act 1996 and this has been updated on several occasions, most recently under the Protection of the Environment Act 2003 which was the subject of considerable debate here earlier this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">Policy, plans and legislation are the foundation stones but they must be built upon through speedy and effective implementation. We must give practical effect to the waste hierarchy and ensure that waste management plans are implemented in a timely and comprehensive way and that the law on waste is fully and effectively enforced. Since taking office the Government has focused on implementation and I am happy to indicate to Senators that significant progress is being made. Much of what we hear about waste revolves around thermal treatment and landfill, but there is also significant activity at the upper end of the hierarchy including waste prevention, minimisation and recycling.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">Waste prevention was identified as a key area for action in last year's Delivering Change policy statement. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, is in the final stages of having a national waste prevention programme established. This will operate through the EPA and a core prevention team will be established within the agency to drive the programme. Arising from the success of the plastic bags levy in achieving important prevention and re-use objectives, we recently commissioned consultants to examine the issues surrounding the implementation of economic instruments, including environmental levies, on other problematic materials such as chewing gum, fast food packaging and ATM receipts. This report will be received shortly and the Minister will study it carefully with a view to bringing forward detailed proposals at the earliest opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">Significantly, the most recent EPA National Waste Database Report indicates that our recycling of municipal waste has increased from 9% in 1998 to 13% in 2001. While this is welcome progress, we have a long way to go to get to the national target of 35% recycling by 2013. However, the building blocks for achieving this are being put in place. We have provided €22 million from the environment fund over the last 12 months to support a range of local authority recycling projects, principally, bring banks, civic amenity sites and biological treatment facilities. Segregated collection services for household recyclables are now available to one third of all households in the State and are being extended all the time. Preparations are advancing for the establishment of a market development board for recyclable materials. Producer responsibility initiatives, which have been so successful in the areas of packaging waste and farm plastics, are being extended to a wide range of other areas, including construction and demolition waste, end-of-life vehicles, waste electrical equipment, newsprint and tyres. A producer responsibility unit will also be established within the EPA. My Department will also be publishing shortly a national biodegradable waste strategy which will provide the framework to facilitate the diversion of 65% of biodegradable waste from landfill by 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">While these initiatives hold out the potential for making further major progress in preventing, reducing and recycling waste, they cannot provide the full solution. The experience of the best environmental performers in Europe shows that energy recovery and residual landfill also have a role to play. While some would have us believe that we can wish away this aspect of waste management plans, as a Government we cannot deal in fantasy. We must work within a framework that is rooted firmly in reality. We all accept that education and awareness are crucial in securing a better understanding and acceptance of this aspect of the waste debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">Accordingly, in addition to the recent Race Against Waste advertising campaign, a parallel waste communications strategy is being launched to try to address the misconceptions and misunderstandings surrounding waste management and the facilities for which waste management plans provide. My Department is liaising closely with all the key stakeholders in driving forward this crucial aspect of the overall campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">While on the subject of implementing waste management policy and plans, it would be remiss of me not to say a few words on the issue of waste charges, which has been the subject of some attention over recent months, particularly in the Dublin area. Across Europe, direct user charges for household waste collection services are widely applied, particularly in the context of increasing awareness of the financial and environmental cost of waste generation and of encouraging waste reduction and recycling. It is only logical that such principled support for waste charges should be built into EU policy and legislation. The polluter pays principle, one of the cornerstones of EU environmental policy, is therefore reflected in waste legislation at European level as well as in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">The bottom line is that charges serve an important environmental purpose. They have been in place in many parts of the country for some time and their recent introduction in Dublin brings domestic waste management practice in Ireland into line with EU norms. Leaving aside these environmental imperatives, it is noteworthy that at no stage during the current debate have those opposed to waste charges offered any credible alternative solution as to how we can tackle our waste management problems. The anti-bin charge lobby has a comfortably simplistic view of how to deal with domestic waste. It thinks that waste management should be looked after by local authorities and not involve the wider community and society and that local authorities can take away householders' waste at no cost to anyone and dispose of it nowhere, if possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">This escapist view may fit in with some of the more fundamentalist ideologies that characterise some of those involved in the anti-bin charge campaign. It also may serve to explain the very narrow base of support which the campaign has attracted. What it would certainly do is disastrously fail the needs of householders and society in general, which wants an efficient and sustainable waste management service, as well as one which will improve the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">We must see events in Dublin in recent weeks for what they are – a clear statement by a very small group of people that they refuse to obey the law requiring the payment of their waste charges. Perhaps even more alarmingly, they are an indication that the people involved also refuse to accept the consequences of their actions, which are provided for in law and passed through the democratic process, as well as refusing to abide by orders of the courts. To have the authority of the Executive, the Legislature and the courts challenged in this way is unacceptable in any democratic society. The law is the law and must be upheld.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">Turning back to the implementation related theme of my contribution, the final priority issue I wish to touch on concerns the implementation of waste legislation. Instances of illegal dumping, some on an apparently significant scale, have come to my attention and have highlighted the need for a much more concerted effort to enforce the waste code. Having introduced a number of stronger enforcement powers under the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the Minister recently announced the establishment of a new Office of Environmental Enforcement. Located within the Environmental Protection Agency, the new office will have a broad remit as regards the enforcement of environmental legislation, both directly and through local authorities, but its initial activities will focus on the waste area in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">The establishment of the new office ushers in a new era of environmental enforcement by having a dedicated, professional and fully resourced team with extensive powers. As a result, we will be much better placed to ensure that those who flout the law and cause environmental pollution are held to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">I again express appreciation on behalf of the Minister and myself for the opportunity to address the House on this issue. I have outlined, in a broad sense, the current state of play in terms of waste management in Ireland and I hope I have demonstrated to Members that with policies, plans and legislation now well embedded, work on the critical area of implementation is proceeding apace on a number of fronts.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">As I mentioned at the outset, waste is a collective responsibility and requires collectively based solutions. From the viewpoint of the Minister and the Government, political leadership, drive and determination will continue to characterise our approach to transforming waste management in Ireland. The House's interest in the process is welcome and I look forward to hearing Members' views during the remainder of the discussion.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_54">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_101">Hopefully, he will come at some future date and debate the whole issue with us. Today the environment occupies a central position in our awareness. The reason is simple: the quality of our life is now threatened by developments which humans have started, but cannot control. In the worst case, the result could be that we no longer have the opportunity to improve the quality of life by our own means. When consumption goes up, more waste is produced. This waste mountain began to grow faster with the invention of plastic and the proliferation of new chemicals and metal alloy products.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">Other factors were the mass manufacturing of goods with built in obsolescence. The use of packaging leaped ahead with the development of refrigeration and rapid transport systems, which meant that more goods and foodstuffs could be packaged and sent all over the world, instead of being produced and sold locally. The boom in disposable consumer goods such as razors, pens, cameras, nappies, etc. added another twist to humanity's tale of waste. Our country is now choking on waste. The same could be said of other parts of the world, but Europe is ahead of us with regard to tackling the waste problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">In terms of materials usage, the industrial society squanders natural resources and creates huge amounts of waste. As more and more countries embrace consumerism, there is growing support for a radical change of approach to materials usage and waste management. The goal of sustainable society is not helped by disposable one-time use products and consumer goods which are cheaper to replace than repair. This is an area that on many occasions I have said should be looked at by the drivers of waste directives in the European Commission. Concerned politicians place production methods that generate less harmful waste on top of their wish list, particularly at election time. To make the most of the waste materials at hand, recycling should be given the highest priority in our environmental policy. At this stage it is up to the Minister of State and the Government to find markets for the materials collected for recycling by local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">The objective should be to recycle as much waste as possible. The evidence from other countries that I have visited is that sorting at source results in a higher degree of recycling and ensures that non-recyclable waste is handled in an environment-friendly way. At any recycling station, the most important thing is that the waste is properly sorted. The containers at the station are clearly marked to identify what kind of waste goes into each. It is important to have staff at recycling stations to give information and guidance if there is any doubt as to what goes where.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">I understand the Government has been given a five-year deadline, within the last few weeks, to improve its performance on recycling and must now meet much tougher targets for materials such as paper, glass and metal. The new drive towards more sustainable use of materials has been approved by the European Parliament and looks likely to demand new thinking on waste, if the goals laid down are to be achieved by 2008. These goals include increasing targets from between 25% and 45% to between 55% and 80%, depending on the material.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">The recycling and waste recovery targets, which are legally binding, are part of an existing directive that the European Parliament voted to strengthen. To meet the targets set for Ireland, the Government will have to persuade everyone to recycle more, but business will also have to reduce the packaging it creates and emphasis must be placed on a reduction of the volume of waste generated in industrial manufacturing and retail processes and also in the home. A new local authority support unit should be set up by the Minister of State to prioritise needs and deliver a toolkit of solutions to help local authorities meet their statutory targets for the recycling of municipal waste. Educational programmes and financial initiatives, such as a tax on packaging with built in costs and a choice given to the consumer, can encourage this. The plastic bag tax introduced by the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government was a major success.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">Since the current Minister took control of waste management there has been no evidence of leadership or meaningful funding of local authorities, demonstrating that the Minister is not serious about achieving real results. Since the Protection of the Environment Bill was passed, there has been no leadership or policy direction to local authorities, public agencies, businesses or the public, apart from a few national advertisements, where a man swings a rat, across the countryside. Where are the waste services and infrastructure to meet modern waste management needs? Where is the commitment to a network of new, state of the art landfill sites? Despite the incineration proposals, there will always be a need for a residual landfill capacity and any waste management process must be sustainable. There must be proper assessments of the implications of any developments to prevent any further deterioration of environmental, social and economic structures and to ensure they make a positive contribution to the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">The Minister must introduce best practice to waste management and incorporate public preferences at planning stage, something that is not being done at present. The proposals on incinerators have generated opposition in many areas, as we see from the protests in Cork, Tipperary and Meath. Residents are frightened by serious health concerns, including cancer claims, but the Government has done nothing to allay their fears. The precautionary principle should apply until the Government can give guarantees on the safety of incinerators. The focus of the Minister's thinking must shift from methods to get rid of rubbish to processes that will prevent wastage and conserve natural resources. To achieve this he must focus on the upper part of the EU waste hierarchy which states that prevention and minimisation of waste should be followed by re-use, repair and recycling.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">The Government, under the Waste Management Acts, Litter Pollution Act, Protection of the Environment Act and other legislation, has the necessary power to prohibit unnecessary generation of waste. The most recent Act allows the Minister the powers to provide for requirements on the nature of waste, to specify certain designs of package and to control waste importation, distribution, supply and sale. It is time for the Minister, now that he has taken the power of the elimination of waste from locally elected councillors, to use the numerous powers he has vested in himself, county managers and officials to clean up the countryside.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">The Minister should tell us what he is doing to prevent the carbon waste from plastic milk cartons. Will he go to the diaries and encourage them to reintroduce glass milk bottles? The Litter Pollution Act has been in place since 1997 and the national litter action plan since 2001 but there are still litter problems throughout the State, with indiscriminate dumping on nearly every county road and cul-de-sac. There should be less talk and more enforcement, something the general public would welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">In 1999 we were promised that a national litter pollution monitoring system that would review local litter management plans would be fully operational by the end of that year but there have been no results from this venture. We have only been told by local authorities that they are starved of cash by the Government when it comes to implementing plans or proper reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">The An Taisce-led national spring clean in 1999, 2000 and 2001, hailed by this Government as a tremendous success, has been abandoned. The development of broadly based local partnerships, with local communities, tidy towns committees, schools, development associations and residents' associations in housing estates that help to achieve a litter free environment, has been hampered by a lack of finance from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Those associations have played an important role, with the assistance of FÁS community employment schemes, in improving the appearance of towns, villages and the countryside and I congratulate them. While much progress has been made, however, more needs to be done. What, however, did this Government do? It reduced community employment scheme numbers from 40,000 to less than 20,000.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelPKitt" eId="spk_57">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_116">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House and thank him for his contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">I am glad the Minister of State mentioned the levy on plastic bags. It was very successful and the former Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who introduced it deserves credit. There were many objections at the time and difficulties were put in the way of the levy but it has been a great success and shows the positive attitude of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">The Minister of State referred to the debate on thermal treatment and landfill, difficult issues that we must tackle. In the Connacht regional waste management area, we have not yet identified a landfill site in County Galway or a site for an incinerator. It is a controversial issue but we are running out of time because the present landfill site in Ballinasloe has a life span that will last until 2005. It is time that all counties in Connacht looked at proposals for landfill sites and treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">The Minister of State has rightly emphasised the importance of recycling and I hope we will prioritise that issue. I received a letter from Repak earlier in the year where it listed its achievements. In 2002, Repak funded the recycling of 323,000 tonnes of packaging waste, 40% of the total packaging on the market last year. Through Repak's efforts, the State met its EU targets for recycling of packaging for 2001 and is well on the way to meeting the 2005 targets. The organisation has 1,200 members, from small corner shops to large companies, and it deserves credit for spending €11 million in direct recycling in 2002 and an extra €4 million to fund the expansion of the bring bank infrastructure. It is confident that there will eventually be an average of one bottle bank for every 1,000 people. It is also involved, as are An Taisce and local authorities, in educational initiatives. For example, approximately 700 schools were involved in the Repak cash for cans project, which was targeted at primary school children, and approximately 7 million drinks cans were collected. There is also the Repak national recycling week, which is designed to raise the awareness of recycling in general, and the Repak green Christmas campaign. The work it is doing in conjunction with local authorities and in partnership with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has shown the resources that are available and highlighted the area of enforcement. I hope it will continue the good work it is doing in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">I understand that Forfás established a waste management taskforce on following an integrated approach to waste management. This involved a national plan for hazardous waste and a regional waste management plan for the management of non-hazardous waste produced by regional and local authorities. They have made progress on waste prevention, minimisation and segregation, reusing and recycling. Senators from rural areas will agree that we have gone in a short time from having no refuse collection service to a situation where we throw everything in the bin. Recycling bins and bags are now provided, in many cases by private contractors, in rural areas. Due to increases in charges, people say that refuse collections services have become expensive. However, the private sector has become involved because local authorities cannot cover all the different areas of refuse services. My local private contractor informed me that he is moving from the recycling bag to coloured bins next year, but without any increases in charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">There is an anomaly with regard to the waiver scheme. It is available in Dublin, Galway city and other areas, but it is not available in rural areas because private contractors are operating the scheme. I suggest to the Minister of State that, just as we had a subsidy for group water schemes to provide free domestic water, the same idea should be considered for waste charges. We cannot have a situation where people in rural areas cannot afford to pay the charges because they do not have a waiver scheme similar to those in towns and cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">I am a big fan of the green school projects. There are 35 schools in County Galway involved in the scheme with 32 receiving the green flag from An Taisce. This started off as a simple project where schools collected newspapers, milk cartons and drinks cans for recycling. Now, they have moved into other areas such as composting, reusing materials, such as egg cartons and ice lolly sticks, and bringing nature trails and gardens to schools. This is an important initiative by the local authorities, schools and An Taisce that I hope will continue to be successful. The local authorities have many other proposals with regard to this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">Regardless of whether we like it, we must have landfill sites, yet people believe they can be done without. Local authorities have been slow and have had difficulties getting suitable sites, so much so that private contractors are looking for planning permission for sites. We are informed that these private operators can cut through the red tape involved and get planning permission quickly. If permission is rushed through, there will be objections and appeals to An Bord Pleanála. It is better to have consultations such as those in which local authorities are involved. People are concerned that landfill sites will be located near houses and communities. However, it is proposed that they should located one mile from villages, communities or schools. That is a fair proposal. There are plenty of opportunities for landfill sites in rural areas. I hope we will see speedy action on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">It is also important to remember that schools have put in place with local authorities many litter control programmes. Litter control is an important issue that is linked to pollution. For example, schools are now not only involved in waste issues but also in water conservation. If we do not control litter, we will have a problem with water supply. Many schools are now looking at the question of phosphates, detergent and disinfectants in the water supply. These are chemicals we are just throwing into the ground. The whole impact on our water supply from this pollution and the lack of litter control must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">Energy management is another issue that comes into this debate. In many offices and workplaces photocopiers are left on all day. If this was prevented and, for example, different lighting was used, we could have a better outcome in terms of energy management. I hope I do not sound like a killjoy, but these are important issues. One is told often by managers that lighting and heating are left on in offices all day. This should not be allowed to happen. This is also part of the whole issue of waste and energy management.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">In County Galway there are five contractors for waste collection. One of the advantages of private sector involvement in waste management there is that the biggest landfill in the county in Ballinasloe has reduced 40% of its waste. However, this site will close in 2005 so we must work hard to get a new landfill for the county. I agree with the Minister of State about paying for the collection of waste. I understand the charge in Dublin is €150 per year, which is reasonable. However, there are other parts of the country where it is twice or even three times that figure. We must bring in a better system for rural areas. The subsidy I referred to could be a possible remedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">The Minister of State also spoke about illegal dumping. That is the most serious issue that affects us. Despite all the work we are doing, waste is still being dumped in bogs, on the side of the road and even outside bring banks. I do not understand why people do not place waste into the bring or bottle banks, leaving it on the side of the site. What will happen is that the bring and bottle banks will be taken away and that will be a retrograde and disastrous step.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_58">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_128">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House. I congratulate him on taking the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen's place. I am sorry to hear he is indisposed. The Minister of State has given us a clear view of the policy on waste management and issues that I was not aware of, such as the waste hierarchy. I was on the board of Repak, but I cannot say much now because Senator Kitt has covered all the areas that I wished to cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">I stepped down from Repak when I was elected to the Seanad. Repak takes a large amount of money from business to relieve them of waste. Supermarkets, in particular, provide much packaging to customers and are obliged to take it back if they do not contribute to Repak. The supermarkets that Senator Kitt referred to are paying that contribution to relieve themselves of the responsibility they would have otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">I want to focus on the hot topic of the day, the dispute about refuse charges. Nine months ago to the day, when we discussed the Environment Bill 2003, I made the point that waste charges for householders should always be related directly to the amount of waste they put out to be collected. At the time the Minister suggested it was enough to provide in the Bill for local authorities to have the power to do this, rather than requiring them to do so. In view of the widespread trouble in collecting these charges, more attention needs to be paid to this aspect of the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">I support the principle of waste charges at household level. The main argument for charging at that level rather than including the cost in general taxation is that individual charges can establish a link between a person's behaviour and the amount that he or she pays. They are, or they should be, based on the principle that the user pays. The importance of the approach is that, if properly structured – it is not fully structured yet – the user pays for a service in proportion to the extent that he or she uses it. The more of the service people use, the more they pay, which is the cardinal principle of this approach. This gives users an element of control over how much they pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">I have a neighbour who lives on her own, is very careful about what she does and only uses her bin once every four weeks. In our house we fill it every week and pay for it. By reducing their use of the service, people should be able to reduce the amount they pay. This system allows us to put a brake on the extent to which services are drawn on. If a service is free, users have no incentive to restrict their use of it. This is why the European Union is so keen on having this kind of scheme as well as metered water charges. It wants paying for the system to be structured in such a way that people have a constant incentive to use the resource more carefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">Paying for waste services at householder level also has an inbuilt motivational factor. We charge for these services at local level to encourage people to use the services sparingly. Individual householders have a number of choices over how they dispose of their waste. They can throw it out, which in effect means putting it out for collection, or they can sort through the waste and select some of it for recycling through bottle banks, green bins, etc. In the case of organic waste, they can compost it and use the compost in their gardens to help the growth of flowers or vegetables. From a national waste management point of view, we have an interest in what choices they make. The more they recycle and the more they compost the better. The less they put out for collection by the local authority the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">It is vital that we structure our system so as to encourage the use that we want. This comes down to a matter of how the collection services are charged. I will give an example of how this can work. In Fingal we have bins and we pay for a label to attach to them each week. We also have a green bin that is collected once a month free of charge. As Senator Kitt said, in several parts of the country waste collection has been privatised. In County Wicklow special bags are sold in local shops and the price of the bag includes the cost of collecting the refuse. The company collecting the rubbish only picks up its own bags and ignores anything else. This system has an inbuilt incentive to use it sparingly. Every time someone uses a bag, he or she pays for it. In Wicklow each bag costs €1.50 to €2, so the more rubbish someone puts out in these bags, the more he or she has to pay. More importantly, the less rubbish someone puts out, the less he or she pays.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">A resident of Wicklow explained to me that within a month of the system starting he found that his household had drastically cut down on the amount of rubbish it put out, almost without thinking about it. Up to then, he had sorted out stuff for recycling whenever he remembered to do it. Now he found he was religiously putting aside stuff for recycling all the time, because he had an incentive to do it. Similarly, he now had an incentive to maintain a compost heap in his garden and feed it with organic waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">A considerable number of my supermarket customers ask me why we put certain products in plastic packaging as they cannot get rid of it. Our main reason is so customers can see through to the plastic and changing would create a challenge for us. Customers never raised this before and have only started to do so in the past year when they became obliged to pay for the waste and they begrudge spending the money. This shows the system is working. In providing for local waste charges, we must do it in such a way as to give the householder the incentives to behave in this way. If we do not, we miss the most important point of having local charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">My objective is to support the Government in its determination to have these charges collected. However, I want to urge it to reconsider how the charges are structured and collected. While in certain parts of the country there is an annual charge, this does not work unless it is related to the amount of rubbish collected.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">There is inconsistency in dealing with the issue of the ability of householders to pay the charges. We all agree that people who do not have the means should get a waiver. However, apparently waivers only apply in some areas and not across the board. This is clearly iniquitous, and should be fixed immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">I am concerned about the notion of collecting these charges on a yearly basis. Doing so presents the householder with one big bill, which is much more difficult to cope with than many smaller bills at regular intervals. More importantly, it increases the distance between the action he or she takes and the need to pay for it. If something done now has to be paid for a year down the road, that is one thing. It is another and much stronger thing if what is done now has to be paid for this week. In my case I have to buy tags to put on bins each week.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">I am also concerned at the expense of collecting these charges. Most local authorities seem to be collecting the charges in exactly the same way as they used to collect residential rates, when they existed. Under such an arrangement the cost of collecting the charge will become a significant amount of the charge itself. Apart from the waste of resources, I can see it making the charge even less popular than it would otherwise be.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">It seems that collecting the tax through a charge on special bags, tags or labels that are sold through local shops is inherently a much more cost-effective way of raising the money as well as possibly being seen as less painful for those who have to pay for it. By focusing on the bags or tags that are used for collection, we should also allow for a system in which the local authority could eventually itself take responsibility for collecting goods for recycling. Some authorities, including Fingal, are already doing that with monthly green bin collections.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">We have often heard about how in Germany and the Netherlands people put out not one but several different coloured bins for collection, each one containing a different kind of rubbish, which is treated in a different kind of way. Repak has already taken the first steps in this area. We could introduce such a scheme here and make it work by differential pricing on the various bags that are used.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">The Government could make the system of refuse charges more acceptable to everyone if it did three things. The system of waivers for people who cannot pay, currently only available in some areas, must be available everywhere. The charges must be directly related to the amount of refuse the householder puts out for collection, which is not happening in all cases. It must be possible to pay the charge "as you go", rather than having to face a big bill at the end of the year. If the Government takes those actions, we will face up to the challenge and there will be greater acceptance among householders, who are having difficulty putting forward an alternative.</p>

        <speech by="#CyprianBrady" eId="spk_59">
          <from>Mr. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_144">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I wish the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, a speedy recovery. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important issue of waste management. Huge progress has been made in the evolution of waste policy and law. It is an ongoing process, which particularly in the past five to ten years has greatly improved the environment in which we live.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">When one remembers the dark smoggy days of the 1970s and 1980s and the ever-growing mountain of rubbish that littered our streets and countryside, we cannot but appreciate the advances that have been made. Senator Kitt mentioned that a visit to any school in the country will show how aware the children are of the environment and their role and responsibility to it. Programmes such as the green flag initiative have opened many young minds to the benefits of environmental awareness and concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">Over the years a number of measures have been introduced which in my view will pay significant dividends in the long run. In many cases these benefits are already plain to see, from plastic bags to the control of hazardous waste and from by-laws regarding shopping trolleys to the emphasis on the polluter pays principle. These measures have greatly benefited our environment. The key to sustainable waste management is the introduction of strong forward-looking legislation, which has been introduced since 1990. In 1992 the Environmental Protection Agency was established with particular responsibility for pollution control. It has also evolved into other areas, including the creation of a national database on waste management and the use of best available techniques in all areas of waste disposal. In 1994 the national recycling strategy underpinned the principle of producer responsibility. The previous speaker referred to the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 which has been discussed in great detail in this House. This Bill deals with pollution prevention, minimisation and recycling and underpins the principle of the polluter pays. It is also very practical and deals with issues such as the rubbish created by concerts and public events and the disposal of car windscreens, which are lethal waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">The role of the local authorities is crucial to the planning and management of all efforts to minimise production of waste and to encourage recovery and recycling. The 2003 Act underpins the role of local authorities and councillors by awarding them enhanced powers in all these areas. Since 1997 the emphasis for local authorities has been concentrated on a number of key areas. Today there is kerbside collection for segregation and recycling. Bring centre facilities are in place around the country where one can bring everything from a milk carton to a fridge freezer. Materials recovery facilities are also available.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">Thermal treatment and waste water treatment is being examined. Switzerland is one of the world's chief producers of toxic chemicals but it has the technology to deal with waste. The technology is available and I believe the thrust of present policy is correct. Everyone is in agreement that we have reached the point of diminishing returns as far as landfill is concerned and we need to consider an alternative. Thermal treatment is the only alternative. Other measures such as the environmental fund set up under the 2001 Act ensure that the proceeds of any levies are used specifically to benefit environmental initiatives, including education and management. The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, stated that €22 million was allocated this year. The National Development Plan 2001-2006 suggests a significant investment of €1.1 billion for the provision of infrastructure, based specifically on the local authorities' waste management plans. The public wants rigorous and independent control to be maintained on all activities that impact on the environment, including the collection of household waste. The vast majority of people accept that these services come at a cost but they also want to see value for money. There have been various initiatives such as encouraging people to compost their household waste and recycling whenever possible. I welcome the installation of segregated rubbish bins in Raheny village. This is a step forward which must be pursued. Repak has taken initiatives such as producer responsibility. Even business people can see the benefits of a responsible approach to waste management. There is an ongoing evaluation of the management of construction and demolition waste in the construction industry. The disposal of end-of-life vehicles is an issue for the motor industry. We have all seen abandoned and burned out cars in housing estates and in rural boglands.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">The Tidy Towns competition is usually associated with small rural towns but streets and small estates in Dublin have also become involved in the competition. The Forfás report of July 2003 states that significant progress has been made in delivering infrastructure and programmes for waste recovery and recycling. There is further work to be done. I commend the Minister and the policies and legislation he has introduced and encourage him to continue along those lines.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcCarthy" eId="spk_60">
          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_150">I welcome the Minister of State, Dr. McDaid, to the House and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, in his absence, for his attendance. I wish the Minister, Deputy Cullen, a speedy recovery. I can only hope he did not cause the injury to his back by falling off the back of a bin lorry.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">Waste management is a very significant issue in regard to which we have witnessed crisis in recent times. Most people do not realise the seriousness of this issue. As a society we have probably been collectively negligent in our attitude and have not done enough. In the recent past there was a lack of facilities, investment and awareness for which we should all accept responsibility. We have moved into a new era in line with European Union directives. The rate of progress on this issue at European level is a very good teaching block for countries such as Ireland. More than 90% of non-agricultural waste is dumped in landfill sites. While the number of dumps is declining, many more landfill sites have been closed each year and that is a welcome development. EU regulations will strictly limit the kind of waste which can be sent to landfill. A number of landfill sites in Cork have been closed in recent years and the remaining sites will only accept specific types of waste. Municipal waste is increasing by 11% per annum. The proportion of waste being recycled has been in decline in recent years but it is hoped there will be an upsurge. I can say without fear of contradiction that in almost every county, controversy is created when strategies are adopted to deal with the future of waste management. The reasons for the controversy often might not stand up to scrutiny but we must deal with the situation as it is. If change frightens a few people, then so be it. Difficult decisions must be made. In recent years there has been a recognition of the problems due to the lack of a decent waste management strategy. The dissipation of natural resources, the risks to human health, the avoidance of our responsibility to the environment and to future generations, the breaches of our obligations under European law and the limits on our future economic growth are seriously impinged upon by past actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">Waste treatment and disposal in Ireland relies fundamentally on landfill, the least favoured method of waste disposal. As a society we produce too much waste, the vast bulk of which is spread or deposited on land. This is not desirable in any context. We have the highest dependency on landfill in the EU. In 1998 some 91% of our domestic waste went to landfill, which spells out the seriousness of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Most official strategy and policy on waste emphasises minimisation, recycling, recovery and reuse. Everybody wants to reduce the amount of rubbish they dispose of, but, unfortunately, some local authorities have not introduced an adequate system of recycling outlets. This presents its own difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">A most successful pay by weight system was introduced in Cork at the beginning of this year. It created huge controversy at the time and, although I agreed with the principle of the approach, I was opposed to the high level of costs associated with it. Pay by weight gives people an incentive to reduce the amount of waste they produce and to use recycling outlets. Such facilities, however, are not available at the level at which they are needed to recycle to the greatest possible extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">The standing charge for waste collection in Cork County Council in 2002 was €160, which was not sustainable in the long term. At that time some businesses in small towns filled refuse trucks by themselves, yet they were not paying any more than those who produced less waste. The pay by weight system prohibits the inclusion of certain waste items. A number of recycling units were introduced. The standing charge was increased to €190 and further payment is based on the weight of waste for disposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">In a town in my constituency last week I noticed 15 bins put out on a street of some 60 houses. This goes to show that people are being proactive about the waste disposal process. They accept the polluter pays principle. People are being encouraged and incentivised to look at alternative measures to the old system of waste disposal, be it recycling, reducing or reusing. This is a welcome development in a town which had two or three bags of rubbish outside each house a few years ago. It demonstrates the distance we have travelled in a relatively short time.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">The strategy for investment in waste infrastructure should be aimed at supporting official policy. Investment needs to be redirected towards the three Rs – recovery, reusing and recycling – to promote the minimisation of the amount of waste requiring treatment or disposal. Two basic requirements are necessary to maintain any degree of success in recycling, the provision of a nationwide collection and separation infrastructure and the development of markets for recycled materials.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">The second requirement, establishing and maintaining markets for recycled materials, will necessitate not only direct investment but also market development through investment incentives, development grants and Government procurement policies that will provide initial demand for recycled goods. If the project is not looked at in its entirety, in terms of the markets that should exist for recycled goods, that will be an obvious impediment to any strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">The race against waste is a welcome initiative. While it is something we need, I remain to be convinced about the advertisements running on national television. I expect that they cost a great deal of money. While I accept that the spirit behind them is positive, I do not think they will have the desired effect. Having 30 or 40 mechanical rats running off the windscreen of a car does not—</p>

          <p eId="para_161">—serve this cause to the extent that it should and a great deal of money has been expended to bring about the desired effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">We need to have a proper recycling system in place if we are serious about asking people to recycle their goods. There is no point having a strategy or initiative that encourages this if we do not have the facilities there to ensure the end product is delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">As Senator Brady pointed out, we debated the Protection of the Environment Bill earlier this year. Many people had difficulty with this contentious Bill. I had strong reservations and spoke to that effect during the debates on it. This legislation will be remembered for one thing only, the fact that it gave county and city managers the power to set the refuse charge and leave waste uncollected in cases where bills were not paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">Real local government is about the ability and power to make decisions at local level. This Bill was retrograde in the sense that it took power away from local councillors. Local government was devoid of enough powers without the Minister taking away further powers. In many instances this has led to refuse charges reaching more than €600 which is a huge extra household bill that would not have come about if the decision to levy that charge had remained with members of local authorities. While a waiver system exists, by and large, it is for those on the margins. We have to consider people on low incomes who may be unable to pay a bill of such magnitude. This legislation was a project in avoiding the political resistance that would have come about if such levies were imposed by elected councillors. It was a contentious issue in most councils and Cork was no different in that regard. When the country was awash with money it was not too much of a difficulty but given the weaker financial situation now it would be much more difficult to implement. The role of elected county council members was eroded by that legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">In regard to bin charges, I respect everybody's right to protest on any matter but I do not agree with people deliberately defying court orders. The reason some people found themselves in prison was because they defied a court order which is not the same thing as protesting against an issue. Such people deliberately engaged in actions contrary to the explicit instruction of a judge. I do not believe there is a broad basis of support for the anti-bin charge campaign. We pay a great deal of money for bin charges in Cork, yet there is no professional type of protesting taking place. It is confined to a select number of people and to one particular area. There are attempts to get a similar campaign going in Cork city but I do not believe it will be successful. These people should pay their charges just the same as the rest of us. While people are entitled to their opinions on the amount of charge they pay, they are not entitled to defy court orders or organise professional protests with the result that some people end up in jail. I do not agree with such behaviour – I never have and I never will.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">We should be cognisant of the level of breaches of European directives. As recently as August, the European Commission announced that it would take Ireland to the European Court of Justice for continued breaches of the EU groundwater directive. This is one of a number of cases – I understand there are eight in total – which are being taken. We must be responsible and serious. We must abide by EU directives in the same way as other member states. The €20 planning charge is another issue in respect of which we are being brought before the European Court of Justice. Other directives include those on dangerous substances, nitrates and the protection of shellfish. These are issues we must examine in a European context. We must be seen on the international stage as a country providing leadership on waste management, which is serious about doing something and which can abide by European law.</p>

          <p eId="para_169">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and his Department have played a major role in setting in motion a number of steps to deal with the waste management problem, which we have ignored for too long. As a nation, we simply do not seem to care what we do with our waste as long as it is not disposed of on our own doorstep. When one speaks to the person in the street, one will invariably be told what should not be done but rarely is a solution to the problem offered. My message today is that this problem concerns us all. Each citizen in this country must face the fact that waste management begins with him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">If we want to reverse some of the waste problems we currently face, we must hammer home the message that each individual has a responsibility when it comes to waste management. Everybody must help local authorities to tackle this issue. The current hierarchy of waste management is prevention, minimisation, reuse and recycling, energy recovery and, lastly, environmentally sustainable disposal of waste that cannot be prevented or recovered. That is the policy of the Department, which should be congratulated for its approach. However, it will be very difficult to ingrain this policy in the culture of the average Irish citizen. We have become too reliant on dumps and landfill but any attempt by the Government to bring about change is met with resistance at every opportunity. Unless we all accept responsibility for this problem, it will not be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">A case in point is the attitude towards incinerators. If we are to deal with the waste issue, we cannot continue to use landfills where waste is out of sight and out of mind. We must eradicate waste properly and, in some cases, the only option will be to use an incinerator. Despite this, whenever and wherever local authorities attempt to develop such a waste management option, they are met with fierce local resistance. Inevitably, development is held up for years. The country simply cannot afford to maintain this approach. The incinerators being developed these days, which are the incinerators which would be introduced here, are top of the range. They produce very little pollution and pose a far smaller environmental risk than any landfill site. Incineration is much less of a threat to health and less likely to contaminate the water supply or attract rodents and other disease carrying animals to a particular area. Despite these facts, we seem intent on putting as many roadblocks as possible in the way of developing a successful incineration scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">Of course, incineration is not the only option. We should only turn to it when all other avenues have been explored. That we should look first at preventing as much waste as possible is the principle at the top of the Department's waste management agenda. This is a difficult policy to develop as it requires a change in our thinking. We must educate people to ensure that when they go to the shops they consider packaging and its disposal when purchasing a product. As it stands, that rarely if ever crosses the mind of the Irish consumer. Until we can introduce this philosophy into the minds of citizens, we will continue to produce far too much waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">As well as prevention, more must be done to recycle our waste. Again, this comes down to education. Until people realise it is their responsibility to recycle, we will continue to see plastic bottles, aluminium cans and tonnes of paper needlessly disposed of as general household waste. Despite the great leaps forward taken in developing our recycling policy, we are still not recycling enough. Perhaps the best way to change the mindset is to offer a deposit on cans and bottles and other generally recycled materials. In a number of European countries, a deposit on glass bottles is still offered. Even if it were minimal, Irish people would be far more likely to recycle their waste if there were some monetary return for doing so. In some ways such a policy would be an extension of the polluter pays principle. By introducing it, we would be rewarding those who do not pollute but instead recycle. It would only add to the success of the polluter pays principle, which has already done much to influence Irish attitudes to waste. Despite some recent difficulties here in the capital, this policy has had a great effect in dealing with the waste issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">By placing the burden for dealing with waste on those who produce it, we have already begun to see changes in the levels of waste production. Generally, people accept the principle and have welcomed it, which is why we have seen positive effects in most parts of the country. Perhaps a further extension of the principle would be for local authorities to introduce authorised bin liners. These would be sold at a premium rate rather than imposing bin charges. The more waste a household produced, the more bin liners would have to be purchased and the more money would have to be paid to the local authority. The effect would be to make people more conscious of the waste they were producing thereby helping to prevent waste and to promote its reuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">I reiterate my congratulations to the Minister and his Department on the policies they have introduced. I urge them to introduce incinerators where they are needed and to continue to adopt policies which are in the best interests of the country despite their unpopularity. While people may oppose them now, our children will benefit.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_178">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, to the House this morning and extend my good wishes to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. The Minister is to be thanked most sincerely for the tremendous work he has carried out in the waste management area over the last number of years. I welcome also the statement on waste management made by the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, this morning. It is most important to do this given that the mid-term review of the national development plan is taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">Much has been achieved under the waste management plans adopted by local authority members and amended by city and county managers under the legislation introduced by the current Minister. However, much time has been lost in the implementation of these plans. Great strides have been made in recycling and waste minimisation by local authorities and refuse services have been provided and extended in most areas. The cost of waste collection is, however, causing some concern. While I support fully waste collection charges, they must be monitored. The pay-by-weight policy referred to by other speakers would be welcomed if introduced. Mention was also made of old age pensioners and the waste waiver system. It would useful if the Minister for Finance were to examine that in the context of the free electricity and telephone schemes whereby old age pensioners living alone are provided with some assistance. When bring banks are being used by people, a small token of appreciation to old age pensioners would cost little. As with the €22 million in grants paid to local authorities by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, perhaps a system could be devised whereby a payment could be made at national level and recouped from local authorities on a <i>pro rata</i> basis by old age pensioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">Public private partnerships provide a means to obtain value for money under the national development plan in the provision of extra facilities. A previous speaker mentioned thermal treatment which is under examination. Proposals in this regard are included in the six national level plans. It has been suggested recently at Government level that the country should be divided into two areas if thermal treatment facilities are provided. That proposal should be considered as it would permit the use of finances in other areas of waste minimisation under the national development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">I acknowledge the tremendous strides which have been made. Tidy Towns competitions and school schemes have been mentioned. The environment has never been in better condition and much of that is due to schools and the volunteers involved in Tidy Towns who have taken a great interest in waste minimisation. Many of the bring banks which have been so successful over the last year are being monitored by schools and local voluntary bodies. That is to be welcomed. I agree with previous speakers that by working together, we will implement the waste management plan. There is goodwill towards this and I encourage the Minister of State and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to go full steam ahead in implementing this plan.</p>

        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_68">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_182">I wish the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, a speedy recovery and return to active ministerial duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">In recent years, people have changed their ways and become more conscious of the necessity to stop putting all our waste in bins and dumping it. Thankfully, the European Commission has recognised that we have changed our ways. However, the delivery of that change has been brought about by individuals alone. The momentum within the Government to deliver that change has been lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The Minister of State told us that €22 million of Government funding has been allocated to encouraging minimisation and recycling. However, when that is shared out among all the local authorities, and considering our population, it is a small input relative to the charges which are being imposed by local authorities and private waste management facilities. Therefore, we cannot clap ourselves on the back for providing just €22 million for such a massive project because, when it is put in perspective, it is a feeble Government input.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">Much of the slow progress on this issue and the failure of local authorities to respond when we began to change our ways is due of a total lack of consultation. The straw that broke the camel's back was the Minister's decision to transfer the function of producing waste management plans from local authority members to city and county managers. These city and county managers are now politically paralysed from taking action to nominate areas for landfill sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">For example, in Galway East, three sites were identified and have been investigated for the past three years by consultants hired by the local authority to find such suitable places. Discussions at local authority level revealed that many members from all parties had the courage to publicly identify other suitable sites. However, these were rejected because it would not be in keeping with the legislation since consultants had been appointed and if sites other than those identified by the consultants were deemed to be suitable, someone would lose out. While the attitude exists whereby reasonable consultation is stifled at that level, we will always have problems progressing waste management solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">I acknowledge that there is opposition to landfill. For example, in the past 12 months, a private company acquired land and applied for and was granted planning permission by the county council. This permission is being appealed to An Bord Pleanála and we await a final decision. However, there are places in some counties in which we could integrate proper landfill sites if the ordinary process of consultation was allowed to take place. Delays will be caused if the Government takes the attitude of blaming local authority members and taking power from them on the basis that they will pussy-foot around the issue or they will not do anything because they are afraid of the local elections. Who is delaying the use of the three sites in County Galway? Will someone decide, sooner rather than later, that they are suitable or not and make a decision in regard to the alternatives?</p>
          <p eId="para_188">A number of Senators mentioned the input of schools and Tidy Towns groups. We must encourage young people to improve their commitment towards the environment and waste management because we will not change the attitudes of many older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">Industry in Ireland also produces a great deal of waste, about which many companies are doing nothing. Companies must not be allowed to continue to pursue the modes in which they have disposed of their waste. We must target industry as being responsible for a sizeable proportion of waste because few companies have made reasonable efforts to deal with the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">Will the Minister of State bring to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government the fact that Lough Cutra, which is the water supply source for Gort, has been extensively polluted? The Minister must take immediate action because no one has yet asked the Department, whose responsibility this matter is in conjunction with the local authority, to ensure that safety concerns are addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">The Tynagh mines site in County Galway is also heavily polluted and no one has taken responsibility for it. A recent EPA report indicated high levels of contamination at the site and the risks of contamination of water and drainage from the area as well as the pollution of adjoining lands. No one has taken responsibility because the company which operated the mine began its operations in pre-planning days. The company got what it wanted out of the mine and abandoned it. We now have a sore on the landscape for which no one will take responsibility. It is incredible that this situation, along with others, is allowed in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The Department of Agriculture and Food retains in storage approximately 700 BSE infected animals of which it is unable to dispose. The Department is seeking tenders from contractors to take the animals out of the country but no one wants them. Could there be some type of intergovernmental consultation to devise a way to dispose safely of these animals? We cannot just export them and push our waste elsewhere. If two Departments cannot get together to make a decision on the issue, the problem of waste management will never be resolved.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnnOrmonde" eId="spk_69">
          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_193">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and I am sorry to hear that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, is indisposed at the moment. I wish him a speedy recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">The issue of waste management is ongoing for as long as I am in the Seanad. All I can do is rehash many of the speeches I have already made. The matter involves collective responsibility on the part of the Government, local authorities, the private sector which deals with waste services and the wider public. The core question is where do we proceed from here? Bringing forward a proper waste management structure acceptable to everyone is a very challenging issue on which there is ongoing debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">An integrated approach which will look at recycling or re-use – some people do not like the word "recycling"– and how best to minimise or compost waste must be adopted. The crux of the matter is what to do with unavoidable waste. How can we change our ways? Recycling is taking root, albeit at a slow pace. It is now at 13% when it should be much more. It has increased from 9% in 1998 to 13% currently. However, we are a long way off the target to which the Minister referred. There must be a policy on how best to educate the public on waste management. While there are bottle banks and civil amenity services, the public is not with us for whatever reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">There was a big whinge last year that the power was being taken away from local authorities. Power will not be taken away from local authorities if local councillors take the lead and are prepared to educate themselves and try to bring about an awareness campaign on what is involved, what is recycling, how to reduce our waste and how to get rid of unavoidable waste. There must be consultation with educationalists, including teachers, parents and school children. I want to relate an anecdote from speaking to school teachers in my area. I asked if they could hold their civics class just before lunch time at approximately 12.15 p.m., so that they could talk to their pupils about recycling, waste packaging, dumping of litter on the ground and how best to reduce waste. The teachers did so, the children left the schools at 12.30 p.m., went down to the local shops and the place was littered 15 minutes afterwards, even though they were given a full lesson on how to recycle and reduce waste. Something is not right because there appears to be no link between what children are learning in school and what is happening in the real world. This issue needs to be looked at again in our awareness and educational campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">I do not like the idea of dumps or landfills of any kind. I would prefer other options, including a more regional approach. I loathe the word "incinerator". Is there any way we can drop it? "Incinerator" means awful things to me – it brings me back to the Holocaust. The word should be dropped and we should use some other way of describing thermal treatment. These concerns are justified because there is a rumour going around that the technology is inadequate to deal with unavoidable waste. As this anxiety still exists, people must be assured that whatever modern technology is put in place will work. If the public was reassured on this issue and the word "incinerator" was dropped, we might get somewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">Proper planning must be introduced to protect the public. An environmental assessment must be carried out. There will have to be a licence which is rigorously applied and whose application is monitored. We must ensure that emissions are at a low level. If we can reassure the public, we will win the argument on landfill versus thermal treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">It is important to take on the anti-bin charge protesters. I have spoken at length about this issue. In my area one side of the road comes under South Dublin County Council, another side comes under Dublin City Council and further up the road comes under Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. Each of the three councils has a separate flat rate for waste charges. I welcome the polluter pays principle. This would get rid of the flat rate and everyone would learn how to recycle and reduce their waste. This would be acceptable to people and would get rid of the anti-charge protests that are taking place because, to be honest, we pay for everything. We pay for our electricity, telephone and I see nothing wrong with paying to have my refuse removed. However, l want to be educated on how to minimise my waste. If we drop the word "incinerator", we will be able to put in place a coherent policy and structure, which I would welcome.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_70">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_200">Waste management presents one of the greatest environmental challenges to this country. I wish the Minister well because he certainly faces a very tough challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Fast-track planning procedures need to be put in place quickly because we have a waste management crisis. As a result of the Celtic tiger and other opportunities, waste generation increased by 89% between 1995 and 1998. The recent discovery of illegal dumping in Wicklow and Fingal – I am sure it is happening in many other areas – indicates a need to minimise our waste and a need for recycling, which must be regulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">The pharmaceutical sector which has been the backbone of our recent boom has doubled production during the past five years. It was responsible for a major proportion of hazardous waste, although much of it had been committed to environmental management. In rural Ireland the major landfill sites or super dumps are unpalatable. While it appears they are the way of the future, no community wants a super dump on its doorstep, or in its back yard. Many of these communities are fearful of such dumps and ask why it should be located in their particular area. If a landfill site is being imposed on a community, swimming pools, community centres or financial inducements should be provided to compensate for the lack of property development. A super dump in any area will reduce the cost of property in that area. The impact of a super dump can be reduced if it is properly provided for, well managed and maintained. No matter what one does, a super dump is not acceptable in one's area. We all want it in someone else's area.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">Senator Ormonde raised the issue of thermal treatment, which is more acceptable than incineration. It is an emotive subject. When starting out on my political career three years ago, I attended a public meeting where I got what I considered to be good advice from an environmental scientist in charge of environmental science in one of the IT colleges. He put it to me that nobody wants incineration or thermal treatment, but every household chimney burns rubbish at a certain temperature which produces dioxins. He asked what we wanted. Did we want thermal treatment which was regulated and measured and would reduce the dioxins? It would burn at a certain temperature and at the end of year less dioxins would be produced than are being produced in every small incinerator. I put that to the public meeting and it was not well received. That is the position we are in and the question is how to inform and package. I do not have all the answers – I may have been wrong – but the issue of thermal treatment is emotive.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">Many councils have taken their councillors to see thermal treatment units in Europe. On first accounts, it appears progressive. However, we are not experts. Unfortunately, as elected representatives, we do not know all the answers. It is difficult for county councillors to vote on an issue that sometimes is technically challenging. The jury is out but many serious decisions are made by councils.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">An issue about which I am concerned is litter and enforcement of anti-litter measures. When I attended school many years ago we were always told not to drop litter. I do not drop litter and most Members do not drop litter, but somebody is doing it. If I hear of a further education campaign around the schools I will get sick. Enforcement of anti-litter measures is what is required. The more litter wardens that are appointed and impose fines on those who drop litter, the sooner we will get rid of the scourge of litter. As a councillor I fought for and succeeded in getting a second litter warden in my electoral area. It is noticeable that the amount of litter has decreased. In Ireland we need an incentive and if a person has to be fined over €100 for dropping litter, that is what is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">In Roscommon County Council we had an anomaly which I raised in the House where the council was removing a bend on a road. It was asked to put the material into a site 300 yards down the road but that could not be done. Instead it had to be transported over 17 miles to the nearest dump. That is not waste management. It involved the transport of that material to a dump and it was filling up the landfill which is a scarce commodity. I wish the Minister well. Waste management is a challenge that faces all of us.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatMoylan" eId="spk_71">
          <from>Mr. Moylan</from>
          <p eId="para_207">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House and wish the Minister, Deputy Cullen, well.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">The statements today on waste management are important. I have listened to the many excellent contributions made. During the summer I was disturbed to read an article on waste which stated that County Offaly produced the second highest amount of rubbish in the country. This makes one ask what we are doing and why are we worse than others. The Environmental Protection Agency's national waste database report makes for disturbing reading. Government strategy is to make tough decisions for more recycling and less waste. Ireland is in the midst of a grave waste problem. The challenge of solving the waste problem is not easy and we do not have the luxury of time. Tough decisions have to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Waste has become a defining characteristic of our modern consumer society. The generation of waste in Ireland continues to increase, reflecting economic growth, improved manufacturing and industrial performance, increased population and changing consumption patterns. In excess of 2.2 million tonnes of municipal waste was generated in 2000, an increase of approximately 20% in two years. The average Irish individual generates approximately 580 kg of municipal waste per annum, far in excess of our EU neighbours. We are poorly equipped to deal effectively with this waste stream. We have a limited recycling infrastructure, almost no biological treatment capability and no means of recovering energy from waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Although the amount of waste recycled has increased in recent years, we recycled only 12% of waste in 2000. Given that Holland recycles 45% and Germany recycles 42%, Ireland has a long way to go. The remaining 88% of our waste was landfill, often in small, inadequate facilities. We do not know exactly what is happening underground in many of our landfill sites. This situation cannot continue and the modernisation of waste management is now a key priority. In my county, Offaly, only 10% of the population currently recycle waste compared to the European average of 80%. The two main excuses for not recycling are that people have neither the time nor the space to recycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Effective waste management is one of the most complex and problematic environmental challenges facing us. There is no magic wand or soft option. Delivery of waste services and infrastructure are, in many respects, inherently more complex than the delivery of other environmental services. Waste streams are very diverse and their management requires consideration of a wide range of environmental, economic and market-related issues. At the same time, waste treatment options are controversial, and there is strong public opposition to proposals for any significant waste infrastructure. As recent cases illustrate, even proposals for relatively small bottle banks and recycling centres attract criticism.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Sound waste management presents significant environmental and lifestyle challenges, which must be confronted. Strenuous efforts must be made and innovative approaches implemented if we are to halt and in time, reverse, the link between waste generation and economic growth. Our objective must be to give practical effect, by means of fiscal and other measures, to the internationally recognised waste hierarchy, which prioritises waste prevention and minimisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">For waste that cannot be avoided, we need to develop an integrated management infrastructure that utilises a range of available treatment technologies to underpin better service provision, not just by local authorities but by an emerging private waste industry. There is already a sound policy foundation on which to build. Changing our Ways, 1998, set the basis for a strategic regional planning process, emphasising the need for a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill in favour of a range of preferable waste treatment options. This policy approach was further developed in Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change, 2002, which provides for a package of new initiatives, funding and revised organisational structures to deliver accelerated change.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Contrary to opinion, real progress has been achieved over recent years. Segregated collection of household waste has been introduced in certain counties. We now have approximately 1,300 bring banks, compared to 400 or 500 in the mid-1990s. That is welcome. Most areas of the country are serviced by recycling centres. Last year, we recycled more than 200,000 tonnes of packaging waste and reached our national target of 25% recycling, as laid down in the European packaging waste directive. The plastic bag levy has had a dramatic effect on our shopping habits and has reduced our use of plastic bags by up to 90%.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Our mindset is changing. The challenge now is to make further, rapid improvements. The cornerstones for any future improvement are the regional waste management plans. These, in line with Government policy and reflecting best international practice, have now been adopted across the country. The plans are designed to tackle the waste problem comprehensively. They include segregation at source and separate collection of recyclable and organic materials in all significant urban areas; extended networks of bring bank facilities for recyclable materials, especially in rural areas; recycling centres and waste transfer stations; biological treatment of green and organic household waste; materials recovery facilities for dry recyclables; thermal treatment facilities and residual landfill requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">These regional plans anticipate the recycling or composting of between 40% and 50% of waste, thermal treatment of up to 40%, and landfill for the balance of wastes. We need to drive forward the implementation of these plans intensively across the country. All players must pull in the same direction and with the same degree of focus and urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">It is one thing to aspire to eliminate the disposal of waste over a period of one or two decades. However, it is quite another to seek to impose a moratorium on the development of thermal treatment or landfill capacity while we pursue such aspirations. We must be practical and make our decisions based on reality and experience, not aspiration. We cannot prevent and recycle all waste. There will always be residual waste, which must either be thermally treated or landfilled. We must face and address that problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Regional waste management plans are not just about incineration. They are about better services for the regions, delivering higher recycling performance, recovering energy from waste which cannot be recycled, and about using landfill as the last resort for residual wastes which cannot otherwise be recovered. Thermal treatment of waste, whether by incineration or other technologies, is only one component of this integrated infrastructure. Any new thermal treatment facilities will be subject to a full environmental impact assessment, planning controls and a rigorous environmental licensing system operated by the Environmental Protection Agency which we respect and trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">We are coming from behind on the issue of waste management. We have much to do to catch up with our European neighbours. However, building on the work already undertaken, I am confident that, within the next five years, we can together effect a step change for the better in our management of waste.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">A few points may have been missed concerning farm and plastic waste. We must highlight that the facility exists for recycling this waste. The plastic from wrapped silage bales has the country polluted. We did a great job in getting rid of the plastic bags and must now do the same for plastic waste from farms. It is a serious problem. There is an onus on farmers to recycle and they must take the opportunity to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">I wish to make a final point about a public meeting held in my area on incineration. A person spoke from the floor and said that the incinerator was being introduced into this country by the Government simply as a backdoor for the introduction of abortion for disposal of babies. That type of scaremongering at public meetings does nothing for the great work being done by the people and the Department on waste control.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_75">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_224">I will be finished by then. I welcome this timely debate on waste management during which there have been a number of good contributions. I would like to take up some issues mentioned by speakers on the Government side. The principle which appears to guide waste management strategy throughout the country is that the polluter pays. This is laudable and people on all sides should have no problem with the idea that polluters should pay for the waste they produce. I have grave concerns about the protest which took place in Dublin in the past few months concerning refuse collection. It is very necessary that the polluter pays. However, some of the responsibility must also rest with those who produce the packaging. I do not believe they take enough responsibility at present. To put virtually all of the responsibility on the consumer is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">We are all familiar with the situation where one can enter a supermarket or shop and buy a product wrapped in three or four different wrappings and which comes in a bag. Such products used to come in a temporary plastic bag, but now come in a more permanent form of plastic container. There are problems with businesses which produce a lot of waste, an issue which does not seem to get enough coverage.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Senator Ormonde spoke earlier about the difficulties that different local authorities face regarding differing charges. It is especially evident in the different local authority areas in Dublin where different local authorities in close proximity charge vastly different amounts of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">In south Kilkenny, where I come from, we charge almost €450 per year for a wheelie bin to dispose of waste. It is a very large sum and is especially high in the context of the bin collection protests in Dublin in the past few months which have concerned considerably smaller amounts of money. It is very unfair that for years in rural areas we have had to pay for waste collection, while in Dublin people have not had to pay. Now we have a situation where a great deal, if not all, of the waste produced in Dublin city and county is accommodated outside the bounds of County Dublin. It is completely ridiculous to expect rural people to take the waste and also to pay to have waste collected on their own doorsteps while people in Dublin expect not to pay refuse collection charges. It is a complete contradiction in terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">I agree with Senator Ormonde that there are difficulties for local authorities. I live near Waterford city which has a considerably lower level of charge for refuse collection, presenting difficulties for residents who live on the borders of such counties. All local authorities should have a general ballpark figure for refuse collection.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Incineration has been discussed in the debate and the whole argument of incineration versus landfill has been raised. I have not heard anyone who has spoken in favour of incineration admit that even if we build thermal treatment plants, we will still be obliged to have landfill sites to accommodate what comes out of such plants at the end of the process. The idea that we will suddenly get rid of dumps around the country by building a big furnace, whether it is called an incinerator or anything else, is completely wrong. People who expound that view should be corrected. Landfill sites are going to continue, irrespective of whether they contain the vast bulk of waste or the residue from thermal treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">The only difference is that in future landfills will have to be of a much higher standard. There will be much more intensive landfill. The waste that comes from incinerators, or thermal treatment plants, will be of a much more potentially hazardous variety and the landfills will be much more dangerous than those which we have at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">There is one matter which I do not believe anyone has raised so far, namely, the idea of the regional authorities producing their own waste management plans, which are well advanced at this stage and which have been adopted just about everywhere. Looking to the future, it is ludicrous that each of the eight or nine regions in the country would have separate waste management plans and separate treatments for waste within their area.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">We have to place great emphasis on the need for recycling and re-use. I have no expertise in engineering or in the general area, but my biggest concern about incineration is that it removes the necessity for people to recycle. If one builds an incinerator, one has to have a certain stream of rubbish to keep it going. Incinerators will be built by private companies which will want to make a profit, as is their right. In order for that profit to be made, they will have to have to have a continuous supply of waste and that removes the incentive for people to recycle, re-use and cut down on waste. Nobody who supports incineration has explained this to me. It is a very serious problem that needs to be explained.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_76">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_233">I thank the Senators who contributed to this debate. The debate has been both important and interesting and gives an opportunity for people to focus on what is a very important and major national environmental problem facing us.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">We should remind ourselves of the different ways in which an effective waste management regime is important. The more obvious dimension relates to environmental protection. We can all readily see how crucially important it is from the perspective of preventing environmental pollution that we have systems, structures and processes in place to ensure our waste is managed to the highest environmental standards. We need policies and systems that focus on preventing waste arising in the first place. Where it does arise – a certain degree of it will always arise – we must ensure we do everything we can to minimise it. We need systems which ensure facilities for the recovery and disposal of waste are effectively regulated and that those involved in the collection and transport of waste are permitted and regulated. Equally, we need across the board systems which ensure there is an effective and timely enforcement regime in place in order to deal with those who try to operate outside the regulatory regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">This, in turn, brings into play our economic progress. Having a high quality environment and effective regime for controlling environmental pollution are a hugely important selling point for Ireland. In a world of growing and deepening competition, they can provide us with a very valuable competitive advantage. This is readily recognised by external investors who would be considering new industrial developments here. Increasingly, people who are proposing coming to the country want to know about that. They often ask whether we have a modern waste management system in place to meet the requirements of their industrial project.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Outside the House, particularly in places around Dublin, one would think there was huge disagreement on this issue. However, obviously there is much agreement, here in the Seanad anyway, on the fundamental issues surrounding waste management. That is important because it allows us to focus on the scale of the problem that we face and, more importantly, on the need to respond in a comprehensive way to that challenge. If one listens to the various comments made on this issue, there is no doubt that people seem to recognise the tradition we had of burying all of our waste in the ground is not a sustainable long-term solution. If we accept that, we have to look at alternatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">It is accepted both here and internationally that there needs to be a greater focus on preventing and minimising waste. This task is one which the soon to be established core prevention team in the EPA will be undertaking. It is accepted that we need to improve radically our performance in the whole area of waste recovery with supporting improvements in the infrastructure available. Likewise, it is accepted that we need better information, education and understanding of the sometimes complex issues surrounding waste management.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The Government accepts all of these fundamentals and supports giving them practical effect in a very substantive way. Residual waste simply has to be dealt with and we cannot just walk away from that. Taking the elements of an integrated approach, to engage in cherry-picking is simply fooling ourselves and constitutes a bit of a cop-out. There is no point fooling ourselves that we can do something in the short term because we cannot afford that type of approach. We cannot wait until we have pushed our recycling levels to the limit and then start to make decisions about how we deal with the remainder of our waste. If we favour an integrated approach, we have to face the reality of that and not cherrypick. Some of the individual comments referred to prevention and reduction of waste and the use of sustainable resources. In my opening statement I set out what is being done and I indicated that there are areas which are also the subject of much discussion at EU level. The Minister has identified initiatives in these areas to be advanced as a priority during the Irish Presidency in the first half of next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The revised EU directives on packaging will pose a major challenge but we should not lose sight of the fact that significant progress has been made and to date we have achieved the 25% recovery target set for 2002. That is working very well under the industry-based recycling regime operated by Repak, which Senator Quinn mentioned. It is on target to achieve the higher recycling target by the end of 2005. While we have the structures and the policies, we need better action on the ground but many things are happening too.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Senator Bannon accepted the need for residual landfill but said that we should follow best waste practices abroad and he added that he was kicking to touch on thermal treatment. We are following best international and best European practice in adopting the integrated waste management approach. We all use the phrases "best practice" and "best international approach", but we should also accept that approach and not run away from what it entails. There is no point cherrypicking and being afraid to embrace less attractive aspects of that approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I agree with those Senators who mentioned the importance of education on some of the newer waste infrastructure, particularly the thermal treatment projects. This is a key concern for the Race against Waste communications campaign which is being implemented in parallel with the advertising campaign. Senator Bannon mentioned the rat. I met someone recently who said that the rat cannot be seen before 9 p.m. Another person, who works with children, said that was a foolish decision, that it would be more effective and likely to succeed with younger people than with 50 year olds who are set in their ways. It is hard to knock us into shape. The advertisement may be somewhat shocking, and it is intended to be so, but I am sure that not all young viewers are in bed by 9 p.m. and it may have more effect on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Dioxins are often the focus of concern when we talk about thermal treatment plants. The Government does not use the term used by Senator Ormonde. It is important to realise that if within the next seven years we reached the stage of treating a million tonnes of waste thermally, the level and quantity of dioxins that such waste would release would be no more than about 2%. The levels from the burning of domestic waste could be over 30 times higher. It is important that we air these facts and the minute quantity of dioxins that might be released by certain projects. I was in a part of my constituency last Saturday afternoon, 20 hours after the Hallowe'en bonfires, and the air was thick with smoke. People complained that certain business people delivered truck loads of waste for which they should have been paying or getting a waste licence to put into the landfill. Instead, they were tipping it out for the children who thought that Christmas had come early. The quality of the air 20 hours afterwards was awful.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">People should focus on reality. We worry about the minute particles that might enter the air from thermal treatment plants, yet we tolerate behaviour like that which must do serious damage to people's health. I did not feel well while I was there and that was only for 20 minutes. I do not know what people living in the area had to endure the previous night but some of the elderly may have had to go to Beaumont hospital or the Mater hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">Senator Bannon raised the issue of supporting local authorities in implementing their plans. No matter what a Government does, the Opposition can say €22 million or €50 million is only buttons, yet these are major resources. The number of bring banks has increased greatly, from 800 to 1,450. There are several civic amenity sites and there is funding for more of these. A lot has been done and a lot more needs to be done. It is important that we continue and that we recognise what has been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Several Senators, including Senator Quinn, spoke about waiver charges and there is a message in that. In the Dublin local authorities when charges were being approved – I was on a local authority at the time – we took serious measures to ensure that there was a generous waiver scheme, particularly for pensioners. In Dublin and around the country where the local authorities withdrew from waste collection it was left to private operators to look after this area. People in the Dublin area who caused civil disobedience should realise what might happen if local authorities withdrew and it was left to the private operators because while it is with local authorities, if the councillors so choose, they can introduce liberal waiver schemes. If the local authorities opt out, certain people in the Dáil and on the streets who are campaigning should be aware that they will end up in a situation where the private contractor may not be so generous.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">It is Government policy that people pay by weight. It varies in Dublin, for example, in Fingal one pays with a tag, whereas in the city council area there is an annual charge. If there was a great system and a public acceptance of the need to pay, then paying with a coloured bag or by tag would be the way to do it. However, when there is no acceptance, the wheelie bin and the city council system of the two sizes of wheelie bin represents that principle to a degree, but in the future when there is wider acceptance that people must pay, Government policy is that they will pay by weight. I apologise for running over time and thank the Senators for their comments today.</p>

        <heading>National Development Plan Mid-Term Evaluation: Statements.</heading>
        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_79">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_248">I welcome the opportunity to address the House this afternoon on the mid-term evaluation of the national development plan published by the ESRI last week. Before commenting on the ESRI evaluation, I feel it would be useful to recall the objectives and content of the NDP.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">When the plan was launched in November 1999 there was almost universal support for its objectives and strategies. The exhaustive analytical and consultative process, which was conducted by the Government and preceded the preparation of the plan, revealed a strong consensus on the key sectoral issues to be tackled and on the measures necessary to deal with these.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">The NDP, as published, set out the following overriding objectives for investment: continuing sustainable national, economic and employment growth; consolidating and improving Ireland's international competitiveness; fostering balanced regional development; and promoting social inclusion. Consistent with these overall objectives, the plan provided for a most ambitious and unprecedented level of investment of almost €52 billion at 1999 prices across all sectoral areas pertaining to the economic and social development of the country. Key elements of the investment strategy were the continuation of stability-orientated macro-economic policies; a major investment programme in economic and social infrastructure; the promotion of education and employment training policies attuned to the needs of the labour market with a special focus on those most at risk of unemployment; and greatly accelerated investment programmes in key areas such as research and development and the provision of child care facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Of the €52 billion provided, nearly €46 billion was from domestic sources, mainly the Exchequer. This included a massive acceleration in Exchequer investment in economic and social infrastructure. The EU contribution of almost €6 billion represented just 12% of the total funding of the plan, compared to 40% for the 1994-99 plan. A target of €2.5 billion was included for the public private partnership contribution to the funding of the infrastructure programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">The plan was predicated on the continuation of stable macro-economic and budgetary policies. It was also based on the broadly positive outlook over the period then being forecast for the world economy as a whole. On budgetary policy, the NDP stated that the annual allocation and ultimately the overall commitment of the plan would have to be kept to a level that respected the public expenditure ceilings set by Government, take account of wider budgetary priorities and accord with the requirements of economic stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">As Senators are aware, there has been a significant international economic downturn since the plan was launched, which has inevitably impacted on Ireland's growth. Nonetheless, as I will outline shortly, the Government has continued to accord priority to the NDP infrastructure programme, notwithstanding a much more difficult budgetary situation. The plan comprises seven operational programmes covering the key areas of sectoral investment pertaining to economic and social development. Reflecting their importance in terms of competitiveness and employment growth, the bulk of the investment was planned to be channelled through the economic and social infrastructure programme – that is €26 billion altogether –  and the employment and human resource programme of €14.2 billion. The plan also contained, for the first time, two regional operational programmes mainly comprising locally based investment in the Border, midlands and west, BMW, and southern and eastern regions, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">I wish to focus in particular on the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme. This is pivotal in terms of addressing the country's infrastructure deficit. Accordingly, the plan provided for massively accelerated Exchequer capital investment in key areas including roads, public transport, environmental protection, housing, health and education. To put this acceleration in perspective, the average annual Exchequer provision for these areas over the first three years of the plan was over €3.9 billion, which represents an increase of 42% over the corresponding 1999 provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">This reflects an Exchequer financial commitment over the period considerably in excess of that planned. For the OP as a whole, the Exchequer delivered about £1 billion more than originally planned over the first three years of the plan. In other words, notwithstanding the economic downturn since 2000, the Government more than honoured its financial commitment to the NDP infrastructure programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">The result of this investment is visible on the ground throughout the country. There have been problems, articulated by the ESRI, which I will address but I strongly assert that by the end of 2006 the plan will have brought about a significant enhancement in our economic and social infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">The ESRI evaluation stems from the requirement under the EU Structural Funds regulations for a mid-term review of the performance of Structural Funds measures in each member state. In the case of Ireland, the Structural Funds comprise a small part of our national development plan. The Government, therefore, decided that the ESRI should evaluate the performance of the entire plan, not just the co-financed part.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Those who take time to read the evaluation will see that it is a broadly positive account of the performance to date of the plan. First, and crucially, the ESRI states that the overall strategy underlying the plan is as valid today as it was when it was first drawn up. On the overriding plan objectives which I outlined earlier, the ESRI states that the ". NDP has made significant progress towards its objectives of continuing sustainable national economic and employment growth and of consolidating and improving Ireland's economic competitiveness." Furthermore, the evaluation states that the NDP ". will have a sustainable positive effect on competitiveness and the productive capacity of the economy in the long term." As regards macro-economic impact, the evaluation states that "NDP expenditure over the period 2000-02 raised the level of GNP by over 7% above what it would have been in 2002." In the long run the level of GNP will be around 3% higher, representing a real rate of return on NDP investment of approximately 14% This is an exceptional economic performance by any standards, which proves that the NDP will leave a lasting legacy to the benefit of generations to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The evaluation is very positive about the impact of the plan on the other overarching NDP objectives of promoting social inclusion and more balanced regional development. It points out that investment in areas such as housing, child care, education and training has had a substantial effect in promoting social inclusion. The evaluation finds a mildly positive impact on the goal of better regional balance in economic development while urging better alignment between NDP investment and the national spatial strategy over the remainder of the plan. The ESRI evaluation gives a very positive endorsement of the impact of plan investment to date in terms of its macro-economic impact and achievement of key objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The evaluation expresses concern about the impact of inflation on output and, in certain instances, the quality of programme and project management. The institute lays stress on the need for proper project appraisal and evaluation before public funds are allocated to programmes and projects. It also highlights the need to appraise the value of proposed changes in the scope and specification of programmes and projects before proceeding with any such changes. Apart from stressing the need for an optimal appraisal and evaluation regime, the ESRl report also puts forward a number of specific recommendations across various areas. These recommendations include a more rigorous pricing regime for the provision of infrastructure, guidance on investment priorities and improvements in the physical planning process.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The evaluation also sets out the recommended allocations by operational programme over the rest of the plan. These allocations reflect the ESRI priority of investment in infrastructure, human resources and RTDI, with lower priority recommended to several other areas, including grants made to industry, agriculture and fisheries. The recommended allocations are firmly grounded on the foundation of maintaining a stable macro-economic and fiscal climate as set out in the Government's stability programme published earlier this year. The ESRI affirms the original parameter that plan investment going forward must remain subject to the prevailing budgetary climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The ESRI evaluation, while purely advisory, will be an input into ongoing Government consideration of investment priorities. The evaluation is undoubtedly a comprehensive analysis of investment under the NDP. As Senators will appreciate, Government consideration of investment priorities must take account of a number of factors, including value for money and economic impact of the investment. The ESRI report contains much useful guidance on the latter. It is clear that the strategy, priorities and key objectives of the plan remain fully valid. The ESRI's conclusion that the plan is impacting so positively on the attainment of these objectives is welcome, as is its conclusion that the plan remains as relevant today as when launched in November 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">There will be no recasting of the plan's strategy and priorities. While it is the Government's intention to continue to progress implementation of the plan, it will be prepared to adapt investment priorities over the period to 2006, if necessary, in the light of the evolving situation and available resources. The clear message from the ESRI evaluation is that the Government has got it right in terms of prioritisation of resources. The allocation of resources for investment is an important issue and the Minister for Finance is already on record as favouring a multi-annual regime for capital investment. The Minister wants to bring about a situation where Departments and agencies can have reasonable certainty on the availability of capital resources over a number of years. Such an approach would undoubtedly facilitate better programme and project management.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The Department of Finance is at present revising the capital appraisal guidelines for public investment projects, which will issue shortly. The objective is to ensure the use by Departments and agencies of the best appraisal and evaluation techniques and optimal efficiency in the execution of major capital projects. The ultimate objective must be to ensure as far as possible that only the most economically justifiable projects receive priority and that all projects are executed on time and within budget. While the Department of Finance will issue guidance, however, it cannot and will not manage individual projects for Departments and agencies. The onus must remain with the latter as regards programme and project management.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">I note the ESRI's recommendation that the Department of Finance should have some additional resources devoted to project and programme evaluation. Efforts in this area have been augmented in recent years through the expenditure review initiative and the extension of the remit of the CSF evaluation unit to cover all plan expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">While the Department will consider the ESRI's proposal, the focus must be on improving evaluation and project management techniques at implementing and sanctioning agency level. Beneficial changes have already been made, notably in the National Roads Authority. Public private partnerships also have a role to play in better project delivery. Momentum has now been built up on PPPs in the roads programme and the Minister for Finance is determined to extend this to other areas in a way that yields greater value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">I acknowledge that the Border, midlands and western region is behind the indicative target for infrastructural investment set out in the plan as published. This reflects the fact that the infrastructure gridlock and bottlenecks are most severe in the southern and eastern region, especially in the greater Dublin area, and that priority has had to be accorded to major projects in this region. It might, however, be noted that there have been positive economic developments in the BMW region. Over the period 2000-03, employment growth in the BMW region was 3.3% as compared to 1.8% in the southern and eastern region. In addition, percentage population growth in both regions between 1996 and 2002 was almost identical. Thanks to the successful negotiating strategy of the Government at the 1999 Berlin Summit, the BMW region has Objective One status for the period 2000-06, despite its GDP <i> per capita </i>in 2000 being well in excess of the threshold for such status.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">In its evaluation, the ESRI makes a number of recommendations which relate to different areas of ministerial responsibility. They are mostly matters for those Ministers, some of whom have commented on them. I will, however, briefly comment on aspects of the recommendations in the key area of transport. The evaluators question the level of specification for some of the key inter-urban routes and the appropriateness of toll-based private financing for some of these routes. There is some validity in the ESRI arguments as regards specification but it is my view that we should look at the investment on the major road routes in terms of the return over the long term. We must avoid regularly upgrading the same stretches of roads as traffic volumes increase. We have seen how toll-based private funding has delivered on the Dublin-Belfast road and what it will deliver via the Kilcock-Kinnegad project. There is potential to roll out much of the rest of the upgrade of the key routes between Dublin and the other gateway cities designated in the national spatial strategy in the same way.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">On public transport some of the evaluation findings merit reflection. The report states:</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The net impact to date of bus and rail investment in the Dublin area has been a substantial improvement in bus patronage, at modest cost, versus a disappointing passenger performance by rail, at substantial cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">It also states with regard to urban fixed-line projects that international experience shows:</p>
          <p eId="para_272">It is exceedingly rare for such projects to cost less than estimated by the project promoters. It is equally unusual for their schemes to deliver the passenger volumes promised.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">These findings must be borne in mind on future decision-making on urban public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The ESRI evaluation endorses the NDP strategy, stating that the plan is as relevant today as it was when launched. More importantly, it states that the plan is delivering on its objectives. We can and will do better in programme and project appraisal and evaluation. From the Government's viewpoint the evaluation gives us the reassurance and motivation to redouble our efforts on plan implementation so that when the final assessment is made after 2006, the same positive verdict will be given.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimHiggins" eId="spk_80">
          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_275">Last week's ESRI's halfway progress report on the NDP is a damning indictment of the management of the biggest investment programme in the history of the State. The ESRI judgment was clinical, crisp and critical. The clear message is that the thrust of the programme of the NDP is sound, but the Government is manifestly incapable of managing a €51 billion programme, designed to create a modern and efficient Ireland capable of meeting the economic and social demands of the 21st century. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, claims the programme is fundamentally sound and that was the ESRI's judgment. However, the plan, which is at its 50% juncture, is mismanaged, grossly over its expenditure targets and needs to be revamped to get it back on track immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Instead of accepting the ESRI's analysis, Ministers immediately set upon the report after its publication. First out of the traps was the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. His insulting dismissal of the report as absolute nonsense was followed by support for his view by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern. On the ESRI's call for the Government to leave investment in broadband to the private sector, he offered the equally insulting and derogatory observation that "To a certain extent, maybe they did not fully understand broadband".</p>
          <p eId="para_277">Next into the fray, responding to the ESRI's view that there was no justification for the creation of 3,000 new hospital beds while beds lie idle throughout the State, was the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin's spokeswoman, who doggedly asserted that the Government was committed to an already discredited health strategy and that 3,000 new beds would be provided, notwithstanding. The fourth Minister to do down the ESRI report was the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, who rejected the call for considering downgrading the standard of roads on lesser used routes which the NDP has earmarked as motorway standard. This barrage was followed by the slightly more conciliatory statement by the Taoiseach. He observed that "it is a good report" containing positives and negatives which should not be ignored and that the Cabinet "should be big enough to take some criticism".</p>
          <p eId="para_278">What has happened to collective Government responsibility? One is left with the distinct impression that instead of the Taoiseach, at long last, showing some leadership and decisiveness, the Government wants it both ways. It is not obliged to accept every iota of the ESRI report, but it should show some cohesion in its reaction to the plan. Equally, the Government should come forward with an official response, instead of the piecemeal and disjointed reactions we have had to date. Today in the Seanad, we have not had a coherent, comprehensive analysis by the Government of how it intends to respond to the ESRI recommendations. It is a large, good and analytical report. One would imagine, having studied the report for at least a week, the Government would have come forward with some comprehensive response rather than, as the Minister of State continually said in his speech, the recommendations being borne in mind. Bearing them in mind is not good enough. We want to know exactly what the Government is going to do with regard to the recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">As a politician from the west, in common with the Leas-Chathaoirleach, I am upset about the report's recommendations for the BMW region. This region was the key trump card in the Government's hand when we joined the EEC. It was the economic and social debilitation of the region that played a major part in Ireland qualifying for Objective One status in structural, cohesion and social funding from Brussels. Despite this, the vast bulk of EU spending went to Dublin and the east, with the paltry crumbs, by way of an occasional by-pass, sewerage or water scheme, coming west of the River Shannon and to the Border and midland regions. It was clear that facing into the last negotiations with Brussels, Ireland, collectively, would lose its Objective One status because the rest of the country had leapt far ahead and was on a par with the better-off areas of Europe. However, due to the outcry from the BMW region and the clear economic and social evidence from there, it was again awarded Objective One status. The legitimate expectation was that the region being the only one so categorised in the country would at last get the top-up of combined EU and Government investment that it obviously needs and merits. This was not so.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The Indecon report, Mid-Term Evaluation of the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme, was not referred to by the Minister of State. It was commissioned by the Government in order to fulfil requirements under the Structural Funds regulations. The report graphically illustrates how the BMW regions have again been left on the hind tit. Of the total investment of €10.6 billion on national roads, public transport, environmental service, sustainable energy, housing and health services, €8.2 billion – 77% – was invested in the south east region. This left a mere €2.4 billion – 23% – of total investment going to the BMW region. The Minister of State understated it when he said that the BMW region was now behind the indicative targets. It is actually grossly behind them. This is a travesty and an absolute disgrace. Indecon spelt it out when it stated that "there are significant differences between the two regions, with investment in the BMW region below expectations". It is another blatant example of disregard on the part of the Government for a region starved of the vital infrastructure that it so badly needs in order to survive, let alone thrive. I am personally taking this matter up with the EU Commissioner for Regional Policy, Mr. Barnier.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">If ever a Government deserves to be charged with gross discrimination, bias and abuse of its position, it is this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition. What particularly galled me were the recommendations of the report on the planned expenditure in the BMW region. It stated that spending on water provision, waste management, commerce and communications, seaports and tourism should be decreased. It also stated that spending on microenterprises – there are not many big enterprises in the region – should also decrease. I particularly commend the work done on regional innovation by the IRDs and the Leader programme. However, the review states that spending in this area should decrease. It states that spending should decrease in forestry, a natural resource and an area with huge potential in the west of Ireland, the Border region and the midlands. Spending should also apparently be decreased on fisheries and harbours, and on the Gaeltacht and islands. In the area of agriculture under two headings, general structural improvements and alternative enterprises, it is recommended that spending should decrease.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">What kind of warped thinking would suggest that an area bled white with emigration for centuries whose sons and daughters have built the economies of the United States, Great Britain and Australia, and which has never had a fraction of its just economic desserts from either national or European budgets, should be dumped upon in such an unfair and illogical fashion? Knowing the attitude of the Government to the BMW region, this is possibly an area the Government might gladly embrace. One might ask where the spatial strategy currently stands. One might also ask what is the reaction of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, the so-called great defender of the west, to the scandalous recommendations affecting the BMW region in this report.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">No Government in the history of the State has ever been handed such a bonanza. No Government in the State's history has so grossly mismanaged such plentiful resources by an arrogant presumption that it knew, and knows, better than the State appointed bodies charged with delivering on infrastructural projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Everybody accepts that Dublin is a mess. It is congested with people, housing, traffic and even crime in certain areas. However, it has been a mess for about 20 years. It was patently obvious that it had to be disentangled in the interest of Dublin and the regions. Year after year, instead of long-term planning, more money was poured into perpetuating the mess by building a series of concentric road circles, each supposed to relieve its inner and now inadequate and redundant predecessor. The result is that Dublin has become more bloated and uncontrolled.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">When the State-appointed National Roads Authority proposed its plans to upgrade existing national primary roads, the Government then basking in the glow of the fully healthy Celtic tiger, decided to overrule the NRA and come up with its own programme with commitments to far more ambitions and extravagant interurban motorway project with five spokes in the wheel, from Dublin to Belfast, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. This was to be constructed by 2006 at a cost of €6.8 billion. The programme is still only at the halfway stage. What was supposed to be €6.8 billion is now estimated to be a massive €16 billion. What was to have been completed in 2006 will not now be completed until 2010 at the earliest.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">This budgetary overrun is scandalous. Equally scandalous is the net effect of the projects, each of which is having a negative effect on Dublin and is sucking more traffic and people into an already suffocated city. As a further result, some much needed bypasses, for example the Ennis bypass, and other infrastructural works have had to be shelved or neglected. The list continues to get longer. The Luas project is late and massively over budget. The initially estimated cost was €290 million. The revised estimate – perhaps I should say guesstimate, as this is the way these projects seem to operate – is now €750 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">I am disappointed the Government has not come forward with a coherent and definitive response as to what it will do. How long more will it be before we have a response from each Minister outlining how they will react to these recommendations? The Minister agrees with the report's finding that inflation is a serious problem and has been since the NDP began. Projects were upgraded without proper evaluation. I would support the consideration of a property tax on second houses. What will happen about that? A key recommendation is the implementation of a congestion charge in Dublin. What will happen about that? The Minister of State has said the Government would bear in mind increased funding for transport investment. What will happen with the reduction of direct support for business from the Exchequer?</p>
          <p eId="para_288">This is a very critical report and one the Government should have studied in detail and allocated the past ten days to decide what would happen. The Government needs to put on the brakes where necessary. It needs to revamp and re-jig the plan and get it back on track as quickly as possible. It is vital that the Government does this.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House. I was interested in what Senator Higgins said. He started by welcoming the plan and called it crisp, concise and challenging, which are all lovely alliterative words and made good listening. Where the Senator disagreed with the plan, it was not crisp, concise and challenging, but all sorts of other things. While the Senator is entitled to his point of view, he is not entitled to two points of view on one topic.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">I very much welcome the report. Of course individual Ministers rushed out to protect their bailiwicks and went on to the battlements, which is understandable as they are worried about their future funding and how their projects proceed. The Government was right to obtain this report, the Mid-Term Evaluation of the National Development Plan and Community Support Framework for Ireland, 2000-2006. The report is quite challenging, to use one of the words used by Senator Higgins. It points out what worked, where the fault lines are and what can be done to rectify these.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">Let us look at the overall project and the mood of optimism we should have about where Ireland is and was, particularly in 1999 when domestic funds financed this programme. A few years previously, we would not have had a chance to embark on such a programme as we would not have had the finance and were very appreciative to Europe of what it gave us for our plans in other years. It is good to be able to stand on our own feet. It was good that the country was doing so well that it could embark on such projects and have the money to finance them. In itself, that is an indication of the economic prosperity of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">To quote Senator Ross the figures released yesterday and reported this morning on this are good and better than we expected. The "steady as she goes" approach will bring us around the corner and on to sunnier slopes again. I am engaging in alliteration, having complained about it earlier.</p>

          <p eId="para_294">This bodes well for the future for us. The ESRI set out to look at where it had been planned to spend the money, what worked and, more important from the point of view of our evaluation of its evaluation, where it did not work or where there were fault lines. One of those related to project appraisal and evaluation, and hands-on project management. We are always being told that big brother should get off our backs, that we are free and should be allowed to manage our own affairs. This is a very agreeable scenario up to a point. An examination of the expenditure which has already been spent and the work still remaining shows that project management at a very tight managerial level has been the underlying lack in many of the programmes outlined in the review. The Department of Finance and the agencies it will engage have clearly stated that for the three remaining years of the plan, the Department will keep a hand on those projects because its job is to watch the money. In most cases the Department of Finance says "no". I never regarded that attitude as a bad thing in either a Minister for Finance or in the Department of Finance. That is their job. When I was in the Department of Education, I always said we had to say "no" first and then say, "maybe, we will look at it." I am in favour of the Department taking a micro management approach and keeping a close watch on expenditure, project management and evaluation and evaluation of the economic cost of disruption.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The evaluation is a good one. Obviously other Senators will be interested in what happened their pet projects. The policy document is worthy of close study. There has been much debate about the review on television and radio programmes. The economic cost of disruption was one of the points raised which was not included in the costings. I am of the view that disruption is a necessary evil in the completion of a project. If there is disruption, it is the means to an economic and social end and must be endured before a project can prove its value to those who use it.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">When there is a discussion about buses versus Luas and Luas versus rail, we must acknowledge that we are quite far behind in the provision of public transport. Cities such as Paris and London had underground rail systems over 100 years ago. We had buses and trains—</p>

          <from>Ms O'Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_298">—and trams which were uprooted, which was unfortunate. We have a very feeble public transport infrastructure. We are now only beginning and that is acknowledged in the ESRI review. We are beginning the great adventure to provide a similar service such as exists in other capital cities. The review strongly recommends the use of bus lanes. Luas and metro are all part of a proper provision of public transport services; none of them is a solution in itself. We are only beginning those journeys and we have a long way to go before we will ever have a proper national public transport system. We are beginning to provide a proper roads infrastructure but it is freely acknowledged in the review that much more has to be done. The review will help to focus minds and finance on the gaps in our system.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The review discusses the advantage of buses and bus lanes over fixed line rail but I do not think it should be one or the other. It has to be a complementary system of full provision, which suits various situations. The QBCs are in place. People may think it is easy to whistle up a bus lane overnight but the officials in Dublin City Council know how difficult it was to organise bus lanes, obtaining agreement from traders in particular who feared for their business. It should not be regarded as a case of buses versus trains because each is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">Senator Higgins spoke about the areas in the review where the ESRI believed that expenditure should be reduced such as forestry, islands and harbours. It would be a foolish report that recommended more money should be spent in all areas. Clearly the review prioritised projects. I am sure various Ministers protecting their bailiwicks and funding will fight the just cause with the Department of Finance and at Cabinet to get their share of what is outlined in the national development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">I welcome the emphasis in the review on the BMW region from which I hail. Some people have an idea that there are jam jars filled with money for the BMW region and they question why that money is not being spent on the region. There is no jam jar filled with money. The money is drawn down when a project is ready to go forward and when finance is required. Planning has been slow in this regard. I have in mind the road from Dublin to the west through Athlone or Kinnegad. The road project has commenced and the plans for the Kinnegad bypass are visible. The planning for this road was slow. I suppose people have the right to object. I wish the Minister luck with the proposed Bill. It will streamline this process but I wonder what will happen the snails and the fens and the people who have objections. I hope when Senator Higgins gets into Europe he will not take up the cause of the snails crossing some by-road and argue they are the most important snails in the world. I never really met or saw a snail that was very important—</p>

          <p eId="para_303">Or toads, as Senator Coghlan said this morning. I welcome a more accelerated method of obtaining planning approval for projects while allowing proper regard for heritage. Absurdities occurred in the case of some of the main roads. The Taoiseach referred in the Dáil to people swinging from trees, the tree ambushers on the N11. We will have to take proper account of people's reservations but surely not to that extent where major projects have been held up for two or three years because there was supposed to be an endangered species. What about the citizens of the land who will become the endangered species if we do not get moving on these physical infrastructural problems?</p>
          <p eId="para_304">This is a very fine evaluation. No Government willingly wishes to display something warts and all but warts and all are displayed here in full.

I am confident that Government plans and projects will be all the better for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_306">Last week, within a day or so of the publication by the ESRI of its mid-term evaluation of the national development plan, another publication appeared that is highly relevant to this discussion. The annual rankings of international competitiveness contained news for Ireland that was nothing short of shocking. Will the Leader tell me if this is alliteration?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_89">

          <p eId="para_307">No, not really. It is not as alliterative as me and Senator Higgins.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_90">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_308">I will do my best to improve. Two years ago, Ireland stood at 11th place in the competitiveness rankings, which was a highly respectable and desirable position. Last year we plunged from 11th place to 24th place. That was a warning, if ever there was one, that our chickens were coming home to roost. Last week's figures show we have taken another fall. We are now in 30th place. Our international competitiveness fell from 11th to 30th place in just two years. Some 29 other countries are more attractive places in which to do business. These countries will be more effective in attracting the highly mobile foreign investment on which our future economy so critically depends.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">Some years ago we would not have been concerned at being ranked 30th, but to drop from 11th to 24th to 30th place almost sounds like free-fall. These figures illustrate just how quickly things can change in today's highly volatile world. In a short space of time one can go from a place in which everyone wants to be to one that is so far down the list that it never gets chosen at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I cannot make the point strongly enough, loudly enough or often enough that regaining our international competitiveness is the single most important factor in determining this country's future. I am not just talking about our economic future, as so much else depends on our economic well-being. We have engaged in the temptation of living on the laurels of the Celtic tiger long after the rest of the world has passed us and gone on to other things. If we allow this precipitous decline in our competitiveness to continue, we are digging our own economic grave.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">It is not so much that we are now in 30th place but that it happened so quickly. This is the context in which we should approach the mid-term evaluation of the national development plan because one of the central aims of that programme is to maintain and enhance our competitiveness. I accept that it predates the publication of these figures but evidence existed that this was likely to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Although it is not a matter that excites a great deal of people, the success of the national development plan will affect the lives of everyone in this country over the years ahead. By any measure, it is a vast undertaking which involves the spending of about €65 billion over a seven year period. The vast bulk of that enormous sum is our own money, as only a small and dwindling proportion of it comes in the form of handouts from the EU. We should look carefully at how this money is spent because of its size alone, quite apart from its importance to our future.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Most public attention so far has focused on the recommendations which the review makes for reallocating some of the spending during the remainder of the programme. Some of the proposals have so incensed a few Government Ministers that they set out to rubbish the entire review. This controversy has tended to take attention away from what the authors have to say about an equally important matter, the question not of where the money is spent, but of how well it is spent. What they have to tell us in that regard is, to say the least, disturbing.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">One would have thought that, with such vast amounts at stake, the evaluation and choice of projects and their management and control as they proceeded would be of the highest possible standard. The review, unfortunately, shows that this is far from being the case. In some respects it seems that we are going backwards. One of the benefits we gained from the EU-supported spending of the 1980s and 1990s was a move away from the stop-go of annual budgeting to the more cost-effective multi-annual funding approach. The review highlights the fact that under the NDP we seem to be reverting more and more to annual budgeting. This gives our friends, the mandarins in Merrion Street – I hope they do not mind being called mandarins as it is a term that is in common usage – more control over the spending. It does so, however, at an unacceptable cost. They should not be allowed to get away with this backsliding. We should insist that they adhere to the lessons so patiently taught us by the EU, even though its input in spending is decreasing.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">A regular theme of mine is the apparent lack of interest in the Department of Finance in the concept of cost-benefit analysis. It seems particularly averse to the discipline of evaluating the costs and benefits of a proposed project as a decision making tool. Reference was made to this recently in the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill in terms of ensuring the regulatory assessment was being done, which it clearly was not in that case. More importantly, it does not apply a cost-benefit analysis when circumstances change during a project to see if it is still worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The authors of the review draw attention to the impact this approach has had on what the Leader and Senator Higgins referred to and what I am tempted to call the ill-fated Luas project. It appears to have encountered many more problems than appeared would be the case when it started. They tell the story, which would be quite amusing if it was not so tragic, of how the project started as one thing at one price in 1993 and then went through a succession of changes as the years wore on. What all these changes had in common was that they greatly added to the bottom-line cost of the project. We have ended up with a still-unfinished light rail system that will cost at least three times its original projected cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">Whether all these changes were for the better is not the point. At no stage were they subjected to the rigours of a cost-benefit analysis. The project was just allowed to grow and grow, to lurch blindly from one thing to another, without anyone putting up their hand and saying: "Hold on a minute. At this cost, is this still a good idea?" One of the most important recommendations in this review is on page 12 of the summary, where it states that consideration should be given to the establishment of a unit in the Department of Finance devoted exclusively to the conduct/commissioning of cost-benefit studies on major projects. I add my hearty support to this recommendation. For a long time I have found it totally incomprehensible that Government spending, especially our capital spending, does not use the cost-benefit concept. If any company in the private sector, and I know those of us in the House who are involved in such, failed to use that discipline in its spending decisions, it would be out of business very quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Let me give an example of the starkness of this issue. The National Safety Council produced figures based on international experience which show that money invested in promoting road safety pays off at a rate of seven times what is invested. It is not a case of putting a price on the benefit of being alive rather than dead as a result of a road accident. We are talking about hard money figures in respect of the benefits which accrue directly to the State in terms of road safety. When challenged at a recent Oireachtas committee, officials from the Department of Finance admitted there was no room in their approach for a consideration of such cost-benefit analyses. In this day and age, that is a shocking admission. In the absence of a proper approach to costs and benefits, we can be sure that a great deal of the money invested by the State is badly spent and that some of it is wasted entirely. I would be a great deal happier if the energy generated by the publication of this review was directed to achieve better value for money than all the spending on the national development plan. Money has been dissipated on turf fights for a share of the cake. The danger is that the focus of attention is on such fights. While the Minister's heart is in the right place and he has to battle this problem, there is a challenge for us. We must ensure that we see the larger picture and grasp the opportunity to do something about it.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_319">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, and his officials, one of whom is a former colleague of mine.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">The report of the Economic and Social Research Institute is of considerable value. I am an admirer of the institute which provides independent analysis from which we can learn whether we agree with every recommendation it makes. Even if we do not agree with its recommendations, the ESRI stimulates debate and asks questions which is a good thing. Obviously, the Government will make decisions as in some, though not all respects, it has more information at its disposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">The tone of the report is positive overall. It is clear that substantial public investment has taken place and will continue to be made at unprecedented levels. The report makes the point that public investment not only makes a short-term contribution to sustaining activity in the context of an international downturn, it also has a long-term input into competitiveness. According to a phrase used in the report, public investment is a stepping stone to realising our full potential. Undoubtedly, this is one of the keys to handling our deterioration in competitiveness. The ESRI argues that the macro-economic returns from the national development plan are higher than anticipated with 7% added to GNP from 2000 to 2002 and a 3% long-term contribution to growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">While I would be the last to dispute that we could do better in certain respects, there is no basis for agreeing with the Fine Gael spokesman, Senator Higgins, that this report is a serious or damning indictment of the Government. That is a gross exaggeration of the measured and constructive critique in the report. Senator Higgins spoke about the importance of the EU to the west at the time we joined. When Padraig Flynn was a Minister and, subsequently, a Commissioner he did his bit for the west as did Senator O'Rourke when she was a Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Senator Quinn mentioned the national competitiveness report which we should note and consider seriously. However, it must be remembered that it puts countries like Germany, which has three times our rate of unemployment, ahead of us. We must look at these things in perspective. We have a much better employment rate and financial situation than Germany. With all due respect, the national competitiveness report represents a businessman's perspective. While that is important as businessmen are the people who make investments, we should not adopt a completely trusting attitude to the report. I do not wish to accuse Senator Quinn of being naive. It is a useful measure like an opinion poll. The report has certain value but that value is not unlimited.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">My experience of the Civil Service tells me that Senator Quinn is completely wrong about cost-benefit analyses. Most infrastructure projects are subject to detailed cost-benefit analysis. I have attended the Government's sub-committee on infrastructure and I know that practically everything is subject to a cost-benefit analysis. I accept that there are criticisms to be made of changes we have made, but to demand a cost-benefit analysis for each is to support the stop-start attitude which has been condemned. We have to get on with things and make decisions. It does no good to wonder in the middle of the Luas project whether it is a good idea. We must finish it.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Interesting points are made in the report and I will refer briefly to them. The ESRI draws attention to the fact that spending on investment is 27% of GDP compared to an average of 20% in Germany, France and the UK. That means on an individual level we have less <i>per capita</i> income because we need to invest more. This is interesting. We have built up the construction sector and our housing output last year was, in absolute terms, one third of that in the UK and a quarter of that in Germany despite their vastly greater populations. There is clear merit, as the ESRI report points out, in fast tracking major public investment and legislation in that regard will be published shortly. The report points to an interesting paradox whereby wage rates for the unskilled are rising relatively quickly while wage rates for skilled workers are dropping. However, this, to a degree, may be a temporary phenomenon. The ESRI report suggests that returns on infrastructural investment are higher as a result of the growth in the 1990s and the success of our economy than they would have been previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Comments are also made in the report in respect of regional balance. While the report states that the regional balance is better as a result of the national development plan than it would otherwise be, the ESRI is not happy. I am not happy either with the balance of investment between the southern and eastern region, which is not the same thing as the south east region and the BMW region. One of the problems to which the report refers only in passing is that there is insufficient disaggregation in the southern and eastern region. The south east region has done quite poorly in recent times and I draw the attention of the House to the limitation of an analysis which only divides the country into two regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The report points out that the returns on education are substantial although they are longer term than returns on infrastructure. I regret that the report has little to say about the value of investment in schools. The ESRI report states that the more rapidly we invest, the higher the cost. The report also suggests that the Berlin Agenda 2000 was front-loaded particularly as far as the southern and eastern region was concerned. Although this suggestion is new to me, it makes sense. The ESRI is complimentary about the progress on non-national roads and water projects and positive about the roles of culture, recreation and sports in regional development. I agree entirely.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Like Senator Higgins, I disagree with the ESRI on agricultural development and related matters. The institute does not seem to appreciate that investment is needed to sustain what is there. Agricultural investment must be made at a level which allows the same jobs to be done, improves productivity and provides the freedom to contribute in other ways to the economy. That aspect of the report is disappointing and superficial. The ESRI has had a blind spot in regard to public transport for a long time. It opposed the DART when it was proposed and has reservations about practically everything other than buses. Senator Higgins asked from where the character of the report comes. There is a touch of leafy Dublin 4 about the ESRI, which shows itself in its attitudes to agriculture and public transport, since one probably does not need public transport to reach many parts of Dublin 4.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">On my way to a funeral outside my constituency this morning, I passed through the Glen of the Downs project on the N11. The speed limit on this beautiful new dual carriageway is now one third lower than when it was a twisty single lane road. I do not understand why the public must be deprived of the value of expensive investment, not to mention battles with folks in trees. Why must we now crawl where, at least at some times of the day, we used to be able to travel at 60 mph? Presumably, the point of public investment is to save time. However, I do not see how that is the case in regard to the N11.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">The ESRI is correct to ask why we spend money building hospitals which we cannot subsequently bring into service. We must have a better match between current and capital expenditure. This is a positive report in that it supports public investment and I hope and am confident that we will not see public investment slashed for budgetary or financial reasons as happened in the 1980s.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_92">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_331">I am pleased to comment on this good report which is part of an important process. Senator O'Rourke complimented the Government on having commissioned the report even though it is a requirement of the national development plan, at least in regard to the CSF element. Nevertheless, the Government also correctly chose to evaluate domestic spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">It is difficult to avoid the temptation of scoring a few party political points and I would have been inclined to do so had the Government not popped up and invited us to kick it down. This is a serious report which makes serious recommendations and for four Ministers to rubbish it in quick succession, a matter of hours after its publication, makes a nonsense of the whole process. The situation is not helped by the Taoiseach's typical blather which seems to mean nothing at all. The Government should have observed the dignity of giving a serious and considered response to the process of evaluation. Not to have done so does considerable disservice to the ESRI, those who drew up the report and the whole process. I am sorry that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The report states that the priorities and concept of the national development plan are good but that delivery has been poor. It has been behind time and over budget in most cases and there is no system in place to properly prioritise projects. These are serious complaints about deficiencies in the way in which we are progressing the plan, resulting in projects being delivered late and over budget and priority projects not necessarily being delivered first. This is a serious reflection of the <i>status quo</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">If we were still enjoying the economic circumstances we did two or three years ago, when we could afford almost anything, it would not matter so much. However, the inevitable result of the current state of the economy is that some of these projects will not happen at all and many others will not be delivered for many years, which is regrettable. If that is the case, we must examine how we prioritise projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The report states that infrastructural expenditure is important and should continue irrespective of economic circumstances. However, the Government and, in particular, the Department of Finance have indicated that they propose to cut back on capital projects because it is easier to do so. While yesterday's numbers were good, they indicate that Departments are taking the easy option by cutting back on new spending for capital projects. The ESRI states that we must accept the basic premise that such projects are necessary to sustain and improve economic activity and that it is short-sighted to cut back on them because the economy is not performing as well. The Government is headed towards this easy route and the Department of Finance should exercise its management role and state that this should not happen. We will keep a close eye on what happens on budget day to ensure that the 5% minimum for capital expenditure is maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I was fascinated by the measure of the returns which the ESRI calculated. The report states that GNP was 7% higher in 2002 than it would otherwise have been and that the overall return is around 14%. I am not sure how the ESRI arrived at those numbers, since the methodology is not that clear in the report, but they are persuasive. The figures should be highlighted and it is important that expenditure is maintained and projects are delivered in good time.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Senator Mansergh stated that there is a touch of Dublin 4 about the ESRI, which I accept shows itself in some of the prejudices with which we are familiar, such as the anti-rail bias, the support for water charges and the commercialisation of the waste water infrastructure and so on. From an economic point of view, I understand why the ESRI makes such recommendations. However, from a political point of view, I understand why the Government does not touch them and that if the Labour Party was in power, it would not do so either. We must accept and expect that the ESRI will state such things. However, the economic benefit would be outweighed by the political disadvantages and no one will deliver on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The national development plan sets out a strategy which is intended to increase competitiveness, improve access to markets and improve inter-urban transport. However, our roads strategy has done none of this and is no longer designed to do so. Rather, we have improved suburban routes around Dublin. Virtually all the big expenditure has been focused on the Dublin region through, for example, the Dublin to Kildare route, the Dublin to the Border route through Meath and the improvement of the N11 through the Glen of the Downs, to which Senator Mansergh referred. All of this is intended to improve access to Dublin for commuters more so than for business. I accept this is necessary, but public transport would be a better means of achieving it. It means we have lost sight of the other principle aim of the roads project which was to improve access for business and individual passengers to the regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">It is clear from the recent noises made by the Government in regard to Waterford that its priority is not to return to such original principles. The ESRI report states that the specifications for the Portlaoise to Cork road and the N9 south of Kilcullen, for example, are too high. If they are built to motorway standards they could take 55,000 vehicles a day, whereas at present they take about one third or one quarter of that figure. What is not spelled out is that if it falls to below dual carriageway status to wide two lane roads, it will only comfortably carry approximately 2,000 vehicles a day, which is well within the current usage. Within five or ten years, it is virtually certain that on the Waterford road, including most of the other major national primary roads, we will be above that usage.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">The choice is quite stark. There are motorways and segregated dual carriageways which can carry a lot of vehicles – in some cases a lot more than they currently carry – and there are wide single lane roads that can carry much fewer. One can easily mess up the main road by having a few trucks travelling at 40 or 50 miles an hour. It does not matter how many cars use the road per hour, if a couple of trucks are travelling slowly, it will encourage people to overtake in dangerous circumstances and slow up people a lot. Irrespective of the usage numbers at which economists inevitably look, there is merit in building to a higher specification if people are to travel relatively quickly from our major cities. I agree with the Minister, Deputy Brennan, that in looking to the future we must consider what is appropriate not just now but in 20 or 30 years' time. Our experience with the M50 in Dublin would tend to bear out these sentiments.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">Before leaving the roads issue, I would like to comment briefly on part of the Indecon report to which Senator Higgins referred. I have not had an opportunity to do so since it was published during the summer. It suggested that the savings in terms of time between the major urban centres would not be huge. For Galway, it referred to a saving of 36 minutes, that is, from 157 minutes currently to 121 minutes. Some of the figures are bizarre. It outlined current travelling times from Dublin to Galway of 157 minutes; Dublin to Limerick, 145 minutes, or just over two hours; Dublin to Cork, 205 minutes, or less than three and a half hours and Dublin to Waterford, 125 minutes, which is just over two hours. I do not think I have ever managed to travel between Dublin and any of these centres within these times. I travel regularly to Lisdoonvarna, in Senator Dooley's county, from where my wife comes and it rarely takes us less than four and a half hours, even on Sunday morning. How one can get to Galway in just over two hours is beyond me. We must sometimes treat what economists say with a certain measure of scepticism.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">Public transport is one of the interesting issues to which the report refers. It specifies that the moneys allocated are being under-spent and that priority is not being given to public transport by the Government. It goes into some detail about the total farce of the Luas project. I have no doubt that in a year's time – assuming it is built – the Luas will provide a decent comfortable service for those who use it along the two lines provided. There is no doubt that if one had carried out the cost benefit analysis when the money was ultimately committed, the argument that it was good value for money would not stand up. In terms of the number of people it will transport per kilometre, the Luas does not stand up to any reasonable examination. As Senator O'Rourke said, the point is made in the report that we never factored in, not just in that project, but also in the port tunnel, the economic costs of the disruption caused.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">This is an important factor as we again consider whether there is to be a metro service in Dublin. The fact is that a metro would not have cost a great deal more than Luas has cost already. The on-surface disruption would be a great deal less because the project would be carried out underground. My party's spokesperson, Deputy Shortall, has not completed her consideration of the whole metro project. It is right that we should take our time to do it and look at the cost benefit analysis. My view is that the project is worth doing. It may take 20 or even 30 years to complete, but it must be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">I do not buy the bus argument. There is a limit to the number of QBCs one can allow in Dublin. They are cost effective and they have delivered a better service where they exist. However, the usage of public transport generally is higher in the areas served by both bus and DART. There is a demand for rail which will never be met by bus. We should acknowledge this and get on with improving the rail service in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">I want to refer to the health service to which Senator Mansergh referred. There has been a certain amount of distortion about what the report said about the service. It does not state that we should not have 3,000 more acute beds although clearly we should. A host of reports, including the recent Hanly report, states that we must have at least 3,000 more beds. It states that doing this last year when 250 to 270 beds were closed at any given time was stupid, and to do it at a time when one has allocated in a preordained way 20% of beds in public hospitals for private use is also stupid. I endorse and accept both these sentiments.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">We must sort out the public-private mix which is ingrained in our system at this stage. I am interested in the recommendation that we should discontinue tax breaks for private hospitals. We must sort out this matter. We must bring the closed beds back into use but this should not take away from the fact that everyone accepts we need to replace the beds that were taken out of the acute hospital service at the end of the 1980s. We have 3,000 more acute hospital beds now than we had then. These must be replaced, otherwise all the talk of reform and all the reports over the last 16 to 18 months will be as naught.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">This is a good report. It deserves serious consideration, not just by Government but perhaps by the committees of this House. It ranges so widely that we could merely touch on the issue today. I am pleased we have had an early opportunity to do just that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMauriceHayes" eId="spk_93">
          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_348">I welcome the report, which is a very useful and necessary exercise. Nevertheless, it is useful for one to cast a cold eye over what has been done. I do not think it is necessary to be in any way thin-skinned or defensive about the conclusions in the report. They are conclusions and not necessarily writ. Sometimes economists have a way of looking at things through an economic lens, which is difficult to translate into the world of political reality, because political and other judgments must be made at the same time.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">The report points out the importance of cleaving to the policy of capital investment in infrastructural projects. It would be extremely counter-productive not to make the investment now. Most Departments with which I have dealt over the years have a tendency to scale back on projects in order to meet current financial stringencies. This has almost always been a mistake. When projects are scaled back – the M50 was mentioned as a case in point – they require even more expensive remedial works further down the line. It is necessary to relate these things to the capacity to provide current expenditure support for them, particularly to link it to training and other policies to ensure people are there to carry out the work.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">It is important to try in some way to demagnetise the Dublin area. The national development plan dilutes this somewhat by calling all sorts of places growth points. To do this, one must have a small number of quite large counter-magnets in other places to provide the full gamut of urban living. One should ask why young people must move to these places and whether it has to do with the quality of life, the quality of choice, the scale of things and so on, which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">I wish to refer to an area in which I have a good deal of experience, namely, hospitals. The report states that there are sufficient hospital beds. That may be true but they are not much use if they are in the wrong place. One cannot count these just as bed spaces and expect them to work like clockwork. Investment is needed. I would argue that it is necessary to justify the claim that 3,000 is the right number. It may be that investment in primary care and in continuing community care would change the context in which acute hospital beds are necessary. I carried out a review of hospitals in Northern Ireland a couple of years ago and we formed the view that anything up to 15% or 20% of people in acute hospitals would be better off if they were looked after somewhere else. One might get a better investment that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">It is ludicrous to talk about a shortage of acute beds when such a large proportion has been committed to private beds, an issue to which the report refers. I have no problem with people practising or availing of private medical treatment, but they should do it in private hospitals. This is an aspect that needs to be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">As we live and work in a changing international environment and any programme is only as good as the premises used and the assumptions made therein, these programmes have to be heroic if one is looking forward seven or ten years. The great advantage of a mid-term review is that it provides an opportunity to review and to tack. There are two international movements, which were probably not anticipated to be as strong as they turned out to be when the national plan was being formulated, namely the movement of manufacturing capacity from the west to east globally – movement into China of service industries particularly and back-up industries to India, for example – and the likely impact of the extended European Union. While not wishing to decry or stop this, we have to consider what we have to do to replace those jobs. There is no point in bidding in the world for low price or low level employment. We have to find the means of upgrading skills, upgrading our workforce and getting added value. That requires an acute examination of the education system, particularly at third level.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">In the pursuit of a degree-led culture, we have lost sight of much industry-based operations. I consider this in terms of Northern Ireland. We lost an extremely good polytechnic for questionable value. The same is happening in the regional technical colleges or centres, which were the drivers of economic change and were hugely important. The number of people who are now going into soft degree options must be examined. We might also look, rather more than this report was capable of doing, at the all-island capacity to discover to what extent scarce resources can be used to complement each other. There is a tendency among the economists to look for organisation and control. That is important. There is no point in throwing money into black holes.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">The health service is such a black hole. Until the capacity to deal with these issues is developed, and that requires implementation of some of the reports that have been put before us, I am glad the Government has introduced a means of following up on great projects. I stand before the House as a person who had to defend at the Committee of Public Accounts a hospital project which started out at a cost of €7 million and finished at €74 million. I know a little about these issues. It would be helpful if those cases referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report were used as case studies. In all cases these were cumulative decisions and I am satisfied that everybody made a decision for what appeared to be a good reason at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">I am glad the Government has resisted the temptation to be as <i>dirigiste</i> as the report would recommend. It is important that agencies carry out this work and that it is not all driven by the centre. This should be regarded as a useful report, as a tonic and as a means of trimming the plan. Its general direction is endorsed and I commend the work done.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_94">
          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_357">I join with my colleagues in welcoming the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to discuss this report by the ESRI. It is timely that we have an opportunity to discuss it so close to its launch. I recognise the input of a number of other important consultants into this report. There has been much comment and interest in the observations of the report's authors, particularly in the areas where they are critical of elements of the projects associated with the national development plan and the management of those projects and also where a number of policy changes have been identified and where there has been a negative reaction from the Departments and Ministers concerned. As a result, there is a perception that the NDP has not been delivering. It would be sad if that were allowed to continue. It is important to recognise that the broad thrust of the report is complimentary of the NDP. It recognises the importance of the initiation of the NDP and of moving away from the methods of the 1980s where projects were funded purely on a year by year basis. As I read it, the report recognised the importance of the current position evidenced by the achievements of the past three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">It is worth noting that there has been significant progress despite the changes in economic circumstances. When the NDP was compiled in 1999, there was a different set of economic circumstances. Despite the dramatic changes that have occurred, the report suggests that the underlying strategy of the plan is as valid now as it was then. There is no doubt that the plan is delivering, particularly through the operational programmes, to which the Minister has referred, on sustainable national economic and employment growth, consolidating and improving Ireland's competitiveness and in terms of social inclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The area about which I would be concerned, where the NDP may not be delivering to the extent originally envisaged, is that of balanced regional development. It was heartening to hear Senators from all sides, particularly Senators McDowell and Maurice Hayes, identify the importance of balanced regional development.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">There has been major investment in the key areas within the regions. Regional development is critical for a number of reasons, not only for the sake of the development of the region concerned but, as Senator Maurice Hayes said, in terms of easing the pressure points of the east coast and, in particular, Dublin. That should be a critical part of the development plan. I do not want to appear parochial but as Senator McDowell has identified, there is a lack of investment in infrastructure in regions such as Clare and the west. That, too, needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">The report also notes that despite both the world and Irish economic slowdown there has been no positive effect on the pressures on infrastructure. This relates to the east coast, particularly Dublin. It also indicates that there is a high rate of inflation in wages and the cost of housing despite the downturn in the economy. Both of these negative elements are clearly identified as affecting our competitiveness. Something must be done about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">The answer lies in an accelerated programme of regional development, which the NDP alone will not deliver. We must, therefore, turn our attention to decentralisation on which the NDP has the capacity to deliver. Unfortunately, the report does not prioritise the projects I believe would have the capacity to deliver on regional development. The focus seems to be on Dublin and the eastern region.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The report recommends an increase in investment in urban public transport. The focus is not on places such as Ennis, Ballina or Midleton, but on bus corridors and light rail infrastructure within the city of Dublin. The report also mentions lowering the priority of mainline rail which does nothing for the concept of regional development. It states that we must recognise that improved public transport will require a major increase in urban density in order to operate efficiently. This will be difficult in Dublin, which is a low-rise city. The capacity for greater density within the confines of the city is virtually impossible. There is talk of an increase in spending on urban transport while at the same time an attempt is being made to increase the density within the city as it stands. If an increase in density is needed in order to deliver a viable public transport system, the plan is not viable. Dublin is no longer a greenfield site and there are no more green or brownfield sites in the city. The concept of increasing density is a flawed approach. It would be better to prioritise projects that would encourage commercial and residential development outside of Dublin, in the eastern region in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">The report also recognises that second houses and holiday homes have created an inflationary pressure on the construction industry and proposes the taxing of these homes, a proposal with which I would not agree. If we made it easier for people to live and work in the regions in which they want to live, they might not need holiday homes. Obviously, the west and mid-west would feature strongly in this regard and we would be delighted to accommodate people.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">This report recommends greater investment in national and non-national roads, which would be beneficial. It is important to ensure that links between the capital city and other towns are continually upgraded although they may not need to be upgraded at the pace identified in the plan. It is more important to examine and upgrade pressure points within the regions. We could talk about areas such as Limerick, Ennis and Galway. We can recognise that when the link between Dublin and Portlaoise is complete, the NDP still envisages building a motorway from Portlaoise to Limerick. However, in my view there should no longer be as great a priority on that project because there are much greater pressure points in and around Limerick and on the link between Limerick and Galway. I do not mean the Ennis bypass because it was identified earlier and is going to go ahead next year. I am heartened also that the fourth river crossing in Limerick is being accelerated. There are pressure points within the regions, as identified in the national spatial strategy, which are causing a kind of noose around the neck of prospective development therein. It is about time these projects were brought about.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The difficulty with the national development plan is that it preceded the national spatial strategy. If we were working from a greenfield plan, it would probably be better to have the national spatial strategy first and have it followed by the national development plan. This would make it easier to prioritise the investment potential and needs in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">It is necessary to look at rail infrastructure in the regions. The report tends to move away from rail but the western rail corridor and the Shannon rail spur are two fundamental elements of growth in that region.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">One other issue raised in the report is finance. There seems to be a question mark over whether finance should be raised through taxation or borrowing. As most of these projects are capital projects, it is critically important that the Minister looks more towards borrowing. Future generations will benefit from the effects of this development. My attitude is that we should let them pay their share.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_95">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_369">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. From the point of view of my constituency and its general hinterland, the BMW region, the ESRI report does not really affect us. The people in this region know there is wastage and that there are problems regarding value for money and general spending. General expenditure is tilted towards the east of the country. We did not need the ESRI report to prove that to us, nor did we need any consultancy review. We know there is an imbalance.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">One of the key priorities of the national development plan was balanced regional development. I remember that balanced regional development was a main issue for the Minister of State during his election campaign. However, as matters stand, the BMW region has lost out. We have lost in terms of infrastructural investment, be it broadband services or roads. I will highlight some of the figures later.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The south-east of the country has gained considerably with regard to broadband and information technology investment. It has attracted high-value, high-tech companies, such as pharmaceutical companies, from America. An €18 million information technology project was launched quite recently in that part of the country. This can be compared to an investment in Donegal of €4 million. There is a considerable difference. I acknowledge and commend the €4 million spend in Donegal. It is important because it will be instrumental in attracting high-tech companies to the county –€3 million will be spent in Letterkenny and €1 million has been spent in Gweedore. The Tánaiste has been talking about change and transition from a manufacturing technology base in Donegal, from a low skill labour force towards a high skill information technology one. If she is to put the money where her mouth is, she must come on board and consider all the people who have lost their jobs in the Fruit of the Loom and other textile industries in Donegal. The Gweedore industrial estate is now barren. There is no point in expecting an investment of €4 million to address the infrastructural needs of that part of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The BMW region has the figures to prove that tourism is down in the region. Flagship projects have been touted over the past four or five years, since I joined Donegal County Council in 1999. According to the national development plan, the flagship projects for Donegal will not happen because an area must have in excess of 100,000 visitors annually in order to get one of these projects. There is a serious problem if we are restricted under this plan in terms of numbers. It is a case of the cart and the horse – we do not have the numbers at present and that means we do not get the project. That matter must be addressed also.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The National Roads Authority payment in 2000 was €19 million, but the actual spend in 2002 was €9 million. That is a dramatic drop. We have one of the most modern design offices in Donegal town, which also serves parts of Leitrim and Sligo. Engineers have designs and plans and are ready to spend money on projects, such as by-passes in Donegal, but that has not happened. Payments to date in 2003 by the NRA to Donegal amount to €2.9 million compared to an actual spend of €19.8 million in 2000. One does not need to be a rocket scientist, have an ESRI report or employ an expensive consultancy company to tell the people in the north west that they are playing second fiddle in a country that is completely imbalanced. This must be addressed in the mid-term review of the national development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">In 1999, some 85,500 jobs were created by small enterprise in the BMW region, which includes Donegal. That went down in 2002 to 36,000 jobs, which is less than half the amount of jobs created by small to medium enterprise. I take on board Senator Maurice Hayes's point. Perhaps we are becoming too reliant on university based education and are attempting to involve people too much in the literary side as pen pushers. There is an opening in the north west for tourism projects, based on crafts and skills. Opportunities exist and this was proved in 1999 when people set up businesses. However, these businesses are not sustainable because the infrastructure is not there to maintain them.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">I know the Minister hears this day in and day out and that Ministers throughout the country are fighting for their own regions. However, the BMW region has Objective One status. It is acknowledged as an Objective One area and, as Senator Higgins acknowledged in terms of the European Union, it has been discriminated against. It needs urgent funding for roads, broadband services and any other type of investment that will help to create jobs in the first place, never mind sustain them.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Donegal is in a unique position because it has 144 km. of border between Derry, Fermanagh and Tyrone, but we have been creating and sustaining our own funding on a cross-Border basis. We have received money under INTERREG as well as from the International Fund for Ireland, but we are not receiving our share of the national spend. The people of Donegal cannot rely solely on cross-Border funds. Those who want to create and sustain jobs cannot rely on Brussels. We want money collected in tax in the region returned and we are entitled to it. It is not too much to ask.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Yesterday, the International Fund for Ireland invested €1 million in a broadband wireless project between Derry, Letterkenny and Strabane. This should be commended and I acknowledge the great funding provided. It will involve a community led approach with groups from Tullyarvan and Buncrana to Convoy. It will be cost-effective because the fibre optic broadband that is being installed in Letterkenny is not cost efficient. It is very disruptive to traffic flow. There are alternatives to putting fibre optics underground.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, talks the talk on Donegal and mentions taskforce documents. She discusses what will be done and how we will manage the transition from a manufacturing base involving textiles to a more advanced highly technological base in terms of attracting high-tech, high value companies into the region. However, that will not happen unless it is addressed in the mid-term review.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">People in the BMW region want a review of broadband investment in 2004 because we are not happy with the €4 million provided. We acknowledge it and it will be spent wisely in Donegal. However, we want a second round of funding for more cost efficient broadband. The man in the street knows that putting fibre optics underground will be costly. The businesses involved in the chamber of commerce in Letterkenny will lose out coming up to Christmas. Wireless fibre optics are cost efficient, involve minimal disruption and can be put in place very quickly. Looking at alternative and cost efficient ways of introducing broadband will be key for the region in 2004. We have lost out in the past, but we do not intend to lose out in the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomMorrissey" eId="spk_96">
          <from>Mr. Morrissey</from>
          <p eId="para_380">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House for the debate on the mid-term review of the national development plan. This report is one of the most important to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas for some time. The national development plan is the Government's investment programme for the period 2001 to 2006 and covers most major investments in physical infrastructure by the State. Infrastructure is the major priority of the plan and the report acknowledges the importance of tackling the country's infrastructural deficit so that we can reach our full economic potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The report's recommendations are very welcome in critically evaluating our spending performance and the delivery of our infrastructure. The report highlights the need for value for money audits on all projects. If we fail to take heed of this criteria it will lead, inevitably, to further delays and cost overruns as evidenced in some of the major projects currently being constructed, such as the Luas and the Dublin Port Tunnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">For the remainder of the plan, project selection will have to be rigorously enforced. Otherwise, some projects will be undertaken to the detriment of other, more worthy projects. We need to reappraise our spending on project selection at this mid-term point as the capital to complete all projects as envisaged in the original plan is now not available. This is due partly to previous construction inflationary price rises and also because of lower revenue accruing to the State's coffers.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The cost of future road building must be seriously addressed from a design perspective. Design of roads must be assessed on traffic needs and future growth patterns. If this was to happen, the requirement for full scale motorways from end to end to our main cities may not be necessary, although it may be accepted that major grade separated interchanges will be required on the edges of cities. We must ensure that we keep our prospective demand in sight. Otherwise, we may continue to spend unwisely.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Concerning future public transport provision in Dublin in particular, we must be cognisant of the fact that Dublin is a low density city and, consequently, the performance of the public bus may be a less costly alternative. This is because, first, it is relatively quick to implement a bus route and order buses and, second, it is very versatile in terms of reaching the outer suburbs.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">Other Senators mentioned greenfield and brownfield sites around Dublin. Some were dealt with recently by Fingal County Council, including the Phoenix Park racecourse in my area. This included a plan for 2,500 houses and if the DTO had its way, up to 5,000 houses might have been involved. It is on a main corridor. It has 275 buses passing the site each day and it has an under-utilised railway line, yet some politicians from the area, for local political reasons, opposed it. However, they are the first to cry out for a DART style service or a suburban rail system or call for the metro to be extended to the area. If the metro, or a DART style system, is to come to west Dublin, or to the Kildare area, our densities will have to increase dramatically and people will have to accept that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">The Luas system as now constructed raises serious questions about further extensions. Some critics would see Luas as a QBC on rails, at a very high price of €800 million. A proper cost benefit analysis needs to be undertaken for future transport projects. We should double the costs and halve the benefits for all future cost benefit analysis to see whether a project stacks up for investment and whether it is worth doing. This has been our experience with the major infrastructural projects in this city; when one considers Luas one sees that the benefits are not those we expected and the costs have almost trebled.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The report refers to weaknesses in project management. This is its major understatement. In many cases such as the Red Cow roundabout and the port tunnel, we have under-engineered. Today at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, directors of the RPA briefed us on some of the reasons for the delay in Luas. It is clear to me and other Senators that poor contractual arrangements are in place and no financial penalties can be imposed by the RPA to force the contractors to complete the works on time. We must look to European experience, such as that which the Madrid metro experts outlined to us in their visit and presentation last June. I can only conclude that when one evaluates our performance against best European practice, we are found wanting.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">This is not because this Government has not made resources available but rather that we have been too lax in our approach to project management. In conclusion, I hope that the Cabinet will examine the many recommendations on project evaluation, selection, design and cost so that this country will be able to compete with the best in the world in terms of infrastructure and our competitiveness will not be hindered.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_97">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_389">I suppose having a national development plan is better than not having one. That is a positive note on which to start. I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically agree with Senator Morrissey that it appears that our national capacity to manage projects is more akin to a Third World country than a country that has aspirations to be a leader of the modern technological revolution. This morning I read the league table of competitiveness on the World Economic Forum website. I share with Professor Paul Krugman, a healthy scepticism about the concept of national competitiveness. Professor Krugman was for many years a professor of economics in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is now based in a university in New York. One runs into all sorts of problems if one looks deeply at competitiveness, but everybody uses it. The World Economic Forum provides reflective assessments, if nothing else.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">It is worth noting that notwithstanding much that is said and written here, the most competitive economy in the world, according to the World Economic Forum, is not the United States, but one of the boring Northern European social democratic countries, Finland. Up there well ahead of us in the top ten are Sweden, Norway, Denmark and The Netherlands. If we are to have a plan that will make us able to be, in the jargon of the day "growth competitive", we would do well to reflect on how those countries conduct their business. They do it with real pragmatism. They have a strong record of trying to find out what works best and doing it, and they have faith in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I do not know whether we need motorways from Dublin to Waterford. There is a good case for saying that we do not need separate motorways to Waterford, Cork and Limerick. That is a second argument. The road and transport infrastructure of countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Norway and The Netherlands, which has a population of 14 million in an area the size of Munster, is very efficient. Any problems this country has in land acquisition for infrastructural development must be multiplied four or fivefold in a country such as The Netherlands, given its population density and size.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I would love the Minister of State to tell us what is the average compensation being paid by the National Roads Authority for agricultural land per acre and what multiplier of the current use value it represents? There was a great kerfuffle when the Minister of State was in another role and then all was sweetness and light. When I hear one half of a conflict suddenly going quiet I smell a good deal for the now silent parties. How much has that cost?</p>
          <p eId="para_393">There is good reason to review the national development plan although I share part of the scepticism of some Ministers about the conclusions in the ESRI report. The problem with economists is that they are much better at analysing the past than telling us what will happen in the future and they make the mistake that foolish investors make of assuming that the past is a good guide to the future. No economist forecast the 1997 to 2002 boom. Some, including the ESRI, forecast fairly good growth rates of 5% or 6% but most economists would have told us that average growth rates of 8%, 9% or 10% over a sustained period of six or seven years were impossible. When this plan was first launched, it looked as if we would have a network of motorways in three years but suddenly everything fell behind, costs increased and went out of control.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">This echoes Senator Morrissey's point with which I agree, that this country does not seem to have assembled the project management skills that exist in other countries. It is worth saying that the small European countries that are ahead of us in the competitiveness league built transport infrastructure, road, rail and other, at a time when they were poorer than we are today. They made a policy decision not to cut taxes across the board when they got rich but to sustain in some cases moderate, and in the case of Denmark, high, levels of taxation. We are not likely to reach Danish levels of taxation but moderate to high levels of taxation could generate resources to build the capital infrastructure that now sustains those countries. Finland underwent a severe economic shock with the collapse of the Soviet Union, as did Sweden in the 1980s but both countries have readjusted. They have not destroyed the things they value, particularly the welfare state. They have adjusted to a new economic reality and have done so because they have managed to continue to invest in infrastructure in the areas of road, rail and human resources. They have some of the best education systems in the world and some of the best health services, although there are waiting lists. I read an article in recent months to the effect that there is considerable controversy in some of the Nordic countries about the health services, because there are waiting lists. As some people have to wait more than six weeks for a major procedure, it is a matter of great concern. Our definition of having no waiting lists is to have nobody waiting more than three months, which is twice that length. Our definition of zero waiting lists is twice as generous and that is one of our problems; our own sloppy standards are those against which we choose to measure ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I have no idea how the national rail procurement agency got the figures for some of its projects. I have no idea how they were suddenly halved and indeed, halved again, when the RPA got one piece of advice about the Madrid figure and another on the Dublin figure. I am sceptical about both figures. I do not believe any more that the necessary expertise and competence exists. It is probably available, but it is most assuredly not being used in this country. The only public body I know that seems to be able to deliver major capital projects on budget and on time, is the ESB. In my wilder moments, I suggest we should engage the whole ESB to become project managers for the country. It seems to be able to manage projects much better than anybody else when it is allowed to and is not subjected to political interference.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">What concerns me in this review is the fact that the instinctive reaction appears to be that since we did not do things very badly in the past, we must therefore stop doing things in the future. Therein lies disaster. I would challenge anybody, whether they are Greens or anything else, to say that we currently have a decent road infrastructure. We could argue forever about motorways here or there, but it is universally accepted that the quality of our road infrastructure is abysmal. When <i>The Irish Times</i> did a little survey on the activities of the National Roads Authority for the last couple of years, it found the most it had done was reduce one journey time by 20 minutes. I suddenly had an insight into how remote from reality that body is because it reacted very angrily and said that the Watergrasshill bypass, quite near to where I live, had eliminated a notorious black spot. I have travelled through Watergrasshill, perhaps 1,000 times, in the past 30 years – driving from Cork to either Kildare or Dublin. I have been held up in Kildare, Monasterevin, Cashel, Fermoy and Mitchelstown. I was never held up in Watergrasshill, yet the body responsible for developing our road infrastructure told the nation it was a notorious black spot. It happens to be 150 miles from Dublin, so perhaps the NRA does not know much about it, but it does not say much for the sort of information on which it is basing its decisions nor does it give me much confidence in its capacity to make decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Quite simply there is still a huge need for infrastructural investment. The solution to our poor performance in the past is not to reduce our investment, but rather to change part of it to investment in efficient project management. I do not care whether this is done by the public or the private sector as long as it delivers value for money. I am sceptical about public private partnerships, incidentally, as we have learned to our cost in Cork, when a €13 million school of music ends up costing the taxpayer €200 million. It strikes me as a very good bargain for the private sector, but not much in terms of efficiency. We need project management skills, cost evaluation and control as well as project control and not a retreat from the necessary investment.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryMWhite" eId="spk_98">
          <from>Ms White</from>
          <p eId="para_398">The publication of the ESRI's mid-term evaluation of the national development plan and the community support framework has attracted much attention. As the Minister of State said in his comprehensive speech, those who take the time to read the evaluation will see that it is a broadly positive account of the plan's performance to date. The resilient performance of the Irish economy in the face of the global slowdown is most encouraging and has surprised many. Our unemployment rate remains at almost half the European average. Some 95% of our people are in employment. While growth has been subdued compared to the standards we enjoyed in the 1990s, we can still derive confidence from our performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">It is clear from the ESRI's report that the NDP has contributed greatly to this resilient performance over the past two to three years. The four key objectives of the plan were continuing sustainable national economic and employment growth; consolidating and improving Ireland's economic competitiveness; promoting social inclusion; and fostering balanced regional development.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The ESRI authors, including renowned economists John FitzGerald and Conor McCarthy, make clear that the NDP has thus far made significant progress towards its objectives of continuing sustainable national economic and employment growth and consolidating and improving Ireland's economic competitiveness. Competitiveness is a big issue at the moment, so it is encouraging that the plan is having a positive effect in this regard. The NDP's underlying strategy remains as compelling and relevant as it was when it was first devised. The research in this ESRI report highlights the importance of tackling our deficit in physical infrastructure as a crucial component in reaching our economy's, and consequently society's, full potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">We heard many negative comments on the report last week. We heard criticism from politicians on all sides. I believe this has masked one very interesting conclusion on the part of the authors, namely that "the macroeconomic returns from investment under the CSF/NDP are significantly higher than previously estimated." This is very encouraging news and it underscores the continuing importance of the Government's commitment to tackling our infrastructural deficit over the coming decade. Expenditure under the plan over the first three years raised the level of GNP by over 7% above what it would otherwise have been in 2002. A proactive and interventionist approach kept the economy in growth. A long-term strategy had a significant short-term gain.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">In the case of social exclusion, the NDP has made a real impact, both specifically and also through the impact of all the programmes taken together. The single biggest item of expenditure has been social housing. The considerable investment in this area has had a major impact on promoting social inclusion and a positive effect on socially excluded groups. A dramatic increase in resources has been devoted to this priority – in 2003 the resources were roughly double what they were in 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The report states there is evidence that the investment in education and training has significantly reduced disparity in earnings, with positive implications for social inclusion. In the case of balanced regional development the evidence suggests that the NDP has made a positive contribution. Without it the regional imbalances we all wish to see rectified would be greater than they are. A good politician has a vision and the drive to implement it. We are not here to be accountants, but to have a vision for the development of the State. When the DART was being built in the early 1980s, there was controversy day and night, as there is now about Luas. Everyone said that only the rich would benefit, coming from Blackrock through Dublin 4 to the city centre. Where would we be today if politicians had not had the vision to build the DART? Mr. Charles Haughey displayed the vision to build the Irish Financial Services Centre and there was constant opposition on the part of the Labour Party to that concept. There is a small minded attitude to many projects undertaken in this State. We are building for ourselves in order to deliver our own future and that of generations to come. I expect politicians to have vision. Naturally, projects must undergo cost benefit analysis but we must imagine where we want the country to go. A lack of vision aborted the railway line from Sandyford to Harcourt Street, a major mistake.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">I attended the meeting of Dublin City Council on Monday that was addressed by the Minister for Transport. He had already criticised the ESRI in his reaction to its report, saying it had not done its homework on Luas. He said that the project that is near completion is significantly different from that in the original plan. At the council meeting he stated that the infrastructure of Luas today is within budget and will be achieved within a three year timeframe. All the fudge and exaggeration of the issue is amazing. There are those who speak in the Oireachtas on these matters without doing their homework first and they say what they like.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">This evaluation is broadly positive. I welcome the dynamic growth in our economy and continuing growth in our population.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_99">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_406">This debate on the ESRI report is premature because we do not yet have the full document. What we have seen so far contains good and bad news on which we should reflect. When we get the complete report we can examine it in greater detail and the Minister of State might return to the House when we have had more time to go through it. The reaction of the Government to the report, however, was laughable, as Minister after Minister queued up to rubbish the report and then the Taoiseach, in his normal style of leadership, undermined his Ministers by saying the report is not nonsense.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">The report makes interesting comments on housing. If the founders of this State returned and saw the mess politicians as a whole have made of housing, they would be appalled that they fought for freedom to end up in this position 80 years later. There is a choice between having two or three properties or none. I have nothing against those who have two properties; they have worked hard and deserve their own home and a holiday home or second property and I admire them. It is totally unfair, however, that we have created a system where people cannot afford to take the first step on to the property ladder because of investors, tax breaks and holiday home construction taking up builders' time. Those holiday homes are often occupied for only one week in the year. In some tourist towns, holiday homes have been beneficial but they have also been an unmitigated disaster in many cases, putting huge pressure on local authority services.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">It is time to reflect on housing policy. Section 23 tax breaks will be phased out within the year. The original idea behind them was to regenerate areas but they have been taken over by investors who have driven the first time buyer out of the market. That person is then forced to rent the house, which he or she cannot afford, so he or she goes to the health board for a rent subsidy, beginning a vicious cycle. We must take on some of the points made by the ESRI about the property market and I look forward to examining this area in depth when the full report is published.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Transport infrastructure is a key area, as it should be when it makes up the bulk of NDP expenditure, but the Government does not have a good record in this area. In spite of his fantastic record in the IFA, as soon as the Minister of State was elected, the Government imposed capital gains tax on those who had land compulsorily purchased for the building of motorways. That was not explained to those people before the election. I have written to the Minister for Finance on behalf of people affected by CPOs and the responses I received are far from satisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The Progressive Democrats are in turmoil in the south-east over the construction of a motorway. Senator Dardis made a clear commitment in south County Kildare during the last general election campaign that if the Progressive Democrats were returned to Government, the motorway from Kilcullen to Waterford would not go ahead. The PD councillor in Carlow, however, is in favour of the motorway, as was the PD candidate in County Waterford in the general election. The Tánaiste is on both sides of the argument. I made a freedom of information request of the Minister for Transport lately and was amazed to find there is no record of any correspondence between the Minister and the Tánaiste apart from general letters referring on other correspondence. I call on the Minister of State to clarify the stance of the Progressive Democrats on the motorway project. Does the party have one? It is split down the middle on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">It has been said that the motorway to Waterford might be scrapped as a result of funding casualties if the fast tracking of the motorway from Cork to Galway goes ahead. The thinking is that the Waterford to Kilcullen road will be the first to suffer. Millions of euro have already been spent in planning and preparing for that motorway, even going as far as signing CPOs for the road. The matter is now with An Bord Pleanála, where it might stay for 18 weeks. Once An Bord Pleanála gives a ruling, the NRA must buy the land in question, even if the Minister announces in December that he is not proceeding with the motorway. The ludicrous scenario would then arise where the NRA would be stuck with land it cannot develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">The uncertainty about the motorway is unfair to those affected by it. In Paulstown, the motorway goes through the middle of a dairy farmer's land but he has accepted this. If people know what is to happen, they can plan ahead. It is not satisfactory that the Minister is fast-tracking some projects at the expense of others. Projects should not be scrapped but we should realise that certain sections of the road network are better than others. We must learn from the mistakes of the past where we built and improved parts of some roads, leaving the rest like a narrow funnel afterwards. We must prioritise building the bad sections of the road network as mini sections to be joined up to the network at a later date as proper motorway standard dual carriageways. The Minister should consider this.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">In the case of the motorway between Waterford and Kilcullen, there are obvious blackspots in Castledermot and Carlow. There are other bad patches between Waterford and Kilkenny. These sections must be prioritised. People accept that the road south of Carlow town to Gowran is a good one and will last for some more years. We should be looking at these in realistic terms and not scrapping or indefinitely delaying projects. When I was nine years of age, I saw the plans for the Carlow by-pass that have never been realised. It is now renamed the outer relief road for Carlow and, more than likely in a few years' time, it will be renamed again as the Carlow inner-relief road because the town will have expanded so much. It is time we put our plans into action.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The ESRI report was mistaken on the group water schemes and the obligations of local authorities in upgrading sewerage and water works. Senators from rural areas will appreciate that local authorities had no choice but to do so. Otherwise, they would have been heavily fined by the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">This mid-term review is a discussion document rather than a full plan. However, there is plenty of food for thought in the report. There should be no knee-jerk reactions and rejection of the criticisms of the document. We must look at the criticism, see if it is fair and see how we can improve the NDP. The NDP is funded by taxpayers' money and is not a Fianna Fáil slush fund. It is important that the money is appropriately spent. As spokesman on transport and a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Transport, I do not have much confidence in many of the State transport agencies. We have had a number of stormy meetings at the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">I urge the Government to look at some of the issues raised by the ESRI report on housing. It is time we reflected on this issue. It should not be an unrealistic aspiration for people to own their own houses. We should be assisting everyone to be a homeowner. The Government has scrapped the first-time buyer's grant and increased development levies in every local authority. The first-time buyer's grant has now been replaced with a first-time buyer's tax. In County Carlow, the charge for planning permission applications has gone from hundreds of euro to thousands.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Rather than chopping and changing plans for the road network, we must stick to some coherent plan. If necessary, we should prioritise building the bad sections of the road network in such a way that they can be joined up at a later stage to complete the project, whether it is from Dublin to Galway, Cork or Waterford. Will the Minister of State clarify why the plan was changed to have one road going from Dublin to Cork with a spur off it for Waterford? What was the explanation for that decision? I am aware that the EU Commission has expressed surprise at it. It will be helpful to all those involved if the Minister clarifies the position.</p>

          <p eId="para_422">It is appropriate to report on what has been already done. The ESRI report is broadly positive about what the plan has achieved. There are some comments about overruns and price increases that cause concern. This gave rise to some Ministers expressing their concerns as they have their own bailiwicks to protect.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Some of the reasons for the overruns must be taken into account. However, there are genuine reasons in many cases. Construction cost increases have been a factor. The ESIOP projected deflators of 6% per annum for the period 2000 to 2002 are 19% cumulative. Serious inflation of construction costs have been a factor. There was also some initial underestimation specifically identified in the Fitzpatrick road evaluation where the 1999 estimated costs were based on a plus 10% update of the 1996 roads needs survey. There was a 10% underestimation of the true costs increase between 1996 and 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The cost of land has also been a factor and not just for the agricultural sector. Senator Ryan was concerned with the deals that were done and why people were so satisfied with it. Senator Browne also made some reference to these. People are reasonably satisfied with the deals because they are fair, taking into account the actual value of the lands and making allowances for the severance caused. Senator Browne referred to farms being cut in two. However, this is taken into account and compensation is paid for such severance. There is a further bonus, designed to expedite the whole process, when landowners conclude the deal quickly. This is working well.</p>

          <p eId="para_429">They are satisfied that they have received a fair deal from the NRA. Concerns were expressed by Senator Higgins about the BMW region and why it has not caught up with the other regions. The Senator will agree that if we were to improve the infrastructure between Ballyhaunis and Dublin, one could start on the Ballyhaunis side with the first 50 km. of motorway. However, this would not be the sensible way. In the first part of the plan, we have majored in working the five spoke wheel out from Dublin. Whether one is travelling from Ballyhaunis, Cork or Dundalk, 50 miles from Dublin there are either recently completed motorways or works in progress. The BMW region will catch up quickly in the second phase of the plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Senator McDowell was concerned for our competitiveness. The recent report on this raises some concerns. He stated that our ranking has dropped from 11th to 24th to 30th place, respectively. I thought he was referring to the Fianna Fáil popularity poll. It really is not funny, but when one gets into the competitive premiership league the criteria are strict. We have lost some ground but we are still in the premiership league for competitiveness. We must watch our Ps and Qs. The successful completion of the national development plan, taking into account the very positive and far-reaching recommendations from the ESRI report, will show that the position we have taken is correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Clearly the report suggests prioritisation of investment based on cost benefit analysis. This may be an issue for the Waterford road considering the prioritising of further investment in the national development plan and the massive moneys that are still to be spent.

Individual recommendations, particularly relating to transport and health infrastructure, need to be considered by Ministers and their Departments. The ESRI is giving the Department of Finance and the Government a clean bill of health and recommends carrying on and keeping a very strict line for future priorities.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_437">I move:</p>
          <p eId="para_438">"That Seanad Éireann:</p>
          <p eId="para_439">– Acknowledges that the price of insurance is one of the main costs facing both consumers and businesses today;</p>
          <p eId="para_440">– Notes that on its return to office in June 2002 the Government set out a comprehensive programme to reform the insurance market and a clear path for the achievement of those reforms;</p>
          <p eId="para_441">– Commends the Government for giving such a high priority to insurance reform in its legislative programme;</p>
          <p eId="para_442">– Welcomes the fact that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) has been established on an interim basis;</p>
          <p eId="para_443">– Notes that in May 2003 the Government approved the priority drafting and general scheme of the Bill to establish the PIAB on a statutory basis and that it is planned to have this Bill enacted before the end of the year ensuring that the PIAB will be operating and hearing cases early in 2004;</p>
          <p eId="para_444">– Notes also that another proposal for legislation entitled the Civil Liability and Courts Bill is being prepared by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform which will reform the law on personal injury actions and give effect to several recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board;</p>
          <p eId="para_445">– Supports the Government's intention to progress the Civil Liability and Courts Bill in parallel with the legislation on the PIAB so that both come into effect at the beginning of 2004;</p>
          <p eId="para_446">– Commends the Civil Liability and Courts Bill for containing a number of very significant reforming provisions in particular the provision that will introduce a requirement for a person to swear an affidavit in order to verify their pleadings in a case so that if a person swears falsely they will be guilty of an offence;</p>
          <p eId="para_447">– Welcomes the Civil Liability and Courts Bill which will provide that if any element of a claim before a court is made in bad faith the whole claim will fail, subject to appropriate safeguards – this provision represents a determined effort on the part of the Government to crack down on fraudulent claims;</p>
          <p eId="para_448">– Acknowledges that this legislation is a commendable effort by the Government designed to eliminate fraud and reduce the costs of dealing with genuine claims;</p>
          <p eId="para_449">– Recognises that such legislation must be complemented by vigorous action to reduce the incidence and severity of accidents, particularly road accidents;</p>
          <p eId="para_450">– Welcomes the fact that the penalty points system, originally introduced in respect of speeding offences, has been extended and will be progressively extended to cover a very wide range of motoring offences;</p>
          <p eId="para_451">– Accepts the penalty point's regime is having an impact on driver behaviour and is helping to reduce accidents, injuries and fatalities on our roads;</p>
          <p eId="para_452">– Supports the Government in its further efforts to reform significantly the Irish insurance market and to ensure that the factors giving rise to high premiums are being addressed as there is scope in the market for both premiums to fall and profits to rise; and</p>
          <p eId="para_453">– Recognises the importance the Government attaches to the attraction of new entrants into the market and supports the ongoing initiative of the Tánaiste in meeting a number of potential new players in the insurance market during the coming months and to ensure that they are aware of the reforms which are taking place and the impact which they will have on the profitability of the sector."</p>
          <p eId="para_454">I welcome the Tánaiste to the House and compliment her on the excellent work to date on the insurance industry. This is an excellent motion and is moved on behalf of the Fianna Fáil party. I hope the House will unanimously agree the motion. Since the Government returned to office in June 2002 it has set out a comprehensive programme and given priority to the insurance industry and significant progress has been achieved. The Tánaiste has given the matter the priority it deserves. One of the most pressing issues is the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. This is an innovative development but it has not received great support from the Law Library which has put up a very forceful case against the establishment of the PIAB. The Tánaiste, who is a very determined Minister, will ensure this comes about. Dorothea Dowling, the interim chairman of the PIAB has addressed this issue at the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. She outlined to the committee the benefits of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. In the report prepared by the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and published in July 2003, the committee fully endorsed the establishment of the PIAB. The insurance industry in general also welcomes this development.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">There has been significant opposition from the Law Library to the establishment of this board as it believes it will affect its members' involvement in the settlement of claims. Bearing in mind that in many cases 40% of damages in an insurance settlement go directly to the legal profession it is obvious that major improvement can take place. There are significant vested interests involved in this issue and they have mounted a strong rearguard action. I have been lobbied by solicitors in County Roscommon who have put forward a case against the establishment of the PIAB. I believe that in the long run they will accept its establishment which hopefully will take place in January 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I ask the Tánaiste to give the House an outline of progress on the legislation. At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business it was proposed that priority be given to the establishment of this board as quickly as possible on a full and statutory basis. It is hoped the PIAB will extend from personal injuries into the area of motor insurance and claims. We believe it will expedite the settlement of claims in a fair and balanced manner and will ensure the cost of insurance comes down.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">We have received many submissions from the insurance industry. Contrary to what was outlined to the committee we discovered that enormous profits were being made by the insurance industry. As the Tánaiste is aware competition in the market is very limited. I hope the development of the PIAB will attract insurance companies from the European Union to the relatively small Irish market. The profits made by the companies trading in this market are very large. I hope the Tánaiste will be in a position to outline, although not necessarily this evening, if there is a possibility that large insurance companies in the EU could provide an on-line service to individuals, without the necessity of them having a physical presence in the State, particularly given the cost of public liability insurance to small industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">With her background in labour affairs, the Tánaiste is aware of the effect that insurance has on the maintenance and creation of employment. Claims are no longer settled lightly by companies. They now fight back and vigorously contest claims. The Tánaiste's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, proposed changes to the judicial system in regard to the settlement of claims, particularly in regard to perjury. Heretofore there was no follow up when people went to court to make false claims, which amounted to daylight robbery. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated his intention to strengthen the law in this regard. I am confident that he will do so and that the legislation will come forward as quickly as possible. I am anxious that this is done. Although there is a tight schedule between now and the end of term, it is time for the necessary legislative changes to be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The innovations proposed in regard to the Motor Insurance Advisory Board represent the greatest change in the ethos of the insurance industry in the history of the State. The Tánaiste has been responsible for piloting through these measures. I look forward to the legislation being passed before the end of this term by both Houses of the Oireachtas. I anticipate that both sides of the House will co-operate to assist the Tánaiste in this regard. She is responsible for the progress evident in the reduction in this year's premia by many of the larger companies. This is a significant reduction, bearing in mind the massive increases that have taken place in recent years and I hope it will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">People are now more aware of the damage done by fraudulent claims. A campaign has been established to ensure that such claims are fought every step of the way. I am sure that Members on both sides of the House would agree that more has been achieved in the past number of years in terms of tackling the insurance industry as a whole than has ever been done before. It would be encouraging if the House would see fit to unanimously back the motion before us, bearing in mind that the report of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business—</p>

          <p eId="para_461">It breaks my heart to disappoint Senator Leyden.</p>

        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_117">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_462">I am disappointed that Senator Ryan will not support this motion. In the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, the Senator's colleague, former Minister Deputy Howlin agreed with the report, which is comprehensive and most supportive of the actions taken by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Both Ministers came before the committee and spent considerable time outlining the many issues involved in this regard. It would be inconsistent with the approach of the Senator's colleague in the other House if the Labour Party group did not support the motion. It is a reasonable and comprehensive motion and outlines the issues in the name of the Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke. The amendments put forward to the motion are not of great assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I, again, thank the Tánaiste for coming to the House. I was delighted to serve in Government with her in the past. While I was in the same Department, I did not have responsibility for insurance. The former Minister, Mr. O'Malley, kindly decided he would take responsibility for that area.</p>

          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_465">I looked after foreign trade, An Bord Tráchtála, the Irish Trade Board, and everything else. That was enough responsibility at the time. The former Minister, Mr. O'Malley, was extremely interested in the insurance industry. The Tánaiste has made it her political priority in Government to ensure that change is instituted in this sector. I hope she will achieve the desired results in this work, for which she has our full support.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">The public views this as a most serious issue. Fraudulent claims are being tackled and a major change is evident. The Tánaiste is responsible for this as she put it at the top of her agenda. I believe she will be successful in her endeavours in this regard and I ask her to ensure that the legislation is brought before the House as quickly as possible. I think I can assure her of the support of this and all sides of the House in bringing it forward as quickly as possible.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_468">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p eId="para_469">To delete all words after " businesses today;" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_470">– Notes that only 20 of the 67 recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board have so far been implemented by the Government,</p>
          <p eId="para_471">– Notes that all other legislation promised has been delayed in spite of many promises,</p>
          <p eId="para_472">– Notes that the Government has so far failed to bring any real competition into the insurance market,</p>
          <p eId="para_473">– And, therefore, condemns the Government's failure to respond promptly and effectively to the crisis facing businesses and consumers in the face of rapidly escalating insurance costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">According to RTE's website, on 20 September 2002, the Tánaiste announced that the reform of the insurance industry was her number one political priority – and so it should be. The problem did not emerge, however, in September 2002. We spent many years before that wondering when the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board would be completed. After it had arrived in the Tánaiste's office, we then sought to ascertain when it would be published. I never managed to figure out why it took so long to put it together and then publish it.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">I accept the bona fides of the Tánaiste that she takes this matter seriously. What has gone wrong is more a commentary on the way the country and the Government, in particular, does its business because it had the resources to do it differently. Almost 14 months later, only 20 of the 67 recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board have been implemented. I would hate to see what would have happened if it was not the Tánaiste's number one political priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The insurance industry has been very good at diverting attention from itself to everybody else. Some of the diversions are legitimate. The legal costs involved in insurance claims are without doubt outrageous. However, some of the diversion has simply been a diversion from its own way of doing things. We should remember that this is an industry which dumped its own ombudsman and refused to reappoint her because she was too much of a champion of consumers. That was not said but the whole world knows that Pauline Marrinan Quinn was dumped by the insurance companies because she was too vigorous in doing her job. Her appointment was intended to be a public relations exercise, not a real advocate of consumers, and when she turned out to be precisely that, they got rid of her.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">This is not a poor and vulnerable industry which was struggling along with marginal profits. It is the nature of the business to have good and bad years. That is why one puts reserves in place. Actuaries get paid so much because they are supposed to work out what reasonable level of reserve is necessary. The notion that exorbitant increases can be explained by the fact that the insurance industry had a bad year due to a great number of storms one winter is a nonsense in terms of the way in which a proper insurance business should run. I will come back to that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">It is worth recording a few figures although it is not often that I quote IBEC or the Small Firms Association. In a survey of SFA members, 76% said there had been no change in their rate of insurance claims from year to year and 15% recorded a decrease in claims. Only 9% had an increase in claims yet in one year the cost of premiums rose by 100%. The Irish Hotel Federation describes the experience of a hotel with fewer than 100 bedrooms in a provincial city. In 2001 its premium was €50,000, in 2002 it was €200,000 and in 2003 it increased by a further 150%. We all know this is happening and we must ask what can be done about it. It is in answering this question that my good friend Senator Leyden and I part ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">It is quite clear that a political priority is not being addressed in the way it should. One of the issues that arises regularly relates to fraudulent claims, which are a disgrace. However, it would have helped if the insurance industry had stirred itself years ago to contest every claim it suspected was fraudulent rather than taking the easy route of paying out and passing on the cost to their customers in the form of higher premiums. The industry did that for years, particularly in the cases of public bodies. Local authorities ended up with massive bills for public liability insurance as a result of claims many of which were manifestly fraudulent. Senator Minihan will be aware of a couple of cases in Cork which involved the successful prosecutions of people who were actually telling people where the hole they could fall into was located. They made a sideline out of it but ended up being convicted. The real tragedy is that everybody knew many claims were fraudulent but the best way to have proved it was via the courts. Most insurance companies adopted a policy over many years of not contesting such claims. If small amounts of the order of €2,000 were involved, it was seen as less troublesome and expensive to pay up. Insurance companies entirely forgot the fact that there are a great many honest, decent people in this country. One company has finally offered people a way in which to tell it about fraudulent claims and has received hundreds of calls. When the insurance industry realised what the public thought of it, it finally dawned on its members to ask the public to assist in dealing with fraudulent claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">This industry claimed to be short of money and to be unprofitable which gave us the impression that it provided a benevolent public service simply because it was concerned about our well-being. I was always a bit sceptical about that position. One picked up the clear impression that the industry was not in business but was running a social service. The lifestyles of those involved in the industry suggest that most of them seemed to do fairly well from this social service. We were told no money was being made, but the truth was that no effort was being made since it was too easy to do things a certain way.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">In recent years two issues have arisen. One has been the scandal of the burden of insurance on young drivers. While some of the cost was the result of the driving habits of young people, much of it was the result of the inability of insurance companies to refuse to shoot at a soft target. The Motor Insurance Advisory Board has revealed the reality that more money was being made from young drivers here than in other countries, which is where a good deal although not all of the increased premium came from.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">It was suddenly discovered that insurance costs were becoming a major burden on businesses. They are also a major burden on householders. I have not seen any sign of a huge increase in the number of houses being burned down, burgled or flooded. Until recently, the incidence of burglary was decreasing for many years although I gather it has increased lately. While most factors were stable and a decrease was occurring in the incidence of others, domestic premiums went up. My own premium increased again this year despite the fact that I have not made a claim on it in years. The reason is not just the inflated cost of building, it is simply that insurance companies feel they can constantly increase premiums. The most fundamental problem is that there is no longer any real competition. There is pseudo competition in that there are many insurance agencies and middle people offering insurance, but they all deal with one or two companies. That is the fundamental flaw and a major issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">A smoke screen has been thrown up consisting of peripheral issues of business competitiveness and wages in particular. Nobody believes the country can continue to pay itself more than it earns, but a contrast must be made with the terrifying escalation in premiums and the expansion of areas in which cover is refused. In my own city there is the small but tragic example of a skateboarding rink for youngsters. It has never been sued or had a claim made against it, but there came a year in which no company would give it a quote and it had to close. Insurers are no longer interested in risk. They want certainty. If we all had certainty, we would not need insurance. If insurance companies are not about risk, they should not be in business.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">This is not a problem that can wait, which is why I am unhappy with the Government's motion. I read the motion carefully and I agree that the price of insurance is one of the main factors. According to the motion, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board has been established on an interim basis which is good. The Government has approved the priority drafting and general scheme of the Bill to establish the PIAB on a statutory basis and it is planned to enact the legislation before the end of the year. There are about four sitting weeks before the Christmas recess. I would love to be told by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that the Bill will be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas by then. The motion also notes that a civil liabilities and courts Bill is being prepared by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is the Government's intention to progress this Bill in parallel with the legislation on the PIAB to ensure that both come into force at the beginning of 2004. A Bill which has not yet been published is to come into force at the start of 2004 according to the Government's own motion. The motion further commends the contents of an unpublished Bill. While the Government has stated intentions, the normal protocol is that we discuss Bills once they have been published. It is not the normal practice for Government to publish the heads of a Bill. The legislation in question is obviously complex, but we are told it will be in force by 1 January 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">Unpublished legislation promised but not delivered does not reflect most rational people's understanding of a number one political priority. This is why the Labour Party has moved its amendment. Despite what people might think, I try to be constructive and to suggest alternatives. I suggest that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment demonstrates that her number one political priority is as she says it is by immediately publishing the promised legislation. She must also give some indication of the real timescale for its enactment and introduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The second issue to be addressed involves competition in the market. The Government is driven by a belief in the market as the best way in which to do everything. The Tánaiste's commitment to the market model is perhaps stronger than that of anyone other than the Minister for Finance and she perhaps understands the market better than him. However, that she understands the problem as well as she does and yet leaves us with something close to a quasi-monopoly, means that no other measures will solve our problem until we re-introduce competition to the marketplace. If that means legislative certainty, which will entice other participants into the marketplace, let us get the legislation published, which we were told would be enacted by the end of the year but which we have not yet seen.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_488">I am delighted to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on one of the most important issues facing the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">I compliment Senator Ryan on selectively quoting a number of commitments which were made. He did not say, and it is in some of the material from which he read, that the timeframe for the legislation was 18 months. We have always said we would have the legislation in place by the end of this year. It will be published next week and, with the co-operation of this House and the Lower House, it is my determination to have it on the Statute Book this year. Since we published the heads of the Bill, there has been widespread consultation and, notwithstanding what appeared in Sunday newspapers, there is no truth in the rumour that the financial resources will not be available to establish the PIAB next year. Without breaching the secrets of the Book of Estimates, which will also be published next week, the resources for the Personal Injuries Assessment Board will be in the Estimates. It is also not true that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has taken umbrage and decided not to back it.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">In regard to his comments on competition, I hope the Senator is not suggesting the Government should establish an insurance company. Until the reform is in place, we will not attract new players. This is a small market of just 4 million people and I am concerned that there are too few players in some product markets – in one there is just one player quoting in the Irish market. We need a combination of tools to drive down the cost of insurance. We need the reforms, which I am implementing through the PIAB, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's civil and courts liability legislation and we need new entrants. We may only need one entrant to substantially drive down insurance costs and I am optimistic we will have that new entrant as soon as the legislation is in place. The indications are that we will have a new entrant, and I believe that will be the case. I will not try to score political points because the issue is way above politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">Reference was made to my former colleague, former Deputy Desmond O'Malley. When he was Minister for Industry and Commerce between 1977 and 1979 he addressed a meeting I attended in certain party rooms in Leinster House when the idea of setting up some alternative to the courts was discussed as a way of reducing insurance costs. That is over 20 years ago and unfortunately, for all sorts of reasons, it never happened. However, it is about to happen sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">The cost of insurance is now a serious issue for virtually all sectors of society. It is not just that spiralling insurance costs are eroding business margins and damaging companies' ability to expand. In some cases, people are being forced out of business altogether because they cannot afford the ever – increasing premiums for employer liability, while many voluntary organisations are having to curtail their activities so as to avoid higher public liability insurance. In these circumstances, the <i>status quo</i> is not an option.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">The Government is in the process of implementing a radical programme of measures to tackle the high cost of insurance. The emphasis is on a co-ordinated set of actions across a range of Departments which will ensure that Ireland has a functioning insurance market in which vigorous competition will ensure a fair deal for policy holders. A fair deal for policy holders will not involve any diminution in the rights of, or the compensation available to, legitimate claimants. Rather, the measures are aimed at reducing costs by reducing the incidence and severity of accidents, reducing the cost of delivering compensation and eliminating fraud.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">A ministerial committee which I chair meets regularly to oversee the implementation of the insurance reform programme. The committee consists of the Minister for Transport, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the chairperson of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board and the interim Personal Injuries Assessment Board and senior officials from the relevant Departments. Representatives from key organisations such as the Irish Insurance Federation, the Law Society, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and others have been invited to attend on occasion. This ministerial team is action-focused and is delivering progress on several fronts.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board was published on 17 April 2002. It is the most comprehensive study and analysis of the Irish motor insurance industry ever undertaken and provides a sound basis for addressing the problems we are experiencing in the insurance industry. The analysis, conclusions and recommendations extend to other areas of liability insurance. The report contains 67 recommendations covering a broad spectrum of activities which impact on the insurance market.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The MIAB action plan includes measures aimed at improving the law in regard to personal injuries, changing procedures governing advertising by solicitors, providing greater transparency and protection to consumers, advocating greater competition in the industry, providing greater information to the consumer, implementing and enforcing the Road Traffic Acts, establishing a Personal Injuries Assessment Board and drawing up a book of quantum to help the PIAB make assessments and encourage negotiated settlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">I am pleased to report the following progress on implementation of the recommendations in the MIAB action plan. Of the 67 MIAB recommendations, 23 have been implemented, three have been partially implemented and 28 are being actively progressed. One cannot be further implemented at present and 12 are under consideration. I wish to set out recommendations of the MIAB which have already being implemented. The Motor Insurance Regulations 2002 deal with a minimum period of notice for renewing motor insurance policies and the format of the no claims bonus certificate, which must be furnished to policy-holders at renewal time. The IFSRA legislation includes the regulatory mechanism to balance the legitimate concerns of consumers with requirements for effective solvency supervision. The Competition Authority has incorporated the principle of acting against the public interest in the Competition Bill 2001. It has also taken on the responsibility, from 1 January 2003, to review all further insurance mergers in the interests of the economy with appropriate reference to the IFSRA and that the process of consultation seeks to protect the interests of specific policyholder groups. To date no mergers requiring review have taken place. The Irish Insurance Federation is at an advanced stage in the implementation of the recommendations relating to it through its codes of practice, which will be published shortly. These recommendations relate to such matters as giving reasons in writing for refusing a quotation, recognising the driving experience of retired drivers who have a record on their employer's fleets, rating policies based on accident free driving rather than risks based solely on age, desisting from the practice of requiring collateral insurance business to be placed with the company before supplying a motor quotation, clearly stating the identity of the insurance group to which the insurer belongs, reducing the number of refusals required under the declined cases committee from five to three, including on the declined cases committee an external representative who will report to the IFSRA and compliance with the provisions of the Equal Status Act 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The IIF and IBEC have agreed and published claims settlement guidelines. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland have amended the Law Society rules to require that all advertisements by its members should state that a lawyer is not permitted to seek a percentage of a claimant's compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">The implementation process is not a numbers game. While all but a handful of the recommendations are being actively progressed, the focus is clearly on the earliest possible implementation of those measures which will have a significant impact on costs and, therefore, on premiums. One of the major recommendations which refers to my Department is the setting up of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on a statutory basis. In connection with the cost of delivering compensation, I refer to the figures contained in the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The board found that motor third party personal injury non-compensation costs as a percentage of compensation costs was 39.5%. Non-compensation costs for employer's liability as a percentage of compensation was 45.9% and public liability non-compensation costs as a percentage of compensation was 56.4% in 2000. These levels are clearly not sustainable and the objective of the PIAB and reforms of court procedures is designed to substantially reduce them.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The Government is fully committed to the establishment of the PIAB, which is already established on an interim basis. On 27 May 2003, the Government approved the priority drafting and publication of the general scheme of the Bill to establish the board on a statutory basis. It is intended to publish the Bill in a few days and introduce it to the Houses this month. This will allow the PIAB to be operational next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The Personal Injuries Assessment Board will process uncontested claims and make awards as appropriate. In the first instance, it will deal with employer liability claims with an extension as soon as possible to public liability and motor. Large numbers of claims will be kept out of the courts system altogether. This will make for a much faster and more efficient system which will cut the cost of delivering compensation to the benefit of all consumers. A book of quantum is being prepared that will assist in the assessment of awards. Work is continuing on the logistics for the operation of the board. A chief executive officer will be appointed in the next few weeks and interviews will be held over the next ten days or so. Premises are being procured. The request for tender for the main IT systems required to support PIAB has been drawn up and published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">By eliminating the need for litigation costs where legal issues are not in dispute, the PIAB will significantly reduce the cost of delivering compensation. The PIAB will also offer speedier assessments to the benefit of genuine claimants. Independent research has shown that claimants in Ireland wait six times longer than in the UK for negotiations to commence on personal injury claims. Some claims will still end up in court and reform of courts legislation is another major area for Government action.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform published the general scheme of the Civil Liability and Courts Bill in July 2003. This legislation will reform the law on personal injury actions and effect a number of the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. It will include measures to tackle fraudulent claims. The Bill includes a requirement for a person to swear an affidavit in order to verify their pleadings in a case. If the person swears falsely, he or she will be guilty of an offence. It includes a requirement that pleadings be full and detailed and set out all relevant information. It will provide for the loss of compensation in the event of fraudulent claims. There will be a provision that if any element of a claim before a court is made in bad faith, the whole claim will fail, subject to appropriate safeguards. It will provide for exclusion from the determination of damages of any income which was not declared for tax purposes. It will take into account all insurance benefits paid to a claimant in assessing damages to be awarded in personal injury claims. It will provide for the reduction of the limitation period for personal injury actions from three years to one to ensure claims are brought forward without delay. Additional powers are to be given to the courts to direct mediation and-or case conferences at any stage, to direct that the net issues in a claim be identified by means of a pre-trial hearing and to direct that a court-appointed medical expert examine the plaintiff.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">The above actions are designed to eliminate fraud and reduce the cost of delivery to genuine claimants. The Minister's aim is to publish this Bill this session and he hopes it will be enacted by the end of the year. The provisions in the PIAB Bill and those in the Civil Liability and Courts Bill must be complemented by vigorous action to reduce the incidence and severity of accidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, will publish a new road safety strategy programme in the next few weeks. As part of the existing road safety strategy, he has introduced penalty points for speeding offences, lack of insurance and not wearing seat belts. Initial indications are that these are having a very positive effect. Ensuring that the penalty points system will result in reduced costs for non-offending motorists is central to the discussions between the Minister and the insurance companies about access to penalty points data.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Competition Authority are jointly undertaking a study into insurance which is examining all aspects of the industry. Issues relating to rivalry between companies and barriers to entry are being examined. If the study discovers anti-competitive practices, it will highlight them so that they can be dealt with effectively. Furthermore, when the above reform measures are being implemented, it is my intention to undertake a campaign to actively encourage more insurance companies to enter the Irish market.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">This comprehensive and co-ordinated approach shows how serious the Government is about the whole insurance issue. Initial indications are that the reform programme is having a real effect. A number of companies have announced major reductions in motor premia rates and more reductions are expected. Reductions in employer's liability and public liability insurance costs, which currently represent a significant burden for business in Ireland, are also expected. An Automobile Association survey published recently shows that the cost of motor insurance has fallen by up to 32% for some drivers between April and October this year. According to the Irish Insurance Federation there was an average 15% drop in premium levels up to September this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">There is a clear need to keep up the pressure and ensure that the critical reforms set out in the Government's programme are implemented as quickly as possible. I look forward to working constructively with this House in the weeks ahead to ensure the legislative proposals to which we are committed are implemented.</p>

          <p eId="para_512">The Tánaiste has delivered a comprehensive statement to the House, which is welcome. It puts on the record exactly where the Government currently stands on the matter and is very useful, as is tonight's debate. I do not doubt for a moment the Tánaiste's commitment to bringing forward legislation. I welcome her announcement that her part of the arrangement will be honoured next week with the publication of legislation. We would welcome the legislation in this House should she choose to introduce it here. It will be a hard slog to get the legislation through both Houses before Christmas but I commend the Tánaiste on her efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">The Tánaiste stated that it is the Minister's intention to publish before Christmas the Civil Liability and Courts Bill and get it through the Houses in this session. I doubt that will happen. It is very comprehensive and important legislation. A key part of the whole programme is to reduce insurance costs, otherwise the scheme and programme of action will not work. It must be given the time required to go through the Houses of the Oireachtas; it should not be rushed and should be given the consideration it needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">This issue did not crop up overnight but it has become worse in recent times. The dust had hardly settled on the 11 September 2001 disaster when it appeared the insurance companies began to tot up its cost. Suddenly at local authority meetings we were hearing that insurance costs had doubled, even trebled in some cases, because of the 11 September terrorist attack. The effect has been extraordinary. People have spoken about the effect on business. We have seen the effect on communities also. Last week I was involved in an arts festival where our biggest cost was insurance. Some festivals, such as St. Patrick's Day festivals, did not go ahead this year because of insurance costs. Community groups are hugely hit. While they are doing excellent work in the community, their insurance costs have become totally prohibitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">I do not know why this is the case. The Tánaiste spoke about competition but I am not sure what she said is correct. My colleague, Senator McCarthy, will deal with motor insurance, particularly insurance for younger drivers. This issue, which is having an appalling effect, must be tackled. I wish the Government well in this regard because what we have experienced in recent years is rip-off Ireland. It is as if one sector saw an opportunity to pass on costs. It appears that at every level costs were passed on, they were also added to. By the time it came to community groups, festivals or individual consumers, the costs were increased. Until we tackle that culture, no amount of legislation will significantly alter the position.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcCarthy" eId="spk_127">
          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_516">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, to the House. I thank the Tánaiste in her absence for attending the debate and Senator O'Meara for sharing her time with me. The House debated this issue in March when the Independent Senators tabled a motion calling for an urgent reduction in insurance premiums, particularly for young drivers. The issue has been debated at great length here. Unfortunately, the level of progress at Government level since then, in regard to motor insurance for young people, has not been at a pace that suggests the campaign is working. While I accept the Tánaiste's commitments in this regard, we are not seeing action fast enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">The Motor Insurance Advisory Board report produced 67 recommendations. At that time we were told full implementation would result in low cost insurance all round. Driving is a necessity in rural Ireland. Unfortunately, we do not have the same access to the DART, rail, taxis and buses as our counterparts in urban areas. Therefore, it is necessary for the young male or female to purchase a car, obtain insurance and drive to their place of work. However, in many respects, insurance companies quote figures which are beyond belief. I was in a house recently where I was shown a quote from an insurance company which was in excess of €3,000. That was an average quote. The driver in this case was able to pay it, but some of his friends had been quoted almost double that amount. That is disgraceful. In other cases the insurance companies do not bother to quote.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">When I bought my first car at 20 years of age, I was told my insurance would be cheaper when I was 21. When I reached 21, I was told it would be cheaper at age 22. At age 26 I am now paying as much as I paid at 20 years of age. My insurance still has not come down to a level which would be reasonably affordable. It is not the case that when one reaches a certain age, it levels off and one pays in line with much older persons. The insurance companies are disingenuous, to say the least, when they give commitments to young persons about their next birthday, or two or three years hence, in terms of cheaper insurance. That is not happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The press reception for the Tánaiste held to announce details of the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board was attended by many vested interests, including representatives from the insurance industry and the insurance federation. In outlining the strategy, the Tánaiste took questions and answers. Following the Tánaiste's announcement, the representatives from the insurance industry said they could not guarantee insurance premiums would fall and were still speaking about profit. In a submission to the Tánaiste's Department, following an invitation to make submissions, they said also that a cost of €500 million per annum was needed for payouts in claims. When this was put to them by those of us and others who had access to the figures and the data produced in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board's report, the insurance companies did not say there was a huge discrepancy in the figures. Dorothea Dowling and her team had established that the figure was a certain amount, but the insurance companies told us it was a different amount, €500 million. The discrepancy was huge. The response was that they were paying into a fund just in case there would be a certain amount of claims. The figure of €500 million was not spent on payouts.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">If we are serious about reducing the cost of motor insurance to young persons we have to take on the vested interests – insurance companies, solicitors and the Government because of the 2% levy which the Tánaiste has already said it will not drop. We must ensure everyone who has a responsibility in this area is brought to order so that insurance costs for young persons are brought to an affordable level.</p>

          <p eId="para_521">I compliment the Tánaiste on her contribution in which she outlined the strategy in place to tackle the issue of insurance. It is true that she set it out as one of her political priorities. I am pleased she is fulfilling that commitment in the way she is moving forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">I am delighted to support this comprehensive motion which clearly outlines the initiatives taking place. Yet the Labour Party tabled an amendment noting and condemning points, but proposing nothing. One can note and condemn all day, but one is not taking action. The reality is that the Government is taking a clear and comprehensive list of actions, as outlined, and the benefits, as the Tánaiste explained, are already being seen and will be seen further in the coming years. It is interesting to note there are consistent calls from our Fine Gael colleagues for debates on insurance and the cost of this and that, but there are no proposals from that side of the House either.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_130">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_524">It gives me great pleasure to speak on the motion. I have a business and I fully understand the great increase in insurance costs in recent years. I have witnessed small businesses closing as a result. There has to be a proper approach to correcting this problem. The establishment of the PIAB by the Government is one strong measure in addressing the wrongs and the spiralling costs of recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">I wish to refer briefly to the culture that has developed in Irish society of fraudulent claims. We all watched the "Prime Time" special. Whereas we may have heard of such fraudulent claims previously, it was astounding to see them and witness what was going on. This is a cultural problem for society. If people are comfortable behaving in this manner, we have a serious problem. People have to take personal responsibility for their actions, which result in greater costs to the community in which they live because of their irresponsible behaviour. RTE deserves plaudits for screening that programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">The issue of spiralling insurance costs is a real problem for business. We have heard from the Labour Party that nothing is being done about it. The reality is that many things are being done about it. It is welcome that the PIAB will be in a position to deal with and process uncontested claims and make awards as appropriate. Initially, the PIAB will deal with employer liability claims and move on to public liability and motor insurance claims. That will happen in the short term and will not be prolonged and protracted.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The statistical evidence available shows that a large number of claims will be kept out of the courts system as a result of the PIAB. This will result in a much faster and more efficient system that will cut the cost of delivering compensation to the benefit of all consumers. Statistics show also that litigation adds in excess of 40% to the cost of compensation and that this has contributed to the high cost of insurance claims. It is fair to conclude that by eliminating the need for litigation costs, where legal issues are not in dispute, the PIAB will significantly reduce the cost of delivering compensation despite the views of certain elements within the Law Library. The PIAB will offer faster assessment to the benefit of genuine claimants. Independent research has shown that claimants in Ireland wait up to six times longer to commence settlement of claims than our counterparts in the UK. I welcome the process undertaken by the interim board to prepare the book of quantum. It is getting the work done and when legislation is enacted, as the Tánaiste committed here this evening, that board will be in a position to move forward and settle claims where legal liability issues are not disputed.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">Regardless of the PIAB, some claims will still end up in the courts. That is the reason there are three pillars to insurance reform. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment looks after the industry, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform looks after reform in the courts and the Minister for Transport has responsibility, and has already taken action with the introduction of penalty points, to try to improve the area of road safety. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has outlined his intention to progress the Civil Liability and Courts Bill which will reform the law on personal injury action and give effect to the further recommendations contained in the advisory board report.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">I welcome the legislation proposed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deal with fraudulent claims. This issue must be addressed. To make it an act punishable as an offence of perjury, where one will have to swear an affidavit in advance of setting out a claim, is welcome. The initiatives being taken by this Government, as clearly outlined and which will be implemented over an 18-month period as promised, are visible. We have had confirmation of this from the Tánaiste this evening. I congratulate the Government and hope it will be supported in this action by all sides of the House. Rather than add insult to injury, the Labour Party should withdraw its amendment and support this Government motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_532">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Aylward, to the House and thank the Tánaiste for her speech earlier. While we may disagree on some issues, we wish her well for the remainder of the programme to be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">This motion is like the long version of the Government election slogan, "A lot done, more to do", which we discussed briefly earlier in another forum. One of the Minister of State's colleagues said this is the lingering influence of de Valera. Some achievements may have been made but much more remains to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">In public statements, all Government spokespersons have set out insurance reform as a leading priority. We all subscribe to that. It has been suggested that the Government will leave no stone unturned in tackling high insurance costs and in creating a type of environment that will make it attractive to new entrants to come into the market in Ireland. We hope that will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">There is no doubt that consumers and business, particularly small businesses, have been savaged by high insurance costs. Consumers have been faced with extremely high household and motor premiums while businesses have been faced with massive hikes in insurance which have caused serious difficulties for many of them throughout the State. Unfortunately, we probably all know examples of businesses which had to fold. Weekly, we hear of businesses, particularly in the manufacturing sector, facing closure or a reduction in their activities because of an increase in the cost of their employer or public liability insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">For an issue which has been flagged as the Government's number one political priority, I do not accept that the Government's progress on this matter is commendable, as the motion suggests. We are faced with a situation where the majority of the MIAB report recommendations have yet to be implemented. Instead of having an increased presence of insurers in the market, we now face the apparent departure of one of the main market operators in the country. Instead of creating a competitive and vibrant market for insurance business, it now seems that the market for insurance will become even more concentrated. Recent media reports which suggest that Eagle Star may leave the Irish market are deeply alarming. The Tánaiste should make it clear to the Competition Authority that she is opposed to Eagle Star being acquired by any existing player in the Irish market. It is not in the interest of consumers or business to see one less player operating in this market.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">What has happened on this issue, which has become the number one political priority for Government? As I said earlier, the Government has been tardy in implementing the recommendations of the MIAB. It has also been unable to tackle the vested interests involved in the insurance and legal professions. There is no doubt that the legal profession has a clear culpability for urging a claims culture that has resulted in high legal costs and excessive premiums for both householders and business. However, the insurance industry is not without blame in this matter either.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business I sat through evidence from the various insurance companies telling us how difficult it was to make money in the Irish market. In their presentations they described the Irish market as unprofitable and unattractive. Yet, just a short while before the publication of the committee's interim report, to which Senator Leyden referred, the insurers suggested that they had made record profits from their activities in most areas of their business in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Many of us fear that there has been a high level of regulatory capture between the Department and the insurance sector over the years. In the same way as problems arose with the banking sector, the Department seems more concerned with prevention issues governing the operation of insurance companies, rather than recognising the consumer interest and welfare. It is a classic case of the consumer coming second to prudential concerns. This is unacceptable and I hope the new regulator for the insurance industry will exercise a more probing and exhaustive assessment of claims, analysis and statistics produced by the insurance sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">The simple and sad reality of the Government's actions on insurance is that nearly two years after the significant public focus on this issue, not a single substantive legislative measure has been introduced to give rise to the concerns expressed in the MIAB report. Similarly, not one substantive report on competition in the insurance sector has been produced by the Competition Authority. Saddest of all, premiums have not come down.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">Profits have increased, but premiums have remained at unacceptably high levels. It is vital that any measures the Government introduces to assist the insurance sector are met with reductions secured directly as a result of savings the insurance companies enjoyed through a reformed market. The Tánaiste has failed to get bankable guarantees from the insurance sector that the reforms being introduced will result in lower premiums. The sector seems unwilling or unable to commit to such a course. This is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">I read in the Sunday newspapers with interest and alarm that there seem to be some differences at Government level over the proposed Personal Injuries Assessment Board. Perhaps, from what the Tánaiste said this evening, these have been overcome. I welcome the establishment of this board and hope it will play an effective and important role in helping to minimise costs. It is vitally important that the PIAB operates effectively and fairly and does not become an additional layer of bureaucracy, nor an additional burden on policyholders. I look forward to seeing the PIAB in action. The Government has spoken of the need for such a board time and again and I know that the Department is dealing with the issue. However, today 18 months after the MIAB report, no such board exists. Again, the Tánaiste signalled that we will have legislation in a week or two.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The true test of the Government's resolve and commitment to this issue will be whether the premiums for business and consumers are reduced over the course of the next six to 12 months. If premiums do not fall, the resulting consumer anger will be visited at the door of the Government. On its record to date, I remain to be convinced that it has the resolve and the ability to secure the savings that are so badly needed in this area. While that is how I feel, I wish the Tánaiste and Government well in bringing about the much needed reforms.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LabhrasOMurchu" eId="spk_134">
          <from>Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_544">The Tánaiste's contribution on the issue of insurance legislation was like a breath of fresh air. Most people, including everyone in this Chamber, realise we have a serious problem. It is like a blight on innovation, industry and community activity. What struck me about the Tánaiste's contribution and her awareness of what is happening in the legislative area is how comprehensive and multi-pronged is the Government approach. There was no other way of doing this because any cosmetic effort would not be welcomed by the general public. There had to be a root and branch approach to this problem as it stood. I always felt particularly aggrieved in the post 11 September 2001 era by how the insurance industry seized on that terrible tragedy to ensure that its particular base would not only prosper, but improve. A voluntary, community organisation with which I am connected, which prior to 11 September 2001 was paying a public liability policy of £50,000, is now paying €130,000. This is only one example; everybody in this House can give examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">I know of many cases where the directors of small industries decided to break up their staff structures and do independent work because they could not possibly afford the premiums that were being charged. In the past these small or cottage industries, employing up to ten people, were safe areas of employment. One seldom saw small industries or businesses going to the wall. The big conglomerates always suffered from world developments and world markets, but now, in every area of the country, small industries are threatened. In the past, they were prepared to absorb certain financial difficulties which came their way. However, the level of increases in premiums they have to bear means that is no longer possible. That is why I am glad the legislative proposals are very comprehensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">We have all received submissions from the legal profession. Some 14 different firms of solicitors have already written to me. I welcome the submissions – I see nothing wrong with it. I am not one of those people who indulges in bashing a particular profession because I believe that some other agenda is present when people head down that road. By and large, I hold the legal profession in the highest regard and it is right to put its case. As far as I am concerned, this is beyond any particular sectoral interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">The insurance companies who were prepared to honour claims in the past on the basis of paying out nuisance money, rather than entering a large claims situation, contributed in many ways to the type of climate that now exists. I remember listening some time ago to Gay Byrne's radio show which, if I recall correctly, broadcast the name of a person who had taken 11 different cases against Dublin Corporation in two and a half years. In each case, £1,500 or £2,000 nuisance money was paid out. This is fine if it only involves one person but if one multiplies that by thousands throughout the country, it is bound to have a degenerative effect on the whole insurance climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">In the past, because the amount of money involved seemed small, we were prepared to accept and condone that practice. I do not believe that is correct. Where fraud is involved, it should be exposed for what it is and I cannot see how anybody could tot up 11 different cases against Dublin Corporation. It was generally the same manhole involved each time. If people are milking the system, they are passing on the cost to the next person, who has to pick up the tab and pay the money. In the final analysis, it is hitting all our pockets and the very heart of our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">It is not part of this debate, but I have often wondered if we should have researched and investigated the possibility of a State-run insurance company. In the same way as we pay tax on our cars, there should have been some method for funding such a company. People might argue that is extreme or would go against the industry. However, as even the Opposition spokesperson said, the industry did not react in time. As a result, it has brought much of this on itself. There is no reason that a marker should not be put down which stipulates that unless it gives a fair service for a fair price, largely where a monopoly exists, the State can step in to ensure that something is done.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">Community activity – this is particularly true of rural Ireland as most people here already know – has been eroded down to the bone. This is for the simple reason that most parishes will not allow use of their halls unless there is individual public liability cover for each use of the halls. Due to the cost and difficulties involved, the halls are closed and are not being used. We should note all the other activities in the community where people will not risk their own assets. For example, they will not risk their own homes or their own money.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">We can all recall the infamous case in County Offaly which involved Muintir na Tíre many years ago. A game of cards was being held in a hall. Unfortunately, an oil heater overturned and there was a fire, but there was no insurance. The first three wealthy people were picked out on that occasion and they happened to be from the farming community. That is one of the classic cases we all remember. I cited that case at a meeting recently and a young lady came up to me afterwards and said she was glad that I had referred to it. She told me her father was one of the people selected at that time. That case was a caution for us all about our involvement in community activity and its inherent danger.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">I welcome the ideas behind the legislation, but there is no choice. I again appeal to the Labour Party and the Opposition to go along with it because, in our hearts, we know something radical has to be done. We also know that if we do not do it, we are letting down the ordinary decent citizen and eroding and undermining community service, the value of which is priceless.</p>

          <p eId="para_553">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, to the House. I also welcome the contribution of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, particularly her promise to act as early as next week on this case. I wish to declare an interest which will clearly show which side I am on as far as insurance is concerned. It also relates to what is happening here because I concur with Senator Ó Murchú in hoping that the Labour Party will withdraw its amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I am a member of the Alliance for Insurance Reform, a grouping of 1,800 business interests affected by the out of control costs of insurance cover in this country. We are the victims in this situation but that understates the position because, as others said, every man, woman and child is a victim as far as insurance is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Big business is in the front line in the sense that it has been hit by the greatest increase in premiums over the past number of years. For many businesses, the increase in their insurance costs has been the difference between them being able to keep trading or going to the wall. For many businesses today, the cost of insurance is a life or death issue. For the economy in general, the high cost of insurance compared to other countries is a significant drag on our international competitiveness, an issue we discussed earlier.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_557">I spoke about it this afternoon. By a happy coincidence, the Alliance for Insurance Reform, AIR, today launched a major nationwide campaign to support the Government reforms of the insurance industry and to ensure that the reforms promised for next January go through on schedule. The Tánaiste told us that if she moves on it as early as next week, we will get it through before January.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">This campaign will use all possible bells and whistles to press home the point. It will continue until the two pieces of legislation that are in the works at present have passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas and are enacted. The AIR is mounting this campaign because it is clear that as the prospect of legislation looms over them, the vested interests are girding their loins for one last desperate throw of the dice. The villains of this particular piece come from two directions. One is the insurance industry itself and the other is the legal profession. Rather like Senator Ó Murchú I do not like to single out anybody, but in this case I am prepared to single out those two areas. Both sets of villains have done very well out of the rest of us for a very long time. Now that the game is up, neither party is ready to give in without a fight. The legal profession in particular has reacted to the setting up of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board with a ferocity that reminds me of the publicans' opposition to the smoking ban. Senator Bohan is not here tonight to have a go at me on that one.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Did the Senators hear the claim this week that the PIAB is unconstitutional? I have no doubt that there will be a constitutional challenge to it before long. That is all the more reason to make haste in bringing the legislation onto the Statute Book. I would love to see it brought before this House next week, as the Minister has promised. Let us continue to remind her of that promise. If there is to be a constitutional challenge, the sooner it happens and is dealt with, the better for us all and for the nation as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Launching its campaign, the chairman of the Alliance for Insurance Reform, Gerard McCaughey, warned that one should not underestimate the legal profession's power or its ability to thwart the wishes of our legislators. He added, however, that the alliance is encouraged by the Government's determination, particularly that of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney and of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to press ahead despite these powerful lobbies. They are strong words but merited in this case. This is another instance of the legal profession acting in the interests of its own members at the expense of the wider national interest. Sooner or later we have to stand up to it and now is the time to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The insurance industry is no better than the legal eagles. It cries the poor mouth as we heard tonight, while at the same time revealing record profits. If ever an industry needed more competition, this is one. Let me give an example that somebody handed me today when she heard this Bill was coming up. It is a letter from AA insurance thanking her for her recent instruction to adjust her policy. The instruction was a change of address, the person in question has moved to a house a few kilometres from where she had previously lived. The AA added that there was an additional premium of €92 due to allow it to clear the item from her account. It requested payment by return of post and noted that the adjustment was a change of address. The customer has moved house and for that the insurer is charging her €92. This is an example of the need for competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">We are slowly moving towards a situation in which new players will be attracted into the Irish insurance market. In the long run, we will pay a proper price for insurance only when the companies have to chase the customers for their business instead of the other way around. We have heard instances tonight of people having to chase insurance companies to get the business rather than the other way around. I want them to be chasing us and looking for our business. I cannot wait for that day.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">One of the ways in which the insurance industry has acted against the national interest has been its attitude to settling claims. We have talked about this tonight, Senator Ryan particularly addressed this point. The industry has always taken the very shortsighted view that it is cheaper to settle even a fraudulent claim than to pursue the rights and wrongs all the way. This attitude has been a major contributor to the "compo culture" that has become almost a cancer in our national life. Small wonder that people have come to regard insurance companies as a soft touch. That is exactly what they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">The easy settlements are incorrect in many cases. One has to prove negligence but it seems that in many of these cases, there is no negligence involved. If someone falls in one's shop or on one's premises, one is deemed negligent and the insurance claim is settled. I have many instances from the past when the judge found against the plaintiff and in favour of the business that was being sued because it had not been found to be negligent.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">It is hardly surprising that the State finally decided that it could no longer afford to tolerate the growth of this culture when it was decided to turn over the handling of all claims against it to the National Treasury Management Agency. It will take a long time to destroy the compo culture that has been created. For that reason, I welcome the provision in the proposed legislation that will force people to face up to the consequences of making a false claim. We have no option but to take that approach to counter the signal people have been receiving for too long that it is no harm to chance one's arm. I support this motion and encourage the Government to persevere with the promised legislation and to do so speedily, without delay and hopefully within the next week. It will speed the day when Irish business and people in general can at last throw that yoke off their backs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomMorrissey" eId="spk_138">
          <from>Mr. Morrissey</from>
          <p eId="para_566">I welcome the Minister of State. The speech made by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on behalf of the Government tonight was one of the most important made in this House since I came in here 18 months ago. It is far reaching, affects every system and should be applauded by all sides of this House instead of being condemned and noted by members of the Labour Party who have withdrawn tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Young drivers, all motorists, householders, and business people especially have been dreading the day when their premium renewal notices drop through their letterboxes. As a business person, I know that the insurance premium is the next highest bill after the wages bill. Over the past two or three years when the economic boom took off and insurance premiums increased dramatically, many companies had to close because they could see no way to continue paying wages and insurance costs. That is why I welcome the contribution of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I am delighted to hear that this Bill will be brought before this House again within a week and that time will be made in the schedule to ensure it is enacted before Christmas in order that we will see real reforms within the next 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">I was surprised to hear a Fine Gael Senator state that reforms are taking place, without accepting what the Government is doing. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, has implemented the penalty points system bringing about massive reductions in premiums over the last six months. Anyone denying that premium reductions are taking place is not living in the real world or is not telling the truth. Premium reductions are a reality in the market place. In a community centre with which I am involved there has been a 50% reduction in public liability insurance this year because we shopped around. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was criticised recently for saying that consumers should shop around but that is the best way to get a price, apart from going back to one's previous supplier. If people shop around, they will get better value. For far too long, the insurance companies sent out their notices too late to allow one to shop around but the new Bill will ensure that people are given notice.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">There have been no new entrants into the market recently because any entrant from the UK or further afield would see what has been going on here and refuse to enter a market with that level of compensation and legal costs. With the reforms now taking place, we will very shortly have a Bank of Scotland-Ireland type of operation coming into the insurance market that will fundamentally change what is happening. Then, as Senator Quinn said, insurance companies will be chasing us rather than us chasing them and pleading for a premium. The Government's response, and the comprehensive Fianna Fáil motion here tonight, demonstrate the radical approach and proactive nature of the activities on which the Government is embarking.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">For far too long we have heard that many issues affecting this economy are global and that consequently the Government can do very little. This is an issue on which the Government can act and is acting. It must be welcomed, not just in this House but throughout the country. I hope there will be all-party support for the Fianna Fáil motion brought before the House to allow us put on record the great work that has been done over the last 16 months and continues to be done to bring us to where we are. Senator Quinn mentioned the alliance for insurance reform. It is a resounding success that the alliance, having been critical over the last 12 months and which claimed that action was not fast enough, is supporting this initiative and will ring all the right bells to see it is activated. The Opposition is out of touch as the main lobby business group in the country representing 1,800 large employers is in favour of what the Government is doing. It is time the Opposition listened and welcomed what is taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">One wonders what Labour Party members were doing when the Tánaiste read her speech because it must have come as a shock to them. She is determined to ensure the legislation is enacted before Christmas. For anyone to criticise that and say it is not action and will not lead to reform and further competition is absurd. We have seen what competition has done in the airline and telecoms markets. We will shortly see the dramatic effect of this new insurance reform Bill, together with what is being done by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, on the penalty points system, on falling insurance premiums. For that reason I am delighted to support the Fianna Fáil motion.</p>

        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_572">I do not believe it is fair to say the Opposition is against the Government on this issue. I believe we are all in favour of it. However, we are concerned about certain aspects of it. That is our job in the Opposition. We are concerned at the perceived slow pace of progress in this area. It is welcome news to hear the Tánaiste intends to publish the Bill early this month. However, there is still no guarantee that it will get through both Houses. As Senators know, Bills are not coming through because there is a massive logjam in the other House. Even if the Bill comes through this House next week or in two weeks time, there could be a massive delay in the Dáil. Even if it goes through there will be a period of time after the board comes into operation when it will not be able to process claims. I admire Senator Minihan for having the foresight to be able to predict how the PIAB will perform, because there is a danger that it could create another layer of bureaucracy. I do not think it will, but we will not know until it is set up.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">There is a real danger, in effect, that if people do not accept out of court settlements, they will go to court. Then, instead of court cases being shortened, they will be lengthened. Unfortunately we will not know that until such time as the board is set up. That is why the Opposition is frustrated, because we feel the Government is moving far too slowly. It is worth reminding some of the Members opposite that this report came out in April last year, nearly a year and a half ago. They are still talking about bringing in legislation. This side of the House will certainly support the Government if it brings forward legislation, as planned, but the sooner the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">Young people are being crippled with insurance premiums. They are also being forced to drive substandard cars. Instead of putting money into a half decent car with air bags and seatbelts in the back, they are being forced to downgrade their vehicles and pay the money towards insurance, putting their own and other lives at risk. We cannot talk about competition in the market until we introduce reform and until such time as we allow fixed costs for different injuries and cases are speeded up instead of taking the normal three years. I am a party at the moment to litigation involving a car crash. Three years on no progress has been made. It is very frustrating both for me and the other person involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">The news that Eagle Star is considering leaving this very small market is worrying. It means we will have four insurance companies instead of five, which would be devastating. Consumers feel very frustrated. A constituent of mine was extremely upset the other day when his wife, who had stopped her car at a junction, crashed on taking off into the back of the car in front. She was literally going at no more than five miles per hour, because both cars had been stopped at the time and were just taking off. My constituent discovered the insurance company had settled up with the lady in question in the other car and had paid out nearly €12,000 in a so-called whiplash compensation claim, which defied all belief. The solicitor in that case got €3,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">There should be an onus on people to prove their injuries. It is totally unfair that someone can claim for a so-called whiplash injury and there is no onus on them to prove it. There should be an onus on people to prove they are genuinely injured and by all means, if they are, they should be compensated. This would eliminate fraudulent claims. As Senator Ó Murchú correctly pointed out, such people are defrauding every one of us and adding hundreds of euro to everyone's annual premiums.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Young Fine Gael is very concerned with this issue. Males under 30, in particular, are being crucified in terms of car insurance. Many companies will not even quote them. The idea of being innocent until proven guilty does not apply in terms of insurance companies. Once they are asked to quote for a male under 30, they do not want to know. They have not time to say goodbye, so anxious are they to hang up the telephone. Hopefully that can all change. We should be doing everything possible to reward safe driving and provide incentives.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">The MIAB report has 57 key recommendations. I acknowledge the Government has made progress on some of the recommendations, but on others they have not. I am concerned that the stamp duty on insurance premiums is 2%. Recommendation 58 of the report said that should be removed. Nothing has happened in that regard. There was no mention of it in the Tánaiste's speech so far as I could see. The legislation needed to tackle fraudulent and exaggerated claims has so far not been introduced. We await it in the near future, but we will hold our fire until we see it, hopefully sooner rather than later. The road safety and driver education syllabus in schools, which is another major recommendation, has not been implemented. Members have raised the whole question of variation in driving tests, failure rates and the appropriateness of driving tests. Overtaking, for example, is not part of the driving test. Unfortunately many car crashes happen when people are overtaking. That is probably the most likely time to have a crash. Neither is driving at night-time part of the driving test, a time when there are also many car crashes. We should therefore question the relevance of the driving test and the huge difference in pass-fail statistics, for example the divergence between figures in Shannon and Cavan and Carlow. I am not sure what the figures say about the people in those counties, or is it a comment on examiners?</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Fine Gael also calls on the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority to publish regular surveys on the premiums charged by different insurers to ensure consumers are properly informed and to encourage competition. To date no comprehensive name and shame data has been published and customers are still being forced to shop around, as the Tánaiste recommended. There should, as well, be an onus on insurers who refuse to offer cover to explain in writing why they are doing so, which is currently not the case. This is one prime area for equality legislation. The whole equality issue has gone full circle and in my view young males under 30 in particular are the current victims of discrimination in motor insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">I wish the Government well on this issue. It is of massive concern to the whole country in terms of public liability. Many voluntary organisations have had to cancel community based events because they are unable to get public liability cover for the day. People right across the board are being crippled by insurance costs. The Minister should examine the idea of insurance companies informing people who are in the middle of a litigation case of their rights. The insurance companies should not be allowed to act totally on their own behalf, without keeping all parties informed at all times.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonScanlon" eId="spk_140">
          <from>Mr. Scanlon</from>
          <p eId="para_581">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank the Tánaiste for the presentation she made. I would also like to mention the work done by the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business on the problems with insurance. The Opposition doubts the commitment on this side of the House to enact the measures contained in this proposal, but my colleagues and I would spend Christmas Day here if I thought we could enact these proposals even an hour sooner.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">Motor insurance is not a luxury for young people in rural parts of the State. These young people are fortunate enough to have jobs now and they need transport to get to work. They have no DART, taxis or buses so the only way they can get to work is by car but the way insurance companies have treated them is a disgrace. The companies said they were losing money on motor insurance, particularly with young drivers, but the Motor Insurance Advisory Board showed in its report that these companies were telling lies and were making profits at the expense of young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">I compliment Quinn Direct, the insurance company that placed an advertisement in every national Sunday newspaper detailing the cost of insurance for young people aged from 18 to 25 years of age. That is the first time I have seen an insurance company in this State producing figures and giving an opportunity to young people to get insurance. The company deserves credit for taking that initiative. Previously, a young person would ring one company and be quoted a price of €3,000 and the next would quote a price of €4,500. There is no set figure. I do not understand why a 19 year old who owns a car of a certain size can receive quotations that are so different. That must be addressed and I welcome every proposal put forward by the Tánaiste tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">I am concerned about the provision, however, that a person must claim within one year. There is no doubt that the fraudulent will have their claims in within a year but decent people who might be involved in an accident might not notice the injury caused by the accident for two or three years. That should be considered because it would be wrong to rule such decent people out if they have a genuine claim for compensation for an injury that was not immediately recognisable.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">With the penalty points system, the Government is doing everything it can to reduce the number of accidents in the State. The insurance companies should not be let off the hook by being handed the names of those who have earned penalty points without a deal being done. Insurance has come down in the last eight months but only by 20% while the insurance companies forget that they increased their premia by 150% in the previous 18 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">I had a telephone call yesterday from a public representative in Drumkeerin who is involved in a community enterprise centre. He deals with a person who employs two people who must close down this Friday because he cannot afford insurance. I am involved in a community group in Ballymote that is providing a children's playground. The playground is built to the highest specifications and the equipment is state of the art. The area is properly fenced and there are lights and cameras. We asked for an insurance quotation and one company quoted us €15,000 for the year on condition that we were responsible for the first €25,000 of a claim. We told them to forget about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Anything that can be done to reduce the cost of insurance is welcome and I commend the Tánaiste on the motion before the House tonight.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_141">
          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_588">Everyone agrees with any measures the Tánaiste or anyone else can take to reduce the cost of insurance. Senators have continually expressed concerns on the Order of Business about the rising cost of insurance. It is a matter of great concern to everyone – young drivers, people in business, those with public liability insurance, farmers and builders. Over the last two years, all these groups have experienced huge increases in the cost of insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The Tánaiste has given assurances this evening and we will support her in anything she can do to reduce the cost of insurance. She stated, however, that she will introduce competition and I would like her to elaborate on that. The Tánaiste, over the last 12 months, has introduced regulations that have penalised small brokerages throughout the State. Each small brokerage must now produce seven or eight pages of regulations and post them to people with whom they are doing business, creating a paper mountain. The majority of these small brokerages are going out of business leading to cartels operating in the industry. Insurance companies now refuse to give quotations to certain classes – if that is not a cartel, what is it? The Tánaiste must outline how she will introduce competition because small insurance brokers are labouring under stringent regulations introduced by her in the last two years and are going out of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The majority of small builders are now going without insurance because they cannot afford the increased costs. The Tánaiste said premia had fallen by 30% but that is hard to believe because all I hear is people complaining about increases. I know from my business there has been a huge increase in business, car and public liability insurance costs. I cannot see how the Tanáiste can come up with a figure of an over 30% decrease in insurance premia.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">Whatever she does to tackle this issue, we will give her all the support we can. However, a lot more needs to be done. The cartels need to be taken on. I would like to know from where the Tanáiste sees the competition that she intends to bring into the market coming and how it will be introduced. The rising insurance costs are a grave concern to young people and business people. There is great hardship facing some of these people. In the past, many business people faced hardship in paying increased business rents. Now, it is insurance costs. When small businesses have to borrow large amounts at the beginning of the year to pay insurance premia, it places a great burden on them. Many small businesses will not be able to pay these large premia and will be left with no choice but to go out of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Different types of business are being affected. Over the years, the small brokerages provided a great service to people. They are now fading away into oblivion and being taken over by the big cartels and insurance brokerages. This has much to do with the stringent controls that have been placed on them. The Tanáiste must look at this too. These were the people who would shop around for small business people and car owners for the best deal for their customers. If they go out of business, is the onus going to be on the private individual to shop around when he might have only one or two companies to choose from? Will the Minister of State ask the Tanáiste to look at the issue of small brokerages fading away one by one and being taken over by the larger groups and plcs in some cases?</p>
          <p eId="para_593">I support the Tanáiste in the work she plans to do in this area. However, I cannot see how premia have been reduced over the last number of months.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatMoylan" eId="spk_142">
          <from>Mr. Moylan</from>
          <p eId="para_594">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, and pay compliment to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Aylward, and the Tanáiste for being with us this evening. The way in which she has been tackling the difficulties that people have been facing with insurance costs is commendable.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">When we look at the buzzwords over the last number of years, the main ones have centred on the problems of young drivers and car insurance. We welcome the statement by the Tanáiste about the matter. I have spoken to many young people who informed me that there are no problems in getting car insurance now. Insurance quotes are now certainly less than they were in the past. I understand the increases were substantial over the last few years, so there is much room for the insurance companies to reduce premia.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Public liability cover is a problem for playgrounds, town parks and community halls. However, they are now able to get insurance and we welcome that development. Some committees for community groups were looking at serious difficulties in obtaining insurance. They are now looking at a situation where they will be able to continue. Community organisations which would have been looking at ceasing activities in towns and villages will now see the opportunity to develop and expand. This will afford them the opportunity to provide facilities for young people who require them so badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">When things were going well, many people paid their insurance in many cases by standing order. They did not realise until after payment was made how much they were paying. Public liability has been a problem for small builders and tradespeople who are giving valuable employment and doing an excellent job when the construction business is booming. They were under pressure in this matter. It has to be recognised that this problem has been faced down and insurance premia are affordable and coming back on side.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">There has been great work done by the Health and Safety Authority which ensures proper procedures are in place in the workplace. A safer work environment for people helps reduce the number of claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">In Offaly County Council, we asked the county manager to publish the list of insurance claims against the council and the amounts that were paid out over the last number of years. It was surprising the number of people who took claims, even in my town, that no one knew about. There was a list of people allegedly falling in footpaths and receiving substantial claims. While the claims were one aspect, the legal fees were at least as much. Unfortunately, this was putting major financial strains on local authorities when finances were not too plentiful. The settling of claims outside court will reduce this burden on local authorities and other bodies. If people are genuinely hurt in a fall, they are entitled to their compensation. In my regional gun club, the committee had to set up a compensation fund to ensure members were covered. They now have a substantial fund in hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">We must also recognise the importance of the penalty points system and pay compliment to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan on that. Driver behaviour has certainly improved since its introduction. We must also pay compliment to the Garda and all concerned in its implementation. The NCT also ensures there is a better quality of car on the road. People complained about the tests becoming more stringent, but so they should be because no car should be on the road unless it is road worthy. If it is not, it should be taken off the road. I pay compliment to those concerned in its implementation. Senators commented on driving tests in daylight and not at night. However, the driving test for lorries takes no consideration of the type of load the lorry is carrying. The test is done in a simple articulated truck with no test on the type or securing of the carried load which is crucial for the safety of other road users. The Department of Transport must examine this and ensure that insurance cover is in order to look after the interests of other users.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Safety statements are important and necessary in the workplace. However, there are a number of workplace locations, particularly farms, where there must be more adherence to safety. Teagasc should be urged to ensure safety statements are in place on all farms, where many people work and many accidents take place resulting in many claims.</p>

          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_602">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, for his presence. I also thank the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Aylward, and the Tánaiste both of whom were here earlier. The Tánaiste advised me that she had another commitment this evening, otherwise she would have been interested in hearing the contributions from all sides of the House on this important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">I have some sympathy for the Opposition parties considering the amendments they tabled. I appeal to them to withdraw these as they are not really relevant. The Labour Party amendment states that only 20 of the 67 recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board have so far been implemented by the Government. Of the 67 recommendations, 23 have been implemented, three have been partially implemented, 28 are being actively progressed and the implementation of at least a further 12 is under consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">At the start of her speech, the Tánaiste made a very clear statement to the House on the progress of the Bill. She stated clearly that this Bill would be enacted before December 2003. It is important that this be enacted and that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, be fully operational by January 2004. Contrary to the article in one of the Sunday newspapers, there is no difficulty in the Cabinet, nor is there a problem with the funding of the PIAB by the Minister for Finance, who has enthusiastically supported the reform measures proposed by the Tánaiste and supported by the Cabinet.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Swimming Pool Projects.</heading>
        <speech by="#MichaelPKitt" eId="spk_159">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_634">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue on the Adjournment. The Minister of State will have an interest in Tuam as it was part of his European constituency for a number of years. I am aware that he received representations on the proposed new swimming pool in Tuam. A pool was built there in the early 1970s. Tenders for the development of a new swimming pool in Tuam have been received by Galway County Council and they have been sent to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. I understand that the cost of the pool and the complex is €7 million. I am hopeful that we will get approval from the Department and that the development of a new pool can begin as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">Earlier this year, essential repairs were carried out at the existing pool in Tuam which resulted in it being closed for three months. This was most frustrating and caused a great deal of annoyance to the people who used the pool. A delay in the Department giving approval for the project could result in the tender prices changing and the development could become much more expensive. I propose that the existing pool be used for community purposes after the new swimming pool is completed. The council worked quickly to carry out repairs on the pool and it is back in use. It is important to have a positive response from the Department so that work can commence on the new pool as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">As I said, the existing pool was built in the early 1970s and it is very much out of date. We need a modern swimming complex in the town of Tuam. The pool in Tuam was built at the same time as the pool in Ballinasloe in the early 1970s, yet Ballinasloe now has a new leisure centre that was recently opened by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. It is time that Tuam also had a new swimming complex. I look forward to a positive response from the Minister of State.</p>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_160">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_637">I thank Senator Kitt for raising this matter and affording me the opportunity to outline the current position on the application for funding to provide a new local authority swimming pool in Tuam. The aim of the local authority swimming pool programme administered by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is to help local authorities to provide swimming pools. The Minister wishes me to recall for the Seanad the administrative procedures of the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">Following the submission and approval of an initial feasibility study, there are four distinct stages which a swimming pool project must complete. In order of progress, these include preliminary report stage, contract document stage, tender and, finally, construction. The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism's technical advisers in the Office of Public Works evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from them. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and is capped at the time of allocation. Grants up to a maximum of €3.8 million are available towards the refurbishment of existing pools or the provision of new pools subject in either case to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or 90% in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas. Support is available to help meet the cost of swimming pools, toddler pools, saunas and steam rooms.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">Since 2000, 55 projects have been or are being dealt with under the programme. Grants were paid in respect of 11 swimming pool projects in Arklow, Courtown-Gorey, Dundalk, Ennis, Enniscorthy, Monaghan, Navan, Wicklow, Roscommon, the Tralee aquadome and Ballinasloe. There are four projects at construction phase in Finglas, Tralee, Grove Island in Limerick, Limerick city and Clonmel. In addition to the 15 projects mentioned above, 40 applications are at various stages in the process. Of these, four have passed contract document stage, 18 have passed preliminary report stage, 13 have passed feasibility study stage and five are under consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Turning specifically to Tuam, the Minister is aware that the swimming pool in the town had served the community well over many years. It has long been recognised that the pool was in urgent need of refurbishment. In fact, the pool was closed recently for urgent repairs. Following an examination of a number of options, Galway County Council decided in December 2001 that the best value for money would be obtained by providing a replacement pool rather than the refurbishment of the existing facility. The proposed replacement facility includes the provision of a six lane 25m pool, a learner pool, a toddler pool, group and family changing facilities, a gymnasium, a steam room, sauna facilities, spectator seating for 100 and an aerobics studio. In March this year the contract documents for the proposed replacement pool were approved. This approval allowed the county council to invite tenders for the work proposed and in mid-October tenders were submitted to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism for approval. This documentation is now under consideration in the Department and the Minister is expected to be in a position to make a decision shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">On a more general level, the Minister is pleased that throughout the country there has been steady improvement in the quality of the facilities being provided under the programme. There is increased sophistication in the applications being made by local authorities and there is a welcome emphasis on sustainability of projects. This trend of looking more closely at the life cycle of a swimming pool and the vital issue of usage rather than simply the capital cost of a project is welcome. The latter, of course, remains a critical factor. It is vital that the promotion of sport generally and the development of facilities such as swimming pools is carried out in a strategic and focused way. This means establishing priorities, avoiding overlaps and ensuring maximum public access to available facilities. The Minister is anxious to ensure that the investment of taxpayers' money by this Government provides value by ensuring that attractive, viable facilities are built. The 2003 provision of €61 million by the Minister's Department through the sports capital programme and €9 million through the local authority swimming pool programme demonstrates that the Government's commitment to sport is being sustained. Since 1998, over €12.8 million has been provided to various sports clubs in County Galway under the sports capital programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism wishes to record that in formulating future policy on swimming pools, officials in his Department have commenced an expenditure review of the local authority swimming pool programme. This review is examining the way in which the programme has worked to date, the benefits which have accrued to the areas in which pools have been built and what amendments, if any, are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme in the future.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Water and Sewerage Schemes.</heading>
        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_161">
          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_643">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter and I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I hoped the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, would attend, but I understand he is ill.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">I have raised the issue of the Castlebar treatment plant to ask how it will be funded. Everyone involved recently received a national development plan document in which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government promised the provision of €5.4 billion for the water services investment programme over the next number of years. The Minister says that in addition to the 41 schemes at construction stage, 367 schemes will commence construction between 2003 and 2005. A further 98 schemes are at planning stage and will commence construction later in the national development plan and 231 schemes are to commence under the serviced land and rural towns and villages initiatives. The majority of those schemes will come on stream in the same way as the scheme at Castlebar. Part of the work at Castlebar has been carried out, but the substantial element which includes the construction of the new treatment unit and the extension of pipelines has not.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">Although I have been a local authority member for almost 25 years, I cannot figure out how this scheme will operate. I have asked the county manager and several other council officials, but no one has to date been able to outline how the design, build and operate aspects of the scheme will affect the lives of people in the town, especially those in the business community. I have reservations about the design, build and operate scheme which will have major cost implications for the business community. There will be no real accountability. Under the conventional system there was accountability to local authority members who were able to address cost issues in the local authority estimates. Once a design, build and operate scheme is agreed and put in place local authority members will have no say. The county manager will receive a bill once a year and local authority members will have no choice but to levy charges across the business community. In this instance, it will not only be the business community which pays, farmers will also pay. The charge will probably relate to the amount of water used and the amount of sewage generated. While there is no way to control the amount of sewage generated, it will be possible to control and monitor the amount of water used by each business premises or farm.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I would like the Minister to outline in detail the way in which the Castlebar scheme will operate and be funded. I would also like to know what consequences will face the business community. Design, build and operate schemes are put in place for a 20 to 25 year period. Once the local authority is locked in to a scheme, there is no way out. Given the multi-billion euro investment proposed, it is time the Government told local authority members and Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas how these schemes are to operate. Nobody can tell anyone how a design, build and operate scheme or, for that matter, a public private partnership will work. I hope the Minister of State can outline to the House the way in which they will operate over the next 20 years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_162">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_647">I thank the Senator for raising this important matter. The latest phase of my Department's water services investment programme for 2003 to 2005 was published last August. The programme provides for the construction of the Castlebar environs sewerage scheme at an overall cost in the region of €55 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">The Department has already approved the commencement of certain advance elements of the scheme at different locations around the town in order to alleviate pressure on the existing treatment plan from infiltration of surface water and to tie in with other improvement works. Last month, as an environmental protection measure, the Minister approved funding for Mayo County Council to begin work on two contracts to extend the out-fall from the treatment plant to a point further downstream where dilution rates are greater. The Minister also recently approved the invitation of tenders for a major sewer, surface water pipeline and pumping station contract. All these works are being procured by conventional contracts, which will see them undertaken mainly by contractors to the council's own specifications and design.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">In accordance with established departmental procurement policy, the treatment plant element of the scheme is being provided under a public private partnership, PPP, employing the design, build and operate model, DBO. The decision to adopt DBO procurement in this case accords with the outcome of the PPP applicability assessment undertaken by the council itself as part of the standard procurement process for water services projects. The assessment, which considered the issues of cost, performance, time and risk in detail concluded that the DBO approach offered the optimum prospect of an innovative, reliable and economical procurement solution. The treatment plant contract is a significant one, involving an increase in the capacity of the existing plant from a population equivalent of 20,000 to 35,000 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The national development plan sets ambitious targets for providing Ireland with a world class water services infrastructure. The Department is determined that its approach to procuring and managing this infrastructure will also be first rate and a number of initiatives are being progressed to ensure that this will be the case. The key example of this is in the area of procurement itself, where the DBO approach is now the preferred route for water services treatment facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Based on experience to date, we are satisfied that DBO best ensures that value for money continues to be a central focus of investment under the water services investment programme. DBO offers many advantages. Single point responsibility for design, construction, operation and maintenance incentivises the private sector contractors to optimise the whole life cost of the project. The use of DBO contracts results in greater certainty in the final out-turn cost of the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">DBO encourages newer technologies which have been shown by other water services schemes to produce significant technical and economic advantages. It gives long-term protection to the capital investment, since the DBO contractor must return the plant to the local authority in good condition at the end of the 20 year operational contract. DBO also ensures a high degree of service during that 20 year operational period, as the contractor is required throughout to meet performance standards which are subject to financial penalties.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">Procurement of the treatment plant in Castlebar by way of DBO will ensure that all these advantages accrue to the town. The procurement of the Castlebar treatment plant under a PPP will not affect the method of financing this scheme by my Department. Capital costs associated with the domestic component will be funded by the Exchequer under the Department's water services investment programme. The marginal capital costs attributable to the non-domestic sector will be funded by that sector, in accordance with Government water pricing policy. The operating costs will also be funded by the same combination of local government funding and non-domestic sector water charges as apply in any other case.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">As a result of the efficiencies associated with DBO and in light of experience to date, it can reasonably be expected that both the capital cost and the operating costs for a given level of service will be lower than if the scheme was entirely procured under the traditional route. This will be particularly welcome news to non-domestic sector consumers in Castlebar who would be liable for the same proportion of those costs, whatever procurement route was adopted.</p>

          <p eId="para_660">It is at the early stages. I attended a conference some months ago which was attended by all the stakeholders. It will ensure that we have a seamless transition through design, build and operation for a period of 20 years. Under a DBO contract, the contractor, usually a consortium which designs and builds a treatment plant, also operates the project for 20 years. The local authority recovers the related operating costs. It does so in the case of non-domestic consumers as part of their water charge and from the local government fund in the case of domestic consumers. We are convinced that, with this one-stop-shop, the project will come in at cost, if not within cost.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morrissey</from>
          <p eId="para_661">I refer to the provision of a primary school in a fast growing area in my constituency. St. Patrick's national school in Diswellstown, Castleknock, has been operational for three years with a complement of 280 students. Next year, because of constraints of space, the school will be able to take in just two classes. The Department of Education and Science must make provision for a site and decide with what method of construction or partnership model it intends to proceed. I do not want to make a big issue of the delay, but it is time the community was given the green light.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_662">I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the current position in regard to the application for permanent accommodation for St. Patrick's national school in Diswellstown, Castleknock.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">St. Patrick's national school is a new school under the patronage of the Archdiocese of Dublin, which opened in September 2001. Enrolments at the school have increased substantially since its inception and the school currently has an enrolment of 203 pupils. The school is accommodated at the nearby old St. Mochta's school buildings as an interim measure pending the provision of permanent accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">Fingal County Council has reserved a site for a new primary school at Diswellstown and this site is the preferred option for the location of a permanent school building for St. Patrick's. The property management section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of the Department of Education and Science in relation to site acquisitions generally, is exploring the possibility of acquiring this site. While the Minister for Education and Science is aware that the owner of this reserved site has expressed an interest in building a school on the site, to date no firm proposal has been made to the Department of Education and Science.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">The Department of Education and Science is disposed towards exploring any innovative approaches or new concepts in regard to the delivery of school accommodation, but will only do so in line with best practice in relation to public procurement. The Senator will appreciate that, in the absence of a firm and detailed proposal, it is not possible to judge the extent to which what may be contemplated reflects the characteristics of the public private partnerships which have already been entered into by the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">In the meantime, conscious of the need for additional pupil places in the Dublin 15 area generally, the Department of Education and Science is continuing to explore, through the Office of Public Works, the possibility of acquiring this site in the conventional manner. The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects and site acquisitions generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">The Seanad adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 November 2003.</p>
