          <from>An Cathaoirleach</from>
          <p eId="para_1">I have notice from Senator Brian Hayes that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to set out her plans for the National Children's Hospital in Tallaght in the context of the recent decision of Government to designate the Mater Hospital as the new national paediatric hospital; and if she will publish without further delay, the overall score of each of the bids in terms of the nine McKinsey criteria established by the joint task force.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Dooley of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">Having regard to the urgent need for a CAT scanner at Ennis General Hospital, the need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the current situation regarding the proposal submitted to the Department and the Health Service Executive on same.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the current plans with regard to FÁS community employment schemes, in particular, the manning of such schemes where some are oversubscribed while neighbouring schemes face closure due to manpower shortages.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to facilitate the introduction of licensed competition and choice in the waste compliance sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_10">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify if she plans to change the current practice where primary school teachers give up five days of their summer holidays to get back three personal leave days; and if she plans to allow paid substitute cover for those days.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_12">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the present position on the Mountbellew sewerage scheme, County Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I have also received notice from Senator Finucane of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the number of houses under council ownership and the number of private houses that will have improvement works carried out in Glenma housing estate in Croom, County Limerick, which was approved in principle by his Department on 14 May 2002, when construction will commence and the timeframe for completion of this project.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16">The need for the Minister for Transport to co-ordinate and plan in conjunction with the National Roads Authority, Galway County Council, North Tipperary County Council and Waterways Ireland an appropriate plan for the Portumna bridge over the River Shannon taking into account the current and future transport needs of the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I regard the matters raised by Senators Brian Hayes, Dooley, John Paul Phelan, Ross, Browne, Kitt and Finucane as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Brian Hayes, Dooley and John Paul Phelan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Ross, Browne, Kitt and Finucane may give notice on another day of the matter they wish to raise.  I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Ulick Burke as the Minister has no official responsibly for the matter.</p>

        <heading>Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy. </heading>
        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_18">Of behalf of the Seanad but, in particular, on behalf of my party, I pay tribute to the late Tom Fitzpatrick who passed away recently.  I note the Dáil paid its tributes yesterday.  He had a brief stint in the Seanad on the Administrative Panel before entering the Dáil.  In every position he held, he delivered on it with great diligence and commitment.  I pay tribute to his time in the Seanad and, in a general sense, to his overall political career.  He was a wonderful example to so many people in Leinster House.  When I became a Member of the Seanad in 1981 he was the Ceann Comhairle.  This was my first introduction to the schoolmaster of Leinster House, as he would have been.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">I recall being very struck by him, not alone by his demeanour and the way he conducted the business, which was excellent, but also by the kindly way in which he carried it out.  He would often seek one out afterwards if he had to be severe with one in regard to a ruling, if one was popping up and down too often, or if he felt he had been brusque with those of us who were about the business of the Opposition, as we were then.  I recall the kindly way he would seek one out and explain a point of order or, perhaps, enlighten one as to how one might go about one's business in the House in a more proper way.  I remember that so well.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">He was kind and meticulous and a really nice gentleman.  I was struck by the way he conducted his business so well.  He gave distinguished service in many areas of public life from his earlier life on town councils, county councils, VECs, and into Leinster House, first in the Seanad and later in the Dáil.  He held many ministerial posts which he carried out with great diligence and respect for the job in hand and for the people with whom he dealt.  I recall being on a deputation from our town council to see him when he was Minister for Transport.  He met us with kindness and respect, dealt with us and followed through on our case.  All his life was devoted to dealing with people respectfully, honestly and in a straightforward manner.  He was a great example of a public servant and of how business should and can be done in public life.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">I also met him in another guise.  Many years ago he was involved in the Cavan drama society — which is where he met his first wife — and when my father and two others started an all-Ireland drama festival, he used to come to it and stay in the Hudson Bay Hotel.  He was out of my reach at that time as I was very young then.  I remember thinking what a rounded life he had, and he had the same in his private life.  He made a lucky choice in his first wife and they were extraordinarily happy, but he lost her and a daughter, Fidelma.  Many years later, having surmounted these troubles and worked through them, he married Carmel.  We were used to seeing them both in this House as he attended his duties assisted by her in every way.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Tom Fitzpatrick was remarkable in public life, because I have not met anybody who has said a word against him.  When speaking of others, people often say they was sharp or otherwise.  Tom was not.  He was kindly, well rounded, authoritative when necessary, conscientious, diligent and a really nice person.  If we could all get the same epitaph, we would do well.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">Tom served his constituency wonderfully.  He represented Cavan and part of Meath at one stage, then Cavan on its own and then Cavan-Monaghan.  His constituents received the same respect and support as he gave to every part of his public life.  It is with great respect and sympathy that I propose this vote of regret and sympathy to Carmel, to his son and daughter, to his brother and his wider family who mourn a very fine politician.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_24">On behalf of my colleagues on this side of the House, I join the Leader in expressing our sincere sympathy to the family of the late Senator and Deputy, Tom Fitzpatrick.  I met Tom on a number of occasions and am well acquainted with his son Tom junior, who was in college with my wife in UCD and who has established a successful career at the Bar following the legal traditions of his father.  It was with terrible sadness we learned of his passing after such a great life and commitment to politics over many decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">As the Leader said, Tom Fitzpatrick served in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  He served not only in this House but also served in the Dáil for in excess of 25 years.  He held three ministerial portfolios during his career.  He was Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Minister for Transport and Power and Minister for Lands.  When he became Ceann Comhairle in November 1982, after the three bizarre elections in such a short period of time, he was eminently suited to the position.  I do not know of anyone else at the time who could have identified him or herself as suited to that position.  Tom was wise, he came from a legal background and had an understanding of law.  He was also experienced and, most important, was respected on all sides.  He was eminently suitable for the position of Ceann Comhairle of the other House.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">As the Leader said, he suffered much tragedy in his life, including the death in 1951 of his first wife and the death of his daughter.  In the past 15 years he had to bear that terrible illness which afflicts so many people but which he bore with such dignity and style.  He was a regular visitor to the House in recent years.  He would have a drink with colleagues in the Members' bar and do his best to remember people even though he found this difficult.  He enjoyed coming back to the House, meeting people and keeping connected with what was going on in this place.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">Tom Fitzpatrick was also a huge figure in Fine Gael, not just in the Cavan-Monaghan area.  At one stage he also represented part of County Meath.  He was a bridge between the modernists and the traditionalists within our party and was utterly respected on all sides of the divide within Fine Gael throughout that very radical period for the party in the 1960s and 1970s.  The former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald regularly required his advice and mentoring because he was a person who was utterly respected by all in the party and was well regarded.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">We remember today his wife, Carmel, his daughter, Geraldine, and his son, Tom.  We thank them for allowing him to give so much of his life to public service.  Someone said to me that if ever there was a county solicitor who cared for all the people all the time, did not fleece them and was more than happy to give them his advice, it was Tom Fitzpatrick.  One wishes this were true of every solicitor today.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">Those of us on the Independent benches wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy.  It is unfortunate that none of us had the pleasure of working with Tom Fitzpatrick so we know him by reputation only, although Senator Norris claims a very remote family connection in the extended family gene pool.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">He gave extraordinary service as a councillor, Deputy, Senator and Minister.  His most difficult task of all — as the Cathaoirleach will appreciate — was as Ceann Comhairle.  He had to adjudicate and mediate in very difficult times which he did with great distinction, winning the admiration and respect of parties on all sides of the House.  This is the measure of the man.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">I knew him only to meet him on the corridor or in the Members' bar.  He was always pleasant, approachable and eager to exchange a few words, and he was interested in those around him.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">As Senator Brian Hayes said, his deterioration in health was noticeable over recent years.  It does not seem that long ago since I greeted him on the corridor.  He made his contribution over more than three decades of public representation in public life.  It is our duty to respect that level of commitment.  We the Independent Members wish to offer our condolences to his wife and extended family and to the Fine Gael Party.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_35">Bhí aithne agam ar Tom Fitzpatrick agus bhí meas agam air.  He was a man who seemed to be able to combine the qualities which meant one could warm to him and still have a sense of being in the presence of somebody who was worthy not just of affection but of respect.  I was a new Senator and I may have been a little loud and brash but I found him a person to whom I could talk.  He was interested in and accessible to new people coming in to Leinster House and he wanted to hear what they were thinking.  When I arrived here first, having been familiar with Tom Fitzpatrick from observing politics from the outside, it surprised me to find that he was not only a less forbidding person than his political image, but also a very warm and sociable person.  As the Leader said, people like him epitomise the very best qualities of public service.  A man with the option of another career, which could have been vastly more lucrative, chose the career of politics and in the process did not make himself rich — as most politicians do not — but a figure of national significance.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">As Senator Brian Hayes confirmed, he was a figure of enormous significance within his political party, which may be less appreciated by outside observers.  Only on reading what has been written about him since he died have I become aware of the degree to which he was an enormously significant figure, who was taken seriously not because he could command 2,000 or 3,000 members, but because people respected the weight of his opinions, the value of his experience and the belief that he had an objectivity and a willingness to consider issues on their merits.  They were the qualities that were apparent when he became Ceann Comhairle, the position with which I most associate him.  He was a Ceann Comhairle of whom people spoke well, which is not always the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">On my behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party, I wish to be associated with the words of condolence to his family.  The country has lost a genuine, in the best sense of the word, public servant.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_38">On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I join with the Leader of the House and the leaders of the other groups in paying a well-deserved tribute to the late Tom Fitzpatrick.  It is notable that he had a very distinguished academic career as a young man and obviously would have been very successful if he had decided to continue in that career exclusively.  However, he made the decision to go into politics, a decision about which the country has every reason to be glad.  It is obvious he had a very long career in public service and that service was, as has been stated, in the best sense of the word.  It is unfortunate nowadays that we are so overcome by cynicism that the idea of public service does not seem to be valued, but is important and he was certainly a model in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">It is notable that he put principle before expediency.  In 1987, he could have continued as Ceann Comhairle, had he decided to cross the floor so to speak — although the Ceann Comhairle does not do that, as we all know.  Nevertheless having been in the Chair, it would have been very tempting for him to continue.  That he did not do so is a tribute to the fact that he had certain basic principles that he held to be very strong and valuable, and that he stuck by those principles.  For those and for many other reasons, it is appropriate that we remember him.  The best tribute that can be paid to anybody in my part of the country is to say that he was a decent man.  Tom Fitzpatrick was a decent man and a gentleman as everybody who ever came in contact with him knew.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">Senator Ryan spoke about respect.  He was definitely held in very high respect, which was a respect of affection and not of fear or intimidation.  I am pleased to join others in expressing our sympathy to his wife, extended family and colleagues in Fine Gael.</p>

          <from>Mr. Wilson</from>
          <p eId="para_41">I join the words of tribute that have been paid to the late Thomas J. Fitzpatrick.  I was privileged to know Tom for as long as I can remember and everything that has been said about him is correct.  He was an honourable and decent man.  While many people did not realise it, Tom was a native of County Monaghan.  He was born in Scotshouse, which is just across the border from Cavan.  He was very fortunate to spend most of his life in Cavan and represented the people of that county.  As is commonly known by many people in this country, the people of Cavan dislike the Monaghan people and they hate us.  The acceptance of a Monaghan man by Cavan people, therefore, is the best honour that can be paid to anybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">He started his political career as a member of Cavan Urban District Council, which he served as chairman for many years.  He was a Senator for a short time, a Deputy and, on three occasions, a Minister.  He was then appointed Ceann Comhairle, the highest position in Dáil Éireann apart from Taoiseach.  As Senator Dardis noted, he had the opportunity to continue as Ceann Comhairle in 1987 but his party did not wish for him to do so.  I do not think many of us would pay attention to our parties if we had the opportunity to continue for another term as Ceann Comhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">I was privileged to know Tom Fitzpatrick for as long as I can remember.  I was delighted to be able to attend his funeral last Thursday and honoured to take part in his guard of honour which, by representing every political opinion in County Cavan, demonstrated the high esteem in which Tom Fitzpatrick was held.  I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife, Carmel, his son, Tom, and his daughter, Geraldine, who currently lives in Cork, as well as to his nephew, Mr. Justice Thomas Fitzpatrick, who is a good friend of mine, and to the Fine Gael party at national level and in County Cavan.</p>

He graduated to the Dáil in 1965, where he pursued a successful and distinguished career as Minister and Ceann Comhairle.  Many other successful Members have followed his example by serving their apprenticeship in the Seanad before moving to the Dáil, which speaks volumes for this House.  He commanded widespread respect from all sides of the political divide, and I often had occasion to meet him around Leinster House both when he was a Member and since he retired.  I always found him to be a thorough gentleman.  I extend my sincere sympathies to his wife,Carmel, his son, Tom, and his daughter, Geraldine, on their sad loss.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 22 and 32, motion 22.  No. 1, statements on the UN Committee's report on progress made on the position of children in Ireland, will be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 5.00 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes each, and the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements.  No. 22, which was not on the Order of Business circulated to Senators over the weekend, is a motion concerning an agreement between the EU and the United States on the continued use of passenger name record data.  As part of their anti-terrorism and security measures following the events of 11 September 2001, US authorities have for some time required airlines on transatlantic routes to supply personal information on passengers in advance of travel, commonly referred to as passenger name record, PNR, data.  The transfer of data has taken place within the framework of a decision by the European Commission under EU data protection legislation and undertakings given to the Commission by the US authorities limiting the use to which the data would be put to protect the rights of EU citizens while, at the same time, assisting the international effort against terrorism.  The European Court of Justice struck down the previous agreement on 30 May 2006 as that agreement only required a Commission decision on behalf of the Community.  The revised agreement will require the agreement of all member states as well as the EU.  No. 22 will be taken on the conclusion of Private Members' business at approximately 7.15 p.m., will conclude not later than 8 p.m. and each group will have eight minutes to discuss the matter.  It is also being taken in the Dáil today.  No. 32, motion 22, will be taken from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_47">I welcome the fact that national Parliaments will have to ratify No. 22 rather than it being left to the European Union institutions, whether the Commission or Council.  Does this measure come within the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or another Department?  I presume it is a justice issue.  We welcome the fact we are to debate it, although I did not know this until I heard it on the Order of Business.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">When the Government first outlined its proposal to introduce the special savings investment accounts, there were two objectives in mind.  The first was to take money out of the economy thereby helping some inflationary problems emerging at the time while the second was to encourage a culture of savings in Irish society.  I have now discovered the Department of Education and Science will tax low income families and refuse them third level maintenance grants on the back of those families having special savings investment accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">I would like the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House this week, if at all possible, to explain why the Government will penalise low income families in this way.  This was not part of the terms and conditions of the special savings investment accounts.  There was no mention of this when hundreds of thousands of people signed up to this scheme.  The very people we need to support will be taxed.  That is unacceptable.  I would like the Minister to come to the House this week to explain why she is introducing this and putting pressures on local authorities to demand that when SSIAs mature, these people will not be able to obtain third level maintenance grants.  They might also lose their medical cards or other social welfare payments.  This is unacceptable and we need some accountability on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">I and my party fully support the discussions in Scotland this week between our Government, the British and all the Northern Ireland parties.  We wish those discussions well.  There have been many false dawns in Northern Ireland over the past ten or 15 years and I hope that when a decision is taken, it will be a bright new future for the people of Northern Ireland.  If ever there was a place which not only needed devolved government but a shared government to deal with the various identifies which exist, it is Northern Ireland.  I wish the talks well and ask if the Leader can arrange statements next week following the conclusion of the talks.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">I do not know if the points raised by Senator Brian Hayes are correct but there is a ring of truth about them and there is certainly much worry in this instance.  If people are to be penalised for saving, it will be the second own goal of this fortnight.  It would be appalling.  We need clarification on this issue.  I hope Senator Brian Hayes is wrong because if it is the case, it brings into disrepute the whole savings culture and will be grist to the mill of those who say spend today and forget about tomorrow.  It will also work against the approach to pensions outlined yesterday in the Dáil by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  We need urgent clarification on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">Growing up we learned much about selling and buying.  If one was to bring something to fair day, sell it at a rock bottom price, see it back on the market half an hour later without even having to feed it and buyers queuing up to buy it, one would not be let out again for two years until one had copped on and learned a few things.

          <p eId="para_54">This is exactly what we have seen.  When we discussed this issue months ago we asked if somebody could point out a privatisation either here or in the UK that has worked.  What is extraordinary about the Aer Lingus case is that there was unanimity on the left and on the right of political comment that this was a bad deal and it has proven to be a bad deal.  We are seeing the same thing happen that happened in Eircom.  We are seeing the company being shoved off at rock bottom prices.  We are seeing huge profit taking, millionaires being created and we will then see asset stripping and no doubt the company will come back onto the market in one form or another.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">In the meantime we are creating a duopoly or a monopoly and prices will be screwed up again so that profits are increased and the consumer pays.  At the end of the day we will try to sort it all out in a couple of years' time by some form of regulation.  It is an appalling episode in management.  We need to discuss this issue, put our views on the table and talk about it.  I do not come from the philosophical position of being anti-privatisation.  That is not what I am talking about.  I am talking about the practicalities and the <i>realpolitik</i>, ordinary people, consumer rights and where we are going in terms of managing the economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">I wonder about the capacity of a centralised government to do anything right.  I do not wish to politicise this matter too much by referring to the Government.  Senator Brian Hayes referred to one issue and Senator O'Toole referred to another.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">I wish to refer to a small matter.  The magnificent new Fermoy bypass was recently opened.  A little bit of fuss was created when some people said they would not pay the toll.  Over the weekend I discovered that a major semi-State organisation, namely An Post, had instructed its drivers not to use the bypass.  They were told to go through the villages of Watergrasshill, Rathcormac and Fermoy town with their huge, big juggernauts that haul mail from Dublin to Cork and further afield.  They were told not to pay the €4.60 toll because An Post regarded it as too dear.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">I wonder whether those in Government talk to each other.  I would have thought it was the function of any public body to implement public policy.  I understand public policy is in favour of tolling and if that is the case then at least public bodies like An Post should pay the tolls and not persecute the misfortunate people of Watergrasshill who have not had a truck through their village in about two and a half years but because of this cock-up and others are now being turned into a rat-run for heavy goods vehicles and loads of cars every morning and evening.

The evidence last week was of chaos, confusion and near-panic for a time because no one had considered this possibility.

          <p eId="para_88">I join with Senator Brian Hayes in wishing the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and everyone connected to the talks at St. Andrew's well and in hoping that the talks will lead to a permanent settlement.  We have had false dawns, but we seem to be close to a final resolution.  We must be encouraged by the facts that Dr. Paisley met the Archbishop of Armagh and that Mr. Adams said last night that Sinn Féin respected the rule of law.  Whether it respected the rule of law previously is another debate, but I welcome Mr. Adams's statement.  It would be appropriate for the Taoiseach to attend the House when the talks are over.  Previously, he was generous with his time and reported to us on the progress made at summits.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">On the radio this morning, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland made a point worth repeating, that is, if people complain about the education system, other services, rates and so on in their own country, one imagines that they would take the reins and run the systems themselves.  It is easy to complain, but it is not as easy to find solutions.  The solutions are in the hands of the people of Northern Ireland.  It is to be hoped we will reach that point and have devolved government.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">The Dáil is debating the probability of an Irish force going to the Lebanon on UN service.  Under the triple lock mechanism, this is technically a matter for the Dáil, but there have been recent calls in this House for a debate on the situation in the Middle East.  The Army has a proud tradition in Lebanon and, while it is a difficult area, it is good to see a contingent being sent there again.  The matter could be discussed in the context of a wider debate on the Middle East or in isolation.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">I wish to support Senator Ryan regarding the €30 million consultancy fee.  We are employing more consultants in respect of opposing Ryanair, the cuckoo in the nest, through the European Union on competition grounds.  Objectively, it is remarkable, having spent €30 million, that there was no forewarning of such an outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">Another issue which causes much concern, both outside and inside this House, is nursing home subvention.  I have been amazed in recent times by the number of people who have approached me who find it very difficult to meet nursing home charges.  It is worth bearing in mind that the last time there was a change in nursing home subvention rates was 2001.  Since then there has been a substantial increase in nursing home charges.  The overall amount of family members' money going into a house is no longer factored in, but what has happened surreptitiously, owing to the current nursing home charges, is that pension and nursing home subvention no longer come anywhere near matching the cost of nursing home charges.  A significant gap exists at present and people find it very difficult to meet the increased charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">I want to hear from the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who has recently published legislation which does not factor in any increases in nursing home subvention rates, what is likely to happen in that regard and to recognise this.  If the Minister came into this House, perhaps we could outline this area which is of concern to us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">To get into a public hospital which caters for the elderly is almost impossible nowadays because the type of categories used by the case assessment unit mean one must be in a very critical condition, one must have had a stroke, one must be old, etc.  One must fulfil all kinds of criteria before one is classified as eligible, yet beds are available in many of those hospitals.  By stealth, people are being pushed into private nursing homes.  That is the future direction and it is wrong.</p>

I was going to call on the Minister for Transport to come to the House to apologise for the Aer Lingus flotation but, as Senator Leyden said, resignation would probably be more appropriate in these circumstances.  There is an unanswerable case for the Leader to talk to her less salubrious successor and ask him to come to the House, not just to apologise for the complete cock-up that has been made of the Aer Lingus flotation but to account for some of the events that occurred because nobody understands why they happened or what was the sequence of events that caused them to happen.  It will be quite remarkable if we cannot get an explanation from the Minister why the Government sold a company at €2.20 per share only for the shares to be bought at €3.05 each a week later.  It is an extraordinary situation and answers are required because this involves taxpayer's money.  The Seanad could do the taxpayer a service by inviting the Minister to the House for a question and answer session about how and why this happened.  Nobody in the country understands it.  Senator O'Toole and Senator Ryan put their fingers on this.  There is almost unanimity on all sides of the political spectrum that this flotation was botched in an inexcusable way.  While they are an easy but justifiable target, there is also unanimity that the €30 million payment to advisers was outrageous.  It was a straightforward robbery of people who did not understand they were being robbed.</p>

People tend to forget this debate is not just about a sport but about an industry that produces live goods and services, employs thousands of people and in which most of the inputs are domestic.  It is at least as important an employer as large companies such as Intel.  I would like the matter to be discussed, especially as the net cost of the current tax break is less than €10 million and the strong suggestion is that when it comes up for review in 2008, the Government of the day might decide to do differently.

The interest accruing on such accounts is being taken into account by local authorities and vocational education committees in assessing the income of parents of students seeking maintenance grants.  As far back as April, people who had not finalised their applications for one reason or another were asked to project the interest that would accrue on their SSIAs prior to the decision of the local authority on their grants.  There is no doubt the local authorities and VECs are being forced to assess SSIAs as part of the income within the guidelines for the means test on grants.  It is a scandal.  We realised two years ago that the then Minister for Education and Science intended to scrap all such grants for third level and we now know that this is a way of hitting back discreetly, as the Minister may think. I am fully supportive of Senator Brian Hayes's request that the Minister for Education and Science come to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">I join with colleagues who have called for a debate on Aer Lingus.  It seems quite extraordinary that a Government that promised us this would lead to competition has led us down an alley into which we will have a virtual monopoly.  In addition, I understand that there are substantial funds — possibly in excess of €1 billion in cash — in Aer Lingus.  Therefore, it is a really sweet deal for Mr. O'Leary as it is almost self-financing.  Some of the advisers are people who also advised on the Eircom flotation.  What concerns me in particular is that Mr. O'Leary is a clever man.  One may not like what he does but he is certainly very shrewd.  He is clearly setting out to alienate the workforce as much as he can.  He is certainly not reaching out to them.  In the weekend newspapers, he said he was going to slash jobs.  He did not say "cutting"; he said "slashing".  That is good management relations.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_153">I support the call for a debate on that matter.  I am concerned about the question of SSIAs.  I agree with my colleagues, Senator Brian Hayes and Senator O'Toole, who have called for the Minister for Education and Science to attend the House.  It would be a real disincentive if SSIAs were to be taken into consideration in terms of educational grants.  It is a kind of Indian giving and it is not on.  I am sure that Members on both sides of the House will remember senior Ministers giving assurances that there would not be this kind of chicanery and trickery.  They said they would not try to claw back tax but if they are now trying to do so, we should know.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">I also wish to seek a debate either on the situation in Darfur or, in the context of what Senator Dardis said, on the role of the United Nations peacekeeping missions.  We have a disastrous situation in Darfur where, in the past week or two, 400 women have been raped.  Villages are being bombed by Government forces in collaboration with the Janjaweed.  Rape is being used as an instrument of policy.  In addition, the African Union mission may be withdrawn, thus leaving a complete vacuum.  These people are being left unprotected.  This is a Rwandan-scale genocide waiting to happen.  On this occasion, we cannot say we are unaware of it.  We know only too well what is occurring.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">A final point must be taken into account.  How disgraceful the attitudes of various nations are that stepped up to the mark, in front of the television cameras, and pledged money for such situations, yet then welshed on those pledges.  That is what has been happening in Darfur where we know people are starving.  European and American politicians said they would give so many millions but they failed to deliver.  They should be called to account.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_156">I join in the calls for a debate on Darfur, which is another case of genocide.  We thought we would not see it happening again in this generation but we have already seen it in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda.  We will see it again in Darfur.  One could spend five hours driving across this country but it only takes five hours to fly to Darfur.  It is important to bear in mind that the world is a global village and we should be debating these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">We are faced with the problem of nuclear proliferation with North Korea joining the nuclear nations and Iran about to do so.  We have already seen terrorists use weapons of mass destruction, namely, aeroplanes filled with aviation fuel.  There is no doubt that we are living in a more dangerous world but we in Ireland can and do contribute to ameliorating the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">I thank Senator Scanlon for providing us with the Department's clarification which was very worthwhile at the time.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_160">On the last point, it is appropriate for the Minister to attend the House.  It certainly was not spelt out at the start, when the SSIAs were launched, that interest on those accounts would be taken into account when people were applying for third level grants.  It is my understanding that in other areas people are losing social welfare entitlements because of interest earned on SSIAs, which is unacceptable.  Clarification of that matter is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">Senator Mansergh raised the issue of the ESRI report on the horseracing industry and I concur with most of what he said.  I fully support the equine sector which is a major employer.  It is also a major recreational product and I concur with the Senator's sentiments in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">Will the Leader contact the Department of Education and Science or the Department of Transport with a view to obtaining clarification on the school bus transport system?  In my area, a number of people in Kilkenny applied for a school bus ticket but a catchment boundary issue arose.  They applied in June and the final verdict was given last week.  They were told that they were within the catchment boundary but their application was now being treated as a late application.  The buses are full so they will not get tickets for their children to travel to school by bus.  We are talking about long distances so the situation is unacceptable.  The Leader should obtain clarification on that issue.  We should ensure that if pupils are eligible for a school bus ticket and are living within a catchment area, they should be accommodated on school buses.  In many parts of the country, however, they are not being so accommodated.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">I compliment the Garda Commissioner on his decision to launch an investigation into the siege in Gort.  I also compliment members of the Garda Síochána who performed very well, as far as I can ascertain from my vantage point, in what was a terrible situation.  I am confident that such an investigation will see that their actions were in order.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">I wish to raise the issue of Garda numbers with the Leader.  On 27 March, I wrote to the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, about Garda numbers in the Garda districts and divisions in Carlow and Kilkenny.  He was not the Tánaiste then, although he has had a great deal of activity in the meantime.  I received a reply on 5 October, seven months later, having requested the information on 27 March.  That delay is unacceptable.  When Members of the House or a member of the public writes to a Minister seeking to ascertain basic Garda figures throughout the country they should get a more prompt response rather than having to wait seven months for a reply.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">I request the Leader of the House to arrange for a debate on the marine industry.  We are a maritime nation and we owe it to people involved in the fishing industry to have such a debate because over the years we have invested quite heavily in the marine infrastructure, be it in piers or our fleets.  We should have such a debate as matter of priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">A serious issue is developing in the pelagic sector.  Fishermen on one or two vessels in the pelagic sector are overfishing and for that they should be punished, about that there is no doubt.  However, as a result of guidelines introduced by the Department, serious problems exist in terms of the pelagic fleet.  This fleet primarily fish scad which is a variation of horse mackerel.  The scad fishermen up to last year were allowed a 10% mix of herring and other variations of mackerel.</p>

This has resulted in an unavoidable mix of herring and other variations of horse mackerel going into the scad and fishermen are dumping hundreds of tonnes of scad, of which 75% to 80% is dead, into the sea.  This is happening as a result of an impractical guideline from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources sanctioned by the Minister in that Department.  It is not workable.</p>

          <p eId="para_172">Hopefully, I will not get a red card.  On the matter of educational grants, I have asked the Minister for Education and Science to examine the possibility of basing the qualification for such grants on net income as in the case of qualification for a medical card because couples and families find it difficult to cope without the benefit of such grants.  Qualification for a medical card has been based on net income for a number of years and the same criterion should apply to qualification for educational grants.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">I support the call for a debate on ethics.  In terms of the recent saga, the real loser in recent weeks has been the body politic.  I would be slow in rushing to introduce further legislation on ethics because it would infringe deeply on people's personal lives and the lives of their spouses and ex partners, as we saw recently.  All we would do by such a measure is turn people off considering entering politics.  We should be careful about that.</p>

          <p eId="para_176">Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of which Department will deal with the legislation on an agreement between the European Union and the United States that will be dealt with this evening.  The legislation will be taken by the Department of Transport as it comes under its aegis.  The Deputy's party spokesperson on transport who has just come into the Chamber will be in charge of dealing with that matter for his party.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">Senator Brian Hayes also raised the matter of the SSIA scheme and the note I have received on that requires clarification.  It states that the amount of income to be included in respect of SSIAs is the Government contribution earned on the savings in the relevant tax year, say up to April of last year or whenever.  The note further states that this is the same position as has existed in the past in respect of similar savings products, including deposit accounts, post office savings certificates, life assurance bonds, etc.  It further states that the treatment of SSIAs is consistent with the treatment of other similar investments over many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">However, the SSIAs were a special savings product to encourage saving and the scheme was introduced for that purpose.  The aspect raised requires clarification and I will seek to ensure the Minister for Education and Science comes to the House to deal with the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_185">Senator Ryan asked if the Government can do anything right.<b>  </b>He said that when the section of road from Fermoy and Cork was tolled An Post instructed its drivers to travel the old route.  This means those vehicles thunder through the villages in that area, which was not meant to be the result of the tolling.  When I travel on the section of road tolled on my way to and from Kinegad to Dublin I never meet a truck; they all travel on the old road.  That is silly — they end up taking the rat runs.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">Senator Ryan also raised the matter of the quality of the advise the Government received.  He asked did nobody envisage the Ryanair spectre emerging.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Senator Dardis wished the talks in Scotland well.  He requested a debate on the probability of an Irish force going to the Lebanon couched, if necessary, in the context of a debate on the situation in the Middle East or on its own in isolation.  I will request such a debate as I consider it is necessary.  However, it is not necessary to debate that matter here as it comes under the triple lock mechanism.  Nevertheless, it would be useful to have such a debate.</p>

The Senator also raised the matter of the nursing home subventions, the granting of which has also tightened.  I know of a case where two pensions go towards the cost of care of an individual, yet there is still a shortfall of €800 in the amount required, and the people concerned do not have the money to make up that shortfall.  The man concerned has Alzheimer's and has high dependency needs and there is the issue of what it will cost to provide for his care.  The level of subventions have not kept pace with inflation.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_121">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_201">I am pleased to be here today to discuss the progress which has been made in Ireland in giving effect to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  I recently had the honour of representing Ireland at the United Nations committee hearing on Ireland's second report on the implementation of the Convention which took place in Geneva last month.  At the time of the submission of the first report in 1998 Ireland was subjected to considerable criticism but on this occasion the atmosphere of the committee was cordial.  The hearing took place last month.  The concluding observations of the committee were published on 29 September last and I am glad to say it endorsed the progress made by the Government on issues affecting children in this country over the last decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">During the past ten years we have witnessed an extraordinary period of change in Ireland.  It has been one of the most rapid and sustained periods of economic growth ever measured in an OECD country.  This wealth has allowed us to make badly needed investment in many areas and, in particular, in infrastructure, health services, education and income support.  The aim of the Government has been to translate our new found economic success into positive social change.  I think everyone will agree that much progress has been made on children's issues since Ireland submitted its first report to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child and it was the extent of this progress which was at issue at the hearing in Geneva.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">The United Nations committee welcomed Ireland's comprehensive second report as well as the detailed replies to the list of issues which provide further information on the position of children in the State.  The committee further noted with appreciation the fruitful and open dialogue which took place with the Irish State delegation.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">I was pleased to be addressing the committee as Ireland's first Minister for Children who sits at the Cabinet table.  This ensures that the interests of children are taken into account in an unprecedented manner across all areas of Government.  The establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children also brings together key Government officials to work in a co-ordinated and integrated manner to deliver the best possible services for children and this was noted by the committee in its concluding observations.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">The committee also singled out for special mention the adoption of new legislation and policy by the Government which improved the lives of children such as the Equal Status Act 2000; the Education (Welfare Act) 2000; the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002; the National Children's Strategy; the National Play Policy and the review of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy to name but a few.  The committee welcomed in particular two key measures which have advanced the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, namely, the establishment of the National's Children Office, which has now been subsumed into the Office of the Minister for Children; and the appointment of the Ombudsman for Children in 2004.  I intend to speak in detail on these issues later.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">The United Nations committee hearings provide a useful opportunity for us to measure our progress and take stock of what has been achieved and identify priorities for the next stage of our development.  As I acknowledged to the committee in Geneva, although there have been huge advances made in the position of children during the last ten years in Ireland, there are areas which need further development and investment.  The United Nations committee highlighted some areas where further progress could be made such as advancing the rights of the child in the Constitution, a continued focus on the issue of child poverty, progressing the implementation of plans for mental health services for children and access to health care services generally.  While the committee supported the changes under way in the area of juvenile justice, it had some reservations on which it sought reassurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">The Government will use these observations to help decide our priorities as we work to improve the lives of children in Ireland going forward.  The Government will not see suggestions by the United Nations committee as stones being thrown, but rather as building bricks that can be added to the foundations already laid in Ireland for improving children's lives.  This is the purpose of the examination process under Article 44 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">As I stated previously, the committee welcomed the publication of the National Children's Strategy, the most significant measure in progressing the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in Ireland to date.  The committee noted with appreciation the over-arching principles of the strategy, the goals set out in the strategy and the broad based co-operation and public consultations including with non-governmental organisations and academics.  It urged us to review progress to date and advance implementation of the strategy with specific timeframes.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">I am pleased to say that a mid-term review has already been undertaken by the National Children's Advisory Council at my request.  Its recommendations have led to the development of a focused cross-departmental business plan for 2007.  This work is well under way and is being led by my Office.  In addition, provisions in Towards 2016 for new structures at national and local level will underpin this central Government level initiative.  Nominations have already been sought for the national implementation group and I hope that the group and the first of the HSE led children's committees will be up and running early next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The committee noted that a number measures have been undertaken by the Office of the Minister for Children to promote respect for the views of the child, including through its work in assisting the establishment of children and youth parliaments and student councils in post-primary schools.  In addition, the office consults regularly with children in its work and is also engaged in re-educating and producing tools to support a wider engagement with children as active participants in their own lives.  I presented a short study undertaken on children and young people's views on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child for the hearing in Geneva entitled  "How we see it".  I was pleased to report that the findings demonstrated that the majority of young people surveyed are aware of their rights under the United Nations convention and are also aware that those rights need to be asserted more fully.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">The committee remarked on the progress made with regard to the collection of statistical data on children, and in particular to the research function of the National Children's Office, now part of the Office of the Minister for Children.  We are adopting a systematic and incremental approach to the development of systems to improve the collection, disaggregation and analysis of data on children's lives.  Reference is made in the State's report to the work already being supported by the Office of the Minister for Children to improve research and data on children.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The most recent social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, commits the Government to continuing to undertake research and data development to assist good policy formulation.  Central to this is the National Longitudinal Study of Children in Ireland.  It aims to provide the database for a comprehensive understanding of Irish children's development in the current social, economic and cultural environment.  It will become a major element of the evidence base for policy and practice regarding children and their families.  Some 18,000 children will be included in this study — a cohort of 10,000 infants aged nine months and a cohort of 8,000 nine-year-olds.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The first phase of this study spans approximately seven years and during that time there will be two data collection sweeps of the birth cohort,  at age nine months and three years, and two of the nine year cohort, at age nine and 13.  Longitudinal data are essential and will inform answers to the questions facing policy-makers and researchers today.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">On the issue of disseminating and making known the convention among relevant authorities and the public at large, the committee noted with appreciation the dissemination of the convention in conjunction with the strategy.  The awareness campaigns of the Office of the Minister for Children, as well as that of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, including through their respective web pages, were also noted.  The establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children was particularly welcomed given its role in promoting children and young people's rights and investigating complaints by children against public organisations, schools or hospitals in addition to its research and policy functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The committee acknowledged and welcomed the efforts undertaken by the State to respond to the issue of child abuse and neglect through the creation of guidelines on reporting child abuse, through investigations of all reported cases of child abuse and through the launching of a nationwide awareness-raising campaign on child sexual abuse.  One of the measures the committee recommended to improve maters in this area was the evaluation of all employees and volunteers working with children.  I was pleased to announce this week that Garda vetting is being extended to all staff, students and volunteers in crèches, nurseries and other preschool services from next January.  Senators will be aware that there has been a steady roll-out over the past few months to huge tranches of staff working with children.  The Garda vetting unit has been given significant additional staff numbers to deal with demands in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">I noted with some concern that there appears to be a confusion in the mind of Members between the functions of the Garda vetting unit and the sex offenders' register.  The sex offenders' register is currently maintained in a paper format at the Garda domestic violence and sexual assault unit in Harcourt Square.  The register essentially constitutes a list of those persons convicted of sexual offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The Garda central vetting unit, based in Thurles, County Tipperary, is responsible for performing child protection vetting upon request from recruiting organisations.  In the vetting process it is obviously vital that any person with a conviction for sexual offences is identified as having such a criminal history.  The key point is that the central vetting unit already has full electronic access to this criminal history information via the Garda PULSE computer.  In other words, the Garda central vetting unit already has all the information at its disposal to vet persons, including full access to the criminal records of persons who have been convicted of sexual offences.  The fact that such a person, by virtue of a criminal record, is also on the sex offenders' register is neither here nor there from a vetting perspective.  Accordingly, there is no requirement for the Garda central vetting unit to cross-check information with the sex offenders' register as the key point is that the Garda central vetting unit will know immediately directly from the computer system that the person has a criminal history involving sexual offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">The sex offenders' register is designed by statute to provide gardaí with the means to monitor convicted sex offenders.  It is not, nor has it ever been, intended as a public disclosure tool.  There are plans to computerise this register as it is currently paper based.  Of course, under the relevant legislation, persons who have committed equivalent crimes overseas are obliged to disclose their existence and their residence within the State to the Garda for inclusion on the sex offenders' register.  I have asked the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to request the Garda to examine whether information obtained in this way can be transmitted to the central vetting unit, since some such persons would not have a conviction within this jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">The vetting requirement is one of a number of measures in the revised child care regulations which were announced on Monday.  The regulations will cover all preschool centres where there are more than three children being looked after.  As well as the garda vetting, preschool providers will have to check employment references for new staff and get references from reputable sources for all students and volunteers.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">The committee also welcomed the establishment of the Social Services Inspectorate, which conducts inspections on foster care and residential centres operated by statutory and non-statutory agencies for children without parental care.  I also reported on the re-balancing and readjustment of services towards early intervention and support for families in order to reduce the number who may become dependent on State care.  Intensive prevention and early intervention community based services which have been put in place include the youth advocacy programme pilot projects and the teen parent support initiative.  I am pleased to report that since 1997, the Government has increased the annual provision for child care services by more than €200 million in real terms and has invested in excess of €60 million in capital projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">The committee made recommendations in a number of areas where Ireland could do better.  One of particular interest was the committee's reference to the need to strengthen children's rights in the Constitution.  I explained to the committee that the power to change our Constitution rests with the people alone.  I stressed that time and again the people of Ireland have demonstrated their strong attachment to our Constitution by rejecting Government proposals to change it.  I am currently engaged in an examination on an Article by Article basis of the provisions of the Constitution as they impact on children.  This work is well under way and will be completed very soon.  I am determined that a formula will be devised whereby the best interests of children will prevail in matters which affect them and which will at the same time meet with the approval of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">While welcoming recent changes in the youth justice system, the committee criticised the decision to make children from the age of ten upwards criminally responsible in the case of murder, manslaughter and aggravated sexual assault.  Legislation, due to come into effect on 16 October, will raise the age of criminal responsibility from seven to 12 in all but the most serious cases of murder, rape and aggravated sexual assault and will contain a number of protections for all offenders.  However, I wish to make it clear that proceedings against children between ten and 14 years will require the consent of the DPP and the courts will have the power to dismiss a case against a child under 14 years, where it determines that the child did not have a full understanding of what was involved in the commission of the offence.  Furthermore, it is very unusual for these offences to be committed by children.  Nonetheless, it is my firm view that victims of these most serious of offences must be assured that justice is seen to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">It would not be possible to cover all of the issues raised by the committee, but I hope I have given Members a sense of the recommendations.  The committee clearly acknowledged the progress made for children in Ireland over the past decade and acknowledged that children and young people are higher on the Government agenda than ever before.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">We can make improvements and the UN committee's recommendations will inform our priorities for children in the future.  The process of reporting progress and benchmarking where we are with regard to improving children's lives is useful and keeps a focus on the goal that Government, non-statutory bodies and parents all desire — a successful and happy childhood for our children.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_227">I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House and wish him well in his new job where much progress has been made.  There is always change in politics, but this area is changing at a rapid rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">While the Minister of State was speaking, I was thinking his departmental responsibilities could be divided into three sections, infants, children and adolescents.  Each of these areas requires its own legislation and expertise.  While much work has been done, there are gaps in the service.  I hope the Minister of State will take my point on board as something constructive rather than critical.  I put a question to the Minister for Education and Science during the summer and was amazed to learn that 1,800 children were unaccounted for after leaving primary school over the past four years.  There was no account of where these children were once they left primary school.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Another issue of concern is the delay that often exists in bringing cases of sexual abuse to court.  I am aware of some of these in my area.  It is not good that children who have suffered sexual abuse who face the trauma of a court case sometimes see the perpetrator of the crime walking about their town or village and appearing to get away with their crime.  We need more speed in bringing these cases to court.  Gardaí are often frustrated in this regard also as they are doing their best to bring forward prosecutions and to present the book of evidence.  This should not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">The Office of the Minister for Children must consider beefing-up or strengthening the role of the Ombudsman for Children.  The ombudsman attended the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children recently, but it appears her powers are quite weak.  It is time to move on to phase 2 and strengthen her powers so that she can investigate areas where we fail children.  It is a major weakness of the role that the ombudsman cannot investigate areas where the State does not provide services.  A significant gap exists which needs to be filled, otherwise it is pointless having an ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">The National Educational Psychological Service has been withdrawn from many schools and some schools have received only a fraction of their allocated hours compared to last year.  This is not satisfactory as it leads to long waiting lists for speech and language therapy or to see a behavioural psychologist.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">I refer to a case from my constituency where an 18 year old girl has threatened to kill her mother.  She was sentenced to six months in Mountjoy Prison.  There is no help for that girl or her mother.  It is a question of passing the parcel and nobody is taking responsibility or is being held accountable.  The mother is terrified of what will happen when her daughter is released from prison.  I am aware of a case where an 11 year old daughter is almost as bad and has threatened to kill her mother while she is sleeping.  Such adolescents require help, in particular those in the 15 to 18 year category who are too young to be put in residential units and are too old to be in paediatric units.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">The report refers to the lack of detailed information.  When the issue of suicide was recently considered by the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, we discovered there is no information available for adolescents about waiting times for psychiatric services. The report states that there may be 100,000 more 15 to 17 year olds in the population in three or four years' time.  It is a case of constantly playing catch-up.  It is vital that the Department plans ahead and is proactive rather than merely acting in a reactive fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">A total of 40,000 non-national children are resident in the country, many of whom are in urban areas.  Their presence presents many challenges in schools including language barriers.  Resources to help those children and their teachers must be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">It is unfortunate that Ireland features as top of the list in many areas such as in alcohol and drug abuse.  In the period 1995 to 2003, there has been a 10% jump in the number of children who have drank five or more drinks in a row.  We have made progress in the wrong direction in those eight years.  Ireland is one of the top three countries in Europe with regard to alcohol consumption and among the top five European countries where children use illicit drugs other than marijuana.  Much progress has been made but there is a lot more work to do.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_125">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_236">I thank Senator Browne for sharing his time with Senator Terry and  me.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power and previously, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan and their officials, to the House. It is important that we now have a Minister of State, albeit at the high chair, around the Cabinet table, who is fully responsible for the area of child welfare which involves up to five different Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power to investigate an issue of concern to me.  Orphans being cared for by family members or friends are in receipt of an orphan's benefit and a medical card.  However, because it is a means tested benefit, I know of an orphan who has not been granted the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  I ask the Minister of State to direct all health boards to grant a clothing and footwear allowance as of right to the families caring for orphans.  If a medical card is granted as of right, a clothing and footwear allowance should be also granted.  The number of orphans is quite small.  They are a special group of people and the State should do everything in its power to ensure their childhood is made as easy as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">I wish to speak about the issue of foster families and the rights both of the child in care and of the natural parents.  A demonstration took place recently outside Leinster House by a group of parents who believe their voice has been ignored.  They are parents whose children have been taken from them and put into care.  The Minister of State will be aware that close to 600 children are in care.  I commend the foster families who do marvellous work.  However the Child Care Act 1991 is clear that it is in the child's best interests that a child be brought up by its natural parents.  Some parents are concerned that their voices are being ignored and that there are insufficient support services for families.  Many families have been unable to cope with their housing and financial problems.  Much more support is required for the parents of these children who dearly wish to take their children back home to live in a normal and natural environment as set out in the legislation and for which we are all responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">I ask the Minister of State to deal in his reply with the issue of assessment.  It is right and proper that assessment should take place on an ongoing basis, at the very least every six months, to ensure the parent or parents of the child have got back on their feet and are able to care for the child.  However, many assessments are taking place only on an annual basis.  This is wrong and it is in breach of the UN charter.  Children have a right to grow up in their natural environment and to be brought up by their mothers and fathers.  It must be ensured that assessment occurs on a regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Another issue raised during the recent demonstration was the need for consistency among social workers and judges.  It is utterly wrong to have different judges in the Family Court dealing with the same case every time it appears.  It is equally wrong for a case to be dealt with by different teams of social workers.  The voice of the parent whose child is in care needs to be recognised.  Many are concerned at the lack of consistency among social workers and in the Family Court when it comes to ensuring the voice of the natural parent is heard.  It is a difficult situation and there is no doubt the courts is the right place to determine whether a child should be in care.  I ask the State to be aware that international commitments on assessment and consistency should be upheld and to ensure the voice of the natural parents is heard in the court setting and in the assessment setting.  These parents do not believe this is happening.</p>

        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_126">
          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_241">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I thank Senator Browne for sharing his time.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on his work and that of his Department.  It was very necessary that such a ministry be provided to co-ordinate all the services for children.  The UN report states that further co-ordination of services is necessary and I would welcome further work on this aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">I acknowledge that much has been done and the report compliments Ireland in many areas.  However, much more needs to be done.  This is a glib saying but we are still playing catch-up in many areas.  In this day and age in Ireland, some children are still living in poverty and some children are still in overcrowded classrooms.  As the UN report pointed out, they are in classrooms where many of the facilities and materials are being provided by the parents because we are not providing sufficient funding to allow schools — primary schools in particular — to function at the desired level.  They lack the necessary funding to provide all the materials they need.  We should not be dependent on parents to provide that funding.  The very parents who cannot afford it have children who need those essential tools in a school.  Those parents should not be asked for money to provide necessary classroom tools.  That is an area of concern that has been highlighted.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">Likewise, the report highlighted that we are playing catch-up in regard to our recreational and play facilities for children.  I recognise what the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has done in bringing about the report.  However, while we can write aspirational reports outlining our plans, difficulty is met locally when attempts are made to introduce playgrounds.  We are also considerably behind in the area of school gymnasiums.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">The report also expressed concerns about the children of immigrants.  We have a new challenge to ensure they are fully integrated into the community and are given the resources needed to improve their English.  Children with disabilities and Traveller children are also referred to, and we are playing catch-up with respect to them as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">I am concerned about children in care and especially children who leave care centres.  Who is responsible for young people who leave such a care institution?  The report highlights this problem which needs to be given attention.  Reference was also made to how we deal with young people of 16 or 17 who get into trouble and who are sent to prison or St. Patrick's Institution where no educational facilities are provided for them, which is disgraceful.  There are so many areas in which we need to improve.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, mentioned that the social services inspectorate that visits care centres and places of detention for young people has been established, which is true.  However, I would like to see this put on a statutory basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">Overcrowding in our schools really needs to be tackled.  With our increasing population, even for a child to get into a school is a problem.  While I welcome the report, it contains much of which we need to take heed and on which we need to work urgently to ensure that the next generation will be provided for.  In particular, priority should be given to disadvantaged children.</p>

        <speech by="#CamillusGlynn" eId="spk_129">
          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_251">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the progress report on the position of children in Ireland.  While I agree with Senator Terry that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, needs to be complimented on his work, it does not matter in what chair the Minister of State sits at the Cabinet table, whether it is high or low, the Senator can rest assured that his two feet are on the ground.  He is an individual gifted with a large amount of common sense, which has been reflected in his work since he became responsible for the area of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">Until recently there was a fragmented approach to children's issues.  It is important that not only should those issues be tackled in the manner in which they have been, but also that children's views should be canvassed and heard.  In that context, I compliment Westmeath County Council and Mr. Gerry Sheridan, who organised the election of the junior county council in Westmeath, which is an important forum at which young people can give their views on many issues that affect them and society in general.  Young people give an unjaundiced view.  They will often say things we do not want to hear.  Whether we like them or not, those are their views expressed in a clear and unambiguous manner and they should be heard and evaluated.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">For the first time in our history we have an Office of the Minister for Children and a Minister of State with responsibility for the area, Deputy Brian Lenihan, at the Cabinet table.  This means that the interests of children are taken into account in an unprecedented manner across all areas of Government.  Key Government officials have been brought together in the Office of the Minister for Children to work in a co-ordinated and integrated way to deliver the best possible results for children.  To this end the staff working in child care, child welfare and child protection from the National Children's Office are amalgamated to form the Office of the Minister for Children and deliver better outcomes for children.  Furthermore, staff working in areas of youth justice and education for early years in the Department of Education and Science will be relocated to the Office of the Minister for Children to provide a joined-up Government approach to the development of policy and delivery of services for children and to put a halt to the fragmented approach that existed heretofore in the provision of children's services.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">It is accepted that this job is by no means complete and there is no room for complacency.  However, real progress has been made, as the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has highlighted both today and when he appeared before the United Nations committee last month.  The national children's strategy was published in 2000, following extensive consultation with children, organisations and individuals, with the objective of providing care and support for children and young people.  The strategy is widely respected and supported as a blueprint for improving the lives of all children, especially those who experience disadvantage or have particular needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">On the Order of Business, a Senator made a request regarding mental health services for the young.  Many areas of the country are served by a very good child and adolescent psychiatry service.  However, that service needs to be expanded significantly.  The midlands have the advantage of having a child and adolescent psychiatry service.  The appointment of an Ombudsman for Children has been a significant acknowledgement that children and young people have the same rights as adults to efficient and reliable public services.  Great strides have been made in education in recent years, the figures on which were highlighted by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in his contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">There should be no hiding place for those who abuse children, especially in a sexual manner.  Every member of society must be cast in the role of whistle-blower to identify such people and have them brought to justice.  Justice needs to be seen to be done by the young people who have been the subject of their hideous and undesired attentions so that those young people can have belief in society and the justice system.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has issued an edict on fireworks.  Fireworks are enjoyed by many people and although they are governed by regulation and legislation, some people, for their own selfish ends, will put those fireworks in the hands of very young children.  In my town, Mullingar, serious injuries have been sustained, including one by the son of a member of staff of Westmeath County Council.  I use this platform to remind parents and the powers that be, especially the Garda, in this regard.  In recent nights fireworks have been set off in Mullingar, much to the discomfort of my dogs and, I am sure, older people who want to get their sleep.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Since 2002, an additional 4,000 teachers have been appointed, an issue highlighted by Senator Terry.  Significant strides have been made in the area of education in terms of providing extra support to children with special needs, with an emphasis on those from disadvantaged areas or who need extra help in learning English.  The large number of immigrants who are now in Ireland are welcome for the contributions they make to the economy.  This morning, a construction contractor based in Mullingar told me that he would be out of business but for the availability of foreign labour.  The children of these immigrants, some of whom have little or no English, will benefit from the additional teachers.  Not only are these teachers making an immeasurable difference to the lives of children, they also provide back-up for their colleagues in the classroom because the additional teachers have resulted in smaller class sizes.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">In 2006, spending on special education initiatives will exceed €640 million.  We should acknowledge the improvements that have been made but we must also ensure they are sustained.  Funding for school transport will increase by 30% from €116 million this year to €152 million in the coming year.  This additional funding will enable every child to sit on individual seats and will pay for the installation of seat belts on all buses by the end of next year.  We do not want a repeat of the events which took place in the midlands last year.  This year, €636 million will be spent on addressing educational disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The Children Act 2001 and the statutory framework it introduced to the youth justice system will also be beneficial.  A twin-track approach will be adopted to child welfare and youth justice in order to help children with special care or protection needs, offending children and children with challenging behaviour.  The guiding principles of the Act are prevention, diversion and juvenile justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">While it was always the intention that the Act would be introduced on a phased basis given the scale and complexity of the issues involved and the significant new sections and amendments introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2006, a considerable portion has already been brought into force by the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children.  To date, a range of provisions have been implemented.  The Garda has a pivotal role to play in areas such as the Garda diversion programme, the treatment of child suspects in Garda stations, children in court, child protection measures and some powers of the courts themselves.  Work remains to be done on community sanctions and youth detention.  With regard to criminal responsibility, new legislation due to come into effect on 16 November will effectively raise the age of criminal responsibility from seven to 12 years in all but the most serious cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">When it comes to child protection, we must always err on the side of caution.  Anyone who becomes aware of child abuse should become a whistleblower rather than leave that responsibility to fall upon carers or parents.  During the past decade, the responsibilities of the State with regard to child welfare and protection have been clarified.  The legislation and guidelines which have been developed and implemented have increased the responsibilities of caring institutions and individuals who work with children in various capacities.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">The changes experienced by those engaged in working with children and families are having a significant impact on their roles.  For example, the Child Care Act 1991 places an onus on the HSE to provide preventative and family support services to children in need.  The Act makes it clear that each caring institution is required to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection, including children who are at risk or are being neglected or ill-treated.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on embracing the need to establish cross-Border co-operation on this issue.  We all know that people who want to harm children are not deterred by borders and may attempt to avoid detection by moving between jurisdictions.  It is clear that close co-operation in this regard would benefit children throughout the island.  The continuing progress made on streamlining the expanded service normally provided by the central Garda vetting unit will, in time, serve all those who work with children and vulnerable adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Children are Ireland's future leaders, workers, legislators and parents.  As a parent, I am aware of the great responsibility involved in raising children.  Parental responsibility is extremely important and should be exercised to its full extent.  Parental control is equally important but, regrettably, in some cases it is the children who control their parents.  I thank the Minister of State and Senators on all sides of the House for their contributions to this important debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_265">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Seán Power, to the House.  I am glad to see that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recognised that progress has been made in Ireland.  However, that progress has been far too slow in some areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">With regard to health and health care services, while the committee welcomes the commitments undertaken by the State in a number of policy documents, it remains concerned about the lack of a comprehensive legal framework and the absence of statutory guidelines to safeguard the quality of and access to health care services, as stipulated in Article 24 of the convention, in particular for children in vulnerable situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">In view of this country's current wealth, I find it difficult to understand why medical cards are not provided to all children.  We could start with children under the age of 12 because, fortunately, teenagers are not frequent users of medical services.  Proposals in this regard have been made by the medical profession on a number of occasions.  The increased cost of seeing a doctor or buying medicine could be an important factor in decisions by families to delay seeking medical care for their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">We have not yet addressed the possibility of preventing disability in children before they are born.  Promises have been made with regard to fortifying flour with folic acid but I have been raising this issue since I was first elected to the Seanad 14 years ago.  Ireland has the highest incidence of neurotube defects in the world, so, more than most, we need to take action on this issue.  The United States, Canada and the United Kingdom now fortify their flour with folic acid, so it is no longer valid to make the excuse that Ireland's confectionary trade with the United Kingdom would be affected if our flour was fortified.  Several hundred disabilities could be prevented each year through the addition of folic acid, therefore, I hope the Department of Health and Children will address this issue as rapidly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">We still do not have neonatal hearing tests, which are relatively cheap to administer.  That is serious because we know that the earlier hearing defects are recognised in a child, the better it is for his or her total development.  That is another area in which we can begin to prevent disability.  We have a national disability strategy from 2004 and the committee welcomed it.  However, the more disabilities we can prevent, the better.  It is bad enough for someone to acquire a disability during his or her life, but it is even worse if the disability need not occur at all.  We really should try to do much more about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">Senator Glynn mentioned road accidents and the fact school buses now have seat belts.  The issue of children killed or injured in road accidents is discussed.  I read a report recently but, unfortunately, I cannot remember the timeframe over which the figures were accumulated.  However, 57 children who were killed in road accidents over the period had not been placed in any type of restraining device in the car.  That is illegal and we must try to enforce the law.  One cannot expect three year olds to ensure they are placed in seat belts.  This is an offence for which not only a couple of penalty points should be given to whoever is driving the child but for which far more points should be given.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">I believe the 57 children were killed over a three-year period.  That is an horrific number of children being killed and left unrestrained in cars.  The Minister of State and, I am sure, other Members know that children are left unrestrained in cars and that children who look younger than 12 years of age sit in the front seats of cars.  There is this crazy notion that SUVs are safer for children but they are not because they are more likely to roll over.  There is also the question of airbags which might provide safety for adults but which are more of a problem for children if they are hit by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Obesity was not mentioned in the report.  I suggest we deal with it in tandem with the play policies being put forward because we can make an effort to ensure children have a healthier lifestyle.  It is very important children have better access to safe play areas because years ago, we all used to run around a lot.  Advertising directed at children is mentioned in the report.  The advertising of unhealthy food is also an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">We need to examine vaccination levels.  Unfortunately, levels are lower among lower socioeconomic populations than among people who live in better off areas.  If special campaigns are necessary in such areas, so be it.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">A serious situation arises in the area of the mental health of children and adolescents.  On 1 November, Part 2 of the Mental Health Act 2001 comes into force.  The situation regarding facilities for children and adolescents with mental health problems are no better than they were when I became a Member of this House.  The committee reiterates its previous recommendation and recommends the State party make full use of the findings and implement recommendations of the expert group on mental health policy appointed by the Minister of State at the Health and Children in 2003.  Three years later, we have moved from 16 beds for children and adolescents who need inpatient treatment to 20 beds.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">At the end of the month it will be a legal requirement for those running whatever institution to which the child is admitted and its clinical director to have him or her placed in properly segregated facilities for children and adolescents with suitably trained staff.  However, this will not be possible.  It has been suggested that 120 beds are needed for the country and that in some parts, parts of adult facilities will have four or five beds for children which is really not what is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">The Minister of State may have seen a headline in one of today's newspapers where Dr. Margo Wrigley, mental health spokesperson for the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, pointed out that recently a seriously ill child spent over 24 hours on a trolley in an accident and emergency department in one of the Dublin hospitals.  That simply will not do.  I told the House previously about a child psychiatrist who telephoned me one night to tell me she could not get a 12 year old girl admitted to hospital and that she was afraid the child would seriously damage herself or some member of her family.  It is not right that a psychiatrist must telephone a public representative late at night to try to find accommodation for such an ill child.  I do not believe the situation has improved much.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">It has been suggested that we need a specialist team and not only a psychiatrist per 100,000 of population.  These teams need to be resourced when put in place.  There is a terrible shortage of psychologists.  One extra child psychiatrist has been appointed since 2003 which simply will not do.  We also need services on a 24 hour basis.  We witnessed that terrible tragedy in Wexford last year where a woman with a serious mental illness drowned herself and her children.  She sought help, could not get it and this is what happened.  We need to catch up as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">There are children who are intellectually disabled and who are not in a suitable accommodation.  They should be placed in proper accommodation in which there are specialised staff to care for them.  This is a huge problem and we have approximately 20 days remaining to solve it properly.  Otherwise, those running the institutions and their clinical directors, who will be medical people, will be brought before the courts and given a hefty fine or put in prison.  However, what are they supposed to do if the facilities in which these children can be dealt with are not in place?</p>
          <p eId="para_279">Bullying was also mentioned in the report.  This is an area in which we seem to have let matters go off the boil.  Professor Mona O'Moore of Trinity College Dublin has done a considerable amount of work on bullying in schools which was very much supported by the Department of Education and Science.  Approximately four or five years ago, a pilot scheme was set up in County Donegal on bullying in schools which was a huge success.  Everyone said there was a significant reduction in bullying in the schools.  Why has that pilot not been extended throughout the country since it was a success and in view of another issue addressed in the report, namely, suicide?</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The committee urged the State party to implement the new ten-year national strategy for action on suicide prevention and the recommendation from the second report of the strategic task force on alcohol.  We bring forward reports and task force recommendations but we do not follow on.  Bullying among children and adolescents is very important in the context of suicide.  Some children and adolescents turn to alcohol and drugs because of bullying before they commit suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I mention another issue which perhaps the Minister of State's Department might address.  Dr. John Connolly, who has a great deal of expertise in the areas of bullying and suicide, is chair of the Institute of Suicidology.  He said that the Internet sites which talk about depression and feeling like killing one's self are seriously unchallenged.  I cannot tell the Minister of State how much he can do but there is a committee which observes the Internet in regard to problems that can arise in respect of children.  Apparently these suicide sites do not urge people to look for help but tell them how they can commit suicide.  We all know how clever children and adolescents are with the Internet and I would like to know if the Department has addressed this issue.  I was most alarmed when I heard Dr. Connolly talk about it because I, not being an Internet aficionado, do not know about these sites.  However, it is horrific to think they exist and that this type of information is being given out to children.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">We have been told we are not addressing the issue of alcohol urgently enough as well as reproductive and sexual health information and that we should not rely on schools to bring forward the information all the time.   The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has done terrific work.  It appears we have quite a low rate of teenage pregnancies and no one should think it is because these girls are going to England for abortions or something like that.  That is not so.  That rate is also low and declining.  This is an area where we are doing quite well.  As the committee suggested, perhaps a more enthusiastic effort in that regard would put us in an even better situation.  I did not realise until recently that 30 years ago Holland had the highest incidence of teenage pregnancy in Europe.  It took them 30 years to get to the stage of having the lowest incidence.  We are making progress and we should continue with it.  We know teenage pregnancy has not just a serious effect on the child but also on the young mother.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">Criminal law issues have come up in the course of the debate.  I was most disappointed when the Children Act 2001 was modified by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  The effect of that was to reduce to ten years the age of responsibility for serious crimes.  I was particularly disappointed when the Minister asked during the debate on that Bill what would be the media response if a child of ten committed a murder.  The media will say what it likes.  We have to introduce the best possible legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">I do not believe the committee can have known that under that legislation, responsibility for places of detention for children has been moved from the Department of Education and Science to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  That is also a retrograde step.  The committee expressed its concerns about anti-social behaviour orders and how carefully they need to be monitored.  I agree with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I also agree with what has been said about St. Patrick's Institution but what is the point in saying anything about it.  In the Whittaker report, Mr. Ken Whittaker said nearly 30 years ago that it should be closed.  It has no educational facilities although children aged from 16 upwards are in the institution.  Neither are there any training facilities.  This is ridiculous.  Detention should be a last resort with children.  It should really be for only violent and serious crimes.  We will have to get better at trying to deal with them in the outside world.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">The longitudinal study is very welcome as these data are needed.  Professor Sheila Greene was going to head it up.  It will be an excellent study.  While 18,000 children sounds a large number, it is not that many.  I hope it will include the ethnic and minority groups to which the committee referred.  We need to get an overall picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">I accept the Ministers of State, Deputies Brian Lenihan and Seán Power, are both most enthusiastic about trying to bring forward these issues but we should not be overly enthusiastic about congratulating ourselves because we have a great deal more to do in many areas.  I would like to see the area of mental health brought forward for debate as a matter of urgency before some of my colleagues will be put in jail by the end of November.</p>

        <speech by="#GeraldineFeeney" eId="spk_131">
          <from>Ms Feeney</from>
          <p eId="para_288">I wish to share time with Senator Daly.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, to the House.  I am delighted to speak on this debate.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, mentioned, the Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted by the UN General Assembly in November 1998.  Ireland signed up to the convention in September 1990 and ratified it in September 1992.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">I am delighted the convention has a built-in mechanism designed to monitor the progress of states in fulfilling their obligations following ratification.  In other words, we are not going to get away lightly.  We cannot say we are doing something when we do not do it, as we are being tracked and monitored.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">Under Article 44, Ireland and other states are required to submit a progress report.  We are required not alone to report on legislative and judicial measures but also to report on administrative and other measures taken to implement the convention.  As we know, Ireland submitted its second progress report in July 2005.  That has been widely reported on and discussed.  In compiling this report the Government and the National Children's Office consulted widely with the NGO sector, particularly those interested in the welfare of children.  In addition, the NGO sector submitted a separate shadow report to the United Nations committee.  The report illustrated how the lives of children have been improved since the examination of Ireland's first report to the committee and acknowledged areas where further progress was required.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">Before I reached the office this morning I heard on the radio that with the increase in child benefit a large percentage of children had been taken out of the poverty net and are no longer on the poverty threshold.  That is encouraging.  Child poverty was an area of concern in the recommendations from the United Nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">The UN committee held its hearing into the second report on 20 September in Geneva.  As we all know, the Irish delegation was headed by the Minister for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  The UN reported back on 29 September and I am glad its report is positive, which means our report was well received by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">It is fair to say Ireland is in a very strong position internationally in regard to children's affairs in general and especially in the area of child safety.  It is only 14 years since September 1992 when we ratified the UN convention yet a great deal of progress has taken place.  We now have an Ombudsman for Children, the National Children's Office and a dedicated Minister for children.  Other Senators have referred to Dáil na nÓg, the special Parliament for children.  Two of my daughters participated in this when they were in secondary school.  It gave them an insight into how local government and the national Parliament operates.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">I am a member of the Joint Committee on Child Protection.  The committee was set up following the CC case last May.  We have met several different groups.  Yesterday the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, appeared before the committee.  It was interesting to hear her views, aspirations and concerns.  Her aspirations and concerns almost exactly reflect the recommendations made by the UN committee, namely, the need to see the child as an individual rights holder and the constitutional change that is needed to enact this.  It is possible that the constitutional change will come about more quickly as a result of the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Child Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Ireland is not without its problems or worries but compared to other countries we are much more advanced in regard to child safety and child protection than, for example, countries like Thailand.  A couple of weeks ago <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> did a very good article on teenage sex trafficking and child prostitution.  I was saddened to see that Ireland is among the highest subscribers to teenage sex.  Irishmen were logging on the Internet and going to places like Thailand looking for sex with very young teenage children.  I do not know if there is a mechanism in place whereby we can prosecute offenders in these cases but it is certainly an area we should examine.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenneally</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_297">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_298">That Seanad Éireann:</p>
          <p eId="para_299">recognises the vital importance of Energy Policy to Ireland's progress, in terms of sustained growth, prosperity and social development;</p>
          <p eId="para_300">accepts that we have an obligation of duty to the next generation to be challenging and far-sighted in our energy management strategy;</p>
          <p eId="para_301">welcomes the publication of the Government's Energy Green Paper entitled Towards A Sustainable Energy Future For Ireland, which sets out policy proposals for Ireland out to 2020 to transform our national energy landscape;</p>
          <p eId="para_302">congratulates the Minister on his continued commitment to make Ireland an acknowledged world leader particularly in the areas of renewables, bio-fuels and energy efficiency; and</p>
          <p eId="para_303">approves of the Green Paper proposing challenging and co-ordinated actions and targets across Government to move us towards a Sustainable Energy Future.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy John Browne.  I read previously that at the rate of current usage, the world's stock of oil is expected to run out in approximately 50 years.  However, usage will increase, particularly in the emerging economies of China and India, and the 50-year period could be reduced considerably.  This is the challenge facing the world and it is imperative that we develop alternative energy sources.  Now is the time to do so instead of waiting until it is too late.  For this reason, the publication of the Government's Green Paper, Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, is timely and has generated much needed discussion in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">"An Inconvenient Truth" is the name of a new movie released in cinemas last week.  In it, Al Gore engages the audience on something that affects us all, namely, global warming.  However, it does not take Al Gore, his book or a movie to highlight the effects of global warming.  We witness the consequences every day in rising sea levels, melting icecaps, negative agricultural effects and changing weather conditions.  Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere maintain a habitual temperature on Earth, but practices such as burning fossil fuels and using CFCs increase greenhouse gases at a rapid rate, resulting in Earth becoming drastically warmer.  This has a negative effect on nature, as it pollutes the world and puts considerable pressure on our environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">A strong economy and a developing population in Ireland means that there is a greater demand for energy, the main source of which is fossil fuels, including oil and natural gas.  Not only are these sources unhealthy for the environment and increase carbon emissions, but they are running low in supply.  Due to the Irish electricity market structure, there is little competition and the cost of this energy is high.  It is essential to find a balance between development and conservation and to address the issues with the supply and cost of energy.  The Government has developed a new policy to face these challenges in the form of the Green Paper, which examines the security, competitiveness and sustainability of Ireland's energy supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Climate change is a major negative result of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions and, therefore, these emissions need to be reduced.  This paper sets out the methods and incentives to stimulate the development of renewable energy sources, which reduce the negative impact of greenhouse gas emissions.  A contribution is to be made to the National Climate Change Strategy 2006 review and under the EU review of the energy crops scheme, a ministerial task force on bio-energy will be established, the national bio-energy action plan will be finalised and an action plan is to be developed in respect of energy efficiency by the end of 2006 to deliver a 20% improvement by 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">An all-island research and development programme will be developed in co-operation with international researchers, including the EU and the International Energy Agency, to support technology breakthroughs.  An all-island renewable target is to be set.  Some 15% of electricity is to be of a renewable source by 2010 and 30% by 2020.  By 2010, 5% of fuel used for heat purchases should be from renewable sources and bio-fuel is to be researched and its penetration increased, the aims being a 2% increase by 2008 and 5.75% by 2010.  The Department of Agriculture and Food is also to consider stimulating increased interest in energy crops.  The all-island target will encourage a diversity of fuels to help to ensure that supply meets demand.  There is also an aim to reduce dependence on natural gas and oil by 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources produced a report last June entitled Review of Energy.  Mr. Bernard Rice from Teagasc told the committee that it "should be possible to get 5,000 miles per acre of rapeseed, roughly 100 gallons at 50 miles to the gallon". In terms of using bio-fuels, it will take upwards of two acres per car to continue driving the average distance of 10,000 miles per annum.  Growing bio-fuels to continue to give every Irish motorist that 10,000-mile experience will take up a large part of the stock of arable land in Ireland.  This must be a wake-up call and it clearly shows that Ireland needs policies to address the changes the future will bring.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">In a further attempt to increase supply, an all-island energy market will be developed and European regional energy markets will be helped to develop.  Gas and electricity supplies will be secured, ensuring an adequate and safe delivery to Ireland at all times.  A network development programme in electricity and gas is to be set up and the South-North gas pipeline and the electricity network renewal programme are to be completed.  Gas sources will also be diversified, gas storage facilities developed, and a European gas market supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">Ireland uses gas to generate over 50% of all its electricity.  Security of supply is, therefore, of major national importance, and more so the longer it takes to get the Corrib gas field into production.  It is estimated this source will be able to supply a large segment of the indigenous gas market in the short term — approximately 30% of peak supply rising to 60% over a period.  It is vital that this supply is brought on stream without further delay and in a safe manner.  The Corrib gas pipeline is an opportunity to extend the gas pipeline to the previously unserviced areas of the west, north west and midlands.  From the map on page 37 of the Green Paper, it is quite obvious that a large part of the country does not enjoy the benefits of natural gas.  I am sure this is something my colleague, Senator MacSharry, will allude to in his contribution as he has raised this on many occasions at the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Renewable energy sources constitute a potential replacement for vulnerable fossil fuel imports, which are most certainly subject to continuing price increases.  Therefore, renewable and sustainable energy sources are most important.  The essential elements are wind, biomass, bio-fuels and wave energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Wind energy is already a well established component of the national electricity generation programme.  There is a limit to the size of the fraction of total electricity that wind can contribute.  The size of this contribution is a matter of continuing debate.  For instance, Denmark produces 20% of its electricity from wind and this percentage is planned to increase in the coming years.  There are many who object to wind farms in their areas, but they are becoming a necessity and it is something on which we will have to bite the bullet or suffer the consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">Wave energy is largely under-utilised in Ireland at present.  It has an advantage over wind in that wave energy is more predictable.  In this country we are well situated for wave power.  However, there is a limiting factor caused by Ireland's grid configuration — transmission and distribution.  The grid is at its weakest where the resource is at its greatest.  Therefore, the wave power industry requires special treatment to get started and derive the benefit of developing a new industry.  The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, in its report, suggested measures such as generous payments per unit of electricity delivered together with an upfront capital grant.  By leading this development of wave energy technology Ireland could benefit in the way the Danish benefited from wind technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Biomass has the potential to replace peat and is already in use through pelletised fuels, which are growing in competitiveness and are becoming more widely available.  Biomass is part of but not the entire solution.  Bio-fuels offer a new and alternative fuel source and I referred previously in this House to Cork City Council, which initiated some projects on bio-fuels.  This initially involved 17 vehicles which ran on rapeseed oil.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The energy policy encourages investments in hydrocarbon resources by promoting Ireland as an attractive location for oil and gas exploration.  This is done through revising regulations and licences and establishing a framework for major projects.  The National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, is to be set up as an independent statutory body, and existing bilateral oil stockholding agreements in the EU will be reviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The structure of the market is to be reformed.  The ESB and State-owned electricity assets will be retained.  The power held by any one strong player in the market will be reduced.  A State-owned land bank of current and potential generating sites will also be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Global warming will be the greatest environmental challenge in the 21st century.  In the Green Paper, Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, the Government attempts to face this challenge by developing energy efficiency strategies, maximising indigenous energy resources, investing in energy infrastructure, research, development, technology and innovation, and increasing competition.  These efforts will reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere, reduce the negative effects of global warming, reduce the costs of energy, and reduce the difficulties with supply.  This will result in a better quality of life for Irish people, Europe and the world.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarcMacSharry" eId="spk_133">
          <from>Mr. MacSharry</from>
          <p eId="para_319">I second the motion.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to the House and congratulate him, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, their officials and all the stakeholders on putting together the Green Paper.  Having had an opportunity to look over the debate which took place in the other House yesterday, I will not say it is long overdue.  We all obviously know that, as the Taoiseach stated, there is almost no other policy area which is so basic and fundamental to our success in terms of sustainable growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">I do want to be repetitive either.  Many Senators will go through the various aspects of the Green Paper.  It is a significantly aspirational document and I assume the reason for that is to stimulate debate over the next two months to get in the widest range of innovative and productive ideas so that the Government can put together the White Paper and come up with the appropriate actions which will make the difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Former US President Bill Clinton stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_322">We will never get the world to deal with a problem which is over the horizon, even if it's just a few years over the horizon, unless we can prove we can do it with productive investments that incidentally create jobs, improve national security of every country involved, and save the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">In the context of this issue, there can be no truer statement.  As long as one can say that it will never happen to us or it will happen to everybody else, that it will happen so far in the future, or that it will not affect me, my children, grandchildren or great grandchildren, one is likely to suggest not dealing with it and to hope someone is looking into it.  Unfortunately, nobody has looked into it and now we need to do so quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">The most important part of that statement is that it strongly suggests we must ensure that people profit from it in the shorter term, and there is nothing wrong with that.  Let us call it incentivisation.  In the smallest possible way, we have made some slight inroads in that regard through the greener homes scheme.  We need to start looking at the greener homes scheme to the power of infinity and over a much wider range of activities.  The scheme is good in terms of the wood pellets, solar panelling, etc., but it is not essential anywhere.  Let us make it easier for people.  Let us provide the scheme through tax credits or through cash payments by which we can get people to engage actively in this.  Let us come up with a cross-departmental approach so that we can legislate in the building regulations, for example, to provide that houses contain all these.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The area of transport is the one where we could take steps quickly.  As the House will be aware, since 1990 there has been an increase of approximately 65% in car ownership.  I gather from a recent press release of Sustainable Energy Ireland that transport is responsible for 41% of our primary energy demand and for 33% of our CO2 emissions.  While one third of our CO2 emissions are in this area, in real terms we can take action through providing incentives for the likes of hybrid cars.  I note that the car of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, is a hybrid that operates with diesel and battery power.  Four cars in the ministerial fleet are hybrids.  They all should be.  Let us provide an incentive to the public, whether through road tax reductions or otherwise, so that they are proactive in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">I am indifferent as to the fuel on which my car runs and, of course, I need my car.  I would be delighted to make such a move.  If these were more readily available and if there were an incentive, perhaps we could get members of the public to change over quickly.  Given that cars are responsible for one third of our emissions and 41% of primary fuel demand relates to transport, substantial gains could be made if the focus was put on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">It is clear, whatever strategy emerges in the White Paper in two months, the Government will have to be radical in its approach.  The bar needs to be set higher than 30% of energy to come from alternative sources by 2020.  If we dream, let us dream that little bit bigger and push the boat out a little bit more.  Last Saturday, as I was driving and burning fuel, I listened to Marian Finucane's interview with Richard Branson on radio.  He is investing €1.5 billion of his resources in the research and development of alternative fuel technologies.  I browsed the Internet earlier regarding his proposals but I could not obtain much detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">However, the Government should look into this.  Richard Branson is meeting airline representatives and so on.  I laughed when I heard his proposal to tow aircraft from the terminal to the runway to save fuel and to have airplanes begin their descent into airports 15 minutes earlier.  Similarly, we all would have laughed 20 years ago at proposals for tidal or wind energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">I would not be true to Tipp O'Neill's maxim that all politics is local and fail to mention the gas network.  I have a diagram of the gas network and the north west is highlighted in yellow because there is no gas provision in the region.  Under the Gas Acts, Bord Gáis has no intention of bringing gas to this area.</p>

Even if the Corrib gas pipeline comes to fruition, there will not be much provision for the people of Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal.  The Minister of State kindly contacted me previously to outline the research being conducted on this issue and the appointment of consultants.  Where is that at?  I hope the full energies of the Department have been brought to bear on BGE to ensure it will expedite this issue as quickly as possible, to determine the subvention that will be required to extend the gas network to the north west and to build it as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_335">condemns the Government's Green Paper on Energy for failing to address Ireland's key energy challenges and calls for a cross-departmental approach to the issue, coordinating the activities of the Departments of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Agriculture and Food and Transport in order to reduce our reliance on imported fuels, reduce our carbon emissions and drive down the cost of energy; and</p>

          <p eId="para_343">amend the National Spatial Strategy to include major renewable energy infrastructure projects."</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The energy debate is interesting.  Last week the main players in the gas and electricity industries, including the regulator, appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to discuss concerns in the marketplace about the escalating cost of gas and electricity.  The backdrop to the debate is a 34% increase in gas bills with an increase of 20% in electricity prices due on 1 January next.  Competition in the electricity sector has totally failed the household consumer and it has made no difference.  These people are captives of their ESB bills, which, aside from electricity charges, also includes VAT, a publish service obligation levy and standing charges amounting to in excess of 20% of the cost of the bill.  When the proposed increase kicks in, electricity prices will have increased by 60% between 2002 and 1 January 2007.  If we are the captives of carbon fuels, how will competition be created in the marketplace?</p>
          <p eId="para_345">Last night in the Lower House, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources stated the ESB will maintain its generating capacity because to do otherwise would lead to increased costs and less competition.  I am not sure about his logic and perhaps if the Government opened the marketplace, competition might be stimulated to reduce costs for the consumers and give them freedom of choice.  However, that will not happen in the short or long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The joint committee conducted a great deal of research and launched its own energy document recently, which received a favourable reception.  I asked the Minister to release the report to the committee compiled by Deloitte &amp; Touche consultants, who were paid more than €1 million, which he received in September 2005.  If the committee members had been given access to that documentation, it may have enhanced their deliberations before producing their document.  However, everybody was bound to secrecy regarding its contents only for it to be published on the same day as the Green Paper on Energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I queried the Minister regarding the public service obligation levy in ESB bills at another meeting, which the regulator stated is anti-competitive, but he jumped down my throat and asked whether I wanted to close peat fired power stations in the midlands.  That was a trivial reaction by him to a serious issue.  The same Minister takes a dividend of almost €80 million from the ESB annually.  I would not mind if the money was ploughed back into improving the ESB's infrastructure but it goes into the Government's coffers.  It was an arrogant cheek of him to label something constructive that I put forward as anti-competitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">However, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Green Paper.  While it is not a good enough response to the energy crisis facing the country, nobody doubts the scale of the economic and environmental difficulties that lie ahead if Ireland does not address the energy crisis.  To neutralise the effect of global warming on the world's population, it is generally agreed that the level of global greenhouse gas emissions will need to be reduced by 70% by 2100.  As a first step, the 1997 Kyoto agreement was drawn up with the aim of reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases by 2012 by 5.2% based on 1990 levels.  Under the agreement, to which Ireland is a signatory, we undertook to limit the increase of such emissions between 2008 and 2012 to only 13% based on 1990 levels.  Without any action, it is estimated our emissions will have increased by 37%, almost three times the permissible level.  We are currently 25% above our 1990 level.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Fine Gael has seriously criticised the Government's Green Paper on Energy for containing little more than aspirational proposals and for a complete lack of costings.  The Green Paper can be contrasted with Fine Gael's comprehensive policy document, Energy for the Future, which was launched six months ago and which contains a set of revolutionary but workable proposals involving several Departments, costed at €488 million.  The Green Paper should have contained wide ranging, feasible solutions to Ireland's energy problems but the Minister has presented the public with a hotch potch of half measures, which are aspirational in character and which have not been costed.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">The dearth of specifics in the Government's plan is clearly evidenced by its target to reduce electricity usage by 20% through unspecified conservation measures.  Such nonsense is not good enough.  It is not credible for the Minister to claim he will reduce energy usage and then refuse to specify how he will do so.  The refusal to cost any proposals and the lack of emphasis on critical issues such as bio-fuels further characterise this phenomenally disappointing document.  A lack of innovation and vision is at the heart of the Government and consumers are losing out.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The Government has failed to create positive competition in the industry that will benefit the consumer, particularly when there is an emphasis on driving energy prices upwards to the detriment of the consumer and the wider economy.  This is clearly seen in the unjustifiable 34% hike in gas prices.  It is worth considering that the Government took in €223 million last year in VAT from energy bills.  At the launch of the Green Paper, the Taoiseach stated there is no other policy area that is so basic and fundamental to our success than energy, yet it has taken the Government over nine years to produce a Green Paper.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_363">I second the amendment.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The Green Paper is aspirational and vague, and no costings are indicated, as Senator Finucane noted.  While everybody understands the importance of the maintenance of security of supply, we must realise the crisis in Ireland with regard to future development.  A few days before Christmas last year, we were in the amber light section.  It was only then we realised the seriousness of our situation with regard to our overdependence on imported fossil fuels.  However, there was no clear indication from the Minister, the Government or the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, that they are serious about moving forward at an accelerated rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">We have had ample opportunity in the past five years to bring on-stream many wind energy projects but they have been stifled.  Perhaps, in the first instance, this was not the fault of the Government but of the local authorities and the planning procedures.  Many wonderful projects are ready to proceed, and are supported by communities, private investors and companies.  However, the major stalling point for these projects, despite them having gone through the planning process, which was difficult in many cases, is access to the national grid.  Whatever the Government must do, they must free up the logjam that in the national grid if we are to release the potential in wind energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Many suggest there is a grand plan to stifle access to the grid so the ESB can move in at a crisis point, when those who have invested heavily in planning and development of sites are over a barrel economically, and purchase access to the grid.  It is unfair but nothing the Government has done in the past nine years indicates it is committed to freeing up access to the grid.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">Many projects were supposedly given clearance for access to the national grid under the Gate 2 process.  However, the reality is that since last August, the CER has not moved forward with projects that were ready to proceed.  Somebody must knock heads in this regard.  The commission must take responsibility because it delayed for six months prior to August on deciding who would and would not get in.  Having made the decision, it has stalled the Gate 2 process and nothing has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">I would be glad to accept the situation is not as I have set out.  I know of a particular project which has been ready to proceed for four years but cannot do so, first and foremost because the commission held it back.  Before that, it was held back due to planning issues.  Those involved are now in a situation where the planning permission is due to run out but they have not yet received confirmation that they can begin development.  This is unacceptable.  If the Green Paper were serious about energy requirements and contained a commitment on action, it would be important.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The Green Paper is long on style but short on substance.  Two factors are referred to repeatedly in the Green Paper, namely, competition and transparency.  However, despite my efforts to get information, I have failed to get details from the Minister, the Department or the CER about a particular case.  A modern gas-fired electricity producing power station has been built in Tynagh, County Galway.  I do not know who owns the station — nobody seems to own it.  GAMA, the builder of the station, was the first owner but it sold out at a huge profit.  Who are the investors in Tynagh Energy?  I cannot find out.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">A more serious problem concerns the terms of contract for Tynagh Energy, although I am open to contradiction in this regard.  It is my understanding there is a 15-year contract for the supply of electricity and the producers are guaranteed payment for 100% capacity production despite the fact there has never been much more than 50% utilisation of the station's capacity since it was commissioned.  How can we call this competition given that we are being charged 100% for electricity but are utilising only 50% on average?  Is it competition?</p>
          <p eId="para_370">I challenge the Minister of State to explain why electricity customers are facing increases of 19% or 20% when there is such a farce in regard to Tynagh.  Must we provide 50% incentives to guarantee reliability of supply for the future?  Why must the customer pay for this?  Will the Minister of State indicate whether these are the terms of the Tynagh Energy contract for the next 15 years?  If so, how can we claim to be serious about regulating energy costs?  We are not.  We are handing control to unidentifed people.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">Projections have been made about changing over to bio-fuels.  The target exists and we would have a tremendous response from bio-fuels if we had a doubling of the tillage area for this purpose.  The Minister of State comes from a tillage county but can he truthfully support the idea that it is possible to double the amount of tillage in order to provide the requirement for bio-fuels?  It is not on.  We are talking about an aspirational situation with no account being taken of the consequences of what is involved, including costings.  The Green Paper is vague in this respect and I am not too sure if everything in it was not a rushed job.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">As regards the break-up of the ESB, we are talking about competition on the one hand and reliability of supply on the other.  It is a thin line between both aspects, however.  The Minister of State should tell the House clearly whether or not the ESB is to be broken up.  If not, how can we correlate that with future energy costs?  Most people would say that over the years the ESB has been particularly good with regard to reliability of supply and repairs.  If we are going to privatise the ESB, will it turn out, as we have today, that somebody is lurking in the long grass, waiting to snipe at certain aspects of the company, thus crippling it later on?</p>

          <p eId="para_377">I am probably the only Member of the House who was involved in the preparation of the last Green Paper on energy policy, which was produced in 1978 under the aegis of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  Outside Departments had an advisory role.  At that stage it was thought that nuclear and coal were the routes to take but subsequent events proved otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">I agree with the Green Paper's exclusion of nuclear energy — on pragmatic economic grounds as much as any others — in that it would not fit the current system.  However, we should not treat nuclear power as if it were a moral issue.  I have no objections to importing electricity from countries where nuclear power plays a considerable role.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The most immediate issues the public will be concerned about are the steep price rises in gas and electricity, and whether those are justified given the rapid and unexpected rise in the price of oil to approximately $60 a barrel.  The Government should review that situation as well as reviewing whether setting these prices annually is at too long an interval.  Realistically and pragmatically, the ESB is vital to our future and, moreover, in State ownership.  More so than price, security of supply is critical to hi-tech industry.  We have seen the disruption caused in the state of California by serious interruptions in power supplies.  That is not to say, however, that all competition should be excluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">I would caution against adopting a gung-ho attitude to wind power, which does have a role to play.  We need to be careful about it, however, as other countries are.  Our tourism industry, which is hugely valuable economically, depends on our landscape.  I would not like to see wind turbines in every other field, as happens, for example, in parts of eastern Germany.  Areas of heritage and high amenity where there are human settlements should be avoided for this purpose.  Wind energy has a role to play but that role should not be exaggerated.  Connection difficulties were referred to in the debate and the fact is that wind power is very unstable.  Winds can be strong or weak and there is no method of storing that resource.  Even large countries such as Germany, which has invested hugely in wind power, have found their electricity systems in danger of being destabilised simply because of the variability in wind strengths.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">While I take Senator Ulick Burke's point that its potential should not be exaggerated, I have a much stronger preference for biomass, which has few downsides.  Many groups are currently working on such projects and I would like to see the Government encouraging the development of bio-energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">A topical issue at present concerns the ongoing protests at Rossport.  In the beginning, I had quite a strong sympathy with the particular local community affected.  It seemed to me that they had been treated in a fairly careless and haphazard manner, and that the project had not been fully thought through.  There comes a point, however, when realism and pragmatism come into play.  Changes are going to be made to the project and that fact must be recognised.  I do not think it is possible for a small community group to force a multinational to put its plant out to sea——</p>

          <p eId="para_390">It would do huge damage to the reputation of this country.  There is a national interest involved in this, so it is time for some realism and accommodation.  I accept Senator MacSharry's point that if there had been more plans to supply the north-west and more benefit for the area concerned, perhaps the opposition would not have arisen to the extent that it has.  It is striking that there are five Deputies representing the Mayo constituency, one of whom is the Leader of the Opposition.  Yet only one of them, an Independent Deputy, actually supports the Rossport campaign.  If there was huge support in County Mayo for the protest it would be reflected in what the local Deputies are saying.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">The Green Paper also places some emphasis on energy conservation and greater fuel efficiency.  I wish to register my unhappiness at the effective phasing out of rail freight transport.  There is much unused capacity which is energy efficient.  That is a case where one area of public policy is going in the opposite direction to the Green Paper.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_394">I wish to make some straightforward points.  On the issue of wind energy, I want to clarify a number of issues.  I agree that wind farms might despoil the landscape but we might have to make a choice some time between that and the possibility of sea water encroaching on some of the beautiful parts of the Minister of State's county, among other areas.  That is a choice we must make.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I want to deal firmly with Senator Mansergh's point about the instability of wind energy.  As the Senator correctly stated, wind energy blows hot and cold, weak and strong.  The reality is that wind energy throughout the country needs to be connected to the one grid because for 90% of the time, wind is blowing somewhere on the island.  That is the correct figure.  Airtricity put forward a proposal to the European Union to have a bank of wind farms interlinked from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean.  There would always be wind blowing, as we can see from normal weather movements.  That is the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I strongly agree with the point made by Senator Finucane on microgeneration.  A new report on this area has been published, which I have not read yet as I only received it two days ago.  Connecting to the grid is a crucially important part of that, but we heard over a year ago that the connections to the grid are to be suspended.  I do not know the reason for that.  We did not get an explanation despite the fact that Senator Finucane, myself and a number of other Members raised it in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Senator Mansergh mentioned biomass.  I presume in its usable form that is a reference to wood pellets.  About three weeks ago I inquired about buying wood pellets in the State, but I could not find a company that sold them.  They must be imported from the North.  What is the reason for that?  Why can we not produce wood pellets here?  What is the problem in that regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_398">More importantly, and this is where this country always goes wrong, I am aware that one can get a grant for installing a wood pellet burning stove but one cannot get a grant for installing solar panels or a geothermal heating system.  Where is the balance in that policy?  What are we doing in that regard?  Why can we not adopt the same approach to both options of the availability of a grant?</p>
          <p eId="para_399">In terms of bio-fuel, we cannot create an industry for the agricultural community, many of whom the Minister of State represents, while there is a cap on the amount that can be produced under the excise limit.  We cannot ask farmers to consider growing a new crop if there is not continuity and certainty of a market and we cannot ask industrialists or other people to develop that industry if they cannot be sure of it either.  Currently, the cost of a barrel of crude oil or diesel is approximately $60, although the price fluctuates and was $70 a barrel at one stage.  The cost of producing bio-fuel is almost double that at more than $100 a barrel.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The way some countries, such as Germany, have dealt with the difference in cost, and I am not suggesting this measure but outlining it for the information of the House, is to increase the excise on diesel to make bio-fuel more competitive, although that is perverting the market and I am not attracted to the idea.  The head of Airtricity made a statement last week indicating that he expected the price of crude oil to be more than $100 a barrel by the end of next year.  If that is the case, bio-fuel would be viable because that price will not increase.  We need to be ready to catch that market and encourage such production now.  That is what I ask the Minister of State to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I would like to there to be a move forward on the following issues.  We should remove the cap on production and consider other ways of making the product more efficient.  The Minister of State should also explain the reason renewable energy generation projects are not grant aided in the same way as are wood pellet burning installations.  Solar energy appears to be going a-begging.  It is almost winter and harnessing the solar energy that is currently outside would heat water to almost 20 degrees, which is enough to knock the sting out of cold water and to reduce many of our energy costs.  Will the Minister of State consider those issues?  I look forward to hearing his response to them.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_164">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_402">I thank my colleague, Senator O'Toole, for sharing his time with me and allowing me to take part in this debate, which is timely because it reflects not only our energy needs but the impact of energy generation upon the global climate.  I am very concerned about this issue.  I have a motion on the Order Paper about it because I believe that what we are witnessing is perhaps the beginning of the destruction of the earth as a habitable planet.  It is that serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">In August, I took up an open invitation from the Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs to travel to Svalbard and Spitsbergen to see for myself the impact of climate change on marine and mammal life, the ice floes and the glaciers in those regions.  What I saw there was very worrying.  We also know that in Switzerland, for example, closer to home, the Eiger, one of the most famous mountains, is changing shape because the ice is melting and loosening.  Massive rock falls have occurred.  The rock face is exposed and is crumbling.  Boulders are crashing down on villages.  The heart of Europe is already experiencing the effects of climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">In Siberia, near Cherski, the permafrost has started to melt, new lakes are appearing, gases are bubbling up from the bottom of these lakes to the surface and they are having a further impact on global warming.  Holes are appearing in the roads all around Cherski and buildings are starting to collapse.  This is not some kind of science fiction account; this is what is already happening and, as Senator O'Toole said, it may well impact on us.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">In the Arctic, the sea ice is decreasing in summer year by year and over the past 30 years, there has been a 15% to 20% decrease in it.  I have seen the effect of climate change and one needs to experience it, to go to these places to get a firm hold on the level of the impact and to see what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">We are not spending enough.  I heard on the BBC World Service some weeks ago Professor John Holdren of the American Association for the Advancement of Science indicate that our spending rate on a global level in terms of renewing our energy stations and so on is flat whereas even to stand still it ought to be three times what it is currently.  Some $12 trillion is needed to rebuild power plants, transmission lines and generating stations.  That would have an impact over 30 to 40 years but we are not prepared to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">I never thought I would say this but thank God for Arnold Schwarzenegger and the introduction of fuel conservation measures which are being made mandatory throughout the state of California.  The situation is now so serious that even the US Congress which, under the Bush Administration, had played ball with the energy and oil industries in particular, recently passed an emergency motion calling for an immediate approach to restrict greenhouse gas emissions.  That shows that even within that most conservative group of people there is a recognition that something serious must be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">With regard to energy, thank God for the people who are protesting in Rossport.  Let us consider the way President Putin dealt with Shell.  It is one of the most disreputable companies on the face of this planet and it is dishonestly buying its way into publications like <i>National Geographic </i>to pretend it is ecologically friendly.  It is not.  President Putin knew how to deal with it.  If there is something in it for Shell, it will come back.  It is disgraceful that the Irish State should be used by a multinational to crush a local population, so to speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">I am glad there is use of interconnectors and that this will expand not only through Northern Ireland but also through Europe.  That links in with what Senator O'Toole said about a bank of wind farms along the coast.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I turn now to the question of wind farms and put on record the benefit of them.  For every megawatt of Irish wind energy that displaces fossil fuel power production each year, the environmental, economic and social benefits include the following: clean electricity to meet the electricity needs of 650 homes — that is per megawatt; the removal of the need to import 6,450 barrels of oil; the avoidance of 2,700 tonnes of CO2; the avoidance of 49 tonnes of SO2; the avoidance of 5.5 tonnes of NOX; and the avoidance of 175 tonnes of slag and ash for landfill.  I know there has been some complaint about the environmental impact of wind farms but these things can be concentrated.  In my opinion, they do less damage than people.  There are some problems for migrating birds but only a small fraction of these birds will be damaged.  They are much more likely to be damaged by a degrading of the environment than by wind farms.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">The Government's website still has out-of-date material on the previous Green Paper which dealt with increasing the percentage of total primary energy requirements to be derived from renewable sources to 3.75% by 2005 from 2% in 2000.  Have these targets been achieved and, if not, why are we bleating about further targets when we have not reached the initial ones?</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. J. Browne)</from>
          <p eId="para_412">I welcome the opportunity to address the House in support of the motion about the recently published energy Green Paper, Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland.  In particular, I welcome the terms of the motion which recognise the social and economic importance of energy policy.  This motion puts energy policy in its rightful place, at the forefront of our development as an economy and as a society up to 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">This is the first comprehensive Green Paper published by Government since the mid-1970s, and it covers all aspects of energy. The paper sets out the policy directions, targets and actions proposed out to 2020 for security of supply, sustainability, and competitiveness, as the three main pillars of energy policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The Green Paper has been published with a two-month period for consultation, and a vigorous and robust debate about the issues and policy directions has already commenced.  I am glad that the Oireachtas has shown a strong lead in this regard.  The paper has already been the subject of an in-depth discussion by the joint committee as well as statements in the Dáil last night and now in this House this evening where we have already had some excellent contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">While many elements make up our overall strategy, we need to keep our eye on the bigger picture in terms of where we want Ireland to be in energy terms in 2020.  A clear vision of the 2020 energy landscape will help shape and inform the debate about strategies to get there.  I note that the motion quite explicitly acknowledges our responsibility to the next generation.  I will sketch out some of the features of the energy landscape we intend that generation to experience.  However, for us to bequeath that reality to them, we will require delivery on challenging and far-sighted targets from us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">The motion places particular emphasis on renewable energy, bio-fuels and energy efficiency.  Attaining world-class performance in terms of the sustainability of our energy production and use will be the key to ensuring a secure energy future for Ireland.  Accordingly, I wish to focus especially on these elements and set out how success in sustainability will support both security of supply and competitiveness, illustrating the coherence of the policy directions set out in the Green Paper.  Delivering the vision set out in the Green Paper depends on the strong leadership of Government and on the response of the stakeholders in the energy industry as well as energy consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">A broad range of factors influence world energy trends such as volatility in oil and gas prices, prediction and forecasts of peak oil, the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly, exponential demand growth from China, India and other dynamically growing economies, and a national economy with an import dependence of around 90% to meet its energy needs.  When we view our circumstances in this context, there is no doubt that harnessing our indigenous renewable energy resources must be central to energy policy not just in the electricity market but across the energy markets, including heat and transport.  At the same time, we must make every effort to reduce energy demand through energy efficiency and demand management strategies.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">The Green Paper envisages an ambitious target of 30% of electricity produced by renewable energy by 2020.  This is a doubling of the 15% target by 2010 and an example of a challenging target as referred to in the motion.  Inevitably, there will be debate whether this new target is too much or too little.  Stakeholders can muster arguments about technical difficulties as well as others who may see the target as too conservative.  Ambitious targets provide the challenge for world-class performance from all areas of the energy industry.  This approach will be brought to bear when definitive targets for renewable energy are set in the White Paper following the consultation period.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">To ensure the revised target can be delivered under realistic assumptions, the historical support offered to this market segment was changed earlier this year.  The new support programme, the renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT, programme, moves the emphasis away from competitive tendering to a fixed price type support mechanism which has been received positively in the market.  This scheme, worth €119 million, will support 55 new renewable electricity generating plants with a combined capacity of more than 600 MW, predominantly wind powered.  This increase in capacity will bring our renewable energy electricity capacity to the point where it can power 1 million homes, increasing capacity from 860 MW to 1,469 MW and preventing the emission of 2 million tonnes of greenhouse gases annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">In addition to the support targeted directly at electricity production, a series of practical supports have been put in place to encourage domestic and commercial electricity consumers to change towards renewable energy technologies.  This year saw the introduction of a five- year €27 million greener homes programme which provides grants for domestic renewable heat technologies; a five-year €22 million bio-heat programme, providing grants for commercial investments in wood pellet and wood chip boilers; an €11 million grant programme for combined heat and power to encourage industry and commercial users to generate their own electricity and heat; and a new excise relief programme for bio-fuels valued at more than €200 million to commence the development of sustainable fuels in the transport sector.  These are the support systems for the here and now, evidence of the importance the Government attaches to the development of renewable energy, and a strong indicator of where the focus of our attention must be over the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Advancing the sustainability agenda runs much further than protecting the environment.  Increased use of renewable energy is central to security of supply, providing diversity in our fuel mix and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels.  This is the great strength of the policy paths set out in the Green Paper, that the policies and actions in it are designed to interact and reinforce one another in a coherent way.  We have one of the richest potential renewable energy resources in Europe — wind, ocean and bio-energy.  In addition to sponsoring and advancing the existing technologies, we must also look to the future and develop further renewable sources and technologies with an eye on 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Earlier this year, the new Irish Energy Research Council was established.  The council, which includes leading academics and prominent industry figures, will co-ordinate energy research in Ireland.  It will advise not only on the development of policy for energy research but also on priorities for Irish energy research and on integrating energy research policy with policies for the transport, environment, agriculture, enterprise, science and education sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">By 2020, Ireland should be the world leader in ocean energy technology, which is a challenging target. The hydraulics and maritime research centre in UCC has been upgraded and an ocean energy test site has been established off the coast of Spiddal, County Galway, to test prototype ocean powered devices.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_427">Our ocean energy strategy is aimed to position us at the cutting edge of development involving research and development, prototype testing and commercialisation targeted for 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Bio-energy is another renewable area where we have the potential to make a significant difference to our energy mix.  Bio-energy is energy from crops, trees, sawdust, and by-products such as tallow, farm wastes and waste vegetable oil.  These can be converted to produce electricity, transport fuels or heating fuels.  In the case of heating fuels, biomass energy can be considerably less expensive than conventional fuels such as oil or electricity.  As a clean fuel, it reduces harmful CO2 emissions, thereby protecting the environment and helping Ireland meet its Kyoto obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">The development of bio-energy resources impacts on our energy security in terms of the development of an indigenous energy resource as well as contributing to competitiveness by creating employment opportunities and, in some cases, lowering energy costs to industry and domestic users.  It also has a wider impact by facilitating rural development by providing new opportunities for farmers and foresters to diversify into the growing of energy crops or plantations.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">A bio-energy ministerial task force, chaired by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has been established to develop a national bio-fuels strategy.  The task force members include the Tánaiste, and the Ministers for Finance, Agriculture and Food, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Transport and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Taoiseach's office is also represented on the task force.  The task force has agreed to draw up a comprehensive national bio-energy action plan by the end of the year, which will set ambitious targets for deployment of bio-energy, identify priority areas for development and the necessary support measures to encourage supply and demand.  This strategy will be formulated in the light of EU developments and will take account of the Green Paper on energy consultation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Energy efficiency is a key part of the Government's energy policy and a crucial element of a sustainable energy policy which has direct impacts on the challenges of security of supply and competitiveness.  It is also a major priority on both EU and international agendas.  The national Power of One campaign, launched last month, has been created with one single overriding objective: to achieve real and measurable change in consumer awareness and behaviour towards energy efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">Meaningful improvements in levels of energy efficiency will help consumers and the economy to control the costs of energy.  That is good for the consumer and business and makes profound sense for the economy.  That is why the Government is intent on engaging with and motivating individual citizens to take action and reduce the impacts of energy consumption.  With strong leadership the public attitude to wasting energy can be changed, much the same as attitudes have been dramatically changed in recent times with regard to smoking in the workplace or the use of plastic bags.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The Green Paper suggests a quantifiable target of a 20% reduction in energy demand by 2020.  Achieving this will mean a change in behaviour and attitudes right across wider society.  The Power of One campaign will run for an initial two-year period and involves a major advertising and media campaign supported by an extensive communications programme.  The concept of Power of One is that the sum of individual effort by consumers as well as enterprise can and will make a substantial difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The publication of the Green Paper on energy commenced a two-month period of debate and consultation, a phase of the policymaking process which is very important.  This presents a unique opportunity for the stakeholders at every level in the industry and right across wider society to comment and make an input into the development of an energy strategy which will deliver for the future.  The Green Paper sets out a range of questions on which we are especially interested in hearing the views of stakeholders, but we will welcome all and any comments offered.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Consultation and discussion in the Oireachtas is an integral part of this phase.  I therefore again welcome the input from parliamentary colleagues, in particular the support set out in the motion before the House.  I appreciate Members' interest in debating the Green Paper so soon after publication.  This helps all of us to highlight the importance of energy policy to the public and to bring the consultation process into public view.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The policy choices and targets set out in the Green Paper are designed to combine in a coherent way to shape the future of the energy sector positively and improve its contribution to competitiveness and well-being.  In 2020 Ireland will be a fully sustainable, secure, efficient, affordable and competitive all-island energy market, supporting environmental, economic and social policy objectives.  The market will have secure and reliable energy supplies, competitive prices and cleaner and more diverse energy sources underpinned by robust interconnection, optimum infrastructure and ambitious technology investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The Green Paper is the blueprint for creating an energy sector which will deliver for consumers, the economy and all our citizens.  We must move from proposed directions to a definitive policy framework.  More importantly, we must identify and put in place the practical actions and targets that will enable Ireland to achieve a sustainable energy future.  Consultation is a key part of this process and this evening the Senate is making a key contribution to the necessary public debate.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_170">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_438">One could not be against the motion in a deeply felt way because, given the way it normally does business, it is good the Government is doing something.  However, one would love to get to the stage of having some sense of the sights being raised to a real vision of the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">I concede that the target of 30% of electricity generation from renewable sources by 2020 is a serious and demanding target.  However, this is only because of the enormous shock of the past six months which caused those in Government to think again about what was obviously going to happen sooner or later — a sudden, perhaps irreversible, rise in the price of oil.  It is not that long ago that oil sold on the international market for $15 to $20 a barrel.  This was spectacularly cheaper than it was before the first oil crisis in 1973.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">It appears that public policy in Ireland was based on the assumption that these conditions would continue and that oil prices were not an issue.  I do not know how that policy emerged, because there were significant indicators that this could not be the case.  Kyoto alone suggested that our view of energy consumption, based on an eternal supply of cheap oil and gas, was not a viable option.  We ignored that.  Therefore, because we are late, the 30% target by 2020 is demanding, given the lead time needed to improve technology, plan, raise capital, design and build etc.  Despite what has been written about the ESB, there is probably no agency in this country — or perhaps in the world — that can do this job better than it.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">According to the National Competitiveness Council's reports, in terms of peer group comparisons the ESB does not do a bad job, one of the reasons being that electricity generation is an enormously capital intensive operation.  This means labour costs are significant but not central to it.  Therefore, the fact the ESB is more heavily manned than some believe it should be does not have a critical determination.  The availability of capital and the capacity to work within budget and deliver within previously estimated capital costs is a characteristic of the ESB which is not shared by public procurement generally.  It has long been my view that the ESB should take over project management for the entire public capital programme because it is good at this.  We would then see serious value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">We are a strange country and the Government is, perhaps, a strange manifestation of this strange country because we develop high-flown hissy fits of environmental sanctimony.  We had ourselves convinced for years that we were environmentally unique in Europe — the cleanest, greenest, freshest country.  However, it turns out we have significant dirty water.  The reason we are not worse is that we were latecomers to industrialisation.  Our capacity to manage sewerage alone would disgrace us.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">The same is true with regard to energy.  We created energy by very dirty processes and let the ESB — which I have said I admire — away with murder in places like Moneypoint for years.  Our great good fortune was that the prevailing south-westerly winds blew everything away and we did not have to worry.  The resulting pollution did damage in western Europe, but fortunately for us our neighbouring island got all the blame on account of being responsible for 90% of it while we were only responsible for 10%.  We were able to continue to talk about our beautiful clean island.  However, we were not very clean; we were fortunate through luck and by accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Some of our sins and omissions are now coming back to haunt us via the Kyoto Agreement and the need for us to meet some target.  What I find hair-raising and what disturbs and distresses me is that we are close to second last in the EU 15 league in terms of supply of energy from renewable sources, with only the British at a lower level.  Sweden has an advantage because it has significant hydro resources.  In 2004, Denmark was at 15% while Ireland was at approximately 2%.  Denmark has no mountains to speak of and therefore does not have great hydro resources but it used the resource it had and is now a world leader in wind energy.  Ireland was so busy pretending that the oil would always be there in vast quantities that we took no steps to encourage investment in research in wind energy.  Denmark is now making huge sums of money out of the international sales of wind generation equipment.  We decided we were far too rich to be concerned about these things and now we are caught.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">Some of this information comes from the National Competitiveness Council.  Transport is very energy intensive and it consumes as much energy as domestic heating.  The proportion of our population which travels by road is very high, as is the proportion of our freight travelling by road which is very high by European standards.  The consequence of high intensity road travel and road freight is high volumes of emissions and high volumes of energy use.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">I am in complete agreement with Senator Mansergh.  The idea that we would have a public policy focused on the reduction in the use of energy, diversification of energy resources and a reduction in the environmental impact of energy transformation while at the same time allowing our national rail services to divest themselves entirely of freight is a contradiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I referred this morning to contradictions in public policy, with the idea of An Post deciding that it would ignore toll roads and go around them.  I condemn the idea of Iarnród Éireann opting out of the use of renewable energy and of transporting freight because it does not want it while our roads are clogged and overloaded with excessive numbers of trucks.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The Green Paper is welcome but outside the area of energy generation, it is quite limited, almost pathetically so, in the targets and aspirations.  This suggests to me that somebody knew something about the ESB and beyond that, they could only think up a few hopeful targets and go on from there.  I regard the Fine Gael amendment to the motion as being much more welcome.</p>

        <speech by="#AnnOrmonde" eId="spk_171">
          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_449">I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this debate and congratulate him and his Department on this impressive, wide-ranging Green Paper on energy.  This is an issue that has many different facets and has serious implications for the future of the country and the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Energy policy strikes at the heart of practically every activity undertaken in the State.  It has implications for businesses of all shapes and sizes, for companies considering locating in Ireland, for meeting our Kyoto obligations and for the level of inflation.  With this in mind, it is vital to have an energy policy that embraces all these distinct aspects and the Minister has managed to achieve this with the Green Paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">It is obvious that the energy outlook is going to change considerably in the medium to long-term future.  Over the next 25 years, it is expected that global energy needs will grow by approximately 50% because of economic growth and population increases.  This growth, added to a continuing decline in fossil fuel supplies, will create obvious energy problems and possibly as soon as the next decade.  Energy demand is expected to grow by 2% to 3% every year until 2020 and most of that demand will need to be met by imported fossil fuels.  Ireland is almost completely reliant on outside factors for our fossil fuel needs.  If shipments of oil and the piping of gas into Ireland were stopped in the morning, our economy would grind to a halt.  It would not take much longer before large tracts of the population would have to make do without their heating and lighting.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">This is not a situation we should dismiss lightly, especially in light of what happened earlier this year in Russia and Ukraine and the subsequent stand-off over gas prices.  That incident created major fears throughout western Europe about gas supply.  If Russia decided to stop supplying the West tomorrow, there would be considerable strain on gas supplies throughout the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">I was encouraged to read that large parts of the Green Paper focused on developing renewable energy sources.  It is true the current technology does not allow for the widespread use of renewable energy sources.  Wind energy offers great promise but the change in wind velocity in any location means that it would result in an inconsistent wind supply.  Wave energy offers a more consistent source, but the technology in this area still needs further development.  This will not continue to be the case.  The technology will improve, especially if there is a desire to use it.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">By setting an ambitious target of having 30% of all energy coming from renewable sources by 2020, the Government is helping to generate that desire.  As well as protecting our environment and reducing our carbon emissions, the added benefit of renewable energy sources is that they are secure.  If we rely on the wind or the waves for our energy, we will not be dependent on other countries continuing to send supplies to us.  However, we will also need to improve our level of energy efficiency, which is an area that needs radical improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I suggest the introduction of energy saving bulbs as the standard throughout the country and the possible phasing out of the existing bulb types.  I suggest greater clarity in energy bills by the indication of the cost of unit per time of day.  This would help to further promote efficient energy use.  The reduction of carbon emissions is another area of concern.  I would like to see more of our electricity generating plants moving to a cleaner standard and reducing their emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I was concerned about the reports of an upcoming rise in ESB and Bord Gáis prices.  While I accept that the regulator felt the need to ensure these semi-State companies continued to be financially self-sufficient, an increase of about 20% or more is a little excessive, given the recent drop in international oil and gas prices.  I ask the Minister of State to ask the regulator to take another look at this price increase in the new year if oil and gas prices continue to drop.  There is no point in the ESB or Bord Gáis generating huge profits if this is coming out of the pockets of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">I am delighted the Government has taken the lead in this issue.  The Green Paper is a brainstorming exercise.  I have an interest in the area of bio-energy which means using crops, trees and farm waste as a source of energy, even though I know very little about bio-energy.  Consumer awareness needs to be created.  I welcome the establishment of a task force.  The Green Paper will be the basis for consultations.  Young people and those interested in studying science should be given an opportunity to debate this issue.  The Green Paper has stimulated my interest in examining how best we can move forward and try to bring about better efficiency in the energy area.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_172">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_458">I wish to make a few comments on the motion and to refer to the possibility of bio-fuel production in the former sugar factory in Mallow.  On the broader issue of alternative energy, I welcome the Government's timely Green Paper on energy.  From a public policy point of view, there is possibly no greater issue facing the country than that of energy.  Virtually every country in the European Union faces the same challenges we face and we must ensure that our support for and development of alternative energy matches the best in Europe.  Through the use of wind, wave, geothermal and solar power, we must seek to become the leading exponent of alternative energy.  We have the natural resources if we can put them to correct use.  Significant investment will be needed by the Government and the first step must be taken in the forthcoming budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">I acknowledge some progress was made in last year's budget by providing tax incentives and the energy grants announced some time later gave further incentive.  I congratulate the Minister on the energy grants scheme operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland.  I, along with many others, had demanded such a scheme.  There has been significant uptake of the alternative energy grants.  I hope that once the initial €20 million has been allocated, the fund will be topped up.  Moving householders to alternative energy systems, including wood pellet, geothermal and solar, is good for the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">I wish to speak about alternative fuels and, in particular, ethanol production.  The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, who has responsibility for labour, is aware of the difficulty we have had in Mallow following closure of the sugar factory and Greencore's failure to resolve the redundancy issue.  We have an unused sugar factory in Mallow, thousands of farmers affected to some degree, hundreds of redundant workers and an industry that has disappeared, namely, the sugar beet industry.  However, we have an opportunity to turn disaster into progress and to produce ethanol in Mallow.  Obviously, there were doubts over whether it was purely aspirational to do so.  Fortunately, our colleagues in Cork County Council, with full cross-party support, commissioned an independent consultant's report on the viability of producing ethanol at the former sugar factory in Mallow.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Cooley Clearpower Research submitted its report to the council three weeks ago.  The report clearly shows it would be possible to produce ethanol in Mallow from sugar beet, wheat and other crops.  Equally importantly, it also showed that it can be economically viable to do so.  We are all aware that sugar beet, wheat and other crops being produced in Ireland can be used to produce ethanol.  However, we must ensure that it is financially viable for the farmers to grow the crops and for a producer to take over the plant and process the crop into ethanol.  The study contains very interesting statistics and I hope the relevant Departments are studying the report.  The report shows that with modest excise duty reductions, even below the levels available in the rest of Europe now, it would be possible to pay the farmers a viable price for sugar beet to be processed into ethanol in Mallow.  We have both European obligations and obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to ensure that a certain percentage of our fuel supply will come from the use of ethanol or bio-diesel and Mallow offers a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The Irish tillage industry is at the point of crisis and collapse as a result of the ending of sugar beet production.  Unless we can find a use for sugar beet and farmers can continue to grow it for financial reasons and for crop rotation, the entire tillage industry could shut down and thousands of jobs could disappear with it.  In preparing his budget, I hope the Minister for Finance, in consultation with the Ministers for Agriculture and Food, and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, will study in great detail the consultant's report on the possible use of the sugar factory at Mallow for ethanol production and give the financial incentives, which are modest by international standards and modest by the standard of the incentives announced in last year's budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">If the Government is willing to have the plant converted into a bio-fuel production facility, it can happen.  By doing so, we can ensure that sugar beet continues to be grown, crop rotation can be maintained, thousands of spin-off jobs from the tillage industry can be maintained and, from the broader view of the economy, we can produce a crop for fuel purposes.  We need to be as ambitious as countries such as Sweden which has declared that within ten to 15 years, it will be entirely free of a dependency on foreign fuels, oil in particular.  We must have a similar aspiration.  We must aim to be the best in Europe in the area of alternative fuel.  I know that Senator Callanan, who is also interested in the subject, will confirm that we can do the business in Mallow.  We can turn sugar beet into a valuable fuel commodity.  I hope the Minister for Finance will use December's budget to introduce the tax incentives which could make that project a reality.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_173">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_464">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I very much welcome the publication of this Green Paper, Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland.  I strongly support the grants and incentives for alternative and renewable energy.  Senator O'Toole asked about the availability of wood pellets and wood chips.  I know they are available in north Galway and I hope they are available throughout the country.  The grants for alternative energy should be made available for other projects, for example, windmills and heat pumps.  It is important to consider such areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Controversy has arisen with regard to wind farms.  I do not think they destroy the environment but believe they can be very effective when located in isolated areas.  Some years ago, an attempt to construct a wind farm on Inis Meáin was opposed, but when I visited the island last year, I saw that the wind farm had been developed in an environmentally friendly manner.  If wind farms can be successful on a small island, they can also be built in other parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">There have been well publicised reports on the dangers of constructing wind farms close to houses.  People have described the sound from the turbines as being similar to an aircraft hovering overhead.  Wind farms are obviously located too close to houses when they affect television reception, but similar concerns were expressed about mobile telephone masts.  Proper development and planning should require that any such installations are located away from houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">The Minister of State referred to volatility in oil and gas prices which is a significant obstacle to devising sustainable policies and predicting world energy trends.  In recent months, we have seen the way in which energy prices first rose, then fell.  The Government has set a commendable target of producing 30% of Ireland's electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020, which represents a doubling of the 2010 target.  I welcome that target and hope we will be able to achieve it.  The other target of achieving a 20% reduction in energy demand by 2020 is also important.  The Power of One campaign has been successful in publicising this issue.  I hope we will be able to build an interconnector with other countries to ensure electricity supplies.  With regard to housing, the greener homes campaign has been very effective in encouraging people to switch to energy efficient options such as insulation and low wattage bulbs.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I welcome the reference in the Green Paper to the three pillars, namely, security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness.  With regard to security of supply, I hope we will be able to bring gas ashore to supply the entire country.  The north west felt excluded in the past and that is one of the reasons for the protests against the Corrib project.  It will be important for us to address greenhouse gas emissions and I hope we can provide incentives to do so while remaining conscious of the Kyoto Protocol.  It is also important that we implement mechanisms which provide for competition and a liberalised regime for gas and electricity.  I welcome the Green Paper because it will provide the path towards Ireland's sustainable energy future.</p>

        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_174">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_469">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, to the House.  It is appropriate that he is here because alternative energy is closely associated with the use of agricultural land to produce fuel.  At the Fianna Fáil seminar in Westport this summer, an eminent expert in this field said that as long as the sun shines, we will be able to produce sufficient energy to sustain the economy.  All energy, whether oil, gas, turf or coal, originally came from the energy produced by the sun.  It was encouraging to consider the various options for energy production.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">The policy brought forward by the Government is worthwhile in terms of planning for the future.  Bord na Móna also has an important role to play by making use of the extensive resources contained in our cutaway bogs.  Research is being conducted with a view to situating wind farms in the middle of bogs.  Elephant grass could also be grown on some cutaway bogs, as well as on the land formerly used to grow sugar beet.  More research should be conducted with regard to producing tidal energy.  French researchers have undertaken several successful projects in that regard and Ireland has massive potential for harnessing tidal power, especially along the west coast.  I welcome the Green Paper and commend the Government on producing it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_175">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_471">I am glad of the opportunity to discuss the Green Paper on energy and to support the Fine Gael amendment to the Government's motion.  The Green Paper is a case of too little, too late and we will not know for some time whether it will bring any changes to our energy supplies.  The policies it proposes should have been introduced a number of years ago because we are now faced with continual energy price increases.  I do not want to be overly critical because there have been some positive developments, such as the energy grants announced by the Government several months ago.  However, the paper is heavy on aspirations and low on detailed policies.  It is disappointing that we were not given much by way of detailed costings or concrete information.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">It is not often I agree with Senator Leyden, but he made some valid comments about the potential for renewable energy supplies.  I have been a vocal advocate for developing wind energy and have spoken several times in this House about the difficulties faced in terms of connecting wind farms to the electricity grid.  These difficulties continue to arise throughout the country.  While wind farms need to be strategically positioned, they should be developed where a suitable location is available.  For wind energy to become a viable option, we need to build a direct interconnector between the east coast of Ireland and the island of Britain.  That should be done sooner rather than later because, while wind energy makes up approximately 8% of energy supplies, another source of energy will be needed when the wind does not blow enough to meet requirements.  That is why the interconnector is essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">It is another example of where the Government is sadly lagging behind.  It set up a process a number of year ago whereby tenders were sought for the construction of an interconnector between Wicklow and Wales, but nobody from the private sector seemed to be interested at the time.  It is essential the Government builds that interconnector as part of the State's infrastructure sooner rather than later.  If we are serious about providing alternative energy sources, then wind and tide energy will be part of it.  Those energy sources are not 100% reliable and we need an interconnector to ensure that if there are periods in which those sources of energy are low, external sources are available to fill the gap.  The interconnector is, therefore, more necessary now than ever.  Whatever about the interconnector being operated and managed by a private company, its construction should be part of public infrastructure.  We should grasp that nettle sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">It is important we promote and support those trying to advance alternative energy sources.  Previous speakers spoke about bio-fuels, an area on which I have spoken several times in the House.  We saw the closure of the sugar plants in my area of Carlow and in Cork and the demise of that industry.  A detailed report has been carried out by Cork County Council in conjunction with others into the viability of an ethanol production plant on the site of the old sugar factory in Mallow.  As Senator Bradford said, that report warrants analysis and I hope that in the run up to the budget, it is thoroughly examined to see if there are any supports which the Government could provide to ensure bio-fuel production takes off.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Until now, we have not seen much take-up and that is largely due to the fact there is no incentive for producers.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, will agree with me that from an agriculture point of view, we need to ensure we provide for alternative enterprises among those involved in farming and those who we wish to become involved in it in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">Bio-fuel is an area which has not been sufficiently developed and there is still great potential.  The budget will provide the Government with an opportunity to encourage more people to go down that route in future.  There is a strong case to be made for the complete exemption of bio-fuels from excise duty.  I have not made up my mind on that but I urge the Government to examine all options in the run-up to the budget because the only way we will get sufficient numbers to become involved and to build up a viable bio-fuels industry is if there is a monetary incentive for them to become involved in that sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">It is important we become more reliant on indigenous sources of energy.  In that regard, it is essential bio-fuels, wind energy and all other energy options which we can produce are thoroughly pursued and supported by the Government when it comes to drafting the budget which will take place in the coming weeks.  We are too reliant on fossil fuels and we need to develop all other options.  In terms of the supply and cost of energy in future, we must ensure we have a viable domestic energy sector.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterCallanan" eId="spk_176">
          <from>Mr. Callanan</from>
          <p eId="para_478">I welcome the Minister of State.  I support the motion and welcome the Green Paper which lays downs all the road markings we require to follow for the White Paper.  It is a pity the House may divide on the motion.  The three pillars listed in the Green Paper are security of supply, environmental sustainability and economic competitiveness.  We talk about the all-Ireland approach which is essential in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The Cathaoirleach might remember that some time ago, I called for a debate on alternative land use.  This is it whether we like it or not.  On a number of occasions, I have referred to land for food and land for energy.  Whatever route we go down in future, it will be based on what land can produce and what we can do with land.  We can have wind energy and the sea can be used for wave energy.  I congratulate University College Cork on the studies and research it has carried out and I hope it will bring them to a successful and speedy conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Since I have spoken about land use for food and energy, I wish to say the EU is wrong in regard to food and is also wrong in regard to energy.  There is a total dependence on nuclear energy or gas from Russia.  We are at that end of the line, so it is essential we establish a sustainable supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">I welcome the fact anaerobic digestion has been mentioned in the Green Paper.  I have referred to it over recent years with little or no support.  People have done studies on it, including John Curtis of the Environmental Protection Agency in Wexford.  He has conducted a detailed study on it and has referred to the benefits of it relative to the environment as well as agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I refer to miscanthus and short rotation coppice.  That is a very good idea but it will need to be grant aided.  I am somewhat doubtful about miscanthus and the amount of aid of it will require.  However, if aid is provided, the best of luck to it.  I call for the removal of excise duties on what we produce from the land.</p>

This has confirmed that the ESB will remain the dominant force in the energy area for the foreseeable future.  I also welcome the decision to press ahead with renewables, especially ocean energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">I express our appreciation for the work the ESB has done at Moneypoint where more than 300 people are employed.  The station is worth €25 million per annum to the local economy and we would like to see it develop.  I compliment the people working there on cleaning up the coal technology to ensure the station complies with environmental requirements.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanKenneally" eId="spk_179">
          <from>Mr. Kenneally</from>
          <p eId="para_486">I thank the Minister of State and Members who contributed to the debate.  By and large, most of the contributions were constructive.  I was a little surprised an amendment was tabled because the objective of the motion was to generate debate on energy.  One theme ran through everybody's contribution, namely, the need for incentives to encourage new participants into the field of renewable energy.  The Minister of State outlined what is being done at present.  The clear message is that we need to do more to encourage development in renewable energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Some Fine Gael Members referred to costings.  I am open to correction but I do not remember costings ever appearing in a Green Paper.  Another Member also referred to policy.  A Green Paper is not a policy document.  Its purpose is to generate a consultation process which will continue for another two months, after which a White Paper will be produced.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">References were made to energy cost increases.  This may be a little outside the scope of what we are discussing but it is important to note that energy costs are largely guided by outside factors.  We import most of our gas from the UK, which is itself a net importer of gas.  At this stage 90% of our energy requirements is imported.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">We are exposed to an increasing number of challenges.  The Irish Wind Energy Association has outlined that Ireland is facing faster energy growth than other EU countries due to the growth in population, economic output from the industrial and agricultural sectors and dependence on fossil fuels.  As a result, Ireland faces a rise in greenhouse gas emissions beyond the EU agreed limit of 13%.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The Green Paper does not fail to address Ireland's key energy challenges.  The same study to which Fine Gael Members referred, that of Friends of the Earth Europe, identified some of the key energy challenges.  One challenge is to reduce emissions in industry.  The Green Paper proposes how Ireland will contribute to the national climate change strategy.  A ministerial task force on bio-energy is to be established.  The national bio-energy plan will be finalised and an all-Ireland research and development programme will be developed to increase efficiency and thereby to reduce energy costs from pollution.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">It is also outlined in the Green Paper that an action plan is to be developed on energy efficiency, that gas and electricity supply will be secured and that competiveness is to be increased.  To increase the rate of renewable energy, the Green Paper outlines the efforts to be made in research and development of bio-energy.  The Green Paper policy would reduce our reliance on imported fuels and drive down the cost of energy by, for example, developing an all-Ireland energy market and opening up the market, diversifying gas sources and setting up the national oil reserve agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">The Government is setting objectives to increase the conversion of bio-fuels in public transport.  In April 2005 a scheme of excise reliefs on bio-fuel projects was announced by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of Finance.  Pilot projects proposed as part of Transport 21 will complement this strategy.  The Government welcomes suggestions to improve the paper on sustainable energies such as some of those made by Fine Gael.  It is clear that through discussing the policies outlined in this paper, Ireland's national energy landscape can be transformed.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">The Green Paper proposes to secure and control energy in Ireland through sustainability, competitiveness and supply.  Consequently, this would help us meet the targeted greenhouse gas emissions level and put Ireland on the international map in terms of its efforts against global warming.  I look forward to future discussions in the House on this matter.  I thank everybody who contributed to the debate.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_540">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_541">That Seanad Éireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion, provided by Article 1.11 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, to notify the President of the Council that it wishes to take part in the adoption of the following proposed measure:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_542">Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of passenger name record (PNR) data by air carriers to the United States Department of Homeland Security,</p>
          <p eId="para_543">a copy of which proposed measure was laid before Seanad Éireann on 10 October 2006.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_181">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_544">I am grateful to be afforded the opportunity to speak to this House this evening on the important question of PNR, passenger name record.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">We were all deeply shocked at events of 11 September 2001.  Since then terrorist attacks in London and Madrid have made us aware that terrorism is a global problem that affects both Europe and the US.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">The US has radically revised internal security procedures with a view to protecting their citizens from terror attacks.  We share the concerns of the US authorities but there must be a balance between curtailing terror attacks and maintaining the rights of individual citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">The events of 11 September 2001 heightened awareness of the vulnerabilities in the area of aviation.  As part of their anti-terrorism security measures following these events, the US authorities enacted legislation providing that air carriers operating flights to, from and within United States territory would have to provide the US authorities with electronic access to the data contained in their reservation and departure systems.  The information is described as passenger name records, PNR.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">Identification of potentially high risk passengers through PNR data analysis provides states and aircraft operators with a capacity to improve aviation security, to enhance national and border security, to prevent and combat terrorist acts and related crimes and other serious crimes that are transnational in nature, including organised crime.  It protects the vital interests of passengers and the general public.  PNR data helps expedite customs and immigration at airports and facilitates and safeguards legitimate passenger traffic.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The European Union has been working with the US authorities to ensure the personal data of European citizens are appropriately protected in the US.  An agreement was negotiated on behalf of the European Commission with the agreement of the member states and was signed in Washington DC on 28 May 2004.  It entered into effect on the same day.  The transfer of PNR data has been taking place within the framework of that agreement and a decision taken by the European Commission under EU data protection legislation and undertakings given to the Commission by the US authorities limiting the use to which the data would be put to protect the rights of EU citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">The European Parliament decided to refer this agreement to the European Court of Justice seeking its annulment.  In a judgment delivered on 30 May 2006, the Court of Justice annulled the decision of the Council of Ministers.  The court decided that there was no appropriate legal basis for the Council decision approving the conclusion of the agreement with the USA or for the Commission decision.  Essentially, it was the view of the court that the main objective involved was concerned with security matters and, accordingly, a First Pillar legal base was incorrect.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">In delivering its decision, the Court of Justice decided that the agreement should remain applicable until 30 September for reasons of legal certainty and to protect persons concerned and to give the Commission and the member states time to discuss and agree on a solution to the question of the legal basis for the agreement.  This, in turn, means the position of travellers from the European Union to the United States remained unchanged until 30 September 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">There was a slight slippage in meeting the 30 September deadline.  However, after lengthy negotiations the EU Presidency has produced the text of the new agreement with the US and a draft Council decision.  The new agreement does not differ to any significant degree from the old agreement except that it has a different legal basis.  I must stress that it offers the same safeguards and protections for EU citizens. In order to maintain transatlantic travel Aer Lingus, in common with other EU airlines, has continued to supply the PNR data with the full knowledge of the intending passengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The 34 individual data items are available for citizens to peruse on the Internet.  Full details of the PNR undertakings of the US Department of Homeland Security are also available on the Internet. Furthermore, there has been very little negative feedback about PNR from airline users.  I have been assured by the Office of the Attorney General that there are no data protection issues involved in continuing to supply the US authorities with this data.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">For Ireland to take part in the agreement the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas is required under Article 29.4.6° of the Constitution.  In the case of some of our European partners a similar parliamentary process will not be necessary.  It is hoped the new agreement will be agreed at the Committee of Permanent Representatives in Brussels tomorrow and formally come into force at an EU Council Meeting early next week.  It is essential that Ireland join with our European partners in participating in this agreement.  For the information of the House, this motion was passed by the Dáil this afternoon.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_183" as="#Leas-Chathaoirleach">
          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_556">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to the House.  Fine Gael agrees with the motion and we do not intend to hold up its passage in the House.  I note the Minister of State stated the motion was passed by the other House.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">There are a few questions on the matter I want to pose to the Minister of State.  We all realise this has come as a result of the events of 11 September 2001.  When travelling the world one likes to know who is sitting in the next seat, that the airlines are safe and that all the safety measures are being put in place.  Everybody would concur with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">We often wonder what our Members of the European Parliament do.  We should congratulate them in this regard because the Commission had decided to enter into this agreement but our MEPs decided to refer it to the European Court of Justice.  We should thank them for their diligence in this matter. The European Court of Justice found that there was no legal basis for the Commission to sign the agreement because, first, it was a security issue and, second, the protection within the United States for the data transferred was not adequately secured.  On the second issue, I hope the protection within the United States of the data transferred will be adequately secured and the Minister of State should spell out to the House that such will be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Will each country sign up independently to this agreement or will the European Union sign on behalf of all the countries?  What is the position if one country decides not to sign up to the agreement?  Would that mean there would not be an agreement or can each country sign its own agreement on the matter with the United States?</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Everybody agrees there is a price to pay for security but I hope safeguards are in place to protect data.  Will other US agencies have access to this information?  Could the information be leaked or sold to companies for profit?  People are worried because, for example, they receive unsolicited mail from companies and they wonder how the companies get their names and other personal details.  Will the Minister of State guarantee that all personal information obtained by the US authorities will be protected and such protection will be enforced thoroughly?  The Houses are passing a motion on behalf of the people and assuring them this will be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">I have no great objection to the motion because a price must be paid for security.  The travelling public likes to know proper security measures are in place and we do not want a repeat of the 11 September attack.  However, every terrorist attack does not take place in the US.  For example, the alleged plot in London emerged in recent months.  Will the information flow be reciprocated by the US so that details about US passengers travelling to Ireland or elsewhere in Europe will be made available?  Who will control information on this side of the Atlantic?  Will the flow of information be reciprocated by the US, given that the motion addresses only information being passed between Europe and the US and not <i>vice versa</i>?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_184">
          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_562">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the recognition of the democratic process resulting from Members of the European Parliament identifying a deficiency in the methodology underpinning the legislative process.  It is important that we should address issues affecting our citizens, albeit in this case it is being done in a European context.  This demonstrates the importance of maintaining a watching brief on the European Commission and the Council of Ministers to ensure citizens are kept as up to date as possible of decisions taken.  That is important in helping people to understand the important role played by the EU in their lives and that they have an important ongoing function in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">The business of war has changed significantly since 11 September 2001.  The growth in global terrorism signalled by that incident has required all stable democracies to enact laws, regulations or rules to best protect their citizens.  This regulation is a natural extension of that requirement.  However, I recognise the importance of securing data to protect the people who own these data.  In this case, the data will be in the hands of a third party.  No new information will be required in the PNR profile by airlines.  The regulation is concerned with the transfer of the information and no additional information is needed.  However, the use of the information raises a number of issues and Senator Paddy Burke is correct that a global marketing database should not be generated on the basis of information provided by the travelling public.  That would be a hugely valuable tool and it would be intrusive if it were used by marketing companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">Earlier this week, serious complaints were made about the misuse of information about people with maturing SSIA accounts.  While this is a separate matter, it relates to the protection of data.  People have been contacted by marketing companies in their homes in the evening in an effort to sell services on the basis of maturing SSIA accounts.  The financial institutions suggest they have not passed on this data but it is clear the data have been passed on.  It is critical that the necessary safeguards should be put in place.  With regard to airline passengers, information about their travel patterns and travel frequency could be extremely useful to a company from a marketing point of view and it could gain a competitive advantage.  This should not happen under this regulation.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure through our permanent EU representatives and the Council of Ministers that the Irish travelling public will be protected from such intrusive activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Concerns have been expressed about the Big Brother element of the regulation.   I am not so concerned about that because the information will be in the possession of a third party, but it is important that other agencies with access to it, but which do not need it, should not misuse it.  We all acknowledge the necessity for the use of this information but its misuse concerns everybody.  All right-minded people who travel on a regular basis want to ensure the greatest protection is afforded to those who fly.  Given the changes in global terrorism, it must be ensured aircraft are not misused, since this has become such a common phenomenon.  The apparatus of war has changed and it is totally based on the knowledge age.  Counter terrorism measures, particularly for surveillance operations, require that all the knowledge available is used.  It was important to see how the UK authorities used information recently to prevent a well orchestrated plan to carry out mass destruction in the air.  I strongly support the measures being taken while recognising the Government has taken into account the various difficulties that could arise through the misuse of information.  I am sure the Minister of State and our permanent representatives in Brussels will ensure the data are protected in the strongest way so that the travelling public will respect the decision being taken by the Houses today.  I wish the Minister of State well at the Council of Ministers meeting.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_185">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_566">I am the first Member, but perhaps I will not be the only Member, to object to this motion, first, because of the way it was bounced on the House without notice, second, it is being taken comparatively late in the business of the day, and, third, there are not enough Members present to have even a token vote.  This debate is a non-event.  It is not a real or full debate. It is a fig leaf to cover over this nonsense about democracy.  I listened with incredulity to Senator Dooley refer to the democracy of the European Union and the watchdog role of the European Parliament.  It is a very toothless watchdog.  It found out what was being done was illegal.  The matter was referred to the European Court of Justice and, in the interim, it continued doing it.  How democratic is that?  It is not democratic.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">The Minister of State's speech contained the usual ritual kowtowing in the direction of 9/11.  I am sick of this.  I agree it was a dreadful event.  The Minister of State was shocked, as we all were, at the events of 9/11.  Was he equally shocked by "shock and awe", the blitzkrieg on Iraq?  Was he shocked by the fact the United States Government seeks to practice torture of a manner not seen since the Gestapo?  It wants to legitimate the mass bombing of civilians, the incineration of women and children and the use of cluster bombs in Lebanon by its allies.  Do these practices not shock us any longer?  There have been at least 100,000 civilian casualties in Iraq.  Let us put on record who are the real terrorists.  They are those with whom we are again so cravenly collaborating.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">I accept it is possible the Americans have all this information already.  They have sneaked into our telephone records and our bank accounts, and now we are handing over passenger lists, which will be of no use to them.  They have already arrested people on the basis that they spoke Arabic, looked different and had Arabic names.  Is this how the information will be used?  Shame on the Americans.  If they want an end to this awful situation of terror, they should examine its direct causes.  There is no point playing around with the symptoms.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">This is not democracy; it is a fig leaf.  There should be a referendum in every European country with regard to handing over information to a deeply criminal regime, which is what the Bush regime is.  I do not dislike America.  I am one of America's best friends in this country because I tell the truth about what is going on there, as a growing number of Americans know.  It is a criminal regime.  What President Bush has managed to do is make America the most hated nation on the planet, despite it having been one of the most loved.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_571">Undertakings have been given to the European Commission by the US authorities.  They are not worth a damn.  We have listened to what Condeleezza Rice said about torture.  First, the US authorities do not seem to speak the same language.  Second, they seem incapable of telling the truth or confronting real moral or ethical issues.  I would not hand them any information about anything.  It is Big Brother.  The sooner we protect ourselves from it, the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">Apparently, the Attorney General has given advice that there is no problem in this regard.  How interesting.  Why is it that university candidates in elections are under such stringent restrictions in terms of dealing with a similar database?  Are the university elections more of a threat to security?</p>

          <p eId="para_574">That is the level of dishonesty that applies in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">I deplore this motion and the way it was bounced into the House.  I deplore the time of the debate, the lack of preparation, the lack of democracy and the fudge that covers over the utter democratic deficit in Europe that has been exposed in everything the Minister of State said.  I do not believe the motion is as innocent as suggested.  We are lickspittling yet again to a corrupt and criminal administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">I cannot understand how President Bush has not yet been impeached for breaking state law, federal law, constitutional law, international law and international human rights law.  This is the kind of person with whom we are dealing.  This is the administration to which we are handing over information about Irish citizens.  I oppose this.  There is no point calling a vote and I will not do so.  However, I want the record of the House to show that at least one voice spoke out passionately against this motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  There has been much deploring during the debate.  What I deplore most is the inability of people to travel freely and securely.  In the modern world, air travel and travel between states is becoming more common.  In bringing forward this type of motion, we must bear in mind several points.  When one books transport, one supplies one's name, which goes onto a ticket reservation.  In turn, one supplies a passport and the information is gathered by a third party.  It is not unreasonable in the climate in which we live that the country one enters would have an electronic record of who is entering that country.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">When one must balance the rights of freedom of movement of an individual against the security of that same person, one must always come down on the side of safety and security.  Security is not just the responsibility of states and state agencies.  It is equally the responsibility of all citizens of the state.  I do not know of anyone who objects to security measures that will make travel safer for everyone.  Perhaps Senator Norris and I would not be too concerned about travelling on the same aeroplane together — I would not have any concerns so long as we were in different seating.  However, Senator Norris must acknowledge that the common good must win through.  We would like to feel we are being made as secure as possible with the information provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Legitimate concerns have been raised by previous speakers with regard to how this data will be used.  I hope the safeguards which we are guaranteed will be upheld and that this information will not be used for incorrect purposes, such as marketing and so on, as outlined by Senator Dooley.  However, in the modern world security concerns have become more prevalent.  We would all prefer if we did not have to enforce border restrictions and could have freedom of movement.  Unfortunately, modern society does not allow us this freedom.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">I support security in the broadest sense with the aim that such security would enhance the security of all who travel.  Primarily, we are passing this motion in the interests of Irish people who travel and use airlines.  We have a responsibility to co-operate with other states, including the members of the European Union, to ensure we protect the rights of individuals.  Notwithstanding the points highlighted in the debate, I strongly welcome and support this measure.  We have a responsibility to the common good to support it and pass the motion.  Senator Norris has consistently raised issues within the broader issue of the war on terrorism but those issues are for other debates, which I am sure we will have in the future.  On this specific issue, it is in all our interests and we all have a responsibility to support the motion.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_581">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  Mar atá a fhios aige, is fear é go bhfuil an-mheas agam air.  Má deirim rudaí, ní rudaí atá dírithe go pearsanta ar an Aire atá i gceist agam in aon chor.  I have long association with the Minister of State.  We get on well and I have nothing but the height of personal respect and regard for him.  My party did not oppose the motion in the other House and I will not oppose it here.  However, it is a profoundly dishonest exercise.  It is dishonest in terms of terrorism, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">Let me make one thing clear.  Since I was elected to this House 25 years ago, the United States has been responsible for the deaths of more civilians by military activities run by people who were not the legitimate government of the state, than all terrorist organisations put together.  The US supported terrorism in Afghanistan against the legitimate government.  Whatever we thought of the Afghan Government, the US funded what in any other country would be called terrorism.  It funded campaigns of terrorism against the legitimate government of Nicaragua in which 50,000 people died.  I could go through a list of similar cases, so sanctimonious old cant from Washington D.C. about a moral superiority is just that, sanctimonious old cant.  The United States is as mired in people's blood as every other regime in the world, and it has become worse not better.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The alternative to this agreement is that individuals in countries with visa exemptions would have to apply for visas.  In that case, the United States would be entitled to seek as much information as it wanted from visa applicants.  To a degree, therefore, we are simply giving them the information that would otherwise be sought on individual visa applications.  One of my children is a student and it is probably just as well that he got a visa before this speech becomes public knowledge.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_192">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_584">It can always be withdrawn.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_193">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_585">They might do so, yes.  However, the detailed information that was sought during the application process for that student visa was extraordinary.  As we all know, the United States is an admirable country in its concepts and as regards the real values it claims to stand for.  The real tragedy and pain of the United States is the increasing gap between what it claims to stand for and what it really stands for.  That is one of the real moral difficulties.  I do not trust President Bush, Dick Cheney or Donald Rumsfeld with my data but I cannot do anything about it.  I will try to avoid going to the United States unless I have to do so for family reasons.  I do not trust them with my data because they abused the trust of their own citizens before the war and continue to do so during it.  There is no doubt that they have abused their executive powers and claimed they could do it in the name of the war against terror.  There is an increasing similarity between the war on terror and the mythology of Orwell's <i>1984</i> in which great victories were always being reported.  In that novel, war was going on consistently and was used to keep citizens in subjection.  The parallels are, quite frankly, terrifying.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">I wish to ask the Minister of State a few questions.  Is this agreement permanent?  Is it open-ended and will it go on forever?  George Bush has promised us that he is going to defeat terrorism.  If it is only about terrorism, therefore, this agreement should end when Bush defeats terrorism.  Or is it a fact, as many of us suspect, that the war on terror is an excuse for a permanent state of alertness — back again to <i>1984</i> — which justifies intrusions that otherwise would not be possible?  It also justifies the legalisation of torture by the country that claimed to be the defender of freedom in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Just before adjourning for the elections, the US Congress effectively legalised what we in Ireland understood as torture.  We argued with the European Court of Human Rights when it concluded that what was done during the first period of internment in Long Kesh was not torture because those involved did not enjoy it or do it for pleasure.  The Irish Government and its legal representatives believed it was torture, yet that is what the United States is now claiming it has the right to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I would like to know if this agreement is permanent.  Is this order subject to the Constitution?  Can I, as a citizen, challenge the order on the grounds that it is an intrusion on my constitutional rights?  Is it subject to the European Convention on Human Rights?  Can I challenge it on the grounds that it is an intrusion on my human rights?  Given that I would have to supply the data in order to apply for a visa, I will not oppose this agreement.  However, the fact that the European Commission through my Government is deciding that I have to do it, is a separate thing from providing the data voluntarily in a visa application.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">I raised this issue in the House on the first occasion this deal came up.  I asked when, in any referendum, I had given the European Community the power to negotiate this on my behalf.  We now know that it never had the power.  The scary aspect of the European project, although I support it, is that those involved presume they have the power.  There is also the scary fact that airlines told us the information had to be given.  The US authorities have the right to seek whatever information they want about anybody who is coming to visit the United States, in the same way we do.  That is why I cannot vote against the measure.  We are fairly good at it, too.  We give suspect immigrants every bit as hard a time as the United States does.  In fact, we are less generous.  However one comes to the United States, if one lives there and has a child, that child is an American citizen.  The United States never diluted that provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">We have been asked by a monstrous regime, which does not understand, defend or support democracy, to agree to something.  If we do not agree to it, the US authorities will be able to demand such details from individual citizens anyway.  The sensible thing to do is to give them the data.  It will make life a little bit easier for citizens on an individual level but it is a profound concession to a regime which deserves no concessions.  That regime has abandoned all the norms by which European liberal democracy regards the world and makes judgments.  We are being swept into their train, in particular in our views of the democratically elected Government in the Palestinian territories.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">There is a long list of other matters on which we have been swept up in the Americans' train.  Fundamentally, however, we might as well agree to this matter because if we do not they will demand it in visa applications.  Nonetheless, it is sinister, unpleasant and wrong.  The European Union made a profoundly anti-democratic decision when first time round it decided it had the authority to do this sort of thing without even consulting EU national Parliaments.  At least this time there will be some form of limited consultation.  I want to know, however, if the agreement is permanent or temporary.  If it is temporary, when will it be reviewed?  What is the status of the Irish Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights <i>vis-à-vis</i> the agreement?</p>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_194">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_592">I thank all the Senators who have contributed to this debate, irrespective of their views.  There has been general support for the measure from Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  I fully appreciate what Senator Ryan said about his position and while he has strong views on the matter, he is a realist.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">When I was listening to Senator Norris, I could not help thinking that I could have been one of the victims of the 9/11 attacks.  Those who are old enough can remember where they were when John F. Kennedy died.  We all remember where we were on 9/11.  I will share these facts with Members of the House.  I was at Shannon Airport on my way to the United States to attend an EU-US meeting as a Member of the European Parliament.  Some of my colleagues had travelled earlier from Brussels but I had intended to fly by Irish airlines.  I had an appointment in the Pentagon two days later, but it could have been two days earlier, that is, on the day of the attacks.  As we were pushing off, we knew there was something wrong when we were taken back into the airport.  We were briefed and I met a gentleman from Roscommon who had spoken to his wife in the United States.  She had previously spoken to their daughter who was in one of the top floors in the Twin Towers.  There was consternation because Americans did not know what was happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">On the positive side of all that, when we were transferred back to Dublin — obviously we did not go ahead with the trip to America — there was a message from the Roscommon gentleman to say that his daughter had got out and was saved.  I am saying all this because I would have no difficulty in providing information.  The issue, which has already been referred to by Senator Ryan, is that if we did not have the bilateral agreement with the United States the exact same information we are now being asked to provide would be available from visa applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">I have been long enough in the other House to remember that I had worn a path to the United States embassy in Ballsbridge to represent my constituents with their holiday visa applications.  That situation continued for many years.  I visited the embassy on numerous occasions but the same information would have been available to the embassy then as we are now being asked to provide.  This is not just an agreement that will be introduced in two days' time, by when, incidentally, I hope all 25 member states will have agreed it.  The European Union is anxious to have it in place in a few days' time.  The fact is, however, that were we to have a much longer debate on this motion, I doubt we would arrive at any other conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">We are all public representatives based in various parts of the country and I do not believe many people are aware that this requirement has been in place for some time.  We are made aware of this requirement by constituents.  There had been very little negative feedback on the requirement of a passenger name record, PNR, for airline users.  The Government, myself and many others who contributed to this debate would prefer if this requirement were not necessary but it is in place to protect us and to make air travel more secure for everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Senator Ryan asked if the agreement will be permanent.  It is a temporary arrangement up to the end of July 2007.  Many of the issues raised by Members, irrespective of their views, will be considered again in the context of a new agreement to replace the negotiated one.  The agreement will have a lead-in time and we in the Department of Transport will have an opportunity to debate it further, possibly at the beginning of the second quarter of next year.  The position on a new agreement, if there is to be one, is that after 31 July 2007, the Department will consult the Office of the Attorney General on that question.  We will do that in the normal way we would consult the office on any legal constitutional requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">I am advised by the Attorney General that this motion does not override any provisions in the Constitution.  The method of submitting the motion was done on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General.  Issues and questions were raised about who will monitor the agreement.  In response to a question raised by Senator Paddy Burke, this is not a bilateral agreement between a member state and the United States of America.  Article 5 of the Council of Ministers agreement provides that this is an agreement between the EU, representing all 25 member states, and there must be unanimity on it.  If we in this House decided not to accept the motion, we could not proceed with the agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">The introduction of this agreement is in the interests of safety.  We cannot compromise on safety, although I am not using that argument as a form of blackmail to try to convince Members that they should agree this motion.  We all want to be assured that when we travel on airlines which require such information, it is provided.  However, people have a choice.  If they do not want to provide such information, they do not go to the United States.  I am not saying that in a facetious way but that is the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">There is provision in the agreement for reciprocal sharing of information.  At this stage there are no plans to request the US to supply similar data.  However, there is such provision in the agreement and such a requirement could be triggered, if necessary.  All member states must agree to a single EU-US agreement and there can be no separate bilateral agreements for one member state or groups of member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">On the question of the big brother element of regulation, we are anxious to ensure that the information that will be given will be provided only for the purpose for which it is intended.  The information will be forwarded to the Department of Homeland Security and others who are involved in sharing terrorism information.  We have been given an undertaking that it will be provided only to those involved in the sharing of information on terrorism activities and for no other purpose.  The European Union will be anxious to ensure that the provision of this information is monitored closely and it should not be provided for any other reason.  Strict limits will apply on the access by other US authorities to this information.  It will be provided only to those involved in sharing terrorism information.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">There is no change to the list of 34 items of data which has been in place for the past six months.  When the European Court of Justice decided that the case brought by the European Parliament did not have a legal basis, a period of 90 days was allowed, which brought us up to 30 September.  We are now anxious to ensure there is no further slippage of time and that the agreement is introduced as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">I believe I am as much in touch with my constituents as any of the Members present and I have not heard in the past six months that the provision of this information has delayed any passenger who travelled to the United States.  In light of the ethnic connection between Ireland and the United States, many family members have had to travel there at short notice at the time of a bereavement.  There have been many such instances, including a few in my constituency where family members have had to provide the information and travel at short notice.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I have always been treated with great kindness and courtesy by the officials in the holiday visa section of the United States Embassy in Ballsbridge, to which I have called on many occasions when I have had to secure holiday visas for constituents.  The views of some Members are contrary to those of others.  Senator Norris gave a passionate contribution but when one reads the Official Report, one will note that his contribution is a matter for another day and another debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">Let us hope that this agreement does not have to remain in place indefinitely and that terrorism can be dealt with.  We know that the many people of Irish descent and with Irish relatives suffered on 11 September 2001.  This regulation is a small price to pay to ensure that travel between here and the United States or through the United States is safer for all mankind.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_197">
            <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_608">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment this important matter concerning the National Children's Hospital in Tallaght and the Government's decision over the summer period to recommend that the new national paediatric facility should be placed in the Mater Hospital in north Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_609">This is in no way intended as a slight on the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, but I very much regret that one of the four Ministers in the Department of Health and Children has not come to the House to take this matter.  That is not only a slight on the people I represent in Dublin South-West but on this House.</p>
            <p eId="para_610">I wrote to Professor Drumm on 14 September and asked him, under the public sector information regulations 2005, to forward to my office as soon as possible the overall score of each of the bids on the national paediatric hospital proposal in terms of the nine McKinsey criteria, the relative weighting of the nine criteria by the joint task force and the ranking place of each of the bids on each of the nine criteria.  He responded to me on 26 September stating that he noted the contents of my letter and that he would ask the parliamentary affairs division to investigate the matter and reply to me in due course.  I have heard nothing since.</p>
            <p eId="para_611">I ask the Government and the Health Service Executive to publish, without further delay, the entire scoring regime that applied to all the hospital bids in Dublin city and county when it came to making the decision on the location of the new national paediatric hospital.  I want that information published and out in the public domain now because the people I represent are gobsmacked that a decision was taken that flies in the face of medical, geographical and other logic.  It is a decision we could regret in the years ahead and one that needs to be explained in a comprehensive way by the Government which meekly took on board the recommendations from the task force.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">At an unveiling ceremony on 1 September the chairman of the Mater Hospital, Dublin, thanked the Taoiseach for following through on his promise to bring the new children's hospital to the Mater.  The Taoiseach needs to say exactly what promises he gave to the Mater.  Why was it the case when an evaluation allegedly was taking place that promises were given in the Taoiseach's constituency that this national facility would, surprise surprise, end up in his constituency.  He needs to comment publicly on that, which he has not done to date following the remarks of Mr. Lamont, chairman of the Mater Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_613">What people want, not only in terms of Tallaght but St. James's and Crumlin, where this decision has a huge impact, is accountability and transparency.  They want to know why, in terms of the criteria, accessibility, co-location, an existing hospital site, the ability to extend in the future, and a good public transport infrastructure, the Mater bid seemed to succeed when on so many of those grounds it could not possibly reach the criteria that Crumlin and, especially, the National Children's Hospital in Tallaght have met consistently.</p>
            <p eId="para_614">The Government must say what is its preferred solution.  Most people in west, north and south Dublin would accept a position where one hospital with two campuses would be established and the existing services would be located in the National Children's Hospital in Tallaght and radically extended.  We are not dealing only with west Dublin but west Wicklow, Kildare and the Meath hinterland.  There is a compelling case to be made for one hospital with two locations.  We need to know whether that is the way the Government will address this issue.  What is its policy in this regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_615">I welcome the considerable efforts locally on behalf of the people in the community to stand up for a facility that has done enormous work in providing excellent paediatric medicine for the west and south-west Dublin, Kildare and west Wicklow areas.  Some of these efforts will be seen at protests this Saturday in Tallaght.  People power has spoken and it will speak again on Saturday.  The Government needs to respond and to state unequivocally its plans for the National Children's Hospital in Tallaght and also for Crumlin because it is not just a question of people who work in this area — nurses, doctors and others — it is a bigger question for people who depend on a quality service there for themselves and, more particularly, for their children.  That is what they expect but have not got following the decision taken.  That is the reason we need more public accountability on what has occurred in this area over the past six months.</p>

          <speech by="#TonyKilleen" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_198">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_616">I am pleased to take the Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  There have been many occasions when I have been pleased to have a Minister from that Department take Adjournment debates on my behalf in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_617">In late 2005, the Health Service Executive, at the Minister's request, undertook a review of tertiary paediatric services.  McKinsey and Company was engaged by the HSE and its report, which was presented to the HSE in February, included a number of key recommendations.  The population and projected demands in this country can support only one world class tertiary paediatric hospital.  The hospital should be in Dublin and should ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital, that is, it should be within a practical walking distance of such a hospital.  The hospital should also provide all the secondary, that is, less complex, hospital needs of children in the greater Dublin area.  These secondary services should be supported by a strategically located urgent care service.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">The HSE welcomed the report as providing a clear outline of how to provide the best hospital care for children throughout the country.  It is worthwhile at this point to explain why the principle of co-location of the paediatric hospital with the adult hospital is so important.</p>
            <p eId="para_619">The McKinsey report emphasised that best outcomes for children are critically dependent on having breadth and depth in sub-specialist services, that is, a critical mass.  To achieve such, it is considered that tertiary centres should serve a population which is large enough to support a full complement of paediatric sub-specialists, co-located with an adult teaching hospital.  The collaboration of adult and paediatric specialists creates a larger critical mass of specialists in a particular area which in turn creates the platform for improved outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">Arising from the McKinsey report, a joint HSE-Department of Health and Children task group was established to advise on the optimum location of the proposed new hospital.  Each of the six major adult academic hospitals in Dublin, including Tallaght Hospital, made a detailed submission to the task group.  The task group concluded that each of the sites adequately demonstrated the feasibility of accommodating the proposed new paediatric hospital and a new maternity hospital.  However, the task group considered that three of the hospitals, Connolly Memorial Hospital, St Vincent's University Hospital and Tallaght Hospital, did not offer the necessary breadth and depth of tertiary services to complement the paediatric hospital, and on this ground these three sites were ruled out as co-location options.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">It should be stressed that the task group did not invite bids or tenders from the six hospitals and, accordingly, it would have been inappropriate to score the submissions.  The submissions therefore were not scored.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">Following assessment of the remaining sites, the group concluded that Beaumont Hospital was significantly less suitable, in terms of ease of access, than either the Mater Hospital or St. James's Hospital, especially for the children of the greater Dublin area who will use the hospital for all their hospital care.  The task group found that the Mater and St. James's demonstrated their ability to meet all of the assessment criteria set by the group and, on the basis of these criteria, it was not possible for the group to recommend one location on a basis that rendered it clearly distinguishable from the other.</p>
            <p eId="para_623">It was the group's view that the selected location would have to develop clear cross-site, team-working arrangements with the corresponding adult specialist teams based at the other adult hospitals.  In the context of the current configuration of adult specialties, the group considered the Mater to be in a better geographical position than St. James's to facilitate a clinical network of critical adult and paediatric specialties.</p>
            <p eId="para_624">Accordingly, the task group recommended that the new national tertiary paediatric hospital should be built on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital.  The task group's report and its recommendations were endorsed by the board of the HSE and by the Government which mandated the HSE to move forward with the development of the new hospital and its associated urgent care service, and to explore any philanthropic proposals in relation to its development.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">The governance arrangements that will arise in the context of the amalgamation of the three children's hospitals will also be pursued, in particular the measures needed to ensure that the new hospital is multi-denominational and pluralist in character.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">The Minister is satisfied that the task group undertook a rigorous and robust examination of the key issues in making its recommendation.  The task group consulted widely in arriving at its recommendation, and gave in-depth consideration to the key issues of access, governance, clinical values and site suitability.  It might be noted that each of the three existing paediatric hospitals expressed strong support for the development of a single paediatric hospital and emphasised the need for decisions on the new hospital to be taken urgently.  Consultant representatives emphasised their commitment to move to the new hospital regardless of its location.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">A joint HSE-Department of Health and Children transition group has since been established to advance the development of the new hospital.  Among the key items to be addressed are the definition of a high level framework brief for the new hospital and the determination of the scope and location of the urgent care service required to support the new hospital.  The group will consult with relevant stakeholders, including representatives of Tallaght Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">The Taoiseach, the Minister and the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive met representatives of the Adelaide Hospital Society, including Archbishop Eames, in June to discuss issues relating to Tallaght Hospital.  The hospital representatives expressed concern at the implications for the National Children's Hospital at Tallaght of the Government decision to endorse the development of a single national tertiary paediatric hospital at the Mater Hospital.  A number of other matters relating to the provision of hospital services at Tallaght were also discussed.  Development proposals submitted by the delegation, which have significant resource implications, have been forwarded to the Health Service Executive for consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_629">In a letter to Archbishop Eames following the meeting, the Taoiseach gave an assurance that the Government wishes the hospital to thrive on a sustainable basis as a particular focal point for the involvement of the minority tradition in the healthcare system and as a key health provider to an expanding local population.  These objectives will be pursued in tandem with other compelling objectives, including the achievement of an effective and efficient hospital care system, which will deliver the highest possible standards of care within a framework designed to respond to the needs of patients at national, regional and local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">Arising from the meeting, it has also been decided that a review will be conducted of decisions taken with regard to the funding and development of the hospital.  The arrangements for this review are being finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_631">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  He has just made an astonishing submission to the House.  We now know for the first time that there was no scoring regime in place for the submissions made by all the hospitals bidding for the national paediatric hospital.  This is new information.  I am glad I raised this matter on the Adjournment and I will return to the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_632">This is the first time since the issue of the report that it has been admitted that there was no scoring regime in place for the various bids for the paediatric hospital.  Why did the HSE not inform me of that when I sought the information over five weeks ago and why did it refuse to comment on the issue?  Tenders were invited and submitted, yet no score applied.  The issue must be revisited.</p>

            <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
            <p eId="para_635">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for coming to discuss this important matter.  He is familiar with this issue and I am happy he is here, as part of the Clare delegation, to discuss this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_636">As the Minister of State is aware, the Mid-Western Hospitals Development Trust has set aside moneys to purchase a CAT scanner for Ennis General Hospital.  The hospital management has prepared plans to accommodate this equipment and has submitted a number of proposals to the Department of Health and Children and the HSE to provide funding for the staffing and operation of the equipment.  To date, the project has not been given the go ahead, despite the urgent need for the deployment of this equipment at the hospital.  Similar equipment is available in some smaller hospitals throughout the country although they do not carry out the same acute surgical procedures as Ennis General Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_637">The absence of a CAT scanner has a two-fold negative effect.  First, only very urgent cases at Ennis hospital are considered for CAT scanning and these patients must be transferred to Limerick by ambulance and in some cases be accompanied by a consultant anaesthetist.  This is an outrageous situation.  Consultant anaesthetists are an expensive resource and are not being used to best effect when sent in ambulances from Ennis to Limerick when they would be better employed at Ennis General Hospital.  It is estimated that 3,000 scans per annum are required at Ennis hospital.  However, due to lack of facilities only approximately 1,000 patients receive a scan by transferring to Limerick.  This is a poor service for the patient population of our county and should be addressed without delay.  It is not good patient care.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">Second, the need to transfer patients to Limerick delays the treatment of patients and affects their prognosis.  It also results in a delay in patients being discharged from hospital resulting in their retention for longer than necessary.  As the Minister of State is aware, Ennis General Hospital is an 88-bed hospital that operates on an annual patient activity level of 117%.  Patient numbers range from somewhere between 100 to 130.  This has been achieved through good management, not just of the management staff but also of the consultants and the nursing staff through the tremendous work they do.  The hospital has scored well in recent analyses on keeping patients off trolleys, in particular through the work in the accident and emergency unit of developing an admission lounge.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">I am sure the Minister of State shares my view that speedy access to CAT scanning would allow for better patient care and speedier discharge of patients thereby leading to best practice which is the target of the Minister for Health and Children.  I appeal through the Minister of State, who is working closely with the Department to achieve this, to encourage the Minister to help to move this along.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanDaly" eId="spk_203">
            <from>Mr. Daly</from>
            <p eId="para_640">I am glad to support Senator Dooley on this issue and I know the Minister of State is equally concerned to see the project expedited.  My concern is that while funding has been earmarked for the project for almost ten months, it has not yet been spent despite the fact we are almost into another budget.  I hope the Minister of State will communicate with the Minister for Finance to ensure the project is speeded up without further delay.  If it is delayed further, it is likely the consultants will threaten to discontinue serious examinations and surgery in the hospital which could create further problems.  There have already been problems with regard to the delays in the development of the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">It is not necessary for me to underline for the Minister of State the fact that substantial funding is available for the project from the local trust fund.  The surgeon, Dr. Burns has been very vocal in recent meetings with us and has made the commitment that local funding is available.  The cost of the machine is available locally and all the HSE is required to do is provide staffing and construction work such as the installation of the CAT scan machine.  I emphasise the necessity to expedite this project in view of the fact that the finance was provided ten months ago.  With the musical chairs currently taking place in the HSE, it appears that nobody is making decisions.  I urge the Minister of State to put some pressure on the HSE to act on this.</p>

            <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
            <p eId="para_642">I thank Senators Dooley and Daly for raising this important matter.  I am taking the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">Ennis General Hospital was the subject on the Adjournment of the Seanad in July when the position with regard to the development of the hospital was outlined to the House.  As the House is aware, the provision of services at Ennis General Hospital is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  The Minister approved the Health Service Executive capital plan for 2006 earlier this year.  The plan provides for €555.5 million spending on approximately 400 individual projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">The provision of a new CAT scanner at Ennis General Hospital is included in the major development at the hospital which is currently at design stage.  The development of the hospital at Ennis will be carried out on a phased basis.  A project team was set up to identify priority developments at the hospital so that the long-term requirements of the county can be addressed.  The priority areas for development in phase 1A include upgrade of wards; the accident and emergency department; the radiology department, including a CAT scanner; the outpatients department; the intensive care unit; the concourse; and general infrastructure upgrade.  The priority developments identified will cost in excess of €30 million to design, build and equip.</p>
            <p eId="para_645">It is a Department of Finance requirement that when a project exceeds €30 million, a cost benefit analysis must be undertaken before the proposed development can proceed.  This cost benefit analysis is currently being conducted by the Health Service Executive.</p>

Will he take back to the Minister a report of the considerable frustration of not just patients but also consultants who find it extremely difficult to operate in the current facility without the availability of a CAT scanner, notwithstanding the fact the moneys are available to provide it?  It is not acceptable for the HSE to continue to suggest it should be part of the future development.  It could be provided now and I have no doubt the Minister of State will use his good offices to get the Department to meet this important requirement.</p>

          <heading>Community Employment Schemes.</heading>
          <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_206">
            <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
            <p eId="para_647">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Since their inception, community employment schemes have provided vital services for rural and other disadvantaged areas.  When the original schemes were established, the employment situation was considerably different.  It is clear from the activities of those schemes that they have provided a very important support service for the communities in which they are based.  In the past couple of years there has been a substantial reduction in the number of people employed on community employment schemes.  This is due to a number of factors, such as higher numbers of people employed, Government cutbacks on the schemes and their amalgamation.</p>
            <p eId="para_648">The community employment scheme in my neck of the woods has been amalgamated with the scheme that existed in the town of New Ross, County Wexford, and which was oversubscribed for the coming year.  The scheme in Mooncoin which serves a number of parishes in that part of south Kilkenny has a serious shortfall in the number of applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_649">I seek the Government's support for the continued existence of the community employment schemes and request that they be held at their current levels or even enhanced.  They provide crucial back up for many local voluntary organisations throughout the country.  Volunteerism is currently at an all time low and this has been discussed in this House and in other places.  Many sporting organisations, such as my own hurling club, would find it difficult to function without the help we receive from the community employment scheme.  Many other clubs in my area and across County Kilkenny and in the country in general, rely on people from community employment schemes to carry out some basic work.  They are not relied upon to carry out the running of the club but they provide basic services.</p>
            <p eId="para_650">A study of the make-up of the community employment schemes shows that many of the people involved are in their 50s and 60s.  These people would find it very difficult to find employment in rural areas in particular where they might not have access to necessary transport to travel to larger urban areas where jobs may be more freely available.  People of advancing years are providing a service in rural areas and may find it difficult to find alternative employment.  This is another reason for an extension of the scheme.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the Government's future policy direction with regard to community employment schemes and to indicate that this group of people who will always find it more difficult to find employment will be catered for.  For a very small sum of money on top of their unemployment assistance, they are contributing in great measure to their communities.  The Minister of State is also from a rural area and I am confident he can name his local community employment schemes.  He will know at first hand the important service these schemes provide throughout the country.</p>

          <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_207" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
            <p eId="para_651">I thank Senator John Paul Phelan for his positive remarks with regard to community employment schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_652">Community employment is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary basis.  CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine and by assisting them to develop both their technical and personal skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_653">As an active labour market programme it has the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed to this end with primary regard to the needs of participants and the community.  In addition, this programme with its focus on the needs of disadvantaged persons, forms a major response by FÁS to tackling the social exclusion of such groups as persons with a disability, lone parents, persons who are long-term unemployed and drug misusers, with a view to their re-integration into the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_654">Changes have been made to CE so that it responds to the needs of disadvantaged people. Community employment health sector places have been ring-fenced from any reductions that have taken place since March 2002 and FÁS makes every effort to ensure places are maintained at the agreed level on ring-fenced schemes.  In addition, projects in RAPID areas are given priority.  However, it is important to note that the primary purpose of CE is to provide short-term work experience and training opportunities for long-term unemployed persons and other disadvantaged groups with a view to facilitating their progression to work in the open labour market.  It is imperative, therefore, that CE positions be vacated on a rolling basis to facilitate new participants.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">To cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment raised the three year participation limit to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a six year period on CE, based on participation since 3 April 2000.  This was done in recognition of the fact that older participants may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">In July of this year my Department published its sectoral plan under the Disability Act 2005.  One of the key highlights of this plan is to increase participation rates of people with disabilities on CE over the period of the plan and to raise the CE participation limits for people with disabilities to provide additional training to assist progression to employment.  For people with disabilities under 55 years of age, the participation limit was raised by one year from three to four years.  For people with disabilities over 55 years of age, the participation limit was also raised by one year from six to seven years.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">A new individual learner plan is also being rolled out nationally in FÁS.  This is designed to track and record an individual's progress from programme entry to exit.  Beginning with the identification of learning needs at induction, through to project and progression skills development, this new approach addresses the personal, social, vocational and specific work-related skills needs of each participant.</p>
            <p eId="para_658">Funding for CE in 2006 has been provided with a view to maintaining overall numbers on FÁS schemes at 2005 levels.  At present there are more than 22,000 people employed on CE schemes nationally, a figure which has been maintained throughout 2006.  It is anticipated that FÁS will utilise its full allocation in this area during 2006.  In delivering these places, FÁS operates flexibility in the management of this allocation to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services.  This provision of places is managed through a standardised application process between regional FÁS offices and local sponsor-community organisations and any issues regarding the allocation of places are dealt with in this context.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.</p>

            <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
            <p eId="para_660">I agree with most of what the Minister of State has said.  However, there is a strong case to be made, particularly as we face into the budget, for the six year limit period to be increased, if not removed completely, for those over 55 years of age.  The reason I raised this matter is that I know of a man who does not have access to transport.  He is 56 years of age and with no access to transport, he will be unable to find a job outside the rural area in which he lives.  There is a strong case to be made for increasing the six year period and if not, removing it completely.</p>
