          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Bannon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to clarify the position with regard to funding for the Longford central water supply and other areas in the county where chronic water supply problems are being encountered.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to outline Government policy on wireless technology and, in particular, the steps the Government will take to ensure that the public is kept informed and aware of any issues relating to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator McHugh of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need to ask the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to expedite the training module which would enable the Mulroy coast and cliff rescue boat to be commissioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_9">Will the Leader organise a debate as soon as possible to discuss the shambles that is now decentralisation? One of the worst abuses of power that has ever occurred in the country was the Budget Statement read by the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in respect of this issue. This was stroke politics at its best. People were led up the garden path, particularly Senator Leyden, whose Roscommon constituency now gets no jobs as a result of the announcement made yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">This issue is about people's lives. We were told 10,000 people would be moved, but now it is down to 3,500. We were told that 53 towns were included in the first phase but that number is now down to 29 and there is no genuine time estimate as to when decentralisation will occur. We need immediate answers from the Government on the issue. This House had a good debate on the issue last year. We smelled a rat then and see it now. The matter has been a shambles from start to finish. The Government needs to go back to the drawing board and work out something that is sensible, strategic and in the long-term interest of the public service. Will the Leader organise a debate on the issue at the earliest possible time?</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_12">On a separate matter, for many months Senator Leyden has led a strong campaign in the House on the issue of trying to regularise the situation for Irish citizens who live illegally in the United States. I compliment and support him on this. However, yesterday we aired a similar situation here where we have a group in the same situation in this State campaigning for the 11,500 parents of Irish-born children who want to have their citizenship and their situation here regularised.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I agree with Senator Leyden that we must campaign hard for the Irish in America. However, he and Government Members should agree with me that we should do our best for these 11,500 parents of Irish citizens born here. This is a crucial issue. Next week we will have the opportunity to debate the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I ask the people to be generous to these Irish citizens who are in a situation where many of their parents and families will be deported. If we lecture the world and the United States about their responsibilities, we should take those responsibilities seriously at home and do for our people what we claim should happen in other countries. Will this House, which has shown more mettle and independence on the issue than the Dáil, lead the campaign on this issue? Will it work with the campaign group to get rights for this small group whose situation should be regularised?</p>

          <p eId="para_14">I agree that we need an early debate on decentralisation, which is a debacle. I put it to the Leader that the House was seriously misled on this issue. During our last discussion with the Minister, I asked him four times if he was certain this could be done in three years. I could see no way that it could be done in three years but felt there might be some way of making it work if there was a longer timeframe. We got the straight answer back that it would be done within the given timescale. That is what we were told. I do not know how Members on the far side feel about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">Members of the House do their best to contribute to debates and I listened to speaker after speaker from the Government side defending decentralisation, welcoming it and seeking to move things forward. Communities' hopes have been raised only to be dashed again. There is something significantly wrong here. It is grossly unfair and it should not be happening. This will rightly become a major party political football because it has been used very cynically.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">I am concerned at the impact this will have on politics in small communities. I will not list all the towns affected, as it will be done by other people. These towns, which looked forward to an injection of additional resources and people into their areas, have already been making provision for decentralisation. Local town councils and urban councils have held meetings to put together structures, yet now they are simply being dropped from the scheme. Not alone will the decentralisation programme not happen within three years but apparently we will not see anything happening until 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">This is utterly wrong. I would welcome somebody on the other side of the House saying, whether he or she agrees or disagrees, that what is happening is wrong. This is the kind of thing that brings politics into disrepute. We will all be tarred with the one brush of making promises that are not reflected in outcomes. This was unnecessary. We all saw it was impossible to do this in three years, however good the idea. Now it looks like it will not happen at all because not only is the timescale wrong but other things are wrong as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">I did not have a chance to discuss the matter with the Leader, therefore, I will not propose an amendment to the Order of Business, which it is my instinct to do, but we need to discuss it next week or else we will need to have a vote on why we should not.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_19">We are almost at the stage where we do not notice the broken promises. A solemn promise to the United Nations was broken last week and a promise made in the Dáil on decentralisation was broken this week. The credibility of the Department of Finance is now at issue because we were assured that decentralisation would be self-financing, which it will be in 25 years time. According to the body investigating the matter, it will pay for itself by 2026. Did the Department, with all its skills and expertise, fail to make the calculation that Phil Flynn and his committee was able to make in six months or was it as we all suspect, no more than a con job?</p>
          <p eId="para_20">I am sure it is no more than a coincidence that the Laoighis-Offaly constituency, served by the Minister and Minister of State, survived all of the ups and downs.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of the parents of Irish-born children. As he said there are 11,000 such children. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not know how many parents of children in the State, who are citizens by birth, are illegally here. It does not know and, apparently, it does not want to find out. Will the Department of Health and Children led by the Tánaiste, which has a responsibility for all children in the State, ascertain how many children who are citizens of the State have been deported with their parents and how many are facing deportation? Furthermore, if we deport children who are Irish citizens, what are the legal implications and what obligations will arise in the future when they return as adults, as they will almost certainly do?</p>
          <p eId="para_34">This issue cries out for a humane response because of the human suffering involved. It also cries out for common sense because we are building up problems for the future. It is necessary that we quantify how many children are involved and ascertain what the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform proposes to do about them. How many children who are Irish citizens have already been made to leave because of the deportation of their parents? In addition, how many children who are Irish citizens have been left behind by their deported parents and what are we doing about them?</p>

At the time of the second referendum we were promised that the Oireachtas, particularly this House, would have a greater say in vetting legislation and directives coming from Europe. We are on the eve of another referendum on the constitution for Europe and people will not be conned a second time with regard to referenda. It is important that the Leader would inform us as to when this will happen, what has been done to date and if any arrangements have been put in place to properly resource this House with regard to vetting this legislation. We are not all lawyers and facilities need to be put in place to assist us in the scrutiny of EU legislation. I hope she will make a statement on this matter or arrange a debate on it.</p>

However, it must be borne in mind that the Government has made a decision to decentralise 230 jobs to Roscommon and that the Opposition parties, particularly Fine Gael, never supported decentralisation and never will.</p>

The House might wish to be reminded of the release yesterday of a young lady from County Armagh who had been held as a hostage for 37 days. It is a source of great relief to everybody.

This project is successful, worthwhile and important for the wellbeing of the children in that badly blighted area. Perhaps the Leader would raise this issue with the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to ensure that the numbers planning to travel will actually do so. The children come here for much needed rest and recuperation. The least we can do is ensure that the Minister for Foreign Affairs intervenes to ensure that this happens.</p>

They would have the support of the nation. We know how to solve this problem; we had it solved for a number of months after the penalty points scheme was introduced. However, as soon as it became known that the system was not being enforced, we took our eyes off the ball. Now there are more than 30 deaths per month where previously there were 20 per month. The Leader should bring the Minister before the House so we can let him know the commitment of this House and of the nation to solving this problem. It is in our hands.

There are disturbing reasons for that. At 10%, Donegal still has the highest rate of unemployment in the country and continues to suffer as a result of false promises on the part of the Government. Donegal town was promised 230 jobs and Buncrana was promised 120 jobs under the decentralisation programme. Gweedore, an unemployment blackspot, was also promised 30 jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">The situation in Donegal is serious. Its county council has invested funding in buildings for those who are supposed be sent there under the decentralisation programme. However, these buildings are empty and are costing ratepayers in Donegal money. Donegal and Derry will soon have the most highly skilled workforce in the IT sector in this country and the two are going to be linked via broadband in the not too distant future. Donegal County Council, Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce and every Opposition spokesperson in Donegal have been let down. Decentralisation must be placed back on the agenda.</p>

It indicates that the number of the aircraft concerned, which is owned by Premier Executive Transport Services, a small US airline, is N379P and that this aeroplane has used Shannon Airport on 13 occasions.

          <p eId="para_153">I remind the House that there was very successful decentralisation in the 1970s. A total of 400 staff from the then Department of Education were decentralised to Athlone at that time and another 400 were decentralised there in the late 1980s.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">Senator Coghlan inquired about the Muckross road. I am familiar with the stretch to which he referred and I am glad that no deaths occurred. I am happy for the Senator because Killarney will boom and bloom as a result of the first phase of decentralisation. Senator Maurice Hayes expressed his delight, which is shared by all Members, that Ms Annetta Flanigan has been released in Afghanistan. Of course our delight is tinged with sadness over what happened other detainees in another country. The Senator asked about the manner in which business relating to Europe is dealt with in the House. This echoed the question asked by Senator Bannon. I am aware of the work of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny. At the same time there could be a more focused approach here in the Chamber on European matters. To that end, we proposed to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that MEPs take turns to come to the House. We must allow them time to find their feet but I hope that the programme can begin again next term.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">Senator McCarthy asked about the Belarus project. Every area in the country has a committee engaging in that very fine work. The children are given a break, good nutrition and fresh air, all the things which are poisoned back home. I cannot understand why they do not want to send the children. The reason may relate to adoption laws. I intend to speak to Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, about the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">Senator Dooley made an impassioned speech about Shannon Airport. I ask Senator Norris to share the documentation received with him.</p>

I am informed by Senator Minihan that Senator Ó Murchú raised with him the issue of having a debate on the role of the Irish language with the participation of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív. The difficulty for the House is that instead of having an excess of time for debate, there will be a deficit of debating time for general issues as distinct from debate on legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">Senator Quinn spoke about road deaths. It is 25 November and I wonder if Members have all their Christmas shopping done. The American visitors have left the Distinguished Visitors Gallery — today is Thanksgiving Day.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">Senator Glynn asked for a debate on unprovoked violence and other Senators have also called for a debate on that matter. I wish to clarify to the House that requests for debates on those issues are not being disregarded; there is simply not sufficient time between now and Christmas. Senator Coonan sought a debate on decentralisation. He suggested Tipperary as a location and was answered very gamely and valiantly by Senator Mansergh.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">Senator Henry stated that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said in this House that people transiting through Shannon Airport had the protection of the Constitution while here. I agree with her that this is an important statement. Senator John Paul Phelan also asked for a debate on violence and wondered when the House would debate the budget. That debate will be held in Private Members' time.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">Senator McHugh sticks to his local issues which he always defends with great vigour. He spoke about Gweedore being a blackspot and the need for decentralisation there. I remind Senator Feighan that decentralisation is coming despite all the people who did not want it.</p>

          <p eId="para_167">Is cúis áthais dom bheith ar ais i Seanad Éireann le freastal ar an Bhille tábhachtach seo, an Bille um Banc Forbartha Comhairle na hEorpa 2004. Tá mé ag súil leis an díospóireacht agus an pháirt a ghlacfaidh na Seanadóirí uilig. This Bill provides for Ireland's membership of the Council of Europe Development Bank. The CEB is the oldest international financial institution in Europe and the only one with an exclusively social vocation. Its activities are targeted to emergency projects and to strengthening social cohesion in Europe. The CEB is the financial instrument of the policy of solidarity, developed by the Council of Europe over the years. The Government views the Council of Europe Development Bank as a valuable expression of that solidarity and of social cohesion in a wider Europe. Although Europe is one of the most developed regions of the world, there are still large pockets of poverty. This is where the Council of Europe Development Bank assists in development. It acts first and foremost in favour of the most vulnerable and fosters balanced social development in the fields of health, education, social housing and employment. The bank is valued in EU member states, in particular by the countries of central and eastern Europe, as an important source of lending for social projects. Ireland's accession to the bank will be viewed positively by these states as a reflection of our commitment to wider European solidarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">The bank is a multilateral development institution, placed under the supreme authority of the Council of Europe. It nevertheless has its own full legal status and financial autonomy. By granting loans, the bank participates in the financing of social projects, responds to emergency situations and thus contributes to improving living conditions and social cohesion in the less advantaged regions of Europe. It is an appropriate time for this Bill to come before this House as it gives a further signal that Ireland welcomes the accession of the new member states into the EU and displays our willingness to play our part fully in the new Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">The current subscribed capital of the bank is just over €3 billion, but only 11% is paid in. The balance is designated as callable capital, but it is most unlikely that this will ever be called on. Ireland would provide subscribed capital of €30.515 million. The paid-in capital contribution for Ireland would be €3.369 million. When joining, Ireland must also pay a contribution to the bank's accumulated reserves of €9.764 million. Its full contribution paid in capital and contribution to the reserves, amounting to €13.1 million, will be paid in four annual equal instalments of €3.283 million each. Provision for these costs is being made in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">Set up in 1956 and originally named the Council of Europe Resettlement Fund for National Refugees and Over-Population in Europe, the fund started out with just eight members. A number of EU member states joined over the subsequent 25 years. However, with the change in the political landscape in Europe in the early 1990s, the influx of new members over the following ten years reflected the growing interest in the bank. The new member states of the EU and former members of the Soviet Union brought the membership up to 37 different countries. In 1999, the name was changed to the Council of Europe Development Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">The primary purpose of the bank is to help in solving the social problems with which European countries are or may be faced as a result of the presence of refugees, displaced persons or migrants consequent upon forced movements of populations as a result of natural or ecological disasters. However, in recent years the bank has expanded its operations to support projects relating to social housing, health, education, rural modernisation, support for SMEs and the improvement of the quality of life in disadvantaged urban areas and the protection and rehabilitation of historic heritage. It is the only European development bank with a social purpose. Its activities are targeted primarily to emergency projects and to programmes directed at strengthening social cohesion throughout Europe. The bank provides loans and guarantees, not subsidies, to its member states, to local authorities and to financial institutions. Its loans are intended for the implementation of social projects which thus enjoy the benefit of favourable financial conditions. Since the bank receives no annual contributions from its members, its financial activity is based on its paid up capital and reserves and the resources it raises on the financial markets. Since its inception in 1956, the bank's capital has been increased regularly to sustain the development of its activity while, at the same time, preserving its financial soundness. The bank does not receive any other aid, subsidy or budgetary contributions from member states to finance activities. The necessary resources are, therefore, raised on the international capital markets in the form of borrowings.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">For its borrowing activity the bank has been rated by Moody's since 1988, Standard and Poor's since 1989 and Fitch Ratings since 1996. It enjoys the maximum AAA rating with all three agencies on its principal long-term debt. To ensure that it maintains access to the funds needed to pursue its activities the bank continues to have recourse both to large-scale borrowings in major currencies aimed at a broad range of institutional investors and to issues in given currencies or with specific structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">To obtain financing from the Council of Europe Development Bank the projects presented must meet the following general criteria: compliance with Council of Europe conventions; respect for the environment on the basis of international conventions and compliance with standards of quality; participation in the financing of projects may not exceed 50% of the total eligible cost, the balance of which may be co-financed by other international institutions; and compliance with bidding procedures in accordance with national and international directives.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">Since 1994, the bank's circle of member states has widened to include a large number of new states, including European Union member states and former republics of the Soviet Union. Some 14 states have joined since 1994. The policy developed by the bank is aimed at strengthening its activities in the new member states by contributing to their economic and social development and reducing inequality. It has introduced innovative instruments to meet the specific needs of each country. Some €1.804 billion, spread over 66 projects in 14 countries, has been lent to the new member countries since 1995. Loans are issued on favourable terms, with a deferred repayment period being carried on, for example, in the form of long-term loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">The sectoral breakdown of approved projects illustrates the bank's capacity for action, not only in its statutory priority sectors but also in health and education infrastructure, employment, vocational training and employment in small and medium enterprises and the Roma community. The bank has adjusted the eligibility criteria as a consequence of the strategy for supporting the social housing sector, which has particular characteristics in the new member countries. The total of disbursements made in favour of the new member countries in 2000 was higher than the total made during the previous five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">The bank has signalled its intention to become the reference financial institution for the Balkans on the question of refugees and migrants. It has become heavily involved in the work of the stability pact for south-eastern Europe. One of the pact's priorities concerns refugees and specific attention is being paid to the Roma community. For example, the bank approved a €30 million project in 2000 for the construction of housing in Croatia aimed at facilitating the return and integration of refugees.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">Strengthening social cohesion means contributing to solving the unemployment problem in the first instance and the Council of Europe Development Bank has adopted two lines of action to that end. It promotes the creation and preservation of jobs and supports investment in SMEs, which are the principal source of new jobs and vocational training.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">Action in favour of employment is one of the bank's new priorities. It has financed several projects aimed at the preservation and creation of jobs in small and medium-sized firms in many countries. The governing board sets out the general orientation of the bank's activity, lays down conditions for membership and decides on capital increases. It approves the bank's annual report, accounts and general balance sheet. The board consists of a chairman and one representative from each of the bank's member countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">The administrative council exercises the powers delegated to it by the governing body, establishes and supervises operational policies and approves investment projects submitted by governments. It votes on the bank's operating budget. The governing board elects the chairman. The governor, who is the bank's legal representative, heads up its operational services. He is responsible for the bank's staff, under the general supervision of the administrative council, and conducts the bank's financial policy in line with the administrative council's guidelines. He represents the bank in its transactions and examines the technical and financial aspects of requests for financing to the bank. The auditing board consists of three members who are appointed by the governing board. It checks the accuracy of the annual accounts which will also be examined by an external auditor.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">I reiterate the Government's view that the Council of Europe Development Bank is an important part of the operations of the Council of Europe. I pay special tribute to Senators who, with their colleagues in Dáil Éireann, have given and will continue to give distinguished service on the Council of Europe and support all its activities, including the continuing enhancement of the role of the Council of Europe Development Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">The Council of Europe Development Bank plays a vital role in the new and expanded Europe. Ireland's membership of the bank at this time is a valuable expression of our solidarity with the new and expanded Europe at an exciting and historic period for the growing European Union. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to the ensuing debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_130">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_182">This is my first opportunity to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, in his new capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs. I will echo many of his remarks on the Bill which the Fine Gael Party fully supports. The Council of Europe Development Bank is not widely known and I was unaware of many of its activities until recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">As the Minister of State outlined, the Bill will allow Ireland to join the Council of Europe Development Bank and make a contribution towards it. It seeks the approval of the Oireachtas to accept the terms and conditions of membership. Under the terms of membership, agreed by the governing board of the bank, Ireland's subscription to the bank's capital will be €30,515,890, of which €3,368,950 will be "paid-up capital", with the remainder available to the bank in the form of callable capital. Ireland will also be required to make a contribution of slightly less than €9.8 million to the bank's reserves. Ireland's total cash contribution, therefore, will amount to slightly more than €13,132,680, which will be paid in equal instalments of €3.2 million over a four-year period. Payment of the first instalment, which falls due within 30 days of the bank's receipt of Ireland's declaration of accession, has been provided for in the Book of Estimates discussed in the House yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">Membership of the Council of Europe Development Bank is part of the Government's strategy to join a number of development banks, as recommended in the 2002 report of the Ireland Aid review committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">According to information provided by the bank, it was established in 1956 making it the oldest international financial institution in Europe and the only such institution with an exclusively social vocation. The bank is the financial instrument of the policy of solidarity developed by the Council of Europe. A multilateral development bank placed under the supreme authority of the Council of Europe, the bank nevertheless has full legal status and financial autonomy. By granting loans it participates in the financing of social projects and responds to emergencies, thus contributing to improving living conditions and social cohesion in the less advantaged regions of Europe. Loans are granted in Council of Europe member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">The bank's fields of action, as defined in its articles of agreement and resolution 1480 (2004) of the administrative council, are structured under three main headings, to which the Minister of State briefly referred. Under the heading of strengthening social integration, the bank plays a role in providing aid to refugees — the Minister of State referred to a project under way in Croatia in this regard. It is also prominent in the areas of social housing and job creation, for example, it recently made a large investment in Germany. Disadvantaged urban areas and rural modernisation are other areas of special interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Under the heading of managing the environment, the bank has played a significant role in funding reconstruction work after natural or ecological disasters in various parts of Europe, as well as in the protecting the environment and preserving historic and cultural heritage. The bank's main areas of concern under the heading of developing human capital are education and health.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">The bank has assets of approximately €4.5 billion and has awarded more than €20 billion since its inception. Examples of projects funded by the bank include €11 million approved for improvements in health care in Bulgaria; since 1995, the Council of Europe Development Bank has contributed to financing a project for therestructure of the health sector in Bulgaria. This major programme aims to improve the health of the population and increase the efficiency of the health care system. Some might argue that we could take those ideas on board here. The programme addresses four different aspects of the problem, three of which are co-financed by the Council of Europe Development Bank and World Bank. The four areas involve strengthening the capacity for analysis and management in matters of health care policies, rehabilitating almost 1,000 neighbourhood health care centres, rehabilitating blood transfusion centres and improving emergency services throughout Bulgaria.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">In Germany, €100 million was approved to provide vocational training which plays an integral part in the fight against youth unemployment. Germany has a widely acknowledged and long-standing tradition of apprenticeships and the Council of Europe Development Bank has financed an innovative project in Bavaria. The programme consists of granting finance to local small and medium-sized enterprises that agree to make additional apprenticeships available for training young people. According to an evaluation carried out by the Landesanstalt fur Aufbaufinanzierung, a Bavarian bank that received financing from the Council of Europe Development Bank, this programme involved over 7,000 small and medium-sized enterprises and led to the creation of over 10,000 apprenticeships, which is very significant by anyone's standards. Studies carried out on the project show that the whole programme played a decisive role in reducing regional unemployment among young people in Bavaria.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">The bank provided a considerable sum to help reconstruction following the floods in Hungary in 1998 and 2000. It gave €9.7 million in aid for refugees and migrants in Lithuania to construct and renovate housing for former deportees returning there from the former USSR. It provided €97 million in Poland for reconstruction and flood prevention measures following the horrific flooding in 1997 and 1998. After the earthquake in Slovenia in April 1998, it provided €4.6 million for reconstruction of buildings and infrastructure, and for social housing for dependent elderly persons whose houses were destroyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">In Spain it provided €6.2 million for the construction and renovation of schools. Between 1996 and 1999, it financed the construction of 109 schools and the renovation of 374 others in Andalucia. Given the potential for strengthening social cohesion in the villages concerned, the construction or renovation of certain schools was undertaken at the request of, and in close collaboration with, parents' or teachers' associations. The social impact has been very clearly felt as the project has benefited 63,000 students, including almost 2,500 children from gypsy or migrant families, and has generated jobs in the construction industry, estimated at 2,000 per year, and in 540 teaching posts. The bank provided vital aid to Turkey following the earthquake there in 1999. The council acts as another bridge towards the full integration of Turkey into a modern democratic European framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Fine Gael is proud to support this legislation. We have a record of being pro-Europe in this House and others. At a time when euroscepticism is a growing aspect of politics in this country and throughout the European Union it is apt that we deal with this Bill now. This institution focuses on European integration and social cohesion and I fully support this Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_131">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_193">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the Bill. The Council of Europe is probably the oldest post-Second World War European institution, along with the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation. Ireland has been a member of the council since the beginning, unlike the European Union, which we joined somewhat later. Although the European Union has expanded and enlarged it by no means covers the whole of Europe. Apart from countries such as Bulgaria and Romania which should join in two or three years time, there are also the Balkans and many former states from central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, some of which are in the news today.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">I wonder why we are joining the bank at this late stage and I have some reservations about dealing with the legislation only at the moment when the time limit expires. We should give higher priority to our international obligations and deal with them in a timely manner. In this case there is no real matter of controversy that needs to be debated at length but it is regrettable that we are discussing this only 48 hours before the deadline expires. There are several reasons we might not have joined earlier, one of which is possibly the previous name of the bank which was the Council of Europe Resettlement Fund for National Refugees and Overpopulation in Europe. We might have had problems signing up to a concept of overpopulation in Europe but the name was changed in 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">The name was unfortunate but the real reason was that it required a significant financial contribution and we will be contributing €13 million. In the past we have been somewhat reluctant to subscribe to some of these organisations. We should have joined this bank long ago rather than so belatedly. The argument would be that we did not have enough money or it did not have sufficient priority. At an earlier stage of our membership of the European Union we benefited from loans from the European Investment Bank for different capital products. That does not have the same degree of importance for us now that we can fund most of our capital spending ourselves. It is important for these countries to be able to get money for essential social infrastructure and emergency relief at reasonable and competitive interest rates which might not otherwise be available to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">Previous speakers have covered the ground well on projects recently supported by the bank. Approximately €2 billion was approved in loans last year. The bank serves a useful purpose. It will be a matter of considerable importance that we do not have a kind of Iron Curtain or fortress Europe in a political or economic sense. We will have to pay attention to the problems of countries that are outside and that will perhaps remain outside the European Union. We must not put them at an unacceptable disadvantage and this Bill is a contribution to that aim.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Europe has no interest in having political or economic instability nor untoward movements of population just beyond its borders. As Europe enlarges, its area of responsibility will also expand. I do not just mean the area within the European Union, but also its neighbouring countries. Ireland is at the western periphery of Europe, while most of the countries that are beneficiaries of this are in the south-eastern end of Europe. Some of these countries will become members, such as Bulgaria, Romania and perhaps even Turkey. I hope that it will happen in the future, when conditions are right. I do not accept the alternative version of fortress Europe that is based on the idea that as we are a Christian civilisation and Turkey is mainly a Muslim country, it does not fit in. We must have a truly pluralist view of the European Union without in any way underplaying its mainly Christian roots.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">In theory at any rate, Ireland is eligible for loans under this Bill. In practice, we do not have difficulties obtaining finance for worthwhile infrastructural and social projects, nor for things like flood relief. We are therefore unlikely to avail of funds from the bank. As a display of solidarity with the rest of Europe, I warmly support this Bill. My only criticism is that it is long overdue.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_199">I welcome the Minister of State to the House to debate this Bill, which my party also supports. I had the pleasure of serving on the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe in 1994. It was a very interesting time in the development of the council. It was shortly after the collapse of the Soviet empire and after the fall of the Berlin Wall. We were casting about for a way in which the countries of central and eastern Europe could be integrated into the European mainstream. It was obvious at that stage that these countries would not be ready for EU membership for quite a long time. As we now know, it took another ten years. It was necessary to provide a middle way that would facilitate them in accommodating themselves to European norms in order to become members of the European Union. The Council of Europe performed a remarkably good job in that regard. It was not easy and there were times when I felt that the council was turning a blind eye to inadequacies in the structure in some of the eastern European states. At one stage, it appeared to ignore the treatment of minorities in Slovakia, or the separation of the executive and judicial powers in some of the former communist states in eastern Europe. It was a difficult time, but there is no question that the Council of Europe performed an extremely useful function, as it was one of the very few institutions into which those countries could accede.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">This was done through the use of the carrot and stick approach. Membership of the club was enough for the people of these countries to feel part of the European norm. However, it also brought home to them the way in which their practices had become totally undemocratic. It was quite normal, in countries that we regard as quite developed such as the Czech Republic, for ordinary citizens to accept and expect that the judiciary would effectively implement the will of the executive. It was accepted that the courts were incapable of vindicating individual citizens' rights if the government did not want that to happen. In making it clear that this was not an acceptable norm, the Council of Europe performed an extremely useful role.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">The Council of Europe Development Bank is somewhat different in so far as it has a mainly financial role. It provides funds for what we in this country would call social inclusion. In that regard, it was quite distinct from other development banks in Europe and elsewhere. For many years, we have had the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank, of which we are members. These banks also performed a useful role in funding large-scale projects in eastern Europe. For example, they funded the transfer from nuclear power to more conventional forms of power generation in eastern Europe. It is also useful for the bank to have this vocational, socially inclusive role and I welcome the fact that we have decided to join it at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">I examined the Schedule to the Bill and the purposes to which it has been put. It is fair to say that we could borrow some of these purposes in Ireland, although I appreciate that we do not intend to do so. The treatment of minorities is something in which we have not excelled. It is true that there are still people in this country who have difficulty in accommodating themselves to the fact that the children and grandchildren of settlers who arrived here in the 17th century are Irish and are entitled to be treated as people who have rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">More recently, we have not been good in the way we have treated our own recently arrived immigrants. When we look at countries like Romania and countries in the Balkans that have very clear minority problems, we should examine our own consciences. That should not stop us from telling countries like Romania, Bulgaria, the countries of the former Yugoslavia and Slovakia, that we do expect them to meet certain norms in recognising the ethnic rights of their minorities and in allowing them due expression, be it legal, political or linguistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">We recently had a visit from the Croatian Minister for European integration who made a presentation to the European affairs committee. I asked her a number of questions on the issue of refugees, which is pertinent to the work carried out by the bank. While Croatia has made serious progress in the past couple of years, much of it driven by the desire to be part of the European Union, there is still a great deal to be done there. The Minister repeatedly made the point that while her Government has no problem with the notion of displaced people in Bosnia, the rest of Croatia and Serbia returning to their former homes in Croatia, these people have to recognise that resettling them is very difficult. It is all very well for the Croatian Government to state on the one hand that it would like the refugees to come back and that they have a right to do so, but on the other hand they are told they will not have houses and jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">In that context, the expressed will of the bank to become involved in those issues and to assist directly in the provision of housing for displaced refugees is very welcome. The message needs to go out that countries such as Croatia should not be allowed to reap the benefits of ethnic cleansing and that people who lived previously in Croatia, Serbia and different parts of Bosnia do have a right to return to their property and a right to be resettled should they choose to exercise that right. It is appropriate that the EU, or in this case the Council of Europe, should have that extra arm available to it to provide direct financial assistance to those who are looking to assist in the resettling of those refugees.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">The decision of the Government to join the bank arose out of the 2002 review of our development aid. I guess it is part of a distinct shift in Ireland's development aid activities. There was a time when we provided "black baby" assistance through voluntary organisations. We then pursued a bilateral aid programme, which was correctly and properly targeted at providing assistance to individual projects on a bilateral basis. The increase in our contribution to multilateral organisations, including the Council of Europe Development Bank, in recent years can be partly attributed to the increase in our overall expenditure. We have increased the amount of money we give to other banks, such as the Bretton Woods institutions, the World Bank and the IMF. We have provided direct bilateral debt relief assistance in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">Perhaps the shift to which I have referred has not been discussed to the extent it might have been. The non-governmental organisations which deal with such issues are largely supportive of it. While I do not criticise the broadening of our development co-operation base, I wonder if we sometimes fail to examine carefully the effect of the various forms of assistance we provide. Ireland is providing direct budgetary assistance to Mozambique, for example. The assistance is debt relief, in effect. The money is being allocated to assist Mozambique's budgetary position. Therefore, it seems to me that we have to take a greater interest in what is being done with that money by the Mozambican Government, which I do not intend to criticise as it has made enormous strides in recent years. We need to co-operate with the Mozambican authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Referring to development co-operation rather than development assistance may be the real key in this regard. We need a mechanism that enables us to co-operate with such governments to provide the additionality. In other words, if we provide debt relief, we need to ensure that the money that becomes available as a consequence is used in a way we can support. We need to adopt a hands-on approach to our bilateral assistance to countries like Mozambique.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">NGOs and other organisations which are directly involved in development co-operation are concerned about the role played in recent years by the Bretton Woods institutions, particularly the IMF. The World Bank, by contrast, has done much in recent years under the leadership of Mr. Wolfensohn to take a more caring approach. It seems that a "good cop, bad cop" approach is being adopted. The IMF is clearly the bad cop and the World Bank is sometimes the good cop. I have previously expressed concern about the use of ESAF funds, the operation of the ESAF programme and the conditions imposed on developing countries in the Third World which seek assistance from the World Bank and the IMF.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The imposition of the neo-liberal economic model, which is typically favoured by the economists who work for international banking institutions, can sometimes be inappropriate. It has frequently undermined civil society in developing countries. It has undermined the governments of such countries by making it more difficult for them to invest in education and health as they try to structure their economies in a fashion that fits into the IMF model. As a small but growing contributor of international aid, for example to the financial institutions in question, Ireland should make it clear that it is not comfortable with such an economic model. Given that the World Bank has slowly shifted its priorities in recent times, I am hopeful that one can make an impact on such institutions. They may not be totally impervious to political persuasion or the views of the governments which, in effect, fund them. At the meetings of such institutions, which are typically held each year, the Government should state clearly where it wants money to be spent and how it wants it to be linked.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Although the Minister of State has provided some information today, I do not know much about the workings of the Council of Europe Development Bank. Can he tell the House what is the bank's total loan portfolio? I assume that it operates from similar commercial ratios as most normal banks. I noted the Minister of State's comment that the bank gave loans of approximately €2 billion some years ago. I assume that its total capacity must be five or six times that sum. I would be interested to know the bank's total loan portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">It is interesting that the Council of Europe Development Bank has been given the AAA standard by the international rating agencies. I am fascinated by how the bank has managed to maintain that standard, while seeking to provide soft loans with deferred repayment in the vocational and social sectors. It seems that one has to take a few risks when one is trying to get involved in the work of those sectors. If the bank has been taking such risks, it must have been extremely successful with their outcomes. It is a pretty clever trick to maintain the AAA standard in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">I assume the Minister of State does not envisage that local authorities will apply for loans from the bank. I would like him to confirm that it is seen simply as a form of aid. If he has any further information about the geographical spread of loans in recent years, I would be interested to hear it. I assume that we are talking primarily about countries in eastern Europe, some of which are now EU member states. I would appreciate more information in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I cannot conclude without referring to the current debate on Ireland's overseas development aid allocation. I will not repeat what I said yesterday about the diminution of our ambition to meet the UN target, other than to reiterate that it is a pity and a shame and that people are extremely unhappy about it. I accept that the Government has reduced its target to 0.5% of GNP, but I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether the reduced target will be achieved. In the last 24 hours, non-governmental organisations, led by Dóchas, have expressed concern about whether the Government's new commitment to increases of €65 million this year and €60 million in each of the years 2005 and 2006 will enable it to achieve the 0.5% target. Having used my calculator this morning to examine the matter, I cannot envisage how the 0.5% target will be achieved. The monetary increases which have been announced will not amount to 0.5%, unless the Government foresees that there will be an economic recession in the next two or three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">I read the comments of officials from the Department of Finance, who said they do not really know what the GNP figures are. That is nonsense. The Department produced an estimate of GNP just a couple of months ago as part of its mid-term review, just as it does every year. I am sure it is well aware of the figure on which it will base the national pensions reserve fund contribution, for example, which is due to be approved by the Dáil next week. The Central Bank produced its quarterly estimate of GNP just a couple of weeks ago. The notion that we do not have a decent estimate of GNP and we cannot, therefore, make a reasonable estimate of what the relevant figures will be in two or three years' time is nonsense. Officials in the Department of Finance are aware that three-year predictions are produced as part of the budgetary documentation.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">We know, as best we can, that the money being committed as overseas development aid will not comprise 0.5% of GNP. The numbers are bogus. I have calculated that we will allocate 0.45% or 0.46% of GNP at best. It is shameful that we have decided to abandon the 0.7% target solemnly made by the Taoiseach at the UN four years ago in favour of a 0.5% target. It is absurd and dishonest to suggest that the new target can be met by the monetary commitment the Government announced a couple of days ago. I ask the Minister of State to explain the reasoning behind the decision at the conclusion of this debate or in the next couple of days. Can he confirm whether it is intended to allocate additional moneys to meet the 0.5% target? Will the Government meet a commitment on which the ink has hardly dried? The Government should realistically outline how the new 0.5% commitment will be met. The numbers which have been provided so far do not add up.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The Labour Party supports the Council of Europe Development Bank Bill 2004 and Ireland's proposed membership of the bank. I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House for this debate. I am fascinated by the Bill, which seems to deal almost exclusively with the issue of immunity. I assume that there is an obligation to provide immunity to the workers in the bank. Will the Minister of State clarify the matter?</p>

          <p eId="para_220">The scheme seems to be part of this whole contribution. It is not related to this particular subject. Ireland is becoming a member state of the Council of Europe Development Bank, an old established institution that is under the authority of the Council of Europe. As a new member of the Council of Europe I am still trying to familiarise myself with its workings. I am still looking at the wider membership, including several countries associated with the council, and how it drives its social and human rights agenda. Most of those countries associated with the council are new and developing democracies who therefore have a great many problems, including on human rights. The current interests in the bank reflect that.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Having visited Turkey some weeks ago and examined its problems in the areas of human and minority rights, I believe it is a great opportunity that we should become a member of the bank to show our solidarity with the Council of Europe and the very important projects taking place in the changing Europe of today. It has been asked why we are becoming members only now. Of course, it is a signal that we have arrived and are now a major player in the EU. Although we are still a small country, we want to be involved and show responsibility and a willingness to play our part in a wider, changing Europe. This is a golden opportunity for us to show our solidarity now.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">The Minister outlined the role of the Council of Europe Development Bank, which will have a social vocation, including social housing, health, education, rural modernisation and small enterprise. In addition, there is a regional remit to deal with refugees, displaced persons and migrants. It is good to share the burden to ensure that social cohesion is realised across Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">The Minister referred to the eligibility criteria and how projects will be monitored. Will the conditions be met fully? Will the bank work within Council of Europe conventions? I am not convinced that the Minister highlighted how countries will measure up to those criteria, such as how to respect the environment on the basis of international conventions and compliance with equality standards. There is a danger that support will be provided for economic projects that have a long-term impact on the environment. It is therefore important to apply the criteria. Will there be a mechanism in place to carry out the evaluation? What mechanism is in place to monitor the investment?</p>
          <p eId="para_224">I am also concerned about what structures will be put in place to report progress. Many committees are subcommittees of the Council of Europe. Will there be interaction between those relevant to the area and the bank?</p>
          <p eId="para_225">On the question of migration, we now know that people from developing countries, including the ten new EU member states, which are still developing their democracies, are moving to more prosperous countries with higher standards of living. There must be proper structures in place to address that. Ireland will have a responsibility in this regard and the fact that we are now becoming a contributor to the bank means that we will want questions to be answered on how money is spent. Social projects can be vague, especially with regard to the way in which programmes are implemented. It is very important that the bank measure countries against the eligibility criteria and requirements and that a monitoring structure be put in place to report on how money is spent. We often hear reports that money has been lost or wasted because too many people were working on a project.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">It is very important that Ireland plays a part. We should be delighted that our money is going in the right direction, but we need transparency and accountability. It is worthwhile, and we are delighted that Ireland has become a member of the bank now. It is an expression of our solidarity. We have come a long way and are playing a major role. Having said that, we like to think that there is transparency regarding how money is spent on such projects, particularly in states emerging from being less democratic than westernised countries. I have seen examples where projects failed because they were not properly monitored or supervised.</p>

          <p eId="para_235">This is very important legislation. We were one of the founder members of the Council of Europe. My criticism is that it has taken us 50 years to get involved in this bank, which is designed specifically to help the poorest of the poor in developing countries. This modest contribution as part of Ireland's overseas development aid is extremely welcome, and we should expand it.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Perhaps the introduction of this Bill might direct the public's attention to the work of the Council of Europe, which is not widely known. The media are more interested in determining what expenses Irish delegations draw down for attending meetings than in the work of the council and its various committees on political affairs, social affairs, health and education. They seem to direct their attention on the one hand to whether one attends meetings and, on the other hand, to what travelling expenses one claims. I wish the media would pay some attention to the work of the council, much of which is relevant to us in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Those of us who are members of the all-party delegation, including Labour, Fine Gael and Independents as well as Fianna Fáil, have contributed to the evolution of Council of Europe policies. The Irish delegation, in the general assembly and the various committees, has made an outstanding contribution. This is welcomed by the member states, especially the emerging, fragile democracies that need economic and social stability. If they do not have such stability, they will experience political instability which, following the collapse of communism, is not desirable in these states. I refer to the Ukraine, which has a population of 50 million. A civil war is feared and the problem stems from underdevelopment and a lack of education and opportunity. There are also drugs and alcohol problems but such emerging democracies have a humanitarian deficit which, unless it is remedied, will lead to conflicts similar to those in the past. The civil unrest in Ukraine following the election reflects an underlying desire among certain people for a return to the communist regime. This could spread north and south of the Ukraine and result in a difficult scenario in eastern Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The Bill is welcome because it is long overdue and it will make a contribution to the Irish response to the necessity for spending on overseas aid. Ireland should accelerate its investment in this area to help the poorest of the poor and to help establish stability in emerging democracies by investing in education, employment and social schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">I was Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid for a number of years. I had the opportunity to bring all the aid organisations together in Iveagh House. It was the first time non-governmental organisations came together with the Department and I was struck by how little they knew about each other's activities. It was an education for both the NGOs and the Department, as each organisation outlined its activities to ensure improved co-operation, less duplication of effort and more support for those who needed it most.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">It is important that the aid organisations should be made fully aware of the legislation so they might direct their attention to countries in central and eastern Europe to address refugee and migration issues quickly. The situation in the Ukraine could easily get out of hand and we have witnessed many horrific instances over the past number of years of anarchy following the breakdown of law and order. These incidents mainly stem from the underlying poverty and deprivation experienced by people. Senator Ormonde referred to Turkey and she will have seen the conditions in which some people live in Istanbul. Ireland's efforts in the campaign to improve living standards among the populations of emerging democracies are welcome and worthwhile and they will create an awareness in the public mind about how important these areas are and how welcome our contribution is in such countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">The cutback in overseas development aid has been widely discussed in recent weeks. Unfortunately, I had the experience of losing my seat in the 1992 general election and this puts this issue in perspective. Does the public care about overseas aid? If the public did, I would have received the highest vote ever for the work I did in this area. I would have received between 10,000 and 12,000 first preference votes, instead of half that number. The work done in the area of overseas aid was not appreciated. I do not wish to sound a note of warning for the Minister of State.</p>

Mr. Duffy, who apart from being a public service broadcaster, is also a newspaper columnist, is more interested in expenses than the work done by MEPs and the contribution Ireland makes to the development of European institutions and, especially, the Council of Europe, which is often confused with the European Parliament.</p>

          <p eId="para_246">Fáiltím freisin roimh an Aire Stáit. Most people have limited knowledge of European institutions in terms of the manner in which they impact on us and the role MEPs play in them, which is often positive and progressive. This lack of awareness is most manifest during debates on referenda and, undoubtedly, it will manifest itself during the debate on the European constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I imagine that few people have any knowledge of the Council of Europe Development Bank. In the context of a materialistic world, this bank is in many ways a good news story. Whenever we discuss banks we do not often use the terms "social conscience" or "social focus". Recently many people were heartened by the findings of <i>The Economist</i> survey which put Ireland at the top of the league in terms of quality of life under various headings. This was a salutary and timely reminder to us of how lucky we are as a people.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">This position was brought about by our vision as a people, our tenacity, the leadership of Government and the assistance we have received from Europe. We have been able to enjoy the fruits of life as a result of our position in Europe. Unfortunately, in some areas this has also brought a sense of greed. We seem to always think in terms of the begging bowl and what we can get from Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">The time has come when we must consider how we can contribute, pay back and help those less fortunate than ourselves. This is expected of us as a result of our history. For example, one need only look at the contribution we made when we were not affluent. Our people travelled throughout the world, whether as missionaries or to help develop legislative systems in underdeveloped countries. People expect Ireland to be central to any mission that sets out to help people, whether in an emergency or as a result of an historical position.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">It is important that we are seen to be part of banks like the Council of Europe Development Bank, which is focused not just on emergency areas but on areas such as education, social housing and health, all the areas of immediate concern, and that we are seen to support them. It is easy to forget. In fairness, the media, the broadcast media in particular, have made us aware of the parts of Europe and the world which still suffer from extreme poverty. We are all aware of it but it is important that it is highlighted.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">I remember speaking to a person who returned from a visit to North Korea shocked by how dismal a country it was and that the women there still worked in the fields. I thought that was ironic because we could still remember Ireland at that particular stage of non-development. We have come a long way in a short period, yet it is easy to close our minds. We should realise that other countries could succeed in the same way we did if they had luck and support on their side.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">Recently I entertained a group comprising two mayors and two others from Slovakia. They came to Ireland through contact with some nuns from the Presentation Convent in Cashel who were working in Slovakia. The group came to study our development as a tourist destination. From talking to them I realised they did not have the bare essentials; they did not have roads, let alone the other necessary infrastructure we take for granted. When we brought the group around the country to show them certain developments, these educated, highly intelligent people were mesmerised.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">We should not confuse lack of opportunity with lack of education or intelligence. These people may have suffered under the system operated in their country and some of their initiative might have been dulled, but they were still inspired by what they saw and wanted to be able to achieve similar results. They accepted this would not happen overnight. It is interesting that it is to Ireland these groups come. In some way they identify and feel a particular affinity with us. This may be for religious or other reasons apart from historical ones. It is not sufficient that we just entertain these people and empathise with their difficulties. We must be practical.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">I admit that like many others I knew little about the development bank before this debate. The bank probably did not register with us to any great degree until now. Having learned about it, I was inspired by it. Often when discussing development we see these as being peripheral and see the economic charter as the central driving force, even though we have social and cultural charters. This is not to say that we do not do well in the other areas. I am particularly pleased that through this development bank we have, in a way, the antidote to materialism and to selfishness or self interest. One might say the same with regard to charity.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">I do not believe one must wait until one gets to the next world to be rewarded one hundred fold. We are rewarded through morale. The morale of a nation is lifted and rewarded by doing something not specifically for itself but for others. While it would not be our motivation, our generosity is paid back to us through friendship and co-operation that may be required at a given time. How often have we said about Ireland that because we never colonised another country, the Irish find friendship wherever they go? This is largely because people saw us as givers not takers. This is our image and it benefits us when we need support on other issues. It is interesting that other countries, because of that fraternity of nations, can identify with us because of having helped them at a given time.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">The same goes in the case of the development bank. I do not suggest this should be our motivation in helping; I am sure it is not. By making a contribution and being part of the development bank, we are doing what is right and what is expected of us, which is why I strongly support the Bill. Taking part positions us as a proactive country that wants full development within Europe, not just for the big powers and those lucky enough to be in the right position at a given time, but so that all nations large and small will benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">I support the Bill and am glad to see there is a degree of unanimity thereon. There should be no division on it, but solidarity. I am glad this step is being taken. I echo Senator Mansergh's comment that it should have happened sooner. However, it is happening now. It underpins our confidence as a nation that we are prepared to be part of a social project and development of this kind.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_147">
          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_258">I echo the welcoming comments to the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy. I am particularly pleased that he is here as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs. He has graced this House with his presence on many occasions through the years in various portfolios and I have every confidence he will continue to bring the same efficiency and professionalism to his new job as he has done in the past. I wish him well in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">I also echo the comments of Senator Mansergh who has taken the lead in this debate and of my friend and colleague, Senator Ó Murchú. Why has it taken so long for Ireland to sign up to this bank and why are we being asked to pass this legislation at the 11th hour when it could have been done much earlier? Be that as it may, I am glad it is going through both Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">I highlight this, perhaps for a different reason to my two colleagues, and in a sense to pick up the thread of what Senator Daly said about attitudes in Ireland and the Irish political establishment towards European institutions. I have noticed in my membership of this House that there is a perception, not fuelled by successive Administrations I hasten to add, but certainly fuelled by the media, that Irish political participation in European institutions is about junkets, travelling abroad, the glamour of aeroplanes and airports. Inevitably it comes down to how much it costs to stay in a hotel or whether one travels business class or economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">I do not wish to overemphasise this point and I agree with everything Senator Daly said. He and I are members of the Council of Europe, as is Senator Ormonde, and we have first-hand knowledge of the impact this attitude has on those of us who believe we are doing something positive in the council, in our case, and in the other European institutions which have distinguished Irish members.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Following the recent publication of expenses for both Houses of the Oireachtas I was asked by Matt Cooper on "The Last Word" radio programme if I stayed in a three star or five star hotel and if I travelled economy or business class. That was his question to me on national radio as a member of the Irish delegation to the Council of Europe, despite the fact that in the two years I have been there I presented three separate reports. I could also list the contribution of other Irish members. Not one of those debates has ever been discussed or even reported, not even as much as one line has appeared in the national newspapers about what is done there. Is it at all surprising, as appears to be emerging in the debate, that there is confusion in the minds of the Irish electorate about the Council of Europe, the European Union, the European Parliament, and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe? If this Bill does nothing else it takes a small step in the right direction in terms of promoting the Council of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I see there are young people in the Gallery who are here as part of civics classes where they are learning about State institutions. Perhaps they will go away from their experience in this House and say in reply to being asked what was being debated in the Seanad that we were discussing a Council of Europe institution. It might lead to someone asking a question as to what the council is about, who its members are and if it is the same as the European Parliament? They both meet in Strasbourg although in separate buildings. The European Parliament also meets in Brussels.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The Council of Europe is the oldest of the European institutions. It was set up in 1949 in the immediate aftermath of the ending of fascism and the Nazi scourge in Europe by 14 like-minded countries. I am proud to say Ireland was one of the founding members. It was set up primarily to protect human rights across the European continent to ensure that never again would any girl or boy, man or woman, be subjected to state terror and authoritarianism and that their human rights and dignity would never be violated in future. The European Convention on Human Rights was agreed at that time and still remains as a monument to the far-thinking people and environment of that era.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">It is salutary that we should remember the circumstances in which the Council of Europe was set up because the lines have become considerably blurred in recent years and there appears to be an increasing violation of human rights, especially in eastern European countries, many of which emerged out of the dark decades of communism. Belarus is a basket case. It has a dictator, an authoritarian communist, Mr. Lukashenko, who is running his own private fiefdom where the freedom of the media and any attempt to introduce the norms of democracy are constantly flouted. My colleague across the floor, Senator McCarthy, raised the issue of Chernobyl children on the Order of Business. This dictator refuses to allow them to leave the country. This is at the heart of the type of work the Council of Europe does.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_150">
          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_268">I will try to pick up the thread of my thoughts. In the context of the formation of the Council of Europe, the Council of Europe Development Bank, established in the mid-1950s, has been doing extraordinarily positive work. I think I am correct in suggesting that this is the first legislation to come through this House that has a specific reference to the Council of Europe and to a Council of Europe institution. If it does nothing else at least it will raise a certain awareness, a point to which other speakers have alluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Countries like Sweden, Italy and Germany, which one would not normally associate with social and economic disadvantage, have benefited to some degree from funding through the Council of Europe Development Bank. Will Ireland now be in a position to benefit or did we always have this right if we wished to put forward an application?</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I was particularly struck by the reference to Germany. The German experience relates to the key role of vocational training in the fight against unemployment. The programme has involved over 7,000 small and medium sized enterprises and led to the creation of over 10,000 apprenticeships. I am no expert in this area but I am aware that concern is regularly expressed about what appears to be a diminution in the number of apprentices and apprenticeship courses here. For example, I understand that in Sligo IT a number of apprenticeship courses have been abandoned. Anecdotal evidence would suggest that this area has been somewhat neglected here in recent times. Anybody who has needed the services of a carpenter, plumber, painter or decorator in recent years will know how difficult it is to find one.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_151">
          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_271">One cannot get them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_152">
          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_272">One cannot find a tradesman to do a small or medium-sized job, they are only available to build 55 or 110 houses in an estate. Is there an opportunity for the Government to follow the German example in this respect? It appears that there is a gap in this area which may be to do with funding. I cannot understand why an apprenticeship course would have been abandoned in an institute of technology. I only have anecdotal evidence in this regard and I stand to be corrected on the details.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">In the context of the Bill I welcome the emphasis the bank has placed in recent years in the stability pact for south-east Europe. Will the Minister give serious consideration to raising the issue of human rights violations in Kosovo? We could perhaps support civic society in its attempts to inform and educate Albanian and Serbian Kosovans, particularly the Serbian population of Serbia, about human rights violations because it is part of the mandate. For example, the mandate refers to efforts to foster peace, democracy, respect for human rights and economic prosperity in order to achieve stability in the whole region, which is still potentially explosive. There is no question that until and unless a final settlement is reached in the Kosovo region and the Serbians are brought into the European fold to comply with European norms, especially in respect of tracking down and handing over of the war criminals, Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, they will not be part of the European family of nations in the way they wish to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">In Croatia, the bank has provided social housing for returning emigrants, where the problem remains. It is an area in which the country has benefited through its involvement in the Council of Europe Development Bank. The former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, played an impressive role during Ireland's EU Presidency and visited the troubled area, in which 213 Irish troops are operating under the UNMOVIC mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">A group from Kosovo visited with the sub-committee on human rights and its members outlined their views. As the Minister of State is in the House, I ask him to address the unresolved issues regarding the return of the bodies of civilians from Kosovo who were murdered by Serbian forces in 1999 following the NATO bombings. Some 700 bodies have still not been returned by the Serbian authorities, which are dragging their feet by insisting they do not have the medical facilities to provide proper post-mortems and are sending the bodies on a drip-drip basis. Some 31 bodies were returned one year and 25 another since 2000. Can anyone imagine the trauma the families of those unfortunate victims are feeling, as a result of what I believe to be the definite violation of the human rights and dignity of Kosovo Albanians? Reference is made in the mandate of the bank, of which Ireland will now be part, to respect for human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">In the week in which one of Ireland's best-loved and oldest institutions in this city, Bewley's, is being shut down in the interests of commercial greed, the question of a national trust for Ireland must be addressed. As cultural heritage forms part of the mandate of the Council of Europe Development Bank Bill, surely the Government must be able to do something, even in the face of commercial reality where such an operation is privately owned. In any other country, the Bewley's buildings on Westmoreland Street and Grafton Street would be immediately protected as listed buildings and a national trust, such as exists in the UK, would be financed by the Government to take over the buildings.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">However, next week these cafés will be shut down and those wonderful stained glass windows and the whole ethos of what Bewley's has represented for Irish people as well as Dubliners will be lost forever. If the Council of Europe Development Bank Bill is supposed to be about anything in the context of the protection of cultural heritage, this is a perfect example, of which there are many more.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I am grateful that the Minister of State has come to the House to take this Bill in his capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, a very wide remit. This Bill will prove to be a very positive development in Ireland's continuing engagement with European institutions. If it does nothing but raise awareness of the important work of the Council of Europe in its institutions and parliamentary assembly, this will be a good day's work.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelTracey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_153">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Treacy)</from>
          <p eId="para_279">I sincerely thank Senators for their wide-ranging and interesting comments on this Bill. Members of Seanad Éireann have shown consistent and genuine concern about the affairs of the less well-off countries of the world, which is fully acknowledged by me on behalf of the Government. We have benefited from the valuable contribution made to the economic and social development of Ireland by international development institutions. It is now time for us to acknowledge that past support and, as we become wealthier, show our support for other states in their development and grappling with their problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">In joining the bank at this time, we are acknowledging our commitment, not only to new members of the European Union, but also to the other countries of eastern Europe. I consider that the Irish experience has much to offer in eastern Europe and elsewhere. I pay tribute to all the speakers. Senator John Paul Phelan welcomed the Bill and supported the Government on behalf of Fine Gael and his very positive contribution is deeply appreciated. Senator Mansergh and others raised the point that we are a bit late in joining the bank. However, that slowness was not due to any reluctance about the importance of the Bill. By joining now, we are expressing our commitment to a new and expanded Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">Taking into account our involvement with the Council of Europe, our contribution over the years, our GDP performance and our economic growth, this is a very important and historic time in Europe. We have enlarged the Union to 25 countries; two or perhaps three new member states will join in the next few years and the European constitution is also being brought forward. All of this comes together at a very important time and Ireland is playing a key role, having just completed its Presidency. This represents a strong statement by Ireland that it intends to continue to support the expanded Europe, particularly the eastern European countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Senator McDowell also welcomed the Bill and noted the shift in our support for developmental institutions. He referred to the World Bank and the IMF, in regard to which I note and accept his points. The Senator asked about the loan portfolio of the bank. The current position is that the bank has disbursed loans totalling €1.58 billion in 2003, which is slightly more than the €1.53 billion disbursed in 2002. The outstanding loan portfolio at present is €11 billion. The Council of Europe Development Bank's new medium-term strategy for the years 2005 to 2009 seeks to keep a similar rate of annual disbursements — €1.6 billion in 2005 and 2006 — while increasing its operations in central and south-eastern Europe, where it is placing its greatest emphasis.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">Senator McDowell referred to the immunity provision in the Bill. This diplomatic immunity is a standard practice, contained in all types of international legislation. It gives immunity to the management, staff and agents of the bank irrespective of the country in which they work so that they can do business, move around and be safe and secure in the knowledge they are protected in the work they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The Senator was very critical about the Government's position on the ODA budget, describing it as absurd and dishonest. I note the points made about the ODA budget but they are not relevant to this Bill. Our payments to this bank, on becoming a member, are our contributions to the capital and reserves of the bank. The payments are new and are in addition to our ODA contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">The target of 0.7% remains as far as the Government is concerned and the increases announced in the Book of Estimates represent major progress towards that goal. In securing an increase of €60 million in 2005 and minimum levels of increase of €65 million in each of 2006 and 2007, we can now plan on a far more secure footing. We are moving firmly and progressively toward our objective of reaching the UN target. By any standards, increases in ODA spending announced in the Book of Estimates are huge. We have not reached where we want to go but we are moving steadily in that direction. The increases are dramatic. Our overall contribution to ODA in 1994 was just €96 million. Next year, it will be €535 million and it will reach €665 million in 2007. We are joint seventh in terms of ODA, among the most generous donors in the world and well above the European average.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">Given our very high growth rates, we are in a sense victims of our own success. Any reasonable person would accept that €190 million is a massive increase and we will continue to build rapidly and expand qualitatively on this very strong base. The total spend on ODA over the next three years will amount to approximately €1.8 billion. One must also add to that Ireland's contribution to the World Food Programme, with which I dealt while working on my previous portfolio. There is great respect for Ireland's generosity, without condition, qualification or normal standard criteria in regard to business transacted between us and the donor and so on. There is respect for Ireland and the fact that we give money so generously, without condition or qualification but according to the normal standard criteria. We do not impose conditions whereby a certain amount of business must be done in this country or a certain amount of products must be bought from this country, unlike other countries which might make a much bigger contribution but which attach strong conditions. That Ireland has made such a contribution is accepted across the world and we are proud of our success.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">The Taoiseach gave a commitment in 2000 when our GDP was at a certain level. Based on that figure we believed we would reach the target of 0.7% over a number of years. Our GDP has performed admirably and we want that to continue. We will work progressively to achieve a realistic figure as quickly as possible. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is doing outstanding work in this area. He has been focused and fair in outlining the facts. Members can be assured that he has made a huge contribution already, along with the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, to ensure we provide this massive increase. We are confident that we will continue to enhance Ireland's reputation as one of the world's greatest donors to the development aid programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">Senator Ormonde made a number of points about the reporting arrangements of the bank. The bank publishes an annual report which is transmitted to the Council of Ministers. The bank's activities are managed by the governing body and the administrative council, of which Ireland will be a member. The annual report is available to the general public. It is not necessary to report on the operations of the bank to the House and there is no reporting to the Oireachtas on the operation of the other two European development banks, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Their annual reports are published and are available as required but it is not mandatory to make the reports available.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Senator Daly welcomed the Bill and referred to the importance of social cohesion in the new states of eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Union. Indeed, his remarks rang alarm bells for me and given that there are almost three years left to the next election, I will take due heed of them. Senator Ó Murchú referred to how Ireland has benefited from supports since it joined the European Union. Now is the time, as Senator Mansergh also pointed out, to repay some of the help we received over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Senator Mansergh cited the difficulties in some of the fledgling states of eastern Europe at present. He spoke about the quality of life report in <i>The Economist</i>. I endorse that report. Last week, I addressed the 25 European Union ambassadors or heads of mission in this country and each one spoke about that report and the quality of life in this country. It was heart-warming to find such confidence in diplomats of such high calibre. They regard Ireland as one of the most outstanding places in the world and confirmed what was reported in <i>The Economist</i>. The Government’s job and goal is to enhance that.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">Senator Mooney raised a number of queries about Germany and borrowing by the bank for apprenticeship training and so forth. Senator McDowell asked the same question with regard to local authorities. There are no plans at present to use the bank for programmes in this country. We believe our GDP, economic capacity, the resources and reserves that are available and the liquidity of our institutions are sufficient to allow us to use our own resources. Indeed, there is supplementary support for various programmes from Europe. There is no reason to call on resources from this bank so we have no intention of using them at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">Senator Mooney also spoke about Kosovo. We are pleased with the recent elections that took place there. It is to be hoped there will be acceptance of the democratic result and that a government can be formed. Hopefully, under the EU-UN administration, democracy will be allowed to sustain itself over the next number of years, people will be in control of the government that is formed, there will be acceptance of the government and Kosovo can become a successful country in its own right with the support it gets from the EU, the UN and the leadership that is critical for its future.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">I thank Senators for giving the Bill their speedy attention. The Bill has been awaiting consideration in the Dáil since February. It came close to discussion on several occasions but other legislation resulted in the postponement of its consideration. It is close to the date of acceptance of the conditions of membership and the Seanad's attention to the Bill today is much appreciated. I thank the Senators for their interesting contributions and their support of the Bill. It is encouraging that all sides of the House are committed to the expression of solidarity and social inclusion in the wider Europe which is the core mission of the Council of Europe Development Bank. I look forward to Committee Stage at 5.30 p.m.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_296">This section relates to the establishment of the registration boards, which will be extremely important. I am sure Members and the Minister of State will want to ensure that these boards operate in line with their international counterparts and that they will not cover people for whom provision is not made internationally. I was concerned on the previous occasion when the Minister of State said that we must be careful about protecting people's livelihoods. The boards will not take anyone else's livelihood away; they will be concerned with the protection of people's titles. If a person is not entitled to be with a particular board, that does not mean they cannot make a living. No one is trying to prevent them from doing so. These individuals will merely not be able to refer to themselves by the title conferred by registration with the board in question. People will be required to have certain training, experience, etc., before they can register with any of the boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">The registration boards will make their own rules. However, I understood that the philosophy behind the Bill is to introduce professional registration in respect of the professionals to which it refers while simultaneously protecting the general public by ensuring that only those registered will be able to refer to themselves by whatever may be the relevant appellation. There is no question that we are trying to take away anyone's livelihood. I previously stated that we can establish as many registration boards as we like but that people will be free to refuse to take notice of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Senator Glynn also previously referred to the outrageous behaviour of certain individuals who were members of professional boards. If people want to seek help from such individuals, there is nothing we can do about it. All we can do is point out that they are not registered with the various registration boards. If, when the boards are established, it is believed that certain people already on the registers should be struck off, the boards will be empowered to remove them.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">It is important to recall the philosophy behind the Bill which, in my view, is to establish registers for the various professions, require professional qualifications from anyone wishing to register and allow for further professions to be catered for at a later date. No one is trying to take away anyone else's livelihood. The important matter with which the Bill deals involves people's use of titles. Members of the general public should be in a position to consult registers to see if people who refer to themselves as holding particular professional appellations are included on those registers.</p>

          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_300">This is one of the more important Bills to come before this House in my seven years as a Member. Professional qualifications should be jealously guarded. These are people who have gone through the rigours of studying for anything up to seven years to attain a professional title. This Bill is designed to protect those titles. Apart from the 12 professional groupings mentioned therein, the Minister has also provided in the legislation the power to incorporate other groupings. It is imperative and it cannot be stressed enough that professional standards are very high. Both the Minister of State and I would insist that all the professional groupings are stand-alone professions and must be recognised as such. I commend the Minister of State on his view and he is also a professional person. It is imperative that the titles are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">We must also ensure that consumers are protected and treated by people who are qualified to treat them and whose qualifications have <i>de facto</i> recognition by the State. As an Irishman and as a Member of the Oireachtas I am in favour of that protection and believe it must be ensured. Some groupings have expressed their concerns to me. I have spoken to the Minister of State and I am satisfied that he is on the right track. Senator Henry is also correct and I support her view. The Government is not trying to do anyone down because that is not its role. This Bill will protect those who have gone through the rigours of pursuing a professional career and earning a qualification. The Houses of the Oireachtas will enact legislation to protect the professional qualifications and titles and also the consumer.</p>

The amendments will ensure that the registration boards update the register on a frequent basis. Amendment No. 8 proposes to make the register available for inspection by members of the public which is their right. They could ascertain that the person they intend to engage or whom they are consulting is a member of the appropriate registration board and is certified as a result, thus ensuring the public gets the proper service it deserves.</p>

It can be presumed that new people will be coming on to the register every year as they qualify and those who have died will no longer appear. My amendment proposes an update on a yearly basis. I support Senator Browne's amendment that the register be available for inspection by members of the public. I prefer my own proposal of yearly rather than on an up to date basis, which could mean yearly but then it might also mean more than yearly, which would be an onus on the registration board. Any sensible kind of register must be updated on a yearly basis. The amendment proposing that the public be allowed see the register is very important.</p>

          <p eId="para_307">The maintenance of a comprehensive, accurate and up-to-date register of practitioners is a main function of each registration board and is clearly pivotal to the effective discharge of the role of each board. The registrants also have an important responsibility to keep the relevant board informed of any changes in their registration details. Section 44 specifies a number of detailed responsibilities of both the registrant and the board to ensure that the register of practitioners is correct and remains correct and fully up to date at all times. Section 45 sets down requirements for the publication of the register consistent with the objective of Senator Browne's amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">It is considered that these provisions give adequate scope and flexibility to the registration boards to publish the registers as often as required, including on the web, for example. Limiting publication to once a year, as proposed by Senator Henry, would preclude the registration board from providing real time information on its registered practitioners to members of the public. This would be seen to impact on the board's primary objective of protecting the public. In my view, real time information would provide a more up to date version of the register.</p>

Could the phrase "at least yearly" not be included? I ask the Minister of State to consider my proposal. Registers exist which are left <i>saecula saeculorum </i>and I know some of them. I am not be happy with the looseness of this section of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">Senator Browne's proposal for access by the public has not been dealt with. The Minister of State's proposals are not satisfactory. I am an agreeable woman but the section must include a phrase such as "at least on a yearly basis" or something stronger if the Minister of State wants it more up to date, which would be splendid. I have known of registers which have not been reprinted for years in some cases. It is very important to include this proposal.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">I presume the Senator is not referring to voters' registration. I am not aware of and I would be delighted if the Senator could inform me of any register that has not been updated. My understanding of the professions is that the registers must be updated annually. I have no problem with adding the phrase "on an annual basis" to section 45, which states, "publish its register in the manner, and at the times, that it considers appropriate." I am not aware of any professional body which does not do so. My own profession of pharmacy has a statutory obligation to publish its register. I presume the medical profession and others must publish on an annual basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_327">As the Senators will be aware, given the potential implications for a practitioner's livelihood, all decisions of the council in the disciplinary area are subject either to appeal or confirmation by the High Court. It is essential in this regard that the council behaves at all times strictly in accordance with the principles of due process.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">The fitness to practise procedures contained in the Bill are, therefore, designed to differentiate clearly between the distinct and separate roles of the various constituent elements of the disciplinary process. The role of the council is broadly to initiate the investigation of a complaint and dictate an appropriate sanction based on the recommendations of a registration board following the substantiation of a complaint against a registrant.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Conferring a broad power on the council to initiate and carry out an investigation into a complaint, as proposed by Senators Browne and Henry, would circumvent the detailed fitness to practise system and run the risk of rendering the disciplinary committee superfluous or at least confer a lower order of importance on the committee. It could also undermine the objective of the Bill to develop a more modern approach to the investigation of fitness to practise complaints through the introduction of a mediation route and allowing a practitioner to accept a complaint to preclude a full hearing in less serious cases. Moreover, there could be concern among practitioners regarding the scope for potential abuse of the complaints system in circumstances that an investigation could be commenced in the absence of a complaint being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">The requirement that there be scope for the regulatory system to initiate a complaint against a registered practitioner is reflected in section 51(3), which allows the registration board to make a complaint to the council. The proposed amendment is, therefore, not accepted.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_331">The Minister of State's response makes good sense. However, the House has on previous occasions expressed concern regarding notorious cases in which none of the individuals concerned made a complaint, whether due to embarrassment about complaining about someone they trusted or for other reasons. The health boards were in the position — I do not know what the position is since their abolition — to initiate barring orders and so forth if a matter was believed to be getting out of hand, for instance, in circumstances in which a woman repeatedly makes complaints against her husband, only to withdraw them.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">While I accept the logic of the Minister of State's argument, perhaps he or his officials could devise a way to deal with issues of this nature when they arise. There have been notorious cases in the medical profession in which it was well known that certain individuals were behaving improperly, yet no one complained. This is a difficult issue and perhaps it does not come within the scope of the Bill. Perhaps we are seeking to protect people from themselves too much. A problem arises, however, when one cannot find anyone to make a complaint against a person behaving in a professional matter, even when it is widely known. It is even more difficult to find complainants in small localities than in cities.</p>

          <p eId="para_333">I understand the Senator's views on this issue and she is correct that we are all aware of cases that arose in the past. The professions and the general public accept that much of what happened in the past was not correct. I understand that the medical practitioners Bill and other legislation to come before the Houses will include whistleblower provisions in that there will be an onus on members of the professions who are aware of malpractice or unethical behaviour to come forward. They will not be able to plead ignorance. While I understand the Senator's views on past events, the Bill will ensure that complaints regarding members of the 12 professions covered by the legislation will be dealt with in an orderly fashion. It will not be necessary for individuals to make complaints against members of the professions.</p>

This area is not as straightforward as other areas of life where one can air one's grievances. People may not be physically able to make a complaint or may find it awkward to reveal aspects of their medical histories. The purpose of the amendment is simply to ensure that no one who reads section 27 will mistakenly conclude that the council does not have a role in the complaints procedure. The amendment spells out that its role will be to receive complaints. While this is referred to in greater detail in section 51(3), the problem is that anyone reading section 27 could get the wrong impression.</p>

If somebody had a complaint in a few year and read section 27 he or she might not be clear on how to proceed. Our amendment is intended to clarify the steps involved.

          <p eId="para_357">Regulation often tends directly or indirectly to reduce competition unless adequate safeguards are put in place to prevent it. There is a substantial body of informed literature in Ireland and elsewhere demonstrating that professional regulation can all too easily result in restrictions with adverse economic impacts. In the Bill the level of lay representation on the council and the individual registration boards is intended to ensure that the work of the council and the boards is open, transparent, accountable and supports competition while ensuring that the public is protected, properly informed and guided. Notwithstanding the significance of this innovation in view of the potential competition impacts of the exercise of the powers of the council and registration boards respectively, the principle set out in the amendment is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Following consultation with the Competition Authority I intend to table amendments on Report Stage to provide that the authority should competition-proof the code of professional conduct and ethics in advance of it becoming binding on registrants and that rules of the council and by-laws of registration boards should be made public. Such amendments are intended to address the issue raised by Senator Browne's amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_375">If somebody has been out of practice for approximately two years this amendment requires that he or she would produce evidence of being brought up to date with the latest developments in his or her area of expertise.

We could leave it to the discretion of the registration boards to ensure to their satisfaction that the person has either attended a refresher course or has been briefed on any developments in his or her profession in that time.</p>

          <p eId="para_376">I share Senator Browne's concern that people might come back on to the register following a significant gap. There is very little in the Bill to cover continuing professional development or training, or whatever one wishes to call it. Perhaps it is being left to the boards but it does appear possible for someone to return to a register after quite a long gap. The practice of medicine changes rapidly and the people we are discussing are mainly paramedical practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">If there has been a gap of some duration, some evidence of continued competence should be required of the person who seeks to go back on the register.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">I understand what both Senators are alluding to. The section dealing with the continuing education of professionals is extremely important. The main objective of this Bill is to protect the public. The circumstances in which a practitioner who has discontinued his or her registration should be restored to the register warrants very careful consideration. Section 31(1)(<i>g</i>) provides that each registration board may make by-laws relating to the criteria for restoration to the register of that profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Section 38 provides that a person's name will be restored to a register if, among other requirements, that person meets the criteria established by by-law for restoration to the register. The issues in these proposed amendments by Senators Browne and Henry are therefore appropriate for inclusion in the criteria that each individual board develops on governing restoration to the register. In order to ensure consistency across registration boards under section 31, the council has a role in approving a registration board's by-laws. I do not propose to accept the amendments because it can be covered this way.</p>

          <p eId="para_396">I was concerned at the looseness of these committees. We should at least state what constitutes a quorum, in case a couple of people were deciding on extremely important issues to do with a person's livelihood. It might have been wise to state the minimum size of a committee because there is nothing more important than the disciplinary committees. I am not hung up on the size of the committee, but we should state the minimum size as well as a quorum. Nothing could be more important for someone on a register than coming before a disciplinary committee. To find that it might be two people and that there is nothing in the legislation to state that that cannot be the case is a poor idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I would like the Minister of State to elaborate on this section. My amendment states that the committee should consist of at least nine members, while the quorum should be five. That is quite a large number, but we are trying to ensure that one third of them are registrants. That is not possible with seven as we would end up with part of a person. A little more delineation is required to ensure that we have set up a suitable committee in fairness to the person that has to go before it. I am particularly anxious about the fact that the committee could be very small. There is nothing in the legislation that states that a committee of two cannot sit.</p>

          <p eId="para_398">The composition of committees of inquiry is critical to the credibility, transparency and accountability of the proposed regulatory system. The committees must have the expertise, capacity and commitment to effectively discharge the key responsibilities assigned to them in the Bill. They must also strike a balance between the requirement to ensure that the professional and clinical dimensions of any investigation are fully understood and the need to focus on the patient or client perspective. In assessing what this balance might be, a particular consideration must be that the work of a committee of inquiry, by its nature, will be a review of the professional or clinical conduct of a practitioner. Where non-registrants were in a majority in this process, particularly where the committee of inquiry had a small membership, this could contribute to a situation where the work of a committee might not be carried out in an efficient, effective and timely manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Notwithstanding the particular background in expertise of the lay membership, there is scope for the inquiry to be delayed by excessive consideration of technical and professional matters. The Bill does not lay down any strict quantitative restrictions on committees of inquiry. In some cases, a committee of three may suffice. In other circumstances there may be good grounds for a substantially larger committee of inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">It is appropriate that the council should have the power to exercise discretion in this regard. I accept the principle underlying the Senators' amendments, which is that the public interest should be specifically identified as a distinct constituent of a committee of inquiry. I propose, therefore, to table an amendment on Report Stage proposing that the council should have regard to the requirement for appropriate representation of the public interest when establishing a disciplinary committee.</p>

Under the Act, a citizen can pursue a case in the State in respect of an aeroplane crash that happened outside the State. The former rule was that a case could be pursued in the state in which the disaster happened, or in the state in which the airline is based. Perhaps the Minister of State will examine the Act to ascertain whether there are similarities and whether we can learn from it. I am sure that is exactly what Senator McCarthy was talking about. Like the legislation before the House, the Air Navigation and Transport (International Conventions) Act 2004 makes provision for events outside the State which affect citizens of the State. The Department of Transport has done a great deal of research in this area.</p>

I do not consider that section 52 is the most appropriate place in which to include such a provision, however. I propose to incorporate the principle of the Senator's proposal in an amendment on Report Stage, after I have discussed the most appropriate place for it with the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel. It may be included in Part 2. Given that the board is required under the Bill to recommend an appropriate sanction to the council when a complaint has been upheld following a hearing, a similar issue would arise if a member of a registration board were the subject of an inquiry into his or her fitness to practice. Therefore, it is proposed to table a further amendment on Report Stage to make provision for members of registration boards.</p>

There is no system of insulating gardaí against complaints, even though it is possible that the complaints might be malicious and baseless. Gardaí do not receive any protection when a person, of his or her own volition, makes a malicious complaint against them. We need to consider including strong references and explicit detail in this legislation to deal with malicious complaints. Such a provision needs to be included in the Bill.</p>

I picked up on it on Committee Stage. It obviously makes sense to hear some cases in private, while at other times they are suitable to hear in public. It might suit a person being pursued in the profession to have a case heard publicly as it would put further pressure on the complainant. Safeguarding the complainant is an issue. As the Minister of State clearly said a moment ago, the Bill's purpose is to protect the public. We do not want to be prescriptive. We want to retain the option of private and public hearings, but we do not want the professions to abuse the option of having a hearing in public — I am not saying that they would — especially concerning medical evidence and personal and intimate details.</p>

It is accepted that, as is proposed in the case of an inquiry carried out before a professional conduct committee, it is appropriate that there be some checks and balances on a registrant's right to reverse the general principle set out in the Bill, particularly where sensitive personal matters relating to a complaint may be the subject of examination. The content of the proposed amendment from Senator Browne is acceptable, subject to drafting changes required by the Parliamentary Counsel, which I propose to present on Report Stage.

The complainant may not be deterred from pursuing the complaint because the registrant says that the hearing must be held in public.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">This section concerns the need for the High Court to confirm any sanction against a member of any profession. If the person against whom the sanction is directed does not appeal, why need the matter still go to the High Court? For the sake of simplicity and to avoid the obvious demands and burdens that a High Court hearing might place on people, is it really necessary to go to the High Court if the sanction is not being appealed? Might it be wise to omit that reference in the section?</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_455">In page 47, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following new subsections:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_456">"(6) In this Act, the titles physical therapist and physiotherapist are synonymous and both titles use are restricted exclusively to those professionals who are registered as physiotherapists.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_457">(7) In this Act, the titles Podiatrist andChiropodist are synonymous and both titles use are restricted exclusively to those professionals who are registered as Podiatrists."</p>
          <p eId="para_458">This situation concerns the protection of titles. I had time to examine other legislation, particularly regarding physical therapists and physiotherapists. I have legislation from the United Kingdom and the State of Victoria in Australia before me. I will quote the latter first. Section 57 of the Physiotherapists Registration Act 1998 states: "A person who is not a registered physiotherapist must not take or use the title of registered physiotherapist or registered physical therapist or any other title calculated to induce a belief that the person is registered under the Act." The equivalent UK legislation provides under the section relating to protected titles for physiotherapist and physical therapist. I am sure I could have found other instances. The UK introduced the Health Care and Associated Professions Order 2001, which was made on 12 February 2002. That is up to date and it states; "A register should have one or more designated title ... physiotherapist and physical therapist."</p>
          <p eId="para_459">This issue must be taken seriously. No one is trying to take away the livelihoods of a body of people who do good work but we must ensure our register is in line with other international registers. The Good Friday Agreement specified that the Republic should examine UK legislation in this area. Other registers will be created and, therefore, it should be ascertained what other nomenclature could be used for people who describe themselves as physical therapists. I told their representatives when I was contacted by them that they do extremely useful and good work. I know people who have attended such therapists and found them useful. Most of their work is hands on. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility to come up with a title that would be suitable to establish a register.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Only one school provides training for physical therapists and I do not know whether international bodies should be involved but a separate register must be established with the agreement of those who call themselves "physical therapists" otherwise we will run into trouble if this title is not recognised separate to that of physiotherapist. Their representatives have been saying this for the past ten years or more.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">I also included podiatrists and chiropodists in the amendment, as they should be considered synonymous. Last week Senator Ryan stated someone without qualifications could call himself or herself a podiatrist under the legislation and, therefore, it is even more important to explain that podiatry and chiropody are synonymous but both are restricted to people with training and a registration board oversees their training.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">Schedule 3 outlines the proper training for all these disciplines but the amendment is useful. I hope the Minister of State will examine it because title is a serious issue. I do not seek to deprive anybody of a living but I wish to ensure people who use a certain title live up to the international nomenclature. I hope the Minister of State will look favourably on the amendment. I am not a proud woman and if he cannot accept it, I am happy for him to reflect on it and ascertain whether he can do anything with it. However, it is worthwhile to tackle this issue because if we do not, something will have to be done down the line and we will have created more problems than we will have solved by creating sloppy registers. No one wants that.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_463">I concur in the main with Senator Henry. All of us were contacted by the representative of the physical therapists association last weekend and we received e-mails and literature from him in which he states, "We are very concerned about the grave misrepresentations of our member physical therapists and the profession of physical therapy in Ireland conveyed during the recent Seanad debate." During the debate, I stated I had never heard of the term, which evoked great surprise in the gentlemen who called me last weekend. However, I have availed of the services of physiotherapists and found them professional and excellent.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">I acknowledge the work of physical therapists is misunderstood and there is a need to tighten the title given to them, the training they undergo and the services they offer. The e-mail I received is not clear in this regard. Perhaps Senator Henry could decipher it more easily. For example, do they want to be physiotherapists?</p>

          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_466">If they wish to be known as physical therapists, their training, standards and work must be outlined. I looked into the chiropody and podiatry angle and I found that podiatry is a step beyond chiropody in the professional qualification one receives. However, there is no school for same in the State. One must attend a Belfast school to attain one's qualification, which highlights a deficiency in the medical system.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">However, I worry about the issue relating to physiotherapists and physical therapists. It is difficult for a young person to become a physiotherapist because of the points needed under the CAO system and the onerous studies involved. We all know someone who has been through the system but I do not know the equivalent requirements to become a physical therapist. I was told by the nice man who called me that I should have known all about physical therapists but I did not. It is not like I live in an ivory tower. I knock about quite a bit but I have never met a physical therapist. Is it, therefore, equally difficult to become a physical therapist in terms of the points required or can one waltz into the profession?</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I would like to know because the legislation is interesting and curious in its own way. I am aware of the purpose of the legislation and I very much support the demystifying of the 12 qualifications for the public so that people will know what to expect when they go through the door with the brass plate beside it. They will know the treatment they need and how they should be treated. Did the Minister of State's officials meet all the various groups affected by the legislation prior to its publication? I do not fault the officials but was that part of the process? Did they winnow through these difficulties with the representative groups prior to the publication of the legislation? This would be necessary with legislation such as this. I would like answers to these questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_471">Until two weeks ago I did not know what a physical therapist did and I am glad to know somebody as experienced as Senator O'Rourke did not know either. Now I know what they are and do and seem to hear about them every hour of the day. Physical therapists are a separate entity. As far as I know they get a pass degree but some go on and do postgraduate studies. They are in existence for the past 15 years. If we could turn back the clock to 15 years ago, we could ask physiotherapists why they did not object to the term physical therapist being used then? Perhaps that would have solved the problem now facing us. Unfortunately, we cannot turn the clock back.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Will the Minister of State confirm a point made to me yesterday, that it was only in the late 1980s that the degree for physiotherapists was developed? Until then the award was a diploma. The physical therapists made the point that just as the physiotherapists had been allowed to evolve, so should they. The Irish Association of Physical Therapists made a submission on the matter to the Department of Health and Children in June 2004. I understand the Department will have a meeting with representatives of the association tomorrow, which is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">My understanding of this amendment is that if it were accepted, we would only allow physiotherapists to use the term physical therapist which would in effect disenfranchise and cut off the physical therapists.</p>

The physical therapists would feel the same way. They have a different system of operation. They do different work and the education and training is different. The work of both physiotherapists and physical therapists is important. Many of the top sports stars use physical therapists. I was interested to hear that Sonia O'Sullivan and Paula Radcliffe use physical therapists as do many of our county teams. It is important that we do not make any decision in this House that would adversely affect the physical therapists. I hope these points are useful and that the Minister of State can clarify the matter.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_480">Yes, many years before. This Bill has been in gestation for some 15 to 20 years. The physiotherapists have been objecting about the matter for a long time. In the legislation in Northern Ireland "physiotherapist" and "physical therapist" are the protected titles.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">Can we do something about those people here, who come from one small unit and comprise approximately 200 people? They do not need the same qualifications to get into that unit as one needs to qualify as a physiotherapist in the universities, one of the most difficult courses to get into as it requires some of the highest points. Those who run the Institute of Physical Therapy and Applied Science Limited, 17-18 Priory Hall, Stillorgan have been open with me about their courses. They do not require people to have anything like the admission requirements required for physiotherapy. The course is not the same in content or length. It is not a university qualification but is from a limited institute, which I am sure is very good. Most of the treatment the physical therapists give appears to be manual, which patients like because it is hands-on. Perhaps they could be called manual therapists.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The problem is not what the physical therapists are doing and is not concerned with trying to deny them a living. The problem is the protection of a title. I have quoted from two Acts, one from Australia and one from the United Kingdom. I am sure I could find more that show that the protected titles "physiotherapist" and "physical therapist" go together. We are supposed to be trying to ensure we are on a par with international title protection and nomenclature. Nobody is trying to harm the physical therapists. There must be some way to accommodate them. They should set up their own register and bring forward an agreed title. They should bring forward what they consider suitable training to the Department of Health and Children, to see if they can be set up and recognised. We will have to consider other people in the same manner, for example, psychotherapists and counsellors. Thankfully, it is the council that will have to do this, not us.</p>

          <p eId="para_484">Senator Henry is correct that the two professions, physiotherapist and physical therapist, are totally different. They have different educational criteria and requirements for entry. Both also admit that they do separate jobs. I cannot understand how they could be synonymous in anyone's reading. My reading and the advice from the Department is that if the amendment is agreed, the issue will end in court. We would have a problem because two professions cannot be synonymous if they have different entry criteria.</p>

          <p eId="para_486">This debate is interesting and useful. The Disability Bill is currently going through the Dáil. I have a great interest in that as Minister of State with responsibility for disability services. One of the problems I meet in my area is the lack of therapists in this regard. We need more therapists, not just in this area but in psychotherapy and many other areas. We need more professional people providing services required by the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">The issue of protection of titles was discussed in detail last week on section 4. Senators will be aware that following this debate the Department agreed to undertake two courses of action; first, to contact the professional bodies representing physiotherapists and physical therapists to arrange a meeting to discuss the issues of protection of title; and second, to contact the four professional bodies representing chiropodists to ascertain their views and the appropriate title for their profession. Meetings have been scheduled with the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists and the Irish Association of Physical Therapists tomorrow. The Department is awaiting formal response from two of the four professional bodies representing chiropodists. I suggest these amendments be withdrawn, pending these consultations.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">We have also consulted with all the groups on many occasions in the course of drafting the Bill. However, it has not been possible to secure agreement on the issue. A report commissioned by the Department of Health and Children on this issue highlighted key areas of agreement between the two representative bodies concerned, which could provide a platform for achieving the practical and realistic long-term solution we need. My fear is that if Senator Henry's amendment were accepted, it would lead us straight into the High Court and we would have the problem of the amendment being immediately challenged. None of us would want that.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">The report by the IPA highlighted the risk of public confusion owing to the international interchangeability of the two titles in the English speaking world. It also assessed the case that could be made on either side of the argument on economic grounds. This report is available should Senators wish to examine its contents.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">It would be advisable to withdraw the amendments while the Department talks to both associations to try to find agreement. I fear that if the Seanad passed the amendment as proposed it could end up causing us all embarrassment.</p>

I have been aware of physical therapists and from what I know of them theirs is a stand-alone profession, as is physiotherapy, podiatry andchiropody. Although some areas may need to be clarified, section 4 will enable other professional groups to be brought within the scope of the Act, which I welcome. I believe this also reflects the Minister of State's view.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">I do not see why a separate board cannot be set up in future. The Minister of State has made clear that this can be done and I hope the discussions will clarify any confusion that exists and that an appropriate registration board will be set up for physical therapists. That is the way forward. They are entitled to that as they undertake a separate course and carry out a separate job. I do not see any reason they cannot be deemed to be separate. This may be addressed differently in other jurisdictions but who is to say they are right and we are wrong?</p>

As far as I know the Minister did not dispute this point the last day, which speaks for itself. The fact that business is good shows there is a need for it. People are going back to them for treatment. A physiotherapist might not work for some people and a physical therapist might not work for others. Medicine is a funny game as we all know.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">I accept the point made by Senator Henry on jurisdiction. Ideally it would be preferable to have uniformity on terms.

We might not be discussing the issue of the dual titles of physical therapist and physiotherapist if they had done so. At this stage we could not allow physiotherapists to have sole rights over the term "physical therapist" because that would prevent physical therapists from using it, which would be devastating for their profession.</p>

          <p eId="para_504">I do not see how physical therapists could have been much more active, apart from giving out to me because the title was not protected. Protecting titles is one of the Bill's objectives. As the title was not protected, there was not much point in them giving out about people calling themselves physical therapists, except to me. People who are long retired complained to me about the situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_519">A period of five years, provided for here, is a rather long time. The Bill states: "who, at any time", it does not state, "who has been in practice during that period of five years". One could have someone applying at the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month in the last year to point out that nearly five years ago they were in practice. One needs to keep up to date in these professions, especially clinical biochemists, medical scientists and orthoptists, where things change almost by the hour. The same is true of radiographers and radiotherapists. I consider five years to be quite a long time. I realise that what is termed the "grandparenting situation" is extremely important and that they will have to undergo assessments.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">One other matter struck me which I will bring up at this point. As the Leader pointed out, there is no school for podiatrists in this country. Does it matter if five years pass after this Bill is enacted and there is still no school for such people? Three years would be better than five, in view of the fact that so many of these professions must keep up to date.</p>

          <from>Mr. T. O’Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_521">The operation of grandparenting provisions will be critical to the effective establishment of a system of statutory registration. If a person applies for registration under this section, that is through a grandparenting process, he or she must, in addition to possessing a listed qualification or alternatively completing a test of professional competence, satisfy the board that he or she is a fit and proper person to engage in the practice of the particular profession. It is considered that if a person had only been practising for a minimal period of time in the five year period proceeding the opening of a particular register, that registration board would have to satisfy itself as to the person's fitness to practise in order to engage in that profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">It is envisaged that registration boards will adopt an inclusive approach in order to bring practitioners under the supervision of a registration board. The effectiveness of the regulatory system established by this Bill will be optimised by maximising the number of professionals, subject to the rigours of the regulatory regime. A quality threshold of basic professional competence must be established in the grandparenting process, which then allows each registration board to monitor the professional conduct and competence of registrants as appropriate. If a registered practitioner does not demonstrate the standard of proficiency, competence and professional conduct expected of registered professionals, this will be grounds for a complaint and will be investigated under fitness to practise procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">It is considered a priority, working with the Minister for Education and Science, to establish a school of podiatry in Ireland. I understand that the professional bodies concerned are undertaking some preliminary work in this regard so that we will reach that point. Therefore, I do not propose to accept Senator Henry's amendment. The proposal of five years is better.</p>

          <p eId="para_524">I suppose it is not unreasonable to leave it to the registration boards. However, people should have been in a practice for a minimum amount of time. They should not be allowed to apply at the last moment having just qualified and not engaged in any practice. The Minister of State could examine the issue further. The purpose of the provision is to ensure that the person is competent. If the Minister of State wants to leave the issue to the boards, that is fair enough as it is not vital to the Bill. However, the amendment might prevent people applying right at the last moment, having only been in practice for a few weeks five years previously.</p>

          <p eId="para_526">This is a very important section, particularly subsections (5) and (7), which allows the Minister of the day to add other parties to the list of registration boards. In that context, physical therapists in particular would ideally prefer to be designated separately and have their own registration board. Is it wise to provide for this at this stage? Given that it has taken 20 years for the Bill to reach this stage, is there any danger it will take another 20 for its provisions to be enforced? Does the Minister of State envisage adding any particular groups in the near future? If so, which will get priority and what timeframe is proposed — will it be before or after the next general election? Will the Minister of State also explain the steps involved for the groups which might wish to be added, for example, the podiatrists to whom Senator Henry referred?</p>

          <p eId="para_527">I have been lobbied by several groups which are not among the 12 specified in the Bill. This is an enabling Bill and the Minister for Health and Children will give due consideration to the requirements of public safety as well as the fact that we lack therapists in certain areas who are needed to provide proper services to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">If the Bill is passed, the three groups about which we have spoken, namely, physical therapists, psychotherapists and podiatrists will be a priority. However, there could be several others and I do not want to limit their number. I cannot impose a timeframe on this process because discussion must take place on many issues. As Senators have pointed out, this Bill is primarily about safeguarding public health and we want to ensure that whatever we do is in the best interests of the public. The officials in my Department are holding discussions with all these groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Major discussions have taken place in the areas of counselling and psychotherapy. It will not be possible to satisfy everyone because different requirements and criteria apply to different professions and we must ensure a level of competence is established to which the public is entitled. That is the Department's responsibility and it is engaged in pursuing it with the professions. There are three or four professions which I am keen to include. I badly need many more physical therapists, podiatrists, counsellors and psychotherapists in my area. In that context, we will try to bring forward legislation as soon as possible but I do not want to put a date on it. Nevertheless, I assure the Senator that the Department regards this issue as a matter of urgency.</p>

Psychotherapists are a particularly important group with which to deal as rapidly as possible. There is an idea that, because one is not doing something physical with a person, it is not possible to do them any damage. However, people who set themselves up as some sort of psychotherapists without training — which is quite possible at present — can cause a great deal of damage. We cannot please everyone. The Department must decide when it meets with the Irish Council of Psychotherapists what criteria it will use in respect of their qualifications, training and experience. The Department should just go with it now because we can add other groups later if necessary. It would be better to do so than to allow matters to drift. I acknowledge that dealing with all these groups is terribly hard work but this is a very important and worthwhile Bill.</p>

All such a group has to do is prove its members have the level of expertise, proficiency, training and qualifications which merit their benefiting under section 4 of this Bill.

Ireland's representative would, therefore, either agree with or oppose any changes put forward. Such changes would be effected by means of a majority.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">I support the thrust of Senator Daly's argument. It is right to state it on the record. I have nothing against civil servants. Irish civil servants have a world-wide reputation for efficiency, probity and integrity but that is not the point. Precedents exist where non-civil servants have been appointed to similar positions, such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Court of Auditors to which two former politicians were appointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">During the period of office of the rainbow coalition Government in the mid-1990s, Senator Daly and I co-sponsored a motion in this House to ensure that elected representatives would not be excluded from consideration for State boards. This seems to be an obsession with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel of all Administrations. At least we managed to halt that particular slide. I suggest the Government could consider a wider trawl in the appointment process. This is the first occasion in which Ireland is involved in an important Council of Europe institution. I believe a political or non-civil servant input might be useful and that is not to cast any aspersions. I ask the Minister of State to consider it on a future occasion if it is not being done on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Will the Irish appointee to the Council of Europe Development Bank board have any direct influence on the projects being considered? I do not wish to widen the argument but it might require a simple "Yes" or "No" answer. As I stated on Second Stage, there are a number of worthwhile projects which member states as contributors are benefiting from, such as Germany, Sweden and Italy. I cited a number of projects in Ireland that might be usefully explored. The Minister of State may have referred to them in his reply but I was unable to stay in the House for the conclusion of his Second Stage reply. What influence, if any, will that individual have? Will he or she be required to stand outside the room when Irish projects are being proposed?</p>

          <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_580">In response to Senator Bannon, this is the first time in my 23 years of public life that I have heard anyone accuse civil servants in the Department of Finance of being cronies of anybody in politics. I do not think they are cronies to anybody in any other Department either. It is a very independent, focused, strong, macro-operation that operates on the basis of a micro-analysis of every decision taken. There is no danger of anything like that happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The nominee would be a senior staff person in the Department of Finance with a track record of public service and an understanding of law, finance and public service operations. As in the case of corporate appointments, the nominee will receive no remuneration for service on the board. He or she will represent Ireland on the board and will serve the country with diligence and dutifully and will make the proper decisions in the overall interest of the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">In response to Senator Mooney, I stated in my closing contribution on Second Stage that Ireland does not intend to call on any resources from the bank for projects. Due to our economic situation, the Government proposes to run the economy and the projects out of our own resources and with the support of the European Union and various instruments and Structural Funds made available to us. That does not mean that in the future we may not do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">When projects are presented to the governing board, all the member states are represented at the board. The Irish representative would be part of the decision-making process and would not have to leave the board at any time. It is a very focused board and there is no doubt that all members will discharge their duty with honour and integrity and achieve a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">On the point raised by Senators Daly, Mooney and perhaps McDowell, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has a different focus. The Irish appointees have full-time posts. Two former politicians were appointed, based on their experience and qualifications. The bank's function is to look after funds and projects on a regional or national basis. It provides the funds and decisions are taken at national level on the disbursement. The Council of Europe Development Bank deals with each project as it arises. Remuneration is not paid to the Irish representative and we will only appoint the best person. There will be no office in Dublin. The bank's office is in Strasbourg.</p>

          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_585">I am grateful to the Minister of State for his usual clarity when dealing with these complex issues. He has left nobody in any doubt as to the calibre of the individual who will be appointed. We wish that person well. I suggest to the Minister of State that Ireland should not stand on its pride when it comes to worthwhile projects. In the context of the Minister of State's reply about our growing economic power and strength, I referred earlier to three countries with equal economic power and strength. Sweden has a higher GDP than Ireland. Germany is normally an economic power house. Italy goes from being very good to not so very good but also has the resources required without need to rely on the bank. I hope what the Minister of State said at the end of his response will become the norm rather than the exception. If there are worthwhile projects identified — and I do not wish to go into the detail of who identifies them but I cited one possible project on the apprenticeship issue from which Germany is benefiting by way of the bank — I would not like to think that Ireland would stand back and decide it is too proud to take any money back from the bank. I remember reading as a child that we did much the same when asked to take part in the Marshall plan at a time when we could have done with it. We said we were not that poor.</p>

          <p eId="para_589">I am grateful to Senator Bannon for his assurance of the quality of the people in the Department of Finance and his acceptance of their ability to do the job. The clarification is simple. The management team which meets weekly in the Department of Finance would nominate a person to the Minister for Finance, who would make his usual inquiries into the suitability of the person in question. He would then circulate a document to Ministers and take the matter before the Cabinet for a decision on his recommendation. The person appointed would then represent the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">To address the matter raised by Senator Mooney, while there are no plans to use the Council of Europe Development Bank, it is not impossible that the Government or a local authority or financial institution would use the bank in future. Any of these bodies could borrow from the bank. If, after we have appointed our representative to the bank, an innovative opportunity were to arise which would help to stimulate the economy, we would avail of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">With regard to the Senator's reference to Germany, following the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Berlin Wall, Germany used the bank's resources to help with its reconstruction operation in eastern Germany. The bank has been of tremendous assistance to the German Government in that area and we wish it continued success. We will not miss an opportunity for any part of the island if one presents itself in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_592">Ireland is represented by public servants every day on all sorts of boards, committees and organisations. Whether it is appropriate to appoint a politician or public servant depends in part on the nature of the body in question, how political it is and the approach taken by other countries. If other countries are, without exception, putting forward as their representatives officials of their Departments of Finance, central banks or similar institutions, it would not be appropriate for Ireland to nominate a politician. Some appointees to positions in organisations such as the European Central Bank are politicians or, as in the case of the current Irish member of the ECB, officials from the Department of Finance. This is a borderline area.</p>

A difficulty arises with regard to the mechanisms we have in place for reporting on our participation in multilateral institutions, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, inasmuch as we tend to pass legislation such as this, sign the relevant cheque and forget about the matter. I am not suggesting the responsibility resides with the Department and not elsewhere but the reporting mechanisms are not good. In addition, they would not be significantly improved if we were to receive only an annual report. A mechanism is needed whereby regular reports are submitted to the overseas development sub-committee of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs or another body. We must occasionally exercise oversight of the action taken on our behalf in the four or five international banks of which we are members.</p>

I concur with Senator McDowell that legislators are in a powerful position in passing legislation, creating an opportunity for people to represent us but failing to scrutinise the performance of the organisation on which we are represented.

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_604">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, to the House and thank him for taking this matter concerning the pressing need for his Department to provide accelerated investment in the Longford central water supply and other areas in the county in which chronic water supply problems are being encountered on a daily basis. Any community, especially a rural business and farming community, is entitled to a reliable and plentiful supply of water without interruption or supply interference.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">While I am aware that some of the problems being experienced in County Longford will be addressed in schemes included in the water services investment programme 2004 to 2006, the Department may not be aware of the urgent need for immediate funding and action in this regard. Water shortages in and around Longford town are causing severe disruption to people in the county. They occur for a number of reasons, including increased demand versus supply capacity, excessive bursts on public mains due to aged network and inadequate storage and reservoir capacity. From 29 August 2004 to 2 September 2004, Longford County Council had to contend with a sequence of events which resulted in customers experiencing severe disruptions of supply. On 29 August, the water supply was turned off at night to conserve supply. On 30 August, the Prucklish reservoir was empty due to a suspected burst in the Newtownforbes area but the council was unable to locate the problem due to consumption and lack of water. This problem affected the Newtownforbes, Aughadegnan, Clonbalt Woods Lismore group water scheme and high areas in Edgeworthstown.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">On 31 August, the council located and fixed a significant burst and most of the Newtownforbes area was restored but the water was turned off at night. On 1 and 2 September, there was a major burst under the railway at Lamagh due to Iarnród Éireann constraints where Longford County Council encountered significant engineering problems. It repaired the section and re-routed supply to Aughadegnan and Clonbalt Woods and Newtownforbes GAA grounds. On 2 September, the council restored supply to all other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">During this period several other bursts were located and repaired. These measures were taken over a few days. The problems continue every day of the year and such remedial actions are merely isolated measures in an attempt to keep the countywide system operating until funding is provided to tackle the problem in its entirety. Longford County Council does not have the funds to rectify its water supply problems, which it has outlined in its assessment of needs for the capital investment programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Funding from the Minister of State's Department is essential to allow the council to undertake schemes which cannot be ignored in the interest of an essential water supply. The council needs to carry out a strategic review of the Longford central regional scheme which will address all the problems of the scheme and propose solutions. Following on from this review, essential works must be undertaken with urgency. We are all concerned about the quality of drinking water and the onus is on the State to provide a pure and wholesome water supply for all its citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">In Longford that provision is sadly lacking and the antiquated network and inadequate reservoir capacity is depriving people throughout the county of a very basic right. I must ask the Minister of State to clarify his Department's position on funding for this important venture. Perhaps he will give me a positive response because there are grave concerns about this issue. Before I came into the House tonight I received three telephone calls about other problems in the north Longford area, specifically the Moyne and Leggah area and the Newtowncashel area in south County Longford. The problem is widespread throughout the county and it is important that it be addressed as soon as possible.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. B. O’Keeffe)</from>
          <p eId="para_610">I thank the Senator for the opportunity to clarify these issues. Providing modern environmental infrastructure to support social and economic objectives has been a major focus of Government spending over recent years. My Department has made unprecedented investment under the national development plan on water and sewerage schemes and this has contributed significantly to the economic growth in every part of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Last May, my Department published the latest phase of the water services investment programme, covering the years 2004 to 2006. The total allocated to County Longford under this latest phase comes to over €53 million, extending to some 14 individual schemes. Of that sum, €18 million is earmarked specifically for major water supply improvements, while €4.2 million is allocated for water conservation work. The schemes selected for approval in the programme took full cognisance of the priorities identified by Longford County Council in its most recent assessment of new water services infrastructure requirements in the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">My Department is very conscious of the need to advance the Longford central regional water supply scheme as quickly as possible. The council has informed us that there have been supply disruptions due to a combination of increased demand, inadequate storage and water loss from the supply network. All of these concerns are being urgently addressed as part of the Longford central regional water supply scheme and the countywide water conservation project.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">There are two elements in the Longford central regional water supply scheme. The first phase, estimated to cost €7.1 million, will provide a new storage reservoir and 15 km of rising mains. Phase I has been approved to go to construction as soon as possible under my Department's water services investment programme. The necessary Exchequer funds have been allocated and are available for draw-down by the council as soon as they are needed. Some advance works have already been done with my Department's approval, for example, the construction of an access road to the reservoir at Knockahaw and some sections of mains and pipes.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">Officials in my Department are examining the design review report for the main share of the works and will deal with it as quickly as possible. When this is approved the council will be free to draw up contract documents that will be used to invite tenders for the scheme. In the interim, the council is proceeding with site investigation and other preparatory work. The water for the Longford central regional scheme is treated at plants at Lough Currygraney and Lough Forbes.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">The second phase of the scheme will focus mainly on upgrading the treatment facilities from the quality and capacity points of view. The council is also pushing ahead with this phase and will conduct interviews for consultants in the coming week to get the planning process under way as soon as possible. My Department will also facilitate the advancement of this phase of the scheme to construction as quickly as the council can process it through the various steps in the planning process.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">There is little point in producing extra water supply capacity if it is then lost through leakage or other deficiencies in the distribution system. Water conservation is the key to meeting communities' needs in a sustainable way. Longford County Council has already completed several of the measures required to create a fully-developed water conservation strategy, included the mapping of services, district metering, demand allocation and structural assessment of pipe networks. A total of €4.2 million has been allocated to the council for the next stage of the process and my Department awaits the council's proposals to build on the measures already in place, for example, by implementing active leakage control across the entire supply network and prioritising the replacement of obsolete pipelines. In the meantime, my Department has approved the council's proposals to rehabilitate old water mains in Longford town and in Granard, while roadworks were under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">My Department awaits contract documents from the council for stage 1 of the Lanesboro water supply scheme. When the contract documents have been cleared, work on this scheme will also be able to start. With regard to the Ballymahon and Granard regional water supply schemes, also approved in the water services investment programme, the council is preparing briefs for the appointment of consultants to get the planning of these projects under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Many new water schemes are moving ahead in Longford that will comprehensively address the matters the Senator has outlined, as well as generally improving the quality and coverage of water supply around the county. I have listened carefully to what the Senator said and I and my officials are fully committed to getting these schemes under way as quickly as possible. I have already verified that the necessary finances have been set aside in my Department's water services investment programme. My Department would very much welcome any proposals the council might put forward to accelerate the implementation of any of the approved schemes.</p>

        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_372">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_624">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I have already spoken about this matter in a general debate on communications. This issue will be a hot potato in the years ahead. As we move forward we will be able to receive e-mails, texts, photographs and so on by wireless technology. We will nonetheless pay a price in another respect. In order to do this, we need to have the proper infrastructure in place. The major telecommunications industries are multi-million euro industries. This was brought home to me recently when a nursing home in Carlow had a base station and antennae erected on its roof.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">I am sure that the Minister of State would have been involved years ago in protest meetings concerning the erection of phone masts. They are now largely gone and have been replaced by far smaller antennae, which invariably do not require planning permission. There has been a complete revolution in the area of wireless technology. The Government should look at this area again and update the necessary legislation. None of us could have predicted how fast the whole area could have expanded and, in the case in Carlow, the antennae and base station caused great distress to the relatives of those in the nursing home. There were genuine fears on their behalf as to whether there were health risks involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">The status of a nursing home also needs to be clarified. Is a nursing home a commercial premises or is it a hospital or medical care centre? If it is a hospital, then it should not have any telecommunications equipment attached to it. The Minister of State might claim that this is an area which is dealt with in county development plans, but it is an area where the central Government has a role to play.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">ComReg is an independent body which gets funding from the Government annually. The main purpose of ComReg is to inspect sites where antennae and base stations are located and monitor the emissions from them. However, I heard rumours that ComReg ran out of money last October and could not visit sites. I have also heard that it only visits a site once a year. That does not instil public confidence in the system. It is very important that we have an independent body that is properly funded and is in a position to carry out independent audits on sites and check emission levels. ComReg does not have to be legally informed about any new base stations, which is a loophole in the law. It therefore cannot check them for emissions afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">A telecommunications provider such as Vodafone might not notify ComReg about a new station because ComReg will recommend that a number of telecommunications providers share a site. This might not be in the commercial interest of the company involved. Many county development plans recommend sharing sites to cut down on difficulties. However, if Meteor discovers a site that improves the coverage in an area, then its competitors will be keen to access that site as well. Once ComReg is informed, its competitors will seek to gain access to the same site so it is in Meteor's interests not to inform ComReg.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The guidelines issued by planning authorities are also very vague. Telecommunications companies do not have to inform the local authority about their plans to erect antennae or base stations as it is purely a matter of courtesy to do so. There was a farcical scenario in Carlow where we were told the antennae on the base station were turned on, turned off and turned on again. The owners of the nursing home in question and Vodafone were not singing from the same hymn sheet. People who allow their premises to be used to host a base station or antennae get a nice sum of €50,000 every five years. That is quite a lot of money and I am sure that very few of us here would decline such an offer. The Government needs to acknowledge the revolution in wireless technology and bring forward legislation to update it for everyone concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">I want to place on the record that I have a mobile phone and I am favour of wireless technology as it is a step forward. However, we need reassurances as well. We cannot have progress in one direction, which may be at the risk of public health.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_373">
          <from>Mr. B. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_631">I thank the Senator for raising this issue. Wireless technology is likely to become revolutionary in the unfolding of the information society. It has the capacity to offer access to all of the on-line information services required by an individual without being restricted by wires, connections and sockets. As technology develops these services will become faster, more powerful and truly liberating. I would like to discuss the main developments in wireless technology and outline how this country is up to date in such developments and to show how the public is being kept informed on these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Wireless technology is constantly evolving and is the backbone for services across many sectors including communications, transport, defence, research and emergency services. The demand for wireless services is growing rapidly due to the demand for increased mobility. The European Commission has established a radio spectrum policy group to develop a Europe-wide policy, in which the Department and ComReg participate. Some of the key elements of the policy include developments in technology, markets and regulation. The policy goes beyond electronic communications to transport and research and development. It requires widespread consultation with commercial and non-commercial stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">Wireless technology underpins mobile services, digital broadcasting and fixed wireless access. Third generation services comprise the principal area of development in mobile technology. Vodafone Ireland announced its pricing details for consumer, rather than corporate, third generation services last Monday. It will launch the services at the end of the month, making it the first mobile operator in Ireland to do so. Digital television broadcasting, which has been launched in a few countries, is under review in Ireland and I would like it to be developed here.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">ComReg has issued fixed wireless access licences and modified regulations to make it easier to license new operators. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, which recently concluded trials of wireless local area network technology, will publish its findings in a report next month. Wireless technology is one of the technologies used in the metropolitan area networks programme, as part of the phased development of the programme, funded by the Department under the national development plan. Wireless technology is of value as a complementary platform in the delivery of broadband services to remote areas. New market entrants are using fixed wireless networks to connect businesses in metropolitan areas, however. I favour using the most effective technology platforms available and tailoring them to suit the environment in which they will operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has established a website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>, to keep the public informed of its initiatives in these areas. The consumer advice website has been developed by the Department with the co-operation of the telecommunications industry to help consumers locate the providers of broadband services in their local areas and to compare different products. Consumers can tell the industry where a choice of broadband services is needed by voting for such locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">There is public concern about the potential health effects arising from the widespread deployment of wireless technology, particularly in mobile cellular networks. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources maintains a watching brief on all health matters relating to non-ionising radiation. In its report on telephone masts published in 1998, the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport concluded that the evidence available to it did not indicate that there was an unacceptable health hazard from telephone masts. A recent World Health Organisation conference yielded no new evidence indicating a link between ill health and non-ionising radiation at the levels set by the guidelines of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">ComReg has put in place a substantial measurement survey programme to ensure that all radio installations in Ireland meet the guidelines. The programme was initiated at the request of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and developed in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The survey showed that none of the installations breached the guidelines. The results of the survey are available on the ComReg website, <i>www.comreg.ie</i>, which has a publicly accessible database of cellular base stations to enable the public to determine which operator is responsible for a particular site.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_638">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I wish to take up his last point about the ComReg website, which I have visited and found to have good and bad aspects. It is good that it can be searched on the basis of a map of Ireland or by typing in key words. If one wants to check if there is a nursing home in County Donegal with a base station, one can do so by searching through the County Donegal list and typing in "nursing home". One is given a list of places, but it may transpire that they do not all have base stations. All one learns is that there is a base station near the nursing home. That is a weakness in the website. It is a good idea, but it needs to be more specific. When I typed in "nursing home" to search the County Carlow list, I was given a list of places. I telephoned all the nursing homes to find out if they have base stations. The website suggested that there was a telecommunications system at St. Fiach's in Graiguecullen, but the nearest one is at Killeshin, which is approximately two miles away. The website is a step in the right direction, but it could be updated or made more specific. It certainly needs more refinement.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_640">At 6.27 a.m. last Sunday morning, a crab boat with four crew members on board got into difficulties in Mulroy Bay in County Donegal. The coastguard units from Mulroy and Buncrana responded immediately to the boat's distress signal by heading for it to help the crew. By the time the Buncrana coastguard unit arrived at the scene of the incident, the crab boat was gone. The four crew men had luckily been saved by the Mulroy coastguard unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I have raised this case and given details of it because I am concerned that the area officer of the Mulroy coastguard unit was faced with a major moral dilemma on Sunday morning. He had to decide whether to try to save the four lives by launching a boat that was not commissioned by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. He was aware that to do so would not be well accepted by the Department. With the 20-20 vision of hindsight, we know all four crew members would have lost their lives if the area officer had not made the right decision, which was to launch the rescue boat. The crab boat had disappeared by the time the Buncrana unit arrived at the scene. Any sane person in a right mode of thinking will agree that four lives would have been lost if the area officer had not decided to launch the rescue boat. When the incident happened, the Mulroy unit had been waiting for six weeks to receive the training necessary to allow the rescue boat to be commissioned. I sent a fax to the Department last Wednesday to try to speed up the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">I ask the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to acknowledge the area officer's foresight and accuracy in deciding to launch the decommissioned rescue boat. It would have been a red letter day for the Department if he had not taken that decision, because four lives would have been lost. It is as simple as that. I ask the Minister of State to try to convince the Department that the official training of the Mulroy unit's crew members should be initiated immediately, as a matter of priority. There should be no more procrastination in this regard.</p>

        <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_377">

          <p eId="para_643">I thank Senator McHugh for making a strong and sensible case. I assure the House that the training he mentioned is well under way and has almost been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">The Mulroy coastal unit is one of 54 such units at strategic locations around the coast. The units are operated by male and female volunteers who make themselves available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to assist in marine emergencies which require their assistance. Each coastal unit has a capability and a range of equipment, including radio communications, marine rescue gear, cliff rescue gear, support boats and vehicles, which is appropriate to its location. The Mulroy unit, which is a cliff climbing and boat team, is manned by 20 volunteers and led by an area officer and deputy area officer. It received a new 7.9 m Foyle class delta rigid inflatable boat, or RIB, on 12 October last. The unit has a four-wheel drive vehicle for pulling the boat, a transit van for carrying cliff climbing equipment and an all-terrain vehicle with trailer. The originalMulroy coast guard boat suffered extensive damage during a search and rescue operation in May 2004. The boat was temporarily replaced by a smaller Searider boat from the training fleet, pending the delivery of the 7.9 m Foyle class Delta RIB.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">A programme of instruction for the Mulroy team in preparation for the introduction of the new RIB has been in place for several months. That included rescue boat training in Wicklow in May 2004, followed by additional training in September and October for several members. A shore-based navigation training module is under way for the Mulroy unit at the BIM Fishery Training School in Greencastle and is expected to be completed later this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">It is expected that final servicing and commissioning of the boat, which has been undertaken by a specialist contractor, will be completed within ten days. Immediately thereafter, Irish Coast Guard training and operations officers will conduct the final at-sea training element before the new boat is declared operational.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">I am also pleased to be able to inform the House that final works to the new Mulroy station house building to accommodate the members of the unit and their new boat and vehicles are being completed in tandem with the boat training and commissioning. That work has been completed as part of the Irish Coast Guard building programme. It is anticipated that the full programme will be completed by 6 December 2004, when the new boat can be declared fully operational.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">I convey my very best wishes to Mulroy coastal unit regarding its new equipment and facilities and thank the members and the local community that supports them for the invaluable service they provide. I express my personal admiration for, and my sincere appreciation of, the selfless courage shown by the entire network of coastal units and search and rescue personnel throughout the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_649">I thank the Minister of State, whom I know to be a reasonable man, having known him for almost two years. Perhaps he might use his expertise and common sense in getting in touch with the Department to support the decision of the area officer last Sunday morning. It was a moral dilemma, and I believe that he made the right decision in taking out a boat that was not fully commissioned. Four lives were saved, and that is what matters. I would like the Minister to use his good offices to convey those sentiments — as I know he will — regarding the officer's decision.</p>
