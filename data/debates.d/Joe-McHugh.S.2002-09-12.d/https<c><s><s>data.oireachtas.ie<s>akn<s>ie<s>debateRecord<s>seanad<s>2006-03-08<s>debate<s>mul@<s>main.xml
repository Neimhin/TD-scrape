          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Transport to provide an update on the urgent need to bring in legislative safety requirements for trucks; to request local authorities to introduce traffic management measures that will ensure safer traffic patterns involving trucks; to provide an update on the total number of fatal accidents on our roads so far this year, including those involving pedestrians; to outline the number of those accidents that included trucks or HGVs; and to provide general statistics for trucks on our roads as a percentage of overall traffic.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</p>

No. 1 is a motion regarding immigration reform in the United States which was placed on the Order Paper as agreed by all the group leaders. It reiterates the sentiments expressed in a similar motion agreed by the House on 11 October 2005 and it is proposed to take the motion without debate; No. 2, the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill 2006 — Second Stage (resumed), to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 1.30 p.m., with the contribution of Senators not to exceed ten minutes and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage; No. 3, statements on the progress of the public service decentralisation programme to be taken at 2.30 p.m. until 5. p.m., with the contribution of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements; and No. 25, motion 24, is to be taken from 5. p.m. until 7 p.m. There will be a sos from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.</p>

          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_5">An international road safety conference is being held in Dublin this week. It has been organised by the National Roads Authority and experts have come from the United States of America, Sweden and Australia. While I am sure that much good will come from it, it is worth bearing in mind that eight years ago, a similar conference on road safety was held with the participation of the same international experts.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">At that time extremely good advice, which is worth highlighting, was given by the Australian representative. He spoke about random breath testing and a more countrywide approach to speed cameras. In respect of such issues, it is worth considering that movement in the right direction has only just got under way, in that the Government has begun to discuss such measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">At that time, however, the Australian expert stated that the best way to put penalty points — which he recommended — into effect was to instil the fear that one might be caught. I must express concern in that regard. Members are aware that there was enthusiasm among motorists for the system when it was introduced in 2002, and they were vigilant about not speeding. However, that enthusiasm has waned and many motorists now honour the system by breaching it rather than observing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">There have already been 76 tragedies on Irish roads this year. However, some pointers are positive. Recently in this House, I inquired as to why the rules of the road booklet was not printed in different languages. It has not been reprinted for 11 years although many changes have taken place during that time. I welcome the Government's decision to print it in eight different languages, which is a positive step. However, while 31 penalty point offences will be introduced on 3 April next, few people would be able to identify the purpose of even five of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">Members who participate in local radio programmes will recognise the degree of ignorance in respect of the penalty point offences which are to be introduced. Although many such offences appear to be extremely simple, they will incur penalty points from 3 April. Given that the new offences will come on stream on 3 April, I cannot understand why every motorist and household has not been informed about them. It is important to provide this information. When they are introduced, many people will protest that big brother is watching in earnest. I am all in favour of information being provided and the people being aware of the offences. I hope he Government will take a step in the right direction and ensure the information is available.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">The problem we have encountered with transport in the past, and in the carnage on Irish roads, is the fragmentation of Departments. The Taoiseach indicated recently he would pull different Departments together. I want the Minister to let us know how that is working out because there is a need for a supremo in charge of this entire area to co-ordinate everything to ensure a reduction in the number of fatalities on Irish roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I note the Minister stated recently that cars from outside the State cannot be impounded at present, even though they may not be taxed or insured. We should close that gap. If we are to reduce the carnage on Irish roads, it will take many punitive measures which must be enforced. After eight years of Government ineptitude on this issue, I hope at last we are seeing positive movement for the future. Let us hope we are because there are many areas that the Government must tease out to ensure it happens.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_12">Over the past number of weeks, and right back to the inquiry into the Garda in Donegal, the force has been to the forefront of many comments made here and in other places. We saw this again two weeks ago in O'Connell Street. The reality is that when push comes to shove gardaí are the people standing there on our behalf. I would be the first to criticise behaviour which I do not accept, and many of us criticised what happened in Donegal and in other places. It is right that we should do so and that we should always be watchful. However, it is becoming almost a cant that when something goes wrong we focus on the Garda in the most negative way.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">Yesterday an individual died in custody and there was a proper and immediate outcry. In some of the commentary the presumption of innocence went out the window. Gardaí are as entitled to a presumption of innocence until proven guilty as anybody else. We should show our trust and confidence in them. If they get it wrong we should say so. We should wait until we find that to be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">Having said that, gardaí also need support in two ways. It is a convention that every death in custody should be investigated independently. The Garda Ombudsman Commission will not be established until later in the year and I do not know of the current position. Such an investigation does not instil trust and confidence if it is not carried out by an independent body. That is what we should seek to happen. That should be done in a way in which we show our trust and confidence in the Garda in doing an impossible job.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">Arising from yesterday's business, the question arose that this person should have been behind bars anyway. There is a simple administrative reason why that was not the case, namely, a lack of resources. Let us put it clearly on the agenda. In every Garda station in this city there is a sheaf of warrants for the arrest of people who have jumped bail, who should have been arrested and who cannot be found and the Garda is not being given the resources to do it. We must recognise that fact. Rather than simply pointing the finger at the Garda, let us give it the resources to do its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">There are people walking around this city who are in breach of bail regulations, who should be behind bars, who should be arrested and who should be facing charges. It is just that the Garda is not being given the resources to do that. When it goes wrong, when one of these people is found committing another crime, we naturally stand up in this House and ask why. In asking why, let us say that the Garda should be given the chance to do its business. When gardaí get it right, they are doing it on our behalf. When they get it wrong, we will certainly point that out as well and correct whatever it is. However, they cannot be left on their own. They are being isolated by commentary to too great a degree over the past number of months, especially since the Donegal inquiry.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_34">I am assuming, as I always do, the Cathaoirleach's support in that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">There has been considerable debate in recent times about the failure of the Government to provide proper social housing. There has been a succession of promised initiatives and figures, none of which have been achieved, even given the increase in the number of households on waiting lists and the number of young people who have given up the idea of ever owning their own home.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">At some stage I want the House to have a debate on social housing and the failure of the Government to make provision for it. The debate could also deal with the issue of the homeless, which was raised in the usual token fashion before Christmas but which needs to be discussed as part of the failure to provide social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate on the contents of the most recent report of the parole board. The board makes recommendations about how people with sentences of eight years or longer are dealt with. It does not make decisions; it makes recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister then decides whether to implement those recommendations and over the past three or four years he implemented between 80% and 90% of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">Given that somebody is being blamed for people being released from prison early when they are given a life sentence, it would be interesting to hear from the Minister why, on the one hand, he is making speeches, as is the Taoiseach, about a life sentence meaning life and, on the other, he is implementing recommendations which allow people to be released after seven, eight or nine years, which I happen to believe is not always a bad decision. Nevertheless, I want to know the Minister's position. Could we have a debate on the report of the parole board as a matter of urgency?</p>
          <p eId="para_39">In connection with what Senator Finucane stated, in many Scandinavian countries the driver of a car in a housing estate is responsible for the safety of the children there. The result is that people tend to drive in housing estates at approximately 15, 20 or 30 km/h because they know that if a child runs out, it is their responsibility. We could consider introducing such a measure in this country and it would have a salutary effect on our drivers.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_40">I wish to repeat a call I made in December for a debate on the tribunals. Such a debate should, if possible, involve a progress report from each of the tribunals setting out the modules completed, modules in progress and, in particular, modules still outstanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">I am seeking this debate for two reasons. First, the timespan of eight or nine years in which people have found themselves before these tribunals is contrary to the well-accepted principle that justice delayed is justice denied. Second, perhaps it would be an opportunity to refocus. Some of the outstanding issues might well be more suitable to a commission of investigation and it might be advisable that this would be looked at now rather than allowing an interminable process to continue.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_42">Will the Deputy Leader arrange a debate on the mismanagement of public finances and the wastage by this Government? We have seen a series of fiascoes by the Government such as PPARS, e-voting and the health care crisis. Recently we read that helicopter flights taken by the Taoiseach around the country last year cost in the region of €650,000. One trip between Dublin and Wicklow cost €2,100. This should be investigated because it sounds hollow in the ears of carers of the elderly and home helps who are concerned about Government waste. I would like an end to such waste and I seek a debate on this issue.</p>

          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_43">I support Senator Finucane's call for a debate on speeding on our roads. I am terrified to use the road late at night and I will certainly not travel after 12 midnight because I am afraid of trucks, which zig zag across the road. No matter what regulations and penalty point offences are put in place, they will still be abused. A public relations exercise is necessary to give the public as much information as possible. We should debate the issue as often as possible to make sure the public is aware of what is at stake following the number of accidents over the past few months.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">The European Parliament recently debated a draft EU services directive, which will establish a legal framework for all member states to provide services in other member states. This Chamber should be used more often to reach out to the public regarding how the directive will work. The nitrates directive caused terrible confusion but, fortunately, it has been clarified.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_47">History is in the air. Yesterday, we had an interesting discussion on the acquisition of an historical document, the national anthem. Today's newspapers report that a member of the public has very generously given an original copy of the 1916 Proclamation to the National Museum. This should be commended because the document could have fetched more than €390,000. The generosity of the McCrossan family should be applauded. Mr. McCrossan's father had an honourable connection with this House as Oireachtas librarian. It was a very remarkable thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">Unfortunately, the State has not always acted with generosity towards its own soldiers. Will the Deputy Leader raise with the Minister for Defence the possibility of recognising the courage, valour and service of solders of the State during the period 1922-24? They have never received a commemorative medal because there was a civil war. It is about time we put the divisions of the Civil War behind us and recognised the service given by these brave people to our country. We should also welcome the establishment of an inquiry by the Minister for Defence into the need to give recognition to the two surviving Army members of the Niemba massacre in the form of medals. This matter was also raised by one of the staff of the House, Mr. O'Donoghue, and it should be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">I refer to the Marino College of Education case, which was raised yesterday. I listened to the Minister for Education and Science on the radio earlier and she gave a remarkably fine performance. We, on this side of the House, do not give credit often enough to Ministers. Deputy Hanafin is quite the best Minister in Government. She handled this difficult issue with tact, diplomacy and skill, considering she could have been tempted to take a whack at the authors of the report but she avoided that. She praised the work of the college and dealt with the issue with decency, diplomacy and tact. She has acted on many of the requests made in the House such as providing medical education at university level, providing additional special education teachers, speech therapists and so on. We should recognise this and say, "Well done", to her.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">I agree with Senator O'Toole's comments on the tragic murder that took place in recent days. I very much hope, for the sake of everybody involved, including the Garda, that the suspect's interview was videotaped so there should be no suggestion whatever that undue pressure was a contributory factor in his death.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">I would also like to refer to the comments by Senators Norris and O'Toole about the death in custody and the subsequent investigation. This makes an unanswerable case for a Garda Ombudsman Commission in a way no other could in the interest of the Garda. I am fully satisfied, on the basis of what I have seen and read, that the Garda acted properly and according to the book in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">One of the problems is that I heard a Garda spokesman last night whose first sentence was, "We will investigate this", and whose second was, "We know everything is okay". As Senator O'Toole said, it would be in the interest of the Garda if the investigation — I do not refer to a public inquiry — was overseen by a senior lawyer because, as well as the Garda element in the case, there is the question of the suspect's treatment in hospital. That also needs to be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">Senator Ryan raised the question of social housing, which I supported in the past. However, I noticed recently that builders have been able to buy themselves out of their obligations. This vitiates the purpose of the initiative, which was to prevent social segregation by shoving people who need social housing into ghettos.</p>

I acknowledge that every Member will have a parochial interest in this regard, similar to myself. How can the Minister for Health and Children justify the provision of only four beds in the accident and emergency ward of Letterkenny General Hospital to service a population of more than 136,000?</p>
          <p eId="para_57">In addition, County Donegal extends from Inishowen to Bundoran, a distance of 144 km. I would also like the Minister to outline when a permanent breast surgeon will be appointed to Letterkenny General Hospital, which is a major priority for the consultants, nursing staff and patients in the hospital. The Minister has not visited the hospital during her time in office. I would like her party colleague, the Deputy Leader, to use his influence, as she is more than welcome to visit. I invite her to visit on behalf of the Donegal Action for Cancer Care group, the consultants, nursing and administrative staff of the hospital and the people of Donegal.

Many young people walk around discos with a thumb over their bottles. I often wondered what this was about and I am led to believe it is the only way they can ensure their drink is not spiked. This is a serious matter. My daughter attends discos and so on and I am told this takes place on a regular basis, but nothing has been done about it. In many cases young ladies end up getting raped. Something must be done about this as there is no point in just talking about it. I would like the Minister to come here to debate the issue. Positive suggestions might emanate from that debate and action could be taken to prevent this type of outrageous behaviour.</p>

I would like the Minister attending the conference to come here promptly to tell us what he intends to do about it, rather than to talk about it. We have done too much talking but have not taken nearly enough action.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">There is an easy solution to the problem that provides good value for money. I saw the number plate recognition technology in operation last week and was impressed by it. There are two devices in operation on the M1 and what they can do is almost magic. They can identify every car going through and tell when it exits whether it has exceeded the speed limit. They can also identify many other details. In Britain, where there are 8,000 of these devices, a court case taking place today will charge a woman for driving without hands. She — it was a woman rather than a man, thank God — was putting her make-up on when she was identified on this speed camera. This is a reminder that these cameras can do far more than just detect speeding. We should do something about this technology immediately as it is an investment that would pay for itself. I would like to hear from the Minister what he is going to do about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">Will the Deputy Leader draw the attention of the Minister for Health or the Minister for Agriculture and Food, whichever is responsible, to the announcement from the World Health Organisation the other day that bird flu does not present a problem if chickens are cooked? We have a thriving poultry industry here, but throughout Europe there has been a drop of 20% in the consumption of poultry. This is a threat to our industry.

The original proclamation in the hall of Leinster House, presented by Seán T. O'Kelly, a former President, should be on proper display, particularly for the 90th anniversary of 1916. It is a very valuable document, but it is in a vulnerable position in the House, just on the wall without any protection. It should be displayed in a proper cabinet on the ground floor as it is a wonderful document. It was a wonderful gesture on the part of Seán T. O'Kelly to present it to the Oireachtas, without any reward, tax incentive or otherwise.</p>

          <p eId="para_75">I agree with Senator Glynn on the need to raise the matter of spiked drinks. The issue is even more worrying. A submission made to the Joint Committee on Health and Children indicated there was no evidence of Rohypnol in any of 5,000 admissions to accident and emergency units. The fact is that young people, especially young women, are drinking more and harder alcohol with which the body cannot cope. These young people blank out and think their drink has been spiked, but evidence shows that up to a year ago no case showed Rohypnol in the system in 5,000 admissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">I am sure the House will support the hundreds of illegal Irish who will march in Washington today in a campaign to legalise their status in the United States. There is a major campaign underway to ensure that people in the United States will get a green card after six years. However, there are influences on this issue and some people and politicians feel these illegals should be booted out of the country. Support from this House would be of value towards ensuring support for this green card.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">Following on the issue raised by Senator Glynn, it is appalling to think that a young person's drink may be spiked. I too am a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children. We know from research carried out by the Rotunda that no young woman who showed up alleging she was raped had any trace of the drug Rohypnol in her blood. It would be wrong to say that women are being raped because their drinks have been spiked when the figures show the opposite. The only reason they are allegedly raped is because of over indulgence in alcohol. If we have a debate on this issue, it should deal with the issue of over indulgence as it is a worrying fact.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">I support Senator Feighan in his call for the unanimous support of this House for the undocumented Irish in the United States of America, who number approximately 50,000. They are marching in Washington today and given that at this time of year we will have Ministers attending St. Patrick's Day parades all over the United States, it is opportune to ask those Ministers to try to improve the plight of the undocumented Irish. This issue is raised in this House regularly. These people cannot come home even if their parents are very sick. They are missing family functions, weddings and so on because they are afraid to come home. We should do everything we can to support the Kennedy-McCain Bill currently going through Congress in America.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_86">Senators Finucane, Ryan, Ormonde, Quinn, Coghlan and Hanafin spoke about road safety matters. Senator Finucane mentioned the international safety conference and made some valuable points in that regard. He also referred to recommendations that were made some time ago. This is an area to which we should return and invite the Minister to the House to discuss it.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">The Senator is correct in what he said about penalty points. People should be made aware of what the new offences are, although there has been much publicity in the newspapers concerning the offences that attract penalty points. Perhaps the Government should consider taking out full-page advertisements in the national press before the new regime is put in place, to advise people of the nature of the offences in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">I agree with Senator Finucane's other point about fragmentation. One often wonders whether responsibility lies with the Department of Transport or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It seems to go around in a vacuum in the ether. I note what Senator Ryan had to say regarding driving in housing estates in Scandinavia, which appears to be a good idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">The matter of speeding trucks was raised by Senator Ormonde and Senator Ryan has raised it on previous occasions. They are quite right. It is frightening driving down the Naas dual carriageway——</p>

          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_91">——where the lanes are very restrictive and trucks are speeding along. Yesterday evening when I was driving home a truck passed me travelling well in excess of 60 mph. Apparently bus drivers also break the speed limits. Senator Quinn raised the matter of number plate recognition, which has been very successful in other jurisdictions. It should be rolled out here.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">Frequently people resort to the Constitution as a refuge when they are caught and are not convicted as a result. I am not saying the Constitution should necessarily be amended but it seems that people at certain levels can hire very expensive and capable lawyers to get them off on offences for which other people are convicted.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">Senator Hanafin made a good point regarding road signs and in that context, I think of a junction on the N7, somewhere near Kildare. Some signs for towns appear after one has passed the junction. If one is going to Waterford, for example, the signs for that county appear after one has passed the relevant junction. That is extraordinary and is inviting people to reverse, which is not something that should happen on a motorway.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">Senator O'Toole raised the matter of death in custody. Obviously we all regret the fact that anybody would die in Garda custody. In the case in question, a post mortem has been carried out and the findings are that the individual died of natural causes. The family of the deceased have asked for an independent post mortem to be carried out, as is their right.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">Going beyond that to the issue of the Garda ombudsman or an independent body, Senator O'Toole suggested that we have an independent assessment of these matters. There is some merit in that argument. These issues are open to debate and were also raised by Senator Norris. Senator Maurice Hayes also spoke about the Garda ombudsman, as did Senator Coghlan.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">Senator Ryan raised the matter of the amendment. It is up to the Cathaoirleach to decide whether an amendment is in order and I will not enter into that debate. However, if the Senator is inviting us to vote down the motion, we will quite happily do that this evening.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">It is a mandatory sentence, as we all know. The origins of the sentence review go back to the time of the death penalty in this jurisdiction and in the United Kingdom. Applications for reprieve were on the Home Secretary's desk and he moved little black balls around as people got closer to being executed. The review process is based on the discretion that the Home Secretary had to reprieve a death sentence. The life sentence has risen from seven to 15 years and is under constant review to determine the most appropriate tariff.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">Senator Maurice Hayes raised the matter of the European convention but I am not sure of the answer to his question. Senator Jim Walsh is correct in his assessment of tribunals. They have an obligation, under the instruments by which they were set up, to report back to the Oireachtas at certain points. However, they seem to go on for a very long time and commissions of inquiry or investigation are preferable for dealing with some, though not all, controversial matters.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulCoghlan" eId="spk_86">
          <from>Mr. Coghlan</from>
          <p eId="para_140">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe. Before the debate adjourned yesterday evening, I spoke on councillors' declarations and conflicts of interests. The Minister said firm directives are in place with which local authority members must comply. It will be interesting if there is any shortfall in the upcoming High Court case of De Búrca <i>v</i>. Whittle on planning matters in County Wicklow. I read a report in this morning’s newspapers regarding my hometown. However, I am too close to it to get involved in a debate on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">All Members know of councillors who took part in debates on planning issues when they had some interests, obvious or not. I will take the Minister's word that good guidelines are in place. Senator Norris referred to practices of the past. I believe 99.9% of councillors are good and law-abiding citizens with the best interests of their communities at heart. It will happen in any walk of life that there is the odd black sheep.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">Ongoing staffing problems exist in local authorities. In various areas, councillors have informed me of large turnovers in people. That is not conducive to good planning decisions. It leads to the last minute invitations for new information for which the clock must start running again. I am glad that spending of €43 billion is planned for infrastructure projects over the next five years, another reason why the Fine Gael Party supports the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">The proposed board will decide what is of strategic importance within the criteria laid down in the Bill. All the right infrastructural projects are included, namely, railways, both heavy and light, major electricity transmission lines, gas pipelines, airports, harbours and ports, waste management facilities and water and wastewater facilities. Incinerators are also included but I read that one specific incinerator is to be excluded. The Bill will rightly not cover shopping centres or office block developments. The main idea behind the provision is that it is seen to be a fair, open and transparent process. The Fine Gael Party agrees with the need for more certainty and better timeframes.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">The Minister referred to badly prepared applications and environmental impact statements. The Bill provides for discussions in advance with the strategic infrastructure division of An Bord Pleanála to ensure applications are put together properly. The board must be careful that it simply gives guidance and nothing improper.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">I welcome the Minister's comments on judicial reviews, the commercial court and the allocation of specialist judges. I also welcome the recent appointment of Kevin Feeney to the High Court. The Minister spoke about the initiatives being taken in the High Court. The President of the High Court has said that new initiatives will be put in place and there will be significant timesavings between the work of the High Court and what the Minister has in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">The need to avoid excessive and vexatious delays to major infrastructure developments is important. Members are aware of people who have objected to projects and delays for the sake of it. I recall one important planning appeal where An Bord Pleanála described it as without foundation or substance. The process will be speeded up and the board will not have to go to so much trouble in dealing with appeals.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">On major road projects, two of the worst roads are in the Minister of State's county. The Cork-Killarney road between Macroom and Ballymakeera is the worst national primary road in the State. I vote the Mallow-Mitchelstown road, the worst national secondary road. Hopefully, these roads will be improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">There is a strong intake in planning appeals. I welcome the provision for ten additional staff members in the appeals process but back-up staff will be necessary. However, I am sure the Minister will keep that aspect under review.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">I also welcome section 9, which deals with rogue developers. Unfortunately I do not have enough time to go into the section in detail.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatMoylan" eId="spk_87">
          <from>Mr. Moylan</from>
          <p eId="para_150">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, to the House and I welcome the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill. Such a Bill on planning is welcome at any time. There will be some controversy surrounding the different sections but we must welcome the Bill because it represents forward planning. Environmental impact statements are highlighted in the Bill and if we want to move in the right direction, that area is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">Problems over planning have arisen in the past in local authorities, and a number of speakers mentioned landfill sites. Other speakers talked about incinerators. Whether we like it or not, this country will have to have a certain number of incinerators if we want to address the problem of the illegal dumping that is taking place. Something must be done in that regard. There are many old landfill sites littered throughout the country and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the environment section of local authorities should engage in better monitoring of those sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">We must emphasise the importance of forward planning, particularly when we consider the difficulties the Government has faced regarding the provision of road infrastructure, which is so important. Objectors climbed trees or dug themselves in as a form of protest. They are entitled to take certain action and express their point of view but if these projects are properly planned, all those problems can be eliminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">People have objected to the fine motorways that have been constructed and some refuse to use them but if they considered the cost of having to drive around the old roads, particularly having regard to the cost of diesel, they would realise they are making a major mistake.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">Under the Bill there will be better involvement of An Bord Pleanála, which is important. We welcome also the small number of staff being provided but the Minister should consider leaving open the option to provide additional staff. As An Bord Pleanála takes on more important planning work it will need more expertise and staff. That option might be available to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">There is mention of railways and electricity transmission lines in the Bill. It is important that planning permission will have to be sought for those projects because in the past the ESB had a system where it laid lines through or close to built up areas or through scenic areas when, with little extra cost, it could have avoided some of those important locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">There is no doubt that planning is never perfect. Regardless of what development takes place, people will be affected by planning decisions. There have been major road and gas developments throughout our counties that have been hugely beneficial to housing and industry but at the same time such developments affect certain people. As mentioned earlier, however, many of those problems can be avoided.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">I wish to respond to a point made yesterday by Senator Norris about a development in my county of Offaly, Standish Sawmills. As a former member of a local authority, I want to record that this company sought and was granted planning permission. That decision was appealed to An Bord Pleanála, which granted planning permission. The company also has an EPA licence. What more can that company do in a rural area of County Offaly? It employs approximately 100 people and it has complied with what is required of it under law.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">A group of people who do not want any development in the area objected but three years ago that same group wrote to me, as concerned residents. I wrote back to them asking for the names, addresses and contact numbers of the concerned residents but that was the last I heard from them. We must be fair to people who want to provide industry and also to those who are entitled to object but I wish to record my view on that development.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">Section 33 provides that land lying ten metres or more below the surface of that land shall be taken to be of nil value. We must be careful about putting something like that in a Bill because developments can take place on one's land where there might be an esker or quarries in excess of ten metres below the surface. That land can be very valuable. I hope we will not decide on Committee Stage that after a certain depth, a farmer's land is of no value. It can be of immense value to a farmer and I would like to ensure we examine that section more carefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">On the question of making application for major developments directly to the board, I would like that aspect to be teased out on Committee Stage. I realise such applications will be notified to the local planning authority, which is appropriate, but will public notices be erected on the site for local residents to view? In many cases, the only way local people know about proposed developments is because they read the notices on the roadside or street. They may not buy the daily papers in which many planning notices are published.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">Regarding objections by An Taisce, it is difficult to know who is making them or from where they are coming. It is my experience that objections can be made in the name of An Taisce at the eleventh hour. Lists of the names of the members of any organisation, whether it be the GAA, a county council, a rugby club, An Taisce or whatever, should be made available to the public. I am disappointed with the performance of An Taisce, although I appreciate it has a job to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">A number of speakers referred to planning and the rezoning of land. Politicians come in for some flack because of rezoning but I was involved in changing the development plan on a number of occasions in a county and the owner of the land or the person who benefited from the rezoning never concerned me. I always believed that by looking at the bigger picture when developing towns, one ensured that housing was available therein and therefore people did not have to move to rural areas where there were serious objections.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">County managers and directors of services are very important in the planning process. There is a perception that many planners are from the one school and that they have a tunnel view of development. It often occurs to me and others that planners make the final decision and sometimes make very significant comments on the architectural value of buildings being constructed. There is a case for local authorities to have expertise in respect of developments.</p>

          <from>Mr. Moylan</from>
          <p eId="para_165">Social and affordable housing has been mentioned and highlighted. We need to address the circumstances in which a developer can give money to a local authority instead of providing the social and affordable mix in the scheme under development. When the legislation dealing with this matter was being considered in the House, I wanted to ensure developments included affordable and social housing so we would not have groups of well-heeled people ensuring nobody of other social classes could enter their estates. This issue must be examined. When one gives a large amount of money to a local authority, it will not always be spent in the area in question and may not be of benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">I welcome the Bill and hope we will discuss it in more detail on Committee Stage. I wish the Minister, Deputy Roche, the Ministers of State, Deputies Batt O'Keeffe and Noel Ahern, and their officials well in dealing with this Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_90">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_167">The Labour Party is far from happy with this Bill. It is not at all clear to us what problem is being solved in respect of a number of issues. A variety of issues arose at various times in respect of planning. All sorts of lobby groups, IBEC in particular, chambers of commerce and Engineers Ireland, the professional body of which I am a member, have suggested at various stages that the legal process was too long-winded and complicated and that infrastructural development was being held back by the complications of planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">I keep a close watch on the National Roads Authority and An Bord Pleanála and am aware of what occurs when a proposal for a major road infrastructure project is made public. This involves a CPO and environmental impact statement and usually an oral hearing by an official of An Bord Pleanála. An Bord Pleanála is currently doing an extremely efficient job regarding such issues and there is not a scrap of evidence that our road infrastructure development is being delayed by planning complications.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">There are two reasons for the delay in road infrastructure development, the first of which is the inadequacy of the Government's plan of 2002, whereby it was to have us supplied with motorways or high-quality dual carriageways by this year. The truth is that it was not a plan but a series of lines drawn on a series of maps. Furthermore, a sum of money was plucked out of thin air, which turned out to be hopelessly inadequate. This was not a question of planning in the An Bord Pleanála sense but of the ineptitude of Government planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">My long-stated view is that the fundamental problem with large-scale infrastructural developments, be they associated with roads or telecommunications, which represents the other major infrastructural deficit in this country, is that there is a difference of opinion between those of us who believe one uses infrastructural development to shape the market and those who do not. If one builds good road, rail, telecommunications and energy infrastructure throughout the country, particularly in the BMW region, it moves the market in the direction of that region and away from areas of excess demand, particularly the eastern region.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">The alternative view, which dominates the thinking of the major funding Department in this State, is that infrastructure must follow the market. In other words, one must prove in advance that the demand exists. If one adopts this model, as the Department of Finance has done historically, one will always have an infrastructural deficit and one region will always be overloaded and swamped with excess demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">If there was an extremely good road infrastructure between Dublin and the towns of Galway, Tralee, Letterkenny and Sligo, it would be of no great significance to multinationals where they were based. If our infrastructure is such that one can get to one of the major international airports in a couple of hours, provided the airports are able to survive, one's location does not matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, is as aware as I am of the potential disaster facing Cork Airport if it is forced to take on a burden of debt it has had no hand in accumulating. If we manage to run good airports, our infrastructure will decide where development happens. This morning's newspapers quote tourism industry representatives as saying the number of visitors to Dublin has continued to increase while the number of visitors to the rest of the country has dropped dramatically because of our poor transport infrastructure. This is not caused by An Bord Pleanála or the planning process. Saying so is a smokescreen to divert people's attention from the inadequacy of Government policy, funding and managerial systems. It is nothing more than this and that is one reason this Bill is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">The second reason is because one is extremely sceptical of the willingness of the Government to use what already exists. The toleration of unauthorised developments, which are ultimately given retention approval, is so high that some cite figures of 80%. It is difficult to ascertain the exact figures but those which are available suggest we do not take the planning laws too seriously anyway. I am not only referring to someone who happens to build an unauthorised back porch. An Bord Pleanála made an unfortunate decision to grant retention permission for a major industrial development in the midlands in recent months. We will not change that by changing the law, but by changing the will. If we do not want to enforce existing law, there is no point in pretending that the introduction of new law will help to solve the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">I would like to speak about the problem of the capacity of individuals to play games with the spirit of legislation, while observing the letter of the law. I refer in particular to a widely reported decision that was made by a local authority in Killarney recently. A member of the local authority who was potentially a major beneficiary, at least through business, of the authority's decision declared his interest and abstained from the vote. However, he stayed in the council chamber actively lobbying the rest of the members of the local authority to take a decision that would benefit the business he was running. That was not a breach of the law, but it was a profound affront to the spirit of the legislation. If the spirit of the law had been properly observed, the individual would have stayed away from the chamber, rather than abstaining from the decision and lobbying his local authority colleagues during an adjournment of the meeting. The Bill will not change that attitude and set of values, which is a problem in this country that should be dealt with by the political party that helps people like the man in question to get involved in politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">This legislation will not alter the extraordinary inadequacy of this country's attempts to plan in a holistic way. The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, knows as well as I do, if not better, that the southern part of Cork city, which is spreading out into County Cork, was developed in an extraordinary way, particularly in the Douglas area. Thousands of houses which have been built feed onto what is essentially a country lane. It does not appear to be within our capacity to recognise that if we are to allow a vast number of houses to be built, we have to ensure that those who live in them can get to where they work, shop and do everything else. We will not bring about change in that regard simply by changing the law until we get a proper sense of holistic planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">If we are to allow thousands of houses to be built, we need to ensure that schools, shops, roads and public transport infrastructure are put in place. Unlike the Department of Finance, we should not wait until we see what happens. If we do not recognise, on the basis of past experience, that the construction of hundreds and thousands of houses will lead to hundreds and thousands of children living in an area, thereby necessitating the development of new schools, etc., all the legislation in the world will not make a scrap of difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">I would like to speak about the issue of delays. I have already referred to delays in the construction of roads, but I would like to consider whether similar problems are encountered in the development of our railway infrastructure. Although I have not seen any evidence that the local communities which have objected to road developments have objected to improvements in railway services, there are significant delays in the expansion of our railway system, which should be the focus of our development of transport infrastructure. Why will it take years to reopen the railway line between Navan and Dublin? Why was it announced last October that the completion of the railway lines from Midleton and Blarney to Cork will take place a year later than was originally intended? Such delays do not relate to An Bord Pleanála, but to ineptitude, bad management and underresourcing.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">I have often made the point that the Department of Finance is continuing to insist that projects like railway improvements need to be viable. Ireland is probably the only country in the world that is attempting, in accordance with the limited criteria of the Department of Finance, to develop a railway infrastructure that is commercially profitable. Most other countries recognise that the huge advantage of railways is that they bring about spectacular reductions in environmental impact. The consequent decrease in the use of private cars also has the benefit of freeing up traffic. One cannot quantify such benefits in a simple profit and loss account under a regime which deems that every ticket needs to be profitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">If one approaches the development of infrastructure in such a manner, one will end up with a ridiculous situation like that in Britain following the privatisation of the railways there. The state subsidy in Britain is now bigger than ever, but there is less state control and less organisation and the railway service is fragmented. If we want to develop our railway infrastructure, we should not think it will be hindered by delays in planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">This country's telecommunications infrastructure is probably its biggest mess. The last time I checked, we were in danger of having four parallel telecommunications infrastructure developments, one of which is owned by Eircom. The privatisation of Eircom has made a great deal of money for a few people while costing the country's citizens a few bob. It has resulted in the transfer of money from the hands of the Irish people and into the hands of people who can best be described as speculative capitalists. The company has suffered from under-investment and delays since it was privatised.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Eircom is touted by international investment analysts as one of the most spectacularly successful companies at dealing with regulators because it has frustrated the intentions of the communications regulators many times. We do not have a proper telecommunications infrastructure because of the inept policy decision to privatise Eircom that was made in the first place and the even more inept follow-up to that, rather than as a result of problems with the planning process.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">Such mistakes are found in many areas. I have not even mentioned incineration. It is possible to envisage circumstances in which incineration is the right solution to a problem. One can deal with incineration only in the context of a properly joined-up waste management policy. There is an incinerator in Cork because An Bord Pleanála capitulated to the Government and agreed to its policy, against the advice of its own inspector. The level of ineptitude in the area of waste management defies description. We do not know from where the incinerator in Cork will get its waste. It will not get it locally because all the generators of hazardous waste in the Cork region are already dealing with that waste. I could mention a succession of issues of this nature. There is no need to change the law to deal with them because the problems lie outside the planning process — they lie in funding, in the Government's inability to manage and develop projects efficiently and on time and in the unwillingness to enforce existing legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">I will conclude by reiterating the need to retain general responsibility for planning at local level. I agree with Senator Moylan that it would be useful to establish a bank of centralised expertise to advise local planners. Such experts would not take over from the planners, but give them the intellectual, scientific and archaeological skills to match the expertise of developers. This problem is also found in Denmark, where the planning process is enormously decentralised. Some local authorities in that country feel inadequate in dealing with certain issues because not enough expertise is available to them. Much more money is spent on such matters in Denmark. We could do worse than to examine the Danish approach, understand the Danish problems and consider the Danish solutions, which do not involve bypassing democratic participation in decisions on development.</p>

          <p eId="para_185">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and his officials. I warmly welcome the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill 2006, which is important and necessary. There was no need for this legislation 20 or 30 years ago because not enough money was available to pay for infrastructural development. It could be argued that it did not make much difference at that time if the planning and judicial appeal processes were drawn out. We are in a totally different situation today, however, because a great deal of funding is available but it is not always spent, as we see when the outturns are published at the end of each year. The underspend is often due to technical, planning or judicial review related delays.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">There has been a tremendous investment programme in the past ten years. I always know I am on the right track when people try to interrupt me. They do not want to hear the truth and they do not want to hear any objective analysis of the situation. Members of the Opposition sometimes laugh and smile, as do some Members on this side, when the Taoiseach describes himself as a socialist. One of the criteria of socialism is the heavy emphasis on public investment and on that criterion, this Government is certainly socialist and more socialist than the Labour Party has ever been.</p>

Its members used to accuse the Labour Party of being a welfarist party. There is probably still some truth in that criticism. If resources and wealth are to be created, public investment is needed and this Government is providing that investment in spades. That is not just coming from Europe——</p>

          <p eId="para_206">——but from its own resources, because of the excellent management of the economy, which the Senator is not prepared to recognise.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">There is a notion out there that this Bill is not needed. Many important projects have been seriously delayed. Given that some of them have now gone ahead, one might ask why they were held up. There were protests in the Glen of the Downs and in Carrickmines. I have never heard of a case where the NRA decided to bulldoze through a 30-foot standing castle and run a road through it. Standing structures are always avoided, but all that was left of Carrickmines Castle was underground.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Another example of these delays was the Kildare bypass, as is the prolonged controversy over the gas terminal in Mayo. The long delays in these decisions are not in the national interest and a more streamlined approach to infrastructure is needed. The governments of states with good infrastructure, such as France, do not hang around for years with appeals, judicial hearings and so on. We should think of the inconvenience that causes to the public. I am in favour of proper, thorough debate about important infrastructure decisions. Such a debate occurred over the proposed M3 and the Hill of Tara. The overwhelming conclusion was that the right route had been chosen and should proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">This legislation needs to be handled with sensitivity. If it was used in an attempt to push through bad decisions, difficulties might arise in obtaining public consent for the planning process. It must be used sensibly in well-considered decisions. For issues such as social housing, it is up to the leaders of local authorities to see that the spirit of the legislation is implemented. Like Senator Moylan, I regret that some developers are simply buying out their obligations. However, to behave in that manner, managers of local authorities need a clear signal from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I know of more than one local authority that consists of officials with plenty of drive, who insist that this be carried through and who do not let people off the hook.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Reference was made earlier to incineration. Listening to the argument, one would think that landfill was an extremely environmentally-friendly method of disposing of waste, but of course it is a filthy method. The argument against incineration is very unbalanced in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Senator Ryan made the point that public investment should lead development and not just follow it. I believe that lesson is being learned. In the Adamstown development, provision is being made for a station. The Cork to Midleton railway line is meant to focus development along the route and is not just following development.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">I do not think the legislation will treat the substrata of a piece of land as of no value if fabulous mineral wealth is located under that land. However, compensation should not be paid for something that has little to do with what is overground. For at least 150 years, this country has been bedevilled by the amount of compensation that must be paid to acquire land and to proceed with development. This area needs critical examination. Small strips of land that are no bigger than this Chamber can cost between €1 million and €3 million and that is not a good use of taxpayers' money.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_112">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_213">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am not in good form because I have just had a blazing row with a senior planner in Limerick County Council over a planning application. That is symptomatic of the frustration felt by many public representatives with the whole planning process.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">The importance of this critical infrastructure Bill for large-scale projects has been expressed but I will digress and discuss planning in general and the frustrations being experienced at present. Some time ago the Taoiseach announced in Sligo that there would be a new charter for rural areas under which the planning process would be simplified. He empathised with the difficulties being experienced by people in rural areas with regard to planning. This was followed up by statements by the then Minister, Deputy Cullen, and recently by the Minister, Deputy Roche, about planning guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Those guidelines have been posted to the local authorities throughout the country. Due to the number of applications, the process has become more frustrating and it is more difficult to get planning permission. I wish to nail the lie that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the Taoiseach have helped the planning process. If anything, it has become more difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">There are difficulties in local authorities and a lack of uniformity between councils regarding design guidelines for houses. The guidelines are constantly changing. The architects who prepare plans suddenly discover that certain features are no longer fashionable, for example, bow windows. They might be told to opt for a stone finish and not to include Dutch gables but if they point out to the authorities that planning approval was given recently for a house which incorporates Dutch gables, external chimneys and, possibly, bow windows, one will be told that the guidelines have been changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The guidelines are not statutory. It is down to the independent thinking of the planners in the council. Professional architects are getting frustrated because they are being told by the planners that their architectural designs for properties are unsatisfactory. I would have thought that the planners' concerns should relate to the specific site, the structure and whether the site is suitable. There is a lack of uniformity. The guidelines given to the local authorities are not statutory guidelines so they are not enforceable.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Many local authorities have appointed independent assessors. These assessors will carry out percolation tests on the site. In many cases, people are paying from €800 to €1,000 to have these tests conducted. If one is paying that amount of money, there is an expectation that the test might be successful but, obviously, in many cases the assessors deem the site unsuitable. However, they must be paid €1,000. There should be pre-assessment whereby the person concerned can be told, for example, that there are rushes on the site making it unsatisfactory for building a house. This initial inspection fee could be €100 rather than having the client pay a fee of €1,000 later only for the site to be rejected.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Percolation has become a big issue. The providers of biocycle systems compete with each other. Clients will be guaranteed that they can drink the water produced by their system yet that system can be deemed unsatisfactory by the local authorities. With percolation tests and biocycle systems, not only is there an independent assessor to assess the site but the environmental section of the local authority is also involved. The health board looks at these issues as well, perhaps second guessing the original estimate made by the assessor. There is a plethora of people involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Recently, the Minister made an announcement about local authority funding for the future. A report was produced by Indecon Consultants at a cost of €292,000. The report covered 2004 to 2006. What were its findings? One could write down on a sheet of notepaper what the findings will be if one contracts consultants to compile a report for that amount of money. They advocated the reintroduction of water rates and the introduction of local charges. It was not necessary to pay €292,000 to discover that. The report was dead in the water from the time it was printed given that no Government or Opposition party will advocate such changes in advance of an election.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">What was the Minister's reaction? He said more efficiencies would be sought in the local authorities. The extra funding that will be required in the future will be found in extra efficiencies. Furthermore, he said the planning charges would be increased. I will remind the Minister of what is happening in rural areas. He should read what Jim Connolly of the rural resettlement organisation is saying. The cost for young people of building in rural areas is extremely prohibitive and the system is making it even more uneconomical for them. That is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">The Government should not say one thing in Sligo and something else through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It should not carry on this hypocrisy of pretending something is happening to simplify the system when it is getting more complex, more expensive and more frustrating for the applicant. The Fianna Fáil Party should forget its constant double speak because people are no longer conned by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">A proper planning policy must be adopted on a national basis. There must be uniformity of design so the person who is preparing a planning application knows what is acceptable and a person in Limerick can produce what Cork County Council says is an acceptable design. Any public representative will say that the most frustrating aspect of the job nowadays is when a young couple comes to him or her about a planning application. I empathise with these couples and am aware of the difficulties they are experiencing and their frustration with the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">No planning application goes through within the statutory period of eight weeks, certainly not in my county although perhaps it happens in other counties. If one watches the process closely and is making representations on somebody's behalf, one will notice that if the planning application is due to be decided tomorrow and one rings today to find out what is happening with it, one will be told that further information is being sought. That extends the process even further because the planning process only starts with the receipt of satisfactory information.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">It is time to define the parameters. It is time that acceptable design is defined so architects and the people who design the plans are aware of it. It is also time to talk to the people who produce biocyle systems. I am sure they are reputable organisations. They are telling their clients that if they use their systems, they will be able to drink the water produced. However, the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government do not appear to be convinced. The Department must give recognition to producers of biocycle systems and say whether their systems are acceptable. That will at least lift the fog of uncertainty on this issue and ease the difficulties people are experiencing.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Another development in recent years which was hailed as a new dawn was the introduction of planning and development contributions. Those contributions have provided much extra financial largesse for the councils. The argument used to convince councillors to introduce such contributions was that proper sewerage schemes would be provided because the resource would be channelled in that direction. However, the reality is quite different. The planning and development contributions escalate every year but communities have not yet seen the sewerage schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">I regularly raise sewerage and water schemes in County Limerick on the Adjournment. I am usually told that the particular scheme is part of the 2005 to 2007 programme on which €150 million will be spent. This has been going on for years. An attempt was made by the Minister to improve matters by providing that if the project was less than €5 million it would not be necessary to go through the routine procedures which actually prolong the application. The Minister said he would simplify the process. However, the process has not been simplified because the local authorities bundled different sewerage schemes together for economic reasons and this pushed most of them over the €5 million threshold, therefore prolonging the saga. When I raise these matters on the Adjournment the Minister reads a thesis on what the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is doing for water and sewerage schemes. The reality is quite different.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">It is time the Minister tackled the planning situation. People in rural areas are waiting for a coherent planning structure which the Department, the local authorities and they can understand. It is time the Minister got his act together. The critical infrastructure Bill relates to projects which I am unlikely to encounter often in my lifetime but the Government must get its act together on the bread and butter issues in planning. On the ground it is the pure butter of planning and the Government would want to get its act together.</p>

The purpose of the Bill is to fast-track the process with a division in An Bord Pleanála to handle major infrastructural projects, which I welcome, as it will allow the quality of life to be improved.

          <p eId="para_261">I have no major difficulty with the Bill. However, I would like the Minister of State to listen to my only objection. The stakeholders are the local authority, the councillors and the public and they may object. I wonder about the composition of the board. It is to reflect planning and environmental expertise, and voluntary input. Handling objections is an enormous task. I have often wondered how An Bord Pleanála works. Will the new division help to improve matters? When serious objections are made, how will it make its decisions? It is a mammoth task to reflect all the objections that might be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">I welcome the section of the Bill that deals with rogue developers. As councillors, we have all experienced developers who completed developments and failed to honour the conditions of the planning permission. The onus is now placed on the developer to go to the High Court if he or she wants a planning decision overturned, which is a positive development.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">Social and affordable housing works well in my local authority area, as we have a county manager who will not tolerate failure to honour the percentage requirements in any estate. I understand that it does not work so well in some local authority areas and the Minister should reflect on the matter again. The guidelines should be administered nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The Bill will fast-track major projects affecting the environment such as incinerators and landfill sites, transport projects such airports and harbours, and energy projects such as gas pipe installation and windfarms. However, the democratic process will still be allowed to work. It is important that the process still involves the local authority to reflect the local development plan and the views of the public, after which the division of An Bord Pleanála takes the final decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">Judicial review remains a possibility if people are still not satisfied. An Bord Pleanála will have the power to refuse planning permission on the basis of the points and objections made. The timeline allows six weeks initially, ten weeks for debate by the council and then 18 weeks for final decision. This will be a good move, provided it works. Today we have some scenarios that can take years to reach conclusion. Provided we have a balance reflecting regional development and the spatial strategy, that the democratic process is retained, and that the timeframe is right, the Bill is welcome and I hope it works.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_266">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, to the House. I also welcome the debate on this important Bill. While we are clear what it seeks to do, I am not convinced the legislation will ensure that any major infrastructural projects will be fast-tracked as a result. In particular, I welcome section 9, which provides that developers who are notorious for unfinished estates, can now be refused permission by a local authority. We have all been lobbied by housing and residents' associations and people living in estates that are not properly finished. It is not good enough for a developer, who gets planning permission and subsequently sells the units at considerable profit, to fail to fulfil the obligation to complete the estate. It has been frustrating to see those developers move on to another estate and then leave the same trail of misery behind, with the local authority virtually helpless to take action. This week I phoned my local authority regarding an unfinished estate.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">I commend the work on this issue done by our spokesperson in the Lower House, Deputy Gilmore, who has put considerable time and effort into the issue. He has led the debate on the issue and introduced a Private Members' Bill on the matter last year. I understand the Minister has not attended the select committee and has delayed the legislative process since.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">However, it is a very welcome development, and I look forward to that section of the Bill being used against developers who need to be taught a lesson. Manners must be put on them, and section 9 is an excellent means of doing so. It ensures that permission can at least be refused to developers who do not finish estates.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">We are all aware of delays, for a variety of reasons, in furnishing the country with critical infrastructure. It is unacceptable that such delays occur. Can we blame the planning process for all the delays? I am not sure we can. The planning process is clearly not at fault with our not having a second terminal at Dublin Airport. There have been debates and arguments in Cabinet regarding the respective positions of the Progressive Democrats and the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan. Such indecision has led to delay in building a second terminal at the airport. It clearly has nothing to do with the planning process, and I wonder how the implementation of this legislation will speed up that project.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">Why has more broadband not come on stream? Why has Ethiopia got more of it than we? Why are we falling behind regarding its provision? It is critical infrastructure, but I do not believe the planning process is to blame. This legislation will not accelerate the provision, implementation or improvement of broadband around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Much has been said regarding High Court actions and judicial reviews instigated by people regarding critical infrastructure. I am not convinced that this legislation resolves the problem. My party has on several occasions proposed the establishment of a special division in the High Court to deal with it. It would enormously speed up projects delayed as a result of High Court challenges. If one examines that proposal, one will see its merit.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">A major feature of the legislation is that local communities will have no real say on massive projects. It cuts out the local, democratic element of the process. That is not good, since a variety of things can happen. If it now bypasses the local authority and the normal planning process, more people will be aggrieved at not having had the same opportunity to submit observations or make their views known regarding the project in its initial stages. We will have greater recourse to the High Court once the project has been advanced by virtue of the new system proposed in this Bill. That is a key point.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">More than likely, more High Court decisions will be taken as a result of eliminating that local involvement and cutting out the real say that local communities have had. That could take a great deal more time to address. Under this legislation, all projects will now go to An Bord Pleanála, which will decide what is strategic infrastructure. The plans then go back to the local authority and to the board for a decision. I would be very interested to know how long it will take the board to make its initial decision on whether a project is of strategic importance. After consideration has been given and time has elapsed, it goes to the local authority for a further ten weeks of consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">I am well used to dealing with local authorities regarding routine planning matters, and we are all very much aware of the number of occasions that the planning authority has sought an extension or withdrawal of the application in order to secure more time to consider it. That happens for several reasons, not least that it may not have adequate resources to deal with the massive increase in applications seen recently. One therefore adds to an already congested planning system. Will resources be put in place to allow local authorities to deal with the extra work generated? One must also bear in mind the public representative's role. His or her workload will be greatly increased. How long will it take from when the project goes to An Bord Pleanála until it returns to the local authority?</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Despite all the difficulties in the planning process, there is general and genuine belief in the independence of An Bord Pleanála. Every reasonable individual involved in planning takes that view, and people are very mindful of it. It is good to ensure a level of public confidence in State institutions, and An Bord Pleanála comes out on top, despite what is a very difficult process administered by local authorities, not least for those who submit applications for one-off rural housing. These legislative proposals will fundamentally change An Bord Pleanála's role from providing an independent planning appeals process to being a facilitator for major Government projects. That conflict will add to a sense of confusion. There may not be the requisite level of public confidence that the board's independence is absolute.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">I have made this point regarding section 9, and I will repeat it for the Minister's benefit. That very welcome part of the legislation provides a rap on the knuckles for developers, making real provision to teach them manners. If they have not completed the work as required, they will no longer be able to make people's lives miserable as they look out from their doorways at estates that have not been finished and which have become jungles of weeds.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">Senator Finucane raised several issues. Regarding the planning process, I am becoming ever more frustrated at the way that local authorities require external reports to assist decision-making on one-off rural housing. For example, regarding a house 4 miles outside Dunmanway in west Cork, the planning process was gone through. When the decision was being made, the engineer sought further information, but generally speaking the application had passed through the system reasonably favourably. In this case, the planning agent did not reply to that request for additional information within the prescribed time limit. Therefore, the application lapsed.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">A similar reapplication was made to demolish the house and build just behind it. Lo and behold, the planning authority sought an archaeological report, which costs approximately €1,500, plus VAT and expenses. In conjunction with increased development charges and the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant, that creates a great financial burden for the hard-pressed young person. This case was inherently contradictory, since no report was sought in the first instance, six or eight months before the second, when the information was requested.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">I look forward to debating this legislation with the Minister in forensic detail on the various Stages. I welcome section 9 but have reservations regarding the remainder.</p>

        <speech by="#KieranPhelan" eId="spk_146">
          <from>Mr. K. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_280">I welcome the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, to the House to deal with this important legislation, in support of which my colleagues and I are pleased to speak. The purposed of the Bill is to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 and it will provide for the introduction of a streamlined planning consent procedure for the development of strategic infrastructure. When the Minister first published it a few weeks ago, I saw the usual suspects knocking each other over trying to get in front of TV cameras or onto radio shows to condemn it. I am fairly sure that the same crowd of permanent whingers had not had the time to read through the measures contained in the Bill before coming out against it. However, I doubt that the Minister had expected much support from them anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I was happy to read that the new strategic infrastructure division to be established in An Bord Pleanála will determine strategic infrastructure projects. That is important, and I hope it is given the necessary resources to do its job. While a member of Laois County Council from 1991 until stepping down, I always found myself frustrated by the lack of speed regarding important infrastructure projects in my area.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">I will address some points to critics of this important legislation. This country needs new and improved infrastructure. We cannot have infrastructure built for the 20th century serving a national economy of the 21st century. Our quality of life is not raised by delays in construction or court injunctions against motorways, for example. I am unhappy to see that such delays are adding to the costs of the various infrastructure projects. That wasted money might have been better spent elsewhere on other projects. There are people who think that those of us outside Dublin should be satisfied with second-rate infrastructure. They are wrong, and I know that the Minister thinks that too. All Members should welcome the fact that this legislation will help to tackle bottlenecks throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">Last November, I spoke in this House with regard to the issue of housing and specifically with regard to local government. The former Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputies Noel Dempsey and Cullen, as well as the current Minister, Deputy Roche, deserve great credit for their success in securing record funding for local authorities since 1997. They fought hard at national level to provide funding to councils and the country is better off because of this investment. However, many other critical projects have been delayed or often stopped in their tracks by a legal system which facilitates protesters who are hell-bent on causing maximum disruption.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">A number of weeks ago in the Seanad, a Progressive Democrats motion referred to the water services investment programme. Members heard how the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, has greatly reduced the level of red tape involved in getting water and sewerage schemes through their design and construction stages. This is crucial for local communities and for rural communities in particular, and the proposed legislation is a similar step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I was happy to learn that this legislation proposes to establish protections so that everyone has the right to participate in the planning process. As I do not want elected county and city councillors to be ignored in this process, I am satisfied there will be a strategic consent process, whereby An Bord Pleanála will be required to consult with the relevant local authorities and to have due regard for their comments, as well as the views of the elected members of the councils.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">I make this point for a simple reason, namely, that public representatives, and specifically members of local authorities, must be accountable to their electorate. Public representatives cannot hide from their responsibilities to the people in their localities. Hence, democratically-elected local representatives must take part in this process. Unaccountable and unelected people can often make decisions without a care in the world. Members' colleagues on city and county councils bear the blame for decisions made by unknown and faceless officials. I urge the Minister to ensure that measures are included in this necessary legislation to prevent the further erosion of local democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">I again thank the Minister for introducing this legislation and I appreciate that it took much effort to bring it this far. I look forward to supporting this Bill and hope it will pass through the Dáil as soon as possible, because the country is being strangled by objectors and cranks with nothing better to do than waste taxpayers' money.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I am proud of the record and achievements of Laois County Council in respect of major projects. However, in many cases, had this legislation been in place, much time and money could have been saved and many projects could have been expedited. Nevertheless, I am glad the legislation is before the House and I thank the Minister once again for pressing ahead with it, despite cries from the usual suspects.</p>

        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_147" as="#Leas-Chathaoirleach">
          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_289">I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It is probably one of the most crucial Bills to come before the House in this, or in any other term. In respect of some of the Bill's aspects, Senator McCarthy put his finger on it when he noted that it will not affect quite a number of issues. He cited the second terminal at Dublin Airport, which is not delayed by planning issues. Similarly, planning issues have not held up the roll-out of broadband, which has been an absolute disgrace, as we are light years behind some of our eastern counterparts.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Moreover, this Bill would not have affected a critical piece of infrastructure for the development of County Mayo and the towns of Castlebar and Westport, namely, the Castlebar-Westport road. Hence, the Bill will have no part to play with regard to many infrastructural projects throughout the country, the progress of which has not been held up by its absence.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I want the Minister to spell out to the House in detail how the legislation will work. As someone who has served for 25 years on a local authority, I am puzzled as to how it will work from the initial lodging of a planning application to the final deadline when planning is granted. I am uncertain of the merits of the Minister's proposal to give power to An Bord Pleanála. He intends to increase the number of its board members from seven to nine and has outlined the various bodies which can nominate people. In addition, the Minister can add a number of people and in the final analysis, eight or nine people will serve on the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">As legislators, Members will vest these nine people with considerable power. In future, they will make the decisions pertaining to critical pieces of infrastructure. When I first heard of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill, I assumed that local or regional authorities would play a significant part in fast-tracking planning applications. However, that does not appear to be the case. From my reading of this Bill, a planning application will go directly to An Bord Pleanála.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">In my experience as a local authority member, in some cases when new roads were being designed, the local authority identified three to five potential routes. Subsequently, the local authority members decided on a particular route on the advice of officials. What will happen in future? Will An Bord Pleanála decide the route for a road from Castlebar to Westport, Athlone to Galway or Naas to Cork? Who will pick the route? Will the application go to An Bord Pleanála after the route is picked? When will the project be fast-forwarded to An Bord Pleanála? It strikes me, from reading parts of this Bill, that local authority members will have little say in the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">I noticed that Senator Norris has welcomed the Bill because of what happened in the 1990s, mainly in Dublin, in respect of taking money for planning applications and so forth. This happened in Dublin because of a lack of forward planning. Officials did not bring development plans and area action plans before council members. Subsequently, material changes to development plans were introduced and councillors were obliged to make decisions in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">However, had proper forward planning taken place, this would not have arisen. While many planners are employed in local authorities, most of them are tied up with matters such as sewerage scheme applications, how they might affect the housing plan, and whether their access to roads is on national routes, county roads or whatever. Too many planners are engaged in such activities and not enough staff work in forward planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">The majority of local authorities have few planners working in this field. More people are needed in this respect and had this been the case in the 1980s, it would have cut out much of the nonsense that happened in the Dublin area. The events of the 1990s would never have happened. Hence, I want the Minister to provide a detailed outline to the House of the progress which a planning application coming under the auspices of this Bill will make from the first to the final stage. How will local people be able to make their input into that process?</p>
          <p eId="para_297">I have encountered people who have been aggrieved by planning decisions. All Members know of such cases. I can cite a case which took place in my home town of Castlebar in respect of a bridge improvement on the national secondary route from Castlebar to Ballinrobe, which aggrieved people. In the case of one particular household, if it snowed or if the ground was slippy, they would neither be able to drive out nor walk out of their driveway. When we went back to redress this with the local authority, we were told in no uncertain terms that the household concerned had people working for them, they went to arbitration and at that stage there was nothing the local authority could do.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_298">In the past number of weeks I was approached in my office by a parent whose son has autism. He was assigned to a school in Athy and unfortunately it did not work out for him in so far as he was not able to cope in the school in question. That has been backed up by reports from the principal of the school, psychologists, the special needs assistant, the bus driver and the parents themselves. The child was physically getting sick in the car going to school and was obviously being a major source of disruption in the school.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Incredibly, the Department of Education and Science is refusing to give home tuition to that child, despite all the evidence given to it. They keep coming back to the parents stating the Department will not give them home tuition because, as far as they are concerned, the child has a school place. The child has not attended school since April last and, unfortunately, will not be attending school in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">I am shocked at the attitude of the Department of Education and Science, which I cannot understand. For years it did nothing for children with autism. Then it started throwing money at parents for home tuition and there was no accountability. We had no idea who was given home tuition and how many hours they were getting.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">In this case where a school place was allocated, it has not worked out and the obvious solution is for the option of home tuition to be given to the parents and the child involved but the Department is sticking to its guns and is not catering for the child's needs. We seem to have learned nothing from the Jamie Sinnott court case or the case taken by Marie O'Donoghue, where she proved in the High Court that every child is educable irrespective of his or herdisability he or she may have.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">I would ask the Minister, Deputy Roche, even though he is not in that Department, to let my concerns be known to the Department of Education and Science. It does not make sense. All these people seek is home tuition. That is why home tuition is available. It is in place for exactly this type of case.</p>

        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_149">
          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_303">We had no redress when we went back to my local authority and we got no suck from them either.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I also have been contacted by a resident in Lucan, County Dublin. This woman told me that one had only to witness the official vandalism visited by Dublin South County Council on the residents of south Lucan by the intransigent insistence on driving a major distributary route through the most densely populated part of west Dublin, thus sundering further the fragile community. She told me that over 300 trees have been mercilessly cut down, never to be replaced, in this venture — which was demonstrated at two oral hearings — and that it will not alleviate Dublin's greatest traffic problem, the gridlock in the Lucan area. What happened there will not alleviate the problem but it has divided a community, pushing the road through the most densely populated part of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Whereas the Bill gives all of this power to An Bord Pleanála, heretofore a local authority decided and there was an appeals process where people could appeal to an independent body, An Bord Pleanála. If An Bord Pleanála will now be the body to which such matters will be fast-fowarded, will there be any independent appeals system afterwards or is a judicial review the only recourse open subsequently? This is an important point. It strikes me, from reading the Bill, that there will be no independent recourse for genuine objectors. Let us face the reality that there are communities who have been badly affected by certain infrastructure. While there are cranks out there as well for whom I do not have any great time, local authority members must have a genuine say on behalf of the people who elect them. The local authority members must have more of a say about the powers included in this Bill. It strikes me that people who are genuinely affected will have no recourse to an independent appeal other than through judicial review. We all are aware of the cost of judicial review. It is an enormous task to ask anybody to go the route of a judicial review if he or she has a grievance against a piece of critical infrastructure that is being put in place.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryMWhite" eId="spk_150">
          <from>Ms White</from>
          <p eId="para_306">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Roche, back to the House and wish him the best of luck during Second Stage of this Bill. As he stated in his speech yesterday, our planning system works well at the local level and in the local framework. It is up to date and it is ideal for that, but it does not work adequately for infrastructure which brings a major public benefit to a wider area or to the entire community. That is why we need to bring forward the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill in the Seanad. It represents one of the most important Bills of his career as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The Bill represents a major evolution of the planning code to meet the demands of a modern State. It will use the experience and competence of An Bord Pleanála, which already deals with many major types of infrastructure, including motorways, and can be expected to give the same robust examination to the projects covered by the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">The new legislation is needed to ensure the continued economic development of our country in a sustainable manner. Ireland is regularly criticised by international consultants, and recently by the OECD, to the effect that our infrastructure is not up to date and has not been able to cater for our increasing population, the return of our diaspora and the many thousands of immigrants. There are major gaps in our critical infrastructure and they pose a significant threat to the country's sustained growth, to the environment and to the standard of living people have rightly come to expect of a modern 21st century economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The Bill is of fundamental importance to our economy. We cannot run a modern economy on 20th century infrastructure. We need to find ways to move millions of people to work and to school every day, as the Minister stated in his speech, without having to spend hours in their cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I want to focus on two particular types of infrastructure. The specific types of infrastructure listed in the Bill will be eligible to come within a single step application process to An Bord Pleanála. The board itself will decide if they are of strategic importance having regard to the criteria, which are listed in the Bill. The Bill will take over responsibility from the Minister for Transport for deciding on rail orders, heavy rail, light rail and the metro. Importantly, as was stated already here this morning, major electricity transmission lines will be subject to a special consent process direct to An Bord Pleanála. The Bill will also be amended to include consent for strategic gas pipelines. We all know how much controversy the Corrib gas pipeline has caused in the affected local area in County Mayo and that will be an important measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">I totally support another point the Minister made in his speech, that the decisions will be made for the overall benefit of the country and of the people in the country, but I want to put on the record here again today the bizarre planning going on in the Poolbeg peninsula in Dublin. An environmental impact statement is being undertaken currently on the proposal to build an incinerator on the Poolbeg peninsula. As I said to the Minister privately, I would have had no problem with this if the Dublin eastern bypass had been built. The bypass should ideally take the form of a tunnel and a feasibility study is under way in this regard. It should go underground at Sandymount Strand and merge with the port tunnel. It was wrong to locate the incinerator in the Poolbeg peninsula because it is more or less a cul-de-sac. I travelled the roads there three or four times daily for 16 years. I drove along Bath Avenue, South Lotts Road, Strand Road and Merrion Road and they were congested back then. They were originally designed to service villages such as Sandymount, Ringsend and Irishtown and they cannot cope with the traffic nowadays, particularly trucks. I saw a child being knocked off his bicycle and killed by a truck at the Ringsend Road junction.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">The incinerator will convert domestic refuse from the four Dublin local authorities through thermal treatment. It is estimated this refuse will be brought in and out of Poolbeg using 400 trucks every day. There is no rationale to this planning. I have no personal grievance with members of Dublin City Council on this matter and I have sympathy for them because of the position they are in. However, a total of 2,500 residential units and 1,500 sq ft in office space are expected to be constructed on Poolbeg peninsula, increasing the local population by 6,500.</p>

          <p eId="para_315">Poolbeg will become a mini-city. This is bizarre planning. The waste to thermal treatment system is fair if the refuse used in the incinerator is strictly domestic. However, my rationale for supporting the local residents is the existing road infrastructure will not cope with the increased traffic.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">I wish the Minister the best of luck with the legislation. It is a great tribute to him. As he stated yesterday, it will be one of the most significant Bills he will introduce in his term of office.</p>

        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_154">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_317">I refer to the need for additional staff in An Bord Pleanála and in the planning departments of local authorities. Senator Burke made sense when he commented on the need for forward planning. If we plan adequately and properly ahead, many of the problems that arise currently could be eliminated. For example, Ballon, County Carlow, is crying out for a bypass to the east of the town. I was trying to impress on the council officials in Carlow recently the need to earmark land for a bypass but they would not do so. Unfortunately, this land will be built on and the bypass will proceed in ten or 20 years, at which point the local residents will go bananas because they will not want the road. However, if the locals knew now that the road would be built and land was set aside for that purpose, it would eliminate numerous problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">I concur with Senator Burke's comments on rezoning. Not enough rezoning was undertaken in Dublin in the past. "Rezoning" has become a bad word lately but it should not be regarded as such. If I am asked by a new councillor what is his or her main job, I tell him or her it is to make sure adequate rezoning is undertaken. Last Monday, I walked around Carlow town with a constituent. She is a mother who is keen to have a new park built in a different part of the town. We examined potential sites and, hopefully, I will meet the director of planning for the area and engage in the planning process. The park might not be built for five or ten years but, at least, we are planning ahead. A park was built on an estate in the town recently but there was uproar because the residents did not want it. However, if the park had been earmarked from day one, there would have been no difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Local authority planning departments and An Bord Pleanála need more staff. The condition of a number of planning departments is shocking. For example, the reception area of the planning department in Carlow must be the worst in the State. It is a big block of wood and one must ring a bell to contact a planner. I appreciate the pressure they are under and the difficulties they have but the departments should be more user friendly. I have no problem with the planning staff but they should be more hospitable and amenable to the public. Some people find these departments intimidating, as do public representatives, because of the decor. Perhaps local authority staff should undertake <i>feng shui</i> courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">I dealt with the planning staff of Kerry County council recently and I could not get over how professional they were. They might have a bad name because of section 4 referrals and so on but I was impressed by the access I had to maps. I was able to click on a screen and find out whether planning permission had been granted or refused in an area. This electronic system has not been standardised throughout the State. Resources for planning departments should be beefed up and they should become more user friendly for the public and the staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Many councillors have done significant work on planning and rezoning land over the years, which resulted in individual becoming very wealthy, yet they did not even receive as much as a telephone call afterwards thanking them for doing so. There has been much publicity recently about councillors taking money for rezoning but many of them got nothing, yet their work benefitted the local area significantly and provided people with housing and so on. Not every councillor receives a brown envelope while rezoning land and I will stand over that comment.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">I recently attended a meeting with planners in Tullow, County Carlow, which is near the Minister's constituency. Planning permission has been granted for a new estate comprising 140 houses near the town on a bad stretch of road. I pointed out to the planners that I am always bemused driving past new industrial estates. When such estates are constructed, roads are built first, followed by footpaths, lighting and so on with the industrial units built during the final phase. It is a pity the same model is not followed for housing estates, where the reverse occurs. The houses are built first and the rest of the infrastructure is provided subsequently or, in some cases, not at all. There is an onus on local authorities to be specific when granting planning permission by sequencing the order in which estates and so on should be constructed. People often apply for planning permission and, when it is granted, sell it to another developer. Everyone then is at the mercy of the developer regarding whether he or she complies with the planning permission.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">A member of staff of every local authority should travel around monitoring planning permissions while buildings are under construction, not afterwards. Every Member has spoken to a planning enforcement officer after the event. It is next to impossible to get a conviction or to have a problem rectified. However, if somebody in the council could monitor and supervise building projects to ensure planning permission is observed, there would be less difficulty down the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">I am one of the few members of my party in favour of incineration. It is time we got real on this matter. I am delighted Ringsend is to get an incinerator as it is about time Dublin took responsibility for its own waste. Counties outside of Dublin should not have to handle its waste. Some people think that Carlow, Kildare and Meath are ideal dumping grounds. There is an onus on all of us to manage our waste. Putting an incinerator in Ringsend may bring home to the people of Dublin the reality that the waste they produce must be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Some people think that recycling costs nothing and have no idea of the very significant costs involved. It is not free and there is little market for it. There may be local issues, such as the inadequacy of the roads, etc., to deal with in the case of Ringsend. However, it is time to get real and become mature on the issue as we are over 80 years old as a State. We should look at alternatives to landfills which are not good. I have yet to meet anybody in favour of extending or putting in a new landfill. I see incinerators as a last resort. I agree we must reduce, reuse and recycle, but we will still have waste to get rid of and should consider the incinerator approach. If we explain the issue properly to people, they will appreciate it better.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Perhaps this Bill will address the concerns. Many infrastructural projects have been held up for ridiculous reasons by certain factions. The hold-up in the Glen of the Downs was a classic case which got much media exposure. When the road was completed, nobody could understand what the original problem was, but at the time when people turned on their televisions for the evening news, they would have thought very tree in the country was to be chopped down. I admit that my cousin is an eco-warrior and may have been up one of those trees. We all have family members with whose views we do not necessarily agree. I am sure she would not agree with mine.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">I welcome the Bill and hope it goes well. I was in Spain recently with members of the Joint Committee on Transport and was amazed by its system whereby the State owns all land more than 10 ft underground, which enables it to complete projects quicker than we do. The public and taxpayers here are sick and tired of seeing projects fall behind schedule and going way over costs. While there must be a balance with respect to the rights of individuals, we cannot afford to continue for years with High Court and Supreme Court actions that ultimately benefit only the lawyers, while the public must continue to put up with substandard transport facilities. I welcome the Bill. Hopefully, it will help to improve infrastructure in the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire chuig an Teach chun an Bille tábhachtach seo a phlé. I compliment the Minister on this major legislation which will have significant benefit. The issue has needed to be addressed for some time and the Minister has been innovative in tackling it, particularly through the arrangement for the President of the High Court to ensure there will be designated judges in the court to deal with what are often complex issues in planning. Hopefully the legislation will streamline the process and avoid the major delays we have seen as a result of court cases, particularly those dealing with public projects. These delays have added considerably to the overall costs of projects and been a huge burden on taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">I welcome the Bill because there is a need for major projects of strategic importance to be considered in a particular way. I have noticed from applications that have come before local authorities that often there is not sufficient expertise within each authority to deal with complex or technical issues. Often there is a reliance on consultants. This is something about which I have some qualms as consultants are not part of the public process. It is undesirable, therefore, to give them a pivotal role in planning applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I note that the engagement of consultants can be extended beyond public sector projects to those that come in from the private sector. It is important that there should be a <i>pro bono publico</i> benefit or application to any such projects permitted by this legislation. Straightforward commercial projects that do not serve the public good should go through the normal local planning process with the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">I have a particular concern with regard to environmental impact statements. I have been at the other end of the planning application process on occasion and have seen these statements produced at huge cost by consultants. Consultants will give clients whatever answer they want. I have seen these statements prepared in support of projects and have seen the same consultants prepare a contrary opinion in support of projects of a similar nature. This brings the integrity of the statements into question. A burden is placed on commercial enterprises to engage consultants at significant expense to produce environmental impact statements, often for relatively minor projects. One often wonders whether these statements are necessary. Sometimes the local authority requests them in order to cover itself. This is an area that needs to be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I welcome the general thrust of the Bill which takes the right direction. I hope that on Committee Stage the Minister will be amenable to looking at other areas of the planning code that may need strengthening or simplifying. It is an anomaly that An Bord Pleanála operates to no timescale whereas local government must operate to strict timescales. An Bord Pleanála has a type of "wish" period of four months to give decisions, but there is no statutory compulsion to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">With regard to the board, will the Minister look at its function and role? Rather than expanding the board, perhaps he should give consideration to its role in regard to small projects such as extensions to houses. Perhaps he could remove the right to appeal to An Bord Pleanála and include the right to appeal to the local authority. This might simplify the system. A body in Dublin with a national remit that focuses on major infrastructural and strategic projects should not adjudicate on minor applications involved in an appeal process. This area should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">There are other areas and minor issues that could be simplified. For example, if somebody is refused planning permission and reapplies within six months, a yellow notice must be put on the site. It is hard to substantiate the need for it to be yellow. Why can it not be an ordinary notice? On the need for applicants to publish their application in a local newspaper, a simpler approach would be to remove that requirement and, instead, require the local authority to publish the list of applications on a weekly basis. These would be more likely to be seen by the public because people would see them together on one page and could go through them to see if any was of special interest for them. Perhaps the Minister will take this opportunity to deal with issues such as this to simplify the code.</p>

        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_158">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_337">I welcome the Minister to the House and commend him on the introduction of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill 2006. This Bill will help to drive the Celtic tiger to new heights by laying the foundation upon which enterprise can build. The Minister is making good his commitment to tackle bottlenecks in our economy, to enhance competitiveness, to improve the quality of life and to protect the environment. The Bill is a major step forward towards a streamlined planning system that can respond to the changing needs of a rapidly growing economy and society.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Every delay incurred in dealing with an infrastructural project adds to the cost of providing infrastructure. The establishment of a dedicated strategic construction division in An Bord Pleanála is an innovative approach to ensuring that key projects are delivered ahead of schedule and within budget. I am sure the Minister was so frustrated with the Glen of the Downs project in his constituency that he decided when he got into his current position to try to bring some Bill forward to speed up such projects which have been badly affected from the point of view of cost, delays and safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">I ask the Minister to confirm whether, as Senator Jim Walsh suggested, major private sector projects could be brought under the remit of this Bill. If that is the case, I suggest that the proposed three-stage development by Newfound Consortium at Lough Key forest park is a project for which a fresh application could be made. As the Minister is aware from representations made to him, the first phase consisting of a 100-bed hotel and 27 holiday homes was rejected by An Bord Pleanála. The second phase, consisting of 78 holiday homes was also rejected. The third phase, comprising a golf course and 200 holiday homes is before An Bord Pleanála for decision. A project of that type, with a beautiful golf course close to the Lough Key forest park would be of great benefit to the people of the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Statements have been made by Senator Feighan regarding officials in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I will not name any officials but I ask the Minister to ensure that all officials make declarations of interest. I further ask him to check the declarations of interest of two officials in his Department who have had an input into the recommendation to refuse permission for the Lough Key forest park project. This is affecting the economy of County Roscommon and has major implications for the people of that county.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">This is a small country and, unfortunately, too many people know too many people. If a person has a house in Boyle, County Roscommon, overlooking Lough Key, then he or she should make a declaration of interest to the Department stating whether he or she had any involvement in the decision to turn down this project, particularly if that person made a statement to the effect that no development would take place adjacent to——</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_377">I will do my best to comment on the points raised by Senators in the four or five minutes remaining. To take the last point first, the proposals for the forest park are private and would not be affected by this Bill in any way. If Senator Leyden or any other Senator believes that any official in my Department has behaved improperly, there are ways other that the debate on this Bill to raise their concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The National Competitiveness Council in its recent annual report pointed out that, in terms of investment and infrastructure, Ireland is now ranked 13th out of 16 developed countries. That is a position that we, as a progressive, modern, forward-looking economy cannot tolerate. Many Senators on both sides of the House spoke thoughtfully on the Bill and I mention in particular the contribution by Senator Quinn. He acknowledged the difficult decisions that have to be made and I agree with him on that. Getting the balance right, as mentioned by Senator Bradford, is crucial. I agree with Senators Quinn and Bradford that getting the balance right is exactly what this Bill is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">This legislation is putting the public interest to the fore and all too frequently that is left out debates. Senators Coghlan, Maurice Hayes, Phelan and Browne expressed concerns about the resources available to An Bord Pleanála. I assure the House I have been in discussions with the board on the issue of resources. Significant additional resources have been allocated for 2006 and the board is content with the resources at its disposal. Senator Browne also mentioned the issue of resources for individual local planning authorities. The important point is that this Bill will shift onerous, large-scale projects into the remit of An Bord Pleanála, which will come as a relief to the local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Senator Maurice Hayes welcomed the development of a central competence within the board. That is why I chose to have the strategic focus within the board, rather than setting up a separate body. Senator Norris was not confident of the board's competence, which is a little unfair. There is significant competence within the board, which has been amply demonstrated and it is not right to adopt an <i>à la carte</i> attitude to An Bord Pleanála, praising it when it agrees with our particular prejudices and then criticising it when it does not.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">Senator Ryan made an interesting point with regard to the tremendous improvement in the handling of road development, about which he is correct. That has come about as a result of Government decisions in 2000 to amend the process. This Bill simply extends that improved system and its economic and social benefits to other strategic infrastructural projects. If Senator Ryan welcomes the improvement for roads, I trust he will also welcome the improvement for other infrastructural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Senator McCarthy demonstrated an imperfect understanding of the Bill and its intent. He suggested, as did others, that the Bill removes the local democratic element from the planning system but nothing could be further from the truth. Since 1963 planning rules have specifically excluded elected councillors from making interventions in individual planning cases. Planning decisions are an Executive function. This is the first legislation in 43 years to write the councillors back into the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">A number of Senators made reference to the Poolbeg incinerator and asked why it will not come under the remit of the Bill. The answer to that is simple. Any planning application which is under way when the Bill comes into operation will not be covered. The Bill will not have retrospective application. Broadband was mentioned by Senators Paddy Burke and McCarthy but it is not affected by the Bill in any way.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">A number of Senators raised the issue of balanced regional development and referred to rail and other projects. I agree that this Bill will be critical in developing balanced regional infrastructure. The problem we have had to date is that the roll-out of the infrastructure can take an inordinate amount of time. In that context, a number of Senators raised the case of the Glen of the Downs road project, which is a classic example. Extraordinary claims were made in that case. People who are now in politics in this country have never apologised for misleading the public. People were saying that every tree in the glen would be cut down and there was a genuine belief that this would happen. The project was held up for the best part of two years, tens of millions of euro were added to the cost of the project and who paid? The taxpayer and the people who were stuck in their cars paid. Senator Browne made that point and one could apply it to a number of other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">A number of Senators expressed concern about sustainable rural housing guidelines and their application. That is obviously not dealt with by this Bill but I wish to make a point which touches on courtesy and the way local authorities operate. I am keeping the implementation of the rural planning guidelines under close observation. They are not something that can be applied as a <i>desideratum </i>by planning officials. They apply and must be applied uniformly across the country. I will keep a close eye on this matter and if Members know of individual cases where they believe the guidelines are being breached, I would be delighted to hear from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">I have also published draft development management guidelines. These will deal with issues such as good manners and management, consistency of approach, and good communications, all of which we expect from the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">On the issue of the value of a substratum, section 33 will value land 10 m or more below the surface of that land at nil. It is a progressive and positive provision which works, as several Senators observed, in Spain and elsewhere. It should work well in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Senator Finucane wrongly suggested that it is generally impossible to get planning permission for major projects. Exaggerating the problem is not the best way to finding a solution for it. Some 83% of planning applications are granted and up to 60% are decided by eight weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Although much good work has been done in the planning process, I am the first to accept there is room for improvement. Legislation alone will not fulfil our demands for infrastructural development. However, without a strong and certain framework for processing modern infrastructural applications, certainty in projects will not be assured. The Bill is part of an overall jigsaw that incorporates funding and structural innovations.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Senators referred to the role of the courts in the planning process. I cannot legislate for the courts as they set their arrangements. It is recognised that large improvements have occurred in the High Court's process for dealing with planning matters, particularly with the advent of the Commercial Court. The courts have shown themselves to be innovative in this area. I am certain that if we, as legislators, do our business, the Judiciary will do its.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I thank Members for their contributions. In the short time that was available, I could not, as I like to, deal with each individual contribution. We can deal with those various matters in more detail on Committee Stage.</p>

        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_198">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_395">I am delighted to attend the House again to update Members on the progress of the public service decentralisation programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I will begin by reiterating the Government's commitment to the full implementation of the programme. Since I last addressed the House on the matter I am happy to report that a number of key developments have taken place and that real progress is being made on all fronts. Significant numbers of civil servants will move this year under the programme as a result of these developments. Decentralisation for those who have volunteered will soon become a reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">One of the aspects all commentators acknowledge is the scale of the implementation task. This ambitious programme involves the relocation of over 10,300 public servants to 58 towns outside Dublin. Over 50 civil and public service organisations are included in the programme. It touches on many of our most important public services and includes the relocation of ministerial offices and the headquarters of eight Departments. It is a challenging objective but one which I, my colleagues in Government and the members of the decentralisation implementation group are increasingly confident the public service can deliver, and deliver well.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Many aspects of the programme are worth re-emphasising. This is a popular programme with many people expressing an interest in either relocating in their current position or transferring to a new organisation that is moving out of Dublin. We now have over 10,600 applications from civil and public servants who wish to relocate.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">The central applications facility continues to receive new applications every week. In all, more than 1,500 people have applied on the central applications facility for decentralisation since the closing date for priority applications. It is anticipated that interest will increase further as building and movement timetables firm up.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Site or building negotiations have been completed in 13 locations. Contracts have been received for an additional ten locations. Suitable sites have been identified in a further 15 locations and negotiations to acquire have either commenced or are close to commencement in these locations. By this time next year, the Office of Public Works anticipates that builders will be on site in 16 locations. Each location requires a brief of requirements to be agreed with the organisation concerned, site selection to be concluded, detailed tender specifications to be drawn up and a public procurement process to be completed. As we all know, the purchasing of land, sites and buildings is not an area that allows for definite dates to be set in stone. In this regard, the OPW is currently reviewing its indicative dates for completion of building in light of its experience to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">In addition to the progress made in negotiating permanent solutions in many locations, I am delighted to see that a number of organisations are being progressive in seeking advance or temporary accommodation to facilitate early moves. These developments will greatly assist the decentralising Departments in taking in many of the civil servants who are currently based in provincial locations, thus giving the organisation a foothold in the location.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Discussions are continuing, and indeed have progressed, on a number of human resource and industrial relations issues. Actual movement of staff within and between Departments and offices is now under way, with over 1,200 staff already assigned to posts which will decentralise.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">All Departments and offices have produced implementation plans setting out the detailed arrangements they are putting in place to plan for relocation while also ensuring business continuity and effective delivery of services to customers. The plans are comprehensive and their preparation involved detailed reviews of business processes as well as the logistics of the move. During the latter half of last year the implementation group held a series of meetings with Secretaries General of Departments involved in the programme to discuss the planning framework in place, assess progress to date and hear about the challenges arising and steps proposed to address them. Following this round of discussions, in a recent interview I understand the chairman of the group confirmed his earlier view that senior civil servants are leading the implementation of this programme in a professional and carefully planned manner and, at the same time, are availing of opportunities to improve both their business processes and their delivery of services in conjunction with decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">We must remember also that decentralisation is nothing new to the Civil Service. At present there are in excess of 13,000 civil servants working in a variety of locations outside Dublin. Members are probably aware of the successful decentralisation of Revenue's collection services, the payments sections of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the finance areas of the Department of Agriculture and Food. While not on the same scale as the current programme, these were significant movements. The learning from these previous moves has built up an expertise in inducting large numbers of new staff, the effective transfer of knowledge and skills and ensuring quality customer service in the transition phase. This learning is proving invaluable in planning and executing the current programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The initial timescale mooted for the decentralisation programme was, quite rightly, an ambitious one. That initial timeframe has been very helpful as a catalyst for progress. The initial focus on a three-year period has greatly assisted in getting preparations off the ground quickly and has been a key factor in delivering the progress evident to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Departments are following the implementation group's approach to phasing arrangements for the programme, which makes sense. The group identified 21 Civil Service locations across 17 counties for the first phase of moves. These locations were selected on the basis of an assessment of progress on property acquisition, numbers applying and business readiness to move. The selection was also informed by the implementation plans prepared by each organisation, and the group's recommendations were accepted by the Government. This is a practical, sensible approach and is not in any way a reflection on the Government's commitment to the overall programme, as some commentators have suggested. While on this point I must say I have been astounded at the inaccuracy of some of the commentary on the programme and the distortion of figures by various people.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Indicative timeframes on a further 24 Civil Service locations, which were not announced in the first phase of moves, were provided by the group in its June 2005 report. However, the programme should not be seen as divided into discrete phases. While the most immediate preparations may take place in organisations with early mover status, the remaining organisations will also continue to plan their business, staffing and property solutions in readiness for moving.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Decentralisation is already a reality in a number of locations. People have moved and more will follow. Advance moves have already taken place to date to Sligo, Portlaoise, Thurles, Tipperary town and Na Forbacha, in Galway. As mentioned above, there are over 1,200 individuals <i>in situ</i> in posts that will relocate both during this year and in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">On current indications, the implementation group anticipates that by the end of 2009, almost 7,000 civil and public servants will have relocated under the programme. The managing of moves within this timeframe is a complex task involving a large number of interrelated elements. I am none the less confident that the implementation group will continue to monitor the programme to ensure there are no undue slippages or delays and that, if they arise, they are properly managed.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The issue of effective transfer of knowledge and skills is central to business continuity in the transition phase. A central feature of planning to date is the documentation of business processes in preparation for transfer of knowledge to, and the training of, new staff. The Department of Finance publishes monthly figures on its website showing that staff are now being actively assigned to decentralising posts. The early assignment of staff, on a phased basis, should be a priority for organisations to ensure they balance the pace of integration with their business needs and customer service obligations. The good lead-in time recognises that in many cases only a small number of staff are moving with their present jobs and that there must be adequate time to build up expertise in new staff. This has been done successfully in previous rounds of decentralisation and I am confident it will happen again this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Each early-mover organisation is canvassing those who have expressed a second or lower preference for particular locations. This is allowing opportunities for staff to change their first preference to an early-mover location where that location is undersubscribed. Movement right across the Civil Service has been a feature of previous successful decentralisation programmes. Recent media references to only one in nine staff moving with their posts as part of this programme do not properly reflect the circumstances on the ground. This statistic is continuously being touted by those opposed to decentralisation, who are hell-bent on confusing everybody, including themselves.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_200" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_413">The simple fact is that when one takes account of the numbers of civil servants willing to change from their current Department or office to fill a post in the new location, the level of interest is very strong. This is particularly true in the case of the early-mover organisations. Staff new to a Department or office are being trained and this is being given high priority in the preparations.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">To suggest that the productivity and effectiveness of the Civil Service will be severely reduced as a result of the number of officers unwilling to relocate with their current post is to do a great disservice to the ability, commitment and dedication of the officers willing to transfer into a new Department. It also underestimates the professionalism of the management of the Departments who are ultimately accountable for the performance of their organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Some people seem to forget, because it suits their cause, that new staff bring with them their own experiences, skills and enthusiasm that will undoubtedly stand them and their new Department in good stead. There will also be new recruits to the Civil Service who will receive the usual induction and other appropriate training.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">The implementation group is paying close attention to developments in the information and communications technology, ICT, area and will continue to do so over the coming months. The group has specified the need for detailed planning of the decentralisation of ICT jobs by individual bodies. This planning is ongoing and has been supported by the Centre for Management and Organisation Development in the Department of Finance, which is providing assistance and guidance to ICT managers across the Civil Service. Industrial relations matters relating to this programme are dealt with by the Department of Finance. Discussions have allowed progress to be made on a number of human resources and industrial relations issues which have laid the groundwork for the assignment of staff from the CAF to the decentralising organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Discussions also are continuing between public service management and staff interests in other areas. One will be aware of some of the issues to be addressed in respect of professional and technical staff, who represent about 10% of the total number of posts decentralising. While the professional and technical grades are not a large part of the early-mover cadre, their positions are more complex than those of members of the general Civil Service. The number of applications from these grades has been lower than in the general Civil Service grades. Added to this is the fact that, historically, there has been less flexibility to transfer to posts in other organisations where a particular professional or technical grade is not represented. Discussions between the Department of Finance and the relevant unions are continuing.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">The other main issue which requires attention at this stage is that of State agencies. The implementation group recommended, in its report of November 2004, that seven State agencies receive initial priority attention in terms of implementation of the programme while still ensuring progress for the remaining organisations. Between them, these seven State agencies represent around 720 posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Members will be aware that a number of issues concerning the movement of State agencies have still to be resolved. In particular, they will have heard of the current industrial relations position in FÁS. The Labour Court recently recommended that the matter be referred back to the appropriate central body. Such central discussions would allow the issues to be teased out with a view to arriving at agreed long-term solutions. I strongly support the full utilisation of the existing industrial relations structures by all parties involved and I believe this represents the best way forward. I therefore urge all the parties to engage in central discussions as recommended by the Labour Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The staff remaining in Dublin are key to the success of the decentralisation programme. Moves of Dublin staff to Dublin posts have already taken place on a bilateral basis as posts became vacant through draw-down from the CAF. Arrangements are now in place to allow the reassignment, within Dublin, of staff whose posts are being decentralised and who themselves wish to remain in Dublin. A facility has been established through the Public Appointments Service to allow staff remaining in Dublin to express preferences as to the organisation in which they would like to work. This will be an ongoing process throughout the transition phase of the programme and progress in this priority area will be monitored continually over the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">I assure the House that the property costs of the programme are being managed professionally by the OPW. The objective is that the property acquired at regional level will be matched over time in cost terms by the disposal of property currently held in Dublin. At the request of the group, the Department of Finance has issued guidelines to Departments and offices on the capture of data on non-property costs, including transition costs such as those associated with knowledge transfer and training, as well as any ongoing costs and savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I reassure the House that the implementation of the decentralisation programme is proceeding well. It is a popular programme involving over 10,600 applications from civil and public servants who want to move from Dublin or their existing provincial locations. Interested civil and public servants continue to submit new applications every week. The property elements of the programme are proceeding very well, with negotiations completed or significantly advanced by the OPW in 23 locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">A number of human resource and industrial relations issues have been progressed allowing the assignment of decentralising staff within and between Departments and offices. Implementation plans have been prepared, setting out the detailed arrangements Departments and offices are putting in place to plan for relocation, while also ensuring business continuity and effective delivery of services to customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I hope I have given a good indication of progress to date. I and the Government remain satisfied that the decentralisation programme will be delivered.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_201">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_425">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am surprised he is satisfied given the debate we had on the roll-out of decentralisation in the Chamber after the announcement of budget 2004. I can safely say that in my time in politics, I have never seen a more arrogant attempt by the Government to con the population than the decentralisation programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">I am forthright in my commitment to the ideal of decentralisation. Fine Gael is fully supportive of the objective. The Minister of State struck the nail on the head when he stated the programme is popular, involving over 10,600 civil and public servants who want to move from Dublin or their existing provincial location. Moving from one's existing provincial location is not decentralisation in any form. A number of public servants are willing to move from Dublin, which I welcome because it is the objective of the programme and represents what we all believe decentralisation to be. However, moving a civil or public servant from an office in Tullamore to an office in Portlaoise is not decentralisation, and could not be understood to be such by anyone. It is a complete misrepresentation of the whole process.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">It is quite clear that the Government's efforts in this regard are a shambles. In budget 2004 we were presented with a timeframe. The Minister of State referred to it and said the initial timescale mooted for the programme was, quite rightly, an ambitious one. What a load of rubbish. During the debate on decentralisation, he outlined his commitment to ensuring the timetable would be honoured. Every Opposition spokesperson said it was completely unrealistic but he and Senators on the Government benches said the opposite. When did the realisation dawn on the Minister of State and his Government colleagues that the timescale that was announced in budget 2004 was nothing other than a ball of smoke? The dogs in the street knew that the Government could not live up to the timescale that was announced. There were negligible levels of consultation with the public and civil servants who were involved in the decentralisation programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">The Government's plans to pursue the programme were announced in the farcical Budget Statement of December 2003, which was the last budget to be presented to the Dáil by the former Minister, Mr. McCreevy. On that occasion, he did not announce much more than the decentralisation programme, which was designed with an eye on the local and European elections which were to take place the following June. It is clear that the Government's plan did not work then and I do not see how it will work now. The Government announced its decentralisation plans a number of months after the publication of the national spatial strategy. As the decentralisation programme did not bear any resemblance to the spatial strategy, it was holed below the waterline before it got started. When the decentralisation programme was announced, I asked the Minister of State to explain why it did not bear any resemblance to the spatial strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">The Minister of State spoke about the buildings and sites at certain locations which have been identified or purchased or are in the process of being identified or purchased. He did not refer to the ludicrous case of the relocation of the Department of Defence. A site in Newbridge that will cost €4 million or €5 million has been earmarked for the Department, even though the OPW owns the site of the former McKee Barracks a couple of miles away in Kildare town. Most of the 65 acres in question are lying vacant. I am sure a suitable location for the new headquarters of the Department of Defence could have been located at the site the Department owns at the Curragh Camp. The land in question, which extends to over 700 acres, is just a few miles from Newbridge. It does not seem to make much sense that the Department is so keen to purchase a hugely expensive new site in Newbridge.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">It seems that the process of property acquisition is at a different stage in each of the 26 locations which have been earmarked for the decentralisation programme. The purchase of the sites and buildings in question will cost approximately €50 million and a further €300 million will be needed to kit them out fully. The Minister of State said he hopes the sale of lands, sites and offices in Dublin will cover the costs associated with the purchase and construction of buildings to house the civil and public servants who are being transferred to new locations throughout the country. It is clear to anyone with a limited knowledge of the property market that the Minister's ambitions in this regard are unlikely to be realised. The completion of the decentralisation programme will cost much more than the amount of money that will accrue from the sale of offices in the capital city which currently house Departments or Government agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">When they are discussing the decentralisation programme, Ministers and Ministers of State often conveniently forget to mention that 60% of the locations which are described as "early mover" locations under the programme are towns and cities in the Dublin commuter belt. That those who will be decentralised to such locations will not go to key unemployment black spots outside the eastern region clearly flies in the face of the decentralisation programme's objectives, as outlined when the programme was first mooted.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">While I understand the Minister of State's comments about the potential loss of expertise, I disagree with them completely. If a person who has been working in a section of a Department for a number of years, building up a level of expertise in a specific area in the process, chooses not to stay in the section in question when it is relocated down the country, it is quite obvious that his or her expertise will be lost. The Minister of State rightly pointed out that new people will bring new ideas and, perhaps, increased enthusiasm to such sections but I do not think the Government has fully acknowledged that existing expertise will be lost in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The Minister of State also referred to the ongoing difficulties with the relocation of FÁS to Birr. I was under the impression that all the civil and public servants who are due to relocate to counties Laois and Offaly were delighted to be moving to Parlon country, but apparently that is not the case as things stand. Recent media reports indicated that just six members of the staff of FÁS want to relocate to Birr. That is not unusual. None of the 93 staff of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, none of the 178 staff of Fáilte Ireland, one of the 90 staff of the National Roads Authority, two of the Public Appointment Service's 100 staff, five of the 100 staff of the Valuation Office, nine of the 110 staff of the Health and Safety Authority, which is due to be decentralised to Thomastown in my home county of Kilkenny, 15 of the 210 staff of Ordnance Survey Ireland and 19 of the 300 staff of Enterprise Ireland have applied to participate in the decentralisation programme. Such statistics, which are not unusual, contradict what the Minister of State has told the House and what the Government continues to tell the public about the decentralisation programme. A response to a recent parliamentary question indicated that just 224 of the 1,300 people who work in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, or 17% of them, have applied to decentralise.</p>

Many of them have never worked in Dublin. When I spoke with Senator Mansergh earlier, he correctly referred to the relocation of an office of Teagasc at Oak Park in Carlow as a fantastic example of decentralisation. Officials in other sections of Departments and Government agencies which have been decentralised over the years are already working outside Dublin. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, has shown his brass neck by telling the House that 10,600 people want to decentralise, given that most of them are not working in Dublin at present.</p>

          <p eId="para_441">The decentralisation programme that was announced has become a programme of relocation. If one examines the Minister of State's remarks today, one will notice that "relocation" is the key word that he used on many occasions. He mentioned "decentralisation" on a handful of occasions, preferring to refer to "relocation". It is a clear distortion of the original objectives of the programme as they were announced.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">Decentralisation is a good idea. I agree wholeheartedly with the objective of moving civil and public servants out of our choked-up capital city and into the regions. No amount of fudge or waffle from the Government can describe the current situation as being anything other than disastrous. It is clear that the programme announced by the former Minister, Mr. McCreevy, in budget 2004 is now up in a heap. When the Minister of State concludes this debate, perhaps he will shed some light on some of the issues I have raised, but I do not think he will be able to do so. It is quite clear that the Government's decentralisation strategy is in a complete mess, although I wish that was not the case. I honestly believe that many towns throughout the country which were promised jobs will never see those jobs because the decentralisation programme is such a shambles. A few months ago, Senator Bradford raised the proposed decentralisation of a particular agency to Mitchelstown in County Cork. He investigated the issue with the Department and found out that there were only 90 people working in that agency, yet the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, had the brass neck to announce that 110 positions would be created in the town. That particular relocation is not in the list of early movers and seems to have dropped off the radar completely. It is quite clear from the level of take-up for decentralisation in the Health and Safety Authority that its proposed move to Thomastown, County Kilkenny, is a long way off. I regret that because Thomastown could do with the lift that such a move would provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I wish the Government the best of luck in the task of decentralisation, but its representatives must start telling it as it is. They should be a bit more honest with the House and the public. They should not massage the figures as they have done today and as the Government continues to do on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_444">I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House. I congratulate them on the work they are doing in making this a reality. A reference was made to "brass neck". With the amount of Opposition and media flak around, the Minister of State might well need such a brass neck. He is doing very well and is showing much steadiness under fire, for which I compliment him.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The Minister of State's report was echoed by the chairman of the decentralisation implementation group, Mr. Finbarr Flood, when he addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 14 December 2005. He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_446">I am happy to report that real progress is being made on all fronts. Significant numbers of civil servants will move next year under the programme, with further large movement in 2007 and 2008. Decentralisation, for those who have volunteered, will soon become a reality.</p>

          <p eId="para_452">The situation is presented as if the glass is 98% empty, instead of looking at all the positive progress. My criticism is not only of the Opposition; it is also of the Dublin-based media which has presented a grossly distorted view of what is happening. Decentralisation may not be happening quite as fast as originally planned, but according to the newspapers, nothing has happened and the whole thing has been a shambles. In fact, a great deal of progress is taking place. A clear mandate was sought from the people and decentralisation was in the Fianna Fáil manifesto.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_454">This was subsequently put into the programme for Government. The manifesto stated that decentralisation would be to those towns which had some difficulty in attracting industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">There was only one passing reference to decentralisation in the national spatial strategy, which was mainly about the location of private services, industrial investment and so on. If one were to take the national spatial strategy as gospel, Tipperary would get no decentralisation at all as there is no hub or gateway in that county.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">There was a certain contradiction in what Senator Phelan said. He spoke about places of high unemployment, yet such places are not hubs or gateways. A complete shibboleth has been made of the national spatial strategy by a certain writer in <i>The Irish Times</i>. It was clearly set out from the beginning that decentralisation was a different process that was complementary to the national spatial strategy, but not identical to it. If previous programmes are taken into account, nearly every hub and gateway has already benefitted from decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">The degree of political negativity from the Opposition and from the Dublin-based media is slowing down and delaying the process. I do not doubt that Senator Phelan is in favour of the principle of decentralisation, but if an alternative Government was formed, what would be decided by those who are based in Dublin and who have expressed much hostility to decentralisation? It will be an issue at the next election.</p>

Such a scenario happened twice before. In 1981, a decentralisation programme was announced, but it was cancelled by the former Minister, Mr. John Bruton, whose brother is the finance spokesperson of Fine Gael. In 1982, decentralisation was again raised, but was again cancelled by the incoming Fine Gael and Labour Party coalition.</p>

          <p eId="para_477">An opinion poll in <i>The Irish Times</i> showed that two thirds of people were in favour of decentralisation, in spite of the all the negative media coverage. The country has developed in a very lop-sided fashion. The announcements on decentralisation have acted as a tremendous catalyst for development and growth. For example, the people of Tipperary town have not looked back since the decentralisation announcement was made. There is, as the Minister said, a small advance party which was not even part of the original decentralisation programme, namely, the 11 staff working in the Private Security Authority, in Tipperary town. They are working in temporary accommodation while permanent accommodation in an old barracks is being prepared.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">I strongly welcome the fact that the decentralisation of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to Tipperary town has moved up the list. It involves 186 posts in the Department. In December we were given an indicative date for construction to start in early 2007. A site has been acquired, although the legal formalities have still to be finalised, and the indicative date for construction completion is the end of 2008. Perhaps the Minister of State will confirm if that remains the situation. I understand that the decentralisation to other towns in Tipperary, mainly in north Tipperary, is proceeding well. The original decentralisation was the Garda College in Templemore and with the expansion of the Garda force I am sure employment there will grow by leaps and bounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">There is agreement across the floor that the Teagasc move to Carlow, which preceded the decentralisation programme, happened smoothly and without too many industrial relations problems. The problems that did arise were solved. The success of decentralisation partly depends on the terms and conditions on offer, particularly when there is a certain reluctance to move. Some flexibility and pragmatism are required to make it a success.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Recently I read a memoir by a doctor — the book could almost be in the category of religious literature — who was born in the South and lives in the North. He spent some time in Brazil. He says in the book, which was published only a few weeks ago, that if we think there are problems with decentralisation here, consider Brazil where Government departments had to move hundreds of miles inland from Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">Similarly, in Germany a large number of departments had to move from Bonn to Berlin some years after reunification. In France, the elite civil service training college, ENA, was shifted from Paris to Strasbourg, somewhat to the displeasure of some of the staff. A year or two ago, Mr. Gordon Brown, Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain, announced a wholesale decentralisation programme which was not on a voluntary basis. If people did not move, that was tough for them. That is not our ethos and I do not recommend it.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">However, Ireland is a reasonably compact country. People have referred to very experienced civil servants who are deeply committed to their Department. In those cases, if they believe in the value of what they are doing, they should seriously consider ways and means whereby they can work in the new location. People ought to be more open to the idea. I have difficulty understanding the development co-operation division of the Department of Foreign Affairs. People who work in that division have to be prepared to be posted to Lusaka, Lesotho, Timor-Leste or other such places but the barbaric jungle of Limerick appears to be a bridge too far.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">Communications are good in this country and are getting better. People have all sorts of flexible working relationships. There is no reason decentralisation should not work. It is in the interests of the country. People should try not to be too political about it. I plead with the Opposition to be a little more positive about the programme and to see the glass as half full instead of half empty. I also plead with the media to cease its gross propagandistic distortions of what is happening, which is purely pandering to a comfortable Dublin audience.</p>

          <p eId="para_487">The Minister has been wrong in many things too. People are not opposed to decentralisation but they are not stupid. They realise this is a sham. First, the programme should never have been announced in a budget speech. It had nothing to do with the budget. It just highlighted how empty the budget was of any news that the former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, had to include it in his Budget Statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Senator John Paul Phelan and Senator Mansergh referred to Teagasc. That decentralisation was included in the Budget Statement even though it had been completed already.</p>

        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_243">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_490">It shows how disingenuous the Government was and continues to be. It should not have been included in that speech. Thankfully, however, it came back to haunt the Minister later because the civil servants who were being decentralised used it as a precedent. There was a compensation package involved in the Teagasc case. People had no difficulty with the proposal to move Teagasc headquarters to Carlow and I, as a resident of Carlow, welcomed it. I hope we can build on it. Perhaps the empty business park that is only a few miles away from Teagasc headquarters will attract biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries which can link with the expertise in Teagasc and the two third level colleges in Carlow.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The decentralisation programme started badly and, unfortunately, has got worse. Nobody opposes decentralisation; Fine Gael does not oppose it. The problem, however, is that the programme was far too ambitious. I have spoken to people in Departments which have successfully decentralised sections in the past. They had to go outside their Department for personnel. It is not as simple as telling 200 people in an office in Dublin that they must all move to Wexford. That cannot happen because the 200 people have commitments and families where they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">The programme also showed how out of touch the Government is with reality. It seemed to think it was the 1950s and that the male in the family was the breadwinner, the female remained at home minding the children and there would be no problem in relocating. It forgot to take account of the fact that there might be two income earners in the family and that the other spouse might have an equally, if not more, successful career than the spouse who is obliged to move. That causes problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">The programme was badly conceived. The Government did not realise that for 10,000 people to move to the country it would have to go far outside that number to get the 10,000. There was no forward planning and we are now paying the price.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">There are two major aspects to decentralisation. The first, which the Government cannot get right, is the physical relocation of personnel. Already, deadlines have been missed. Last year I got information from the Minister as to when the decentralisation to Carlow would take place. Today, Deputy Hogan received information stating that it will be delayed by another year and in reality it could take a further year after that.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">While some people might think it was fantastic for the Government to decentralise part of a Department to Carlow, I wish to explain the true story. Representatives of Carlow had a fantastic package and offered the Government a prime site in the middle of the town, for which it would not have been possible to pay money. A group comprising Government and Opposition elected representatives met the Minister for Finance with a package offering fast-tracked planning permission if we were successful. The Government accepted our case as it was very good by comparison with other towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">While we are glad to have decentralisation to Carlow town, many civil servants moved to the town in anticipation of the Department coming. They are very disappointed that the deadline keeps moving. I appreciate that difficulties might exist in other parts of the country in getting personnel and other issues. However, this is not the case in Carlow town. There has been oversubscription for the section of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that is to relocate to Carlow. Will the Minister of State consider temporarily renting premises in Carlow while the permanent building is being built? People in Carlow will be very sceptical and cynical if they do not see developments. We have the required number of civil servants and, unfortunately, we also have an empty business park on the outskirts with an empty advance building, which could cater for the 300 civil servants due to come to Carlow.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Deadlines are being moved out and I appreciate there are delays in a building programme. It is now up to the Minister of State to indicate that he is prepared to move those civil servants in the agreed timeframe and in some cases move them to temporary premises while the permanent building is being built. This may be possible elsewhere, as many advance factories remain idle throughout the country. Carlow has one such advance building and may also have other suitable buildings.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">One of the aims of decentralisation is to deliver better public service. I am concerned that because the programme is so ambitious we will need to seek people from outside Departments, staff will need to be retrained and up-skilled, and we will lose much knowledge and expertise in Departments as people who cannot stay in a particular Department might opt out. They might leave the Civil Service and go to the private sector or go to a different Department and the taxpayer will be the ultimate loser. I reiterate the two points that must be addressed, namely, the physical relocation of Departments and agencies and the provision of a better public service. The ham-fisted approach of the Minister regarding a section of the Department of Foreign Affairs relocating to Limerick would not inspire confidence. Some people with specific and unique expertise might now leave the Civil Service following the handling of the decentralisation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">I ask the Minister of State about the lease arrangements for buildings now occupied by Departments. If a Department decentralises ahead of the expiration of the lease will the taxpayers end up paying for an unoccupied building in Dublin? Could the State be subject to penalties for overstaying in a building in Dublin?</p>
          <p eId="para_500">While Fine Gael is in favour of decentralisation, we would not have done it in the way the Government has. We would not have announced it in the Budget Statement, where it did not belong. Unfortunately the Minister of State is now ducking and diving as he is well used to since coming to office. He is running scared on many issues. Deadlines are being missed consistently.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Is the Minister of State prepared to temporarily relocate particular Departments and agencies, in particular the section of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to Carlow, to a different building while the permanent building is being built in light of the delay in the building programme?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelBrennan" eId="spk_244">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_502">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and his officials to the House, and thank him for taking this opportunity to discuss the Government's ambitious plan. I am aware of calls from various quarters for the rolling-back or postponing of the decentralisation programme, but it is not always clear why groups make such a call. If the call is for political reasons from political parties, let them say so. If the call is from vested interests, let them also set out why they object. I say this because the calls from Members opposite certainly cannot be based on either a lack of enthusiasm among public servants, or because the programme is in someway being imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Of course, the Minister of State, the Government, the Progressive Democrats and I all support the programme. More important than my support or that of anyone for the project, is the enthusiasm among pubic servants for decentralisation. This aspect is regularly and regrettably omitted from the debate. Almost all Departments are involved, either wholly or partly, in decentralisation. Some 10,000 applications have been made and new applications are being received every week. Since the closing of the application period in September 2004, I understand an average of 100 new applications have been received each month over the past 14 months. Such is the enthusiasm for the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">Unfortunately the numbers relating to decentralisation have been manipulated of late, I fear, to serve various agendas. We have had defective reporting of numbers within a particular Department wishing to relocate within that same Department and we have seen issues of internal problems within an agency being conflated with the overall project. This behaviour does not serve the Opposition, workers' representative groups, the Departments, the public servants themselves, or the towns that are earmarked for decentralised Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">It has been suggested that the programme is forcing some workers to relocate. I always understood the decentralisation programme to be entirely voluntary. Staff may opt to decentralise with their post or to another post in a decentralised location, or they may opt to remain in Dublin. It may be necessary to explain further to some people the difference between operational realities and so-called "promotional blackmail". However, that is surely a job forthe decentralisation implementation group. Responsibility to drive forward the implementation of the programme lies with the DIG, not with the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">I will conclude with a case study. As the Department of Finance has made clear, the potential benefits of decentralisation are immense. Existing civil servants seeking to leave Dublin, for example, in order to return to family and friends back home, or to acquire an affordable and comfortable family home within easy reach of their workplace, will have a broad range of options. It also seems likely that there will be a wider range of work and career opportunities for public servants already working outside Dublin. Present and future civil servants who aspire to senior management positions will no longer need to move to Dublin, although many may continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Pressures on traffic congestion and housing inflation in Dublin will be reduced and the programme will provide a very significant boost to local economies. For example, under the programme, the Revenue Commissioners will decentralise 50 posts to Newcastle West, County Limerick, and 20 or 30 spin-off jobs can also be expected. This may be worth more than €1.5 million directly to the local Newcastle West economy. The planned decentralisation to Newcastle West illustrates clearly the points I have outlined. The Revenue Commissioners have prepared and submitted an implementation plan for Newcastle West to the implementation group and this plan is being progressed. I understand analysis of first preferences applications from the central application facility indicated some 81 applicants for Newcastle West, which indicates no shortage of enthusiasm.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Internal information seminars regarding the transfer of work from the Office of the Collector General to the new locations in the mid-west region have been completed, and letters of offer for transfer to Newcastle West were issued to staff in June last year. Again, the information process was put in place and is working. I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, and his Department on accommodating the move. I understand the Commissioners of Public Works are considering tenders for the provision of offices under phase one of the decentralisation programme. I also believe the commissioners expect to have reached a decision on tenders as early as this month. My point is that decentralisation is not only welcome among public servants; many are crying out for it. They are fed up with living far from work and, most important, far from their extended families.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">Second, the towns identified for decentralisation look forward to welcoming new families to their communities and new workers to their economies. Political and vested-interest point-scoring is possible if one knocks the programme, but it should be avoided. We should commend the Minister of State on his role in accommodating the relocations and the decentralisation implementation group on its work in driving the project to a successful conclusion.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_245">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_510">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">I am pleased to have yet another opportunity to speak on decentralisation, an initiative which I fully support, since I believe it absolutely necessary from a social, economic and infrastructural perspective. However, it has been dreadfully mishandled by the current Administration and Minister. I tell the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, straight that he and his colleagues have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. When this programme was announced to a hushed Dáil on budget day some years ago, apart from the constituency announcements, there was a hope, expectation and, in some quarters, a belief that it would happen on time. However, no matter what way we twist or turn the figures, progress has been shockingly slow.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">On the politics of this question, I listened with interest to Senator Mansergh's contribution. He stated that he expected that decentralisation would become an election issue, something that he seemed to welcome. I join with him in that hope, since based on how the Government delivered on its commitment, the Minister and his colleagues will be judged very harshly. I accept that any Minister, Oireachtas Member or person examining public policy in this country must see the merits of decentralisation. However, the present programme is a litany of disaster and failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">Senator John Paul Phelan raised an issue in his opening remarks that I have brought up on many occasions, namely, that of Mitchelstown. Some 70 or 80 jobs in Dublin were to be transformed into 200 posts there. That is sadly indicative of the numerous announcements made, which I will not call false but mistaken. Thousands of public servants working in greater Dublin would be extremely interested in moving to more rural or peripheral locations; we must take that as given. However, the way in which the Administration announced the decentralisation programme showed that it was not well thought out. Now the Government is trying to push it through, and we are not meeting with any success.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">We must reflect on whence we have come and whither we mean to go. No matter how one considers the figures, the position in March 2006 is that the programme is simply not working. What the Minister of State's colleagues and he set out to do some years ago is simply not happening. If we go through the towns for which decentralisation was proposed, we see that many seem to have fallen from the list. Even in those where progress has apparently been made, which are on a list released some months ago, it has been extremely slow. We must reflect on what sort of decentralisation we practise.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">From the outset, many people had genuine concerns about the idea of moving departmental headquarters to the regions, and that issue must be examined. However, the inflexibility of the programme and difficulty in allowing people to transfer from one Department to another are among the big issues. If the Government had announced 20 or 25 towns where decentralisation was to be implemented, where it was interested in establishing agencies, offices of State or Departments, and waited for the response in regard to each, the picture would have been different.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">Let us take the example of Fáilte Ireland, part of which was scheduled to come to my local town of Mallow. We are advised that not a single staff member wishes to move there. Undoubtedly, there are hundreds of public servants around the country who would like to move to that region, but the difficulty is that one must marry them with the jobs on offer. We must look at this with much more flexibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">One way or another, within the next 15 or 16 months we will have a general election. The Minister of State will recall the words of his then senior colleague, former Deputy McCreevy, whom he almost beat to the post in publicising the news of decentralisation. Mr. McCreevy, when Minister, said that if the programme were not fully implemented by election day, it would prove a political failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">We already know that it will not be implemented in full, but leaving aside the politics, we must reconsider how it was designed to work and the idea of setting in stone what Department, office of State or semi-State board or group should move to a given town. That formula simply has not worked. There may be people working in Bus Éireann who might like to move out of Dublin but who are not interested in moving to Mitchelstown. There are some in Fáilte Ireland who might like to move out of Dublin but who do not wish to move to Mallow. Yet there are hundreds who would like to move to Mallow and hundreds who would like to move to Mitchelstown but who are unable to resolve that dilemma. We must re-examine what offices were planned for which areas and how we might introduce some flexibility to the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">I need hardly repeat that the concept of decentralisation is a very reasonable and worthy one that should be supported because of the many benefits that would flow from it, economically, socially and from an infrastructural perspective. However, when the Minister of State takes leave of his portfolio next May or whenever, virtually no one will have been transferred as a result of this so-called decentralisation bonanza. It certainly will not have worked within the timeframe, and I regret to say that there is no great evidence that it will work at all. Who in his right mind would not want to see civil servants and semi-State personnel adding to such communities as Athy, Ballinasloe, Buncrana, Carrickmacross and Cavan? We would all love that, and we should all aspire to it. However, the system that we have put in place is simply not adding up.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">I appeal to the Minister of State and his colleagues to be big and brave enough to say that they will review the type of programme and the mechanism used hitherto. If that does not happen, we will be having bimonthly decentralisation debates in this House from now until election day, saying the same things on all sides without there having been any great progress. It would be disappointing if we did not take advantage of the fact that there are towns crying out for offices to move there and great numbers of public servants in greater Dublin who would be willing to move if we could provide flexibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">Yesterday we debated the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill 2006. I said that the key word regarding that legislation was "balance". The key word in the decentralisation debate is "flexibility". We do not seem to have the balance right. Prescribing offices for towns before considering the numbers willing to move to each was a grave mistake. How the Minister of State and his colleagues will extract themselves from this mess I am not really sure, but they must attempt to do so for everyone's sake.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">We do not want decentralisation to take the place on the political stage which was held by the draining of the Shannon for almost 50 years. We want it to happen and believe it can. However, the manner in which it was thought up, proposed, announced and deemed to happen is questionable. While this experiment has failed, the concept of decentralisation is still as important, valid and credible as ever and may be needed now more than ever. The Minister of State should be big enough and sufficiently politically brave to admit that the process has not worked out exactly as he would have wished, is not going according to plan and must be re-examined in order to get it back on track.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Rural, regional and provincial Ireland needs decentralisation, as does Dublin city and greater Dublin. While a solution can be found, it will require fresh and brave political thinking. I hope that as the Minister of State was first out of the traps with decentralisation announcements some years ago, he will now accept the responsibility of being the first to concede that a new way forward is needed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanDaly" eId="spk_246">
          <from>Mr. Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_524">The difficulty with the Opposition Members in both Houses is reminiscent of a comment which I am sure the Minister of State has heard, namely, "I love you darling, but". There is always a "but", and their statements are always contradictory. While the Opposition Members are all in favour of decentralisation and want to see it working, they will always claim that the manner in which it is being done will prevent its success. While this may be fine from an Opposition perspective, in reality the process of decentralisation has been under way for 50 or 60 years or more. Sometimes, progress has been slow or delayed. I can recall when John Bruton, as Minister for Finance, cancelled the entire decentralisation programme after one of the elections in 1981. He did so after matters were almost ready to proceed, in that sites had been bought, negotiations had been entered into and decisions had been made as to what units were to move. That decision delayed decentralisation by some ten to 15 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment him on his tenacity in dealing with this complex matter. It affects people's lives, livelihoods, personal family homes and everything else, and unquestionably is a complicated business. However, the Minister of State is dealing with it in an extremely forthright manner. He has always indicated his willingness — even this week — to ask people to negotiate regarding their difficulties and problems so that this process may move smoothly.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">More than ten years ago, when in the office now held by the Minister of State, I endeavoured to move 1,200 staff from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin to Ennis, Limerick and Nenagh. While it took some time, it has had a dramatic impact on towns like Nenagh and Ennis. In respect of its impact on Ennis, it has been beneficial for the civil servants who moved there to work and has provided a major boost to the economy of Ennis. It was the trigger which set off the economic transformation which has taken place there in the past ten to 15 years. The relocation to Ennis, Limerick and Nenagh was successfully completed. It took some time because of negotiations regarding office accommodations and because it was a fairly ambitious move. Members should recall that 1,200 people were moved to three locations, while the current scheme envisages the move of 10,000 people to many locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">I have a query in respect of one aspect of the current plan, namely, the proposed move of the Irish Aid development organisation to Limerick city at the same time that a move from that city to Newcastle West and Kilrush is planned. This should be examined because if the decentralisation programme is attempting to move people from Dublin to Limerick, it should be noted that a fairly substantial decentralisation from Limerick to Newcastle West, Kilrush and Listowel is already planned. This matter should be revisited because it appears that at present, many people in Limerick city want to move out. That is proven by the fact that the numbers for Newcastle West are fully subscribed, as are the numbers for Kilrush.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The Kilrush, Listowel and Newcastle West concept came about when three towns came together with the help of local organisations and development associations as well as the Shannon Development company. They put forward a scheme whereby a substantial number of staff could be moved to locations within easy reach of each other using the car ferry in Killimer. This has been an important success story, as evinced by the uptake of staff who are willing to move to those three locations. I am glad that the Kilrush site in particular is working out satisfactorily. As far as I am aware, the proposed 50 positions have been offered to people and they have already expressed the desire that the concept would be moved forward. Some discussion has taken place in Kilrush in respect of suitable accommodation and I want the Minister of State to expedite this matter. Even on a temporary basis, accommodation is available. As the Government intends to provide a permanent office for their personnel in Kilrush and given that those people have been advised of the positions, it is important to use temporary accommodation until such time as an office is ready.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Ample accommodation is available in the town of Kilrush in a number of locations. As far as I am aware, the Minister received several proposals after making inquiries in respect of accommodation there. Some parties made representations to Members to have their cases put forward for consideration. That process has now been concluded and it is important that action be taken speedily.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I compliment the implementation team because of its success in many areas although there will always be nitpicking in respect of particular areas with which there will be difficulties. For example, there is a difficulty in respect of Enterprise Ireland as to whether its staff wishes to relocate to Shannon. The vehicle registration unit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was transferred to Shannon more than 25 years ago and has operated successfully there since. The unit now employs up to 100 staff in its office in Shannon town. It has been an important office and has also made a major impact on Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Any Enterprise Ireland staff who have anxieties about a potential move to Shannon should examine the experience of, or talk to, staff in the vehicle registration unit in Shannon. They would hear of the success which the vehicle registration unit had in its relocation there and of the satisfaction its staff have in living somewhere like Shannon, with all its attendant benefits and attractions. For instance, one can walk up the road to the airport. If one tried to travel to Dublin Airport, I am sure that one would encounter some delays. However, one could stroll up to Shannon Airport this afternoon and take a flight to wherever one wished.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">While there may be difficulties in respect of some areas, time will settle many of them. In the case of Ennis, a certain amount of relocation was involved and in such cases, it takes a while for it to settle down before it begins to be effective. However, the experiment in Ennis has been extremely successful from the perspective of the town of Ennis. It triggered and spearheaded the economic transformation that has taken place there. I can recall canvassing in Ennis before that took place. One travelled through derelict buildings, derelict streets and vacant places that could not be sold or leased. The place was economically devastated. However, thanks to the Government decentralisation, in addition to the decision to introduce urban renewal schemes for the town, Ennis is now thriving and the impact in many of its surrounding areas has been dramatic.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I look forward to welcoming the Revenue personnel to the town of Kilrush, where they will enjoy great attractions. I compliment the various organisations in Kilrush who worked closely with all the public representatives to ensure that they made their case. They received advice from consultants and had the wholehearted support of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company. Its representatives in both north Kerry and west Clare worked with the various committees to put forward the best possible case. To be honest, at the outset those involved were sceptical as to whether this would succeed, because the towns were relatively small. It was also important to group them together from the civil servants' perspective, because it opened up promotion prospects and made it more attractive for people to locate there.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">There will be a certain amount of re-organisation and difficulties in getting decentralisation up and running successfully but the Minister of State has the energy to get the entire operation moving. I do not understand why people are still saying there should be more discussions with unions and other interested parties. This relocation of 10,000 people has been talked about for five or six years. Do they want to continue until the day of judgment talking about whether or not one will do this?</p>
          <p eId="para_535">I compliment Charlie McCreevy, the former Minister, for making the decision to go ahead with decentralisation. There is talk now of making this an election issue. I pressed him strongly before the last general election to make the decision on Kilrush and suggested to him that had he made that decision I might not be here now but in the other House.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanDaly" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Mr. Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_537">As for people who want to make this a political issue, it was a political issue before the last election and it will be a political issue in the next election and probably in the subsequent one. It was a political issue in the general elections in 1981 and 1982, when the then leader of Senator Feighan's party, former Taoiseach, Garrett FitzGerald, and his Minister for Finance, John Bruton, scrapped the entire idea. If they want to do that again, they will send out a wrong signal to people. Some people will say that one should wait seven or eight months for an election and that when Fine Gael gets into office it will scrap the programme, as it did previously. It could not do that now. This programme has gone far enough that Fine Gael will not be able to stop it for a second time, but it is important we encourage the Minister of State to press ahead with the work. He has the energy to do so and to do it successfully.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">If there is to be a dialogue with unions and others about the differences that might exist over whether, for example, Enterprise Ireland comes to Shannon or goes elsewhere, it is a minor issue which in time will resolve itself. It is unrealistic to accept the sight of young people on Sunday evening lining up in the square in Kilrush waiting for coaches to take them back to Dublin. I never accepted it from the first time I was elected in 1973. Some of them would be in tears coming back to Dublin. At every clinic, mothers, fathers and their children would ask that they get back to the region from the then Departments such as Agriculture and Posts and Telegraphs, why it was not possible for Government to locate to any provincial town in Ireland and to expedite this process and get it moving successfully.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">While there may be teething problems, industrial relations problems and other problems, as the Minister of State said only this week, let people sit around the table and resolve those problems so this scheme can work successfully. I hope to see the day when another 10,000 people can be moved to provincial locations where Government business can be done as effectively and efficiently as in Kildare Street, next door in Agriculture House or anywhere else. I wish the Minister of State success in his endeavours and compliment him on the work he has done in expediting this issue to date.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_249">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_540">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, for coming to the House. The issue of decentralisation raises a few matters. First, I welcome the concept of decentralisation. Over the years any town which has experienced decentralisation has benefited from it. Senator Daly is correct in stating that it makes a considerable difference to an area.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">One or two of my brothers worked in the Civil Service and it was harrowing to see them get on the train or bus every Sunday and go to Dublin. They came home, not every week but every three weeks. They put down roots in Dublin. I am not complaining about that but it would have been very different if there had been opportunities to work closer to their home. The concept of decentralisation has been a success, perhaps up until now.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">Decentralisation has certainly helped in Sligo, which is my own area, and in Roscommon and Longford. Long before this decentralisation of 10,000 jobs was announced by the former Minister, Charlie McCreevy, it was too much of a political football. If Fine Gael had been in power, it might have done it similarly. Decentralisation invariably always went to the areas of the Ministers or Ministers of State or whoever had the influence.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">About four years ago, 100 jobs in the pre-1963 pensions area of the Pensions Board were due to be created in Sligo. At the time there was no accommodation in Sligo town. They were looking for a site and it was proposed that there was a building in my own town. Those 100 jobs would have made a considerable difference to my local area. It would have been as good as 1,000 jobs in a major town like Sligo. There would have been no problems with traffic, the accommodation was a quarter of the price and there were people from north Roscommon and south Leitrim queuing up at the roundabout at Carraroe trying to get into Sligo. It was an opportunity missed. Once again, the common sense, win-win approach did not come into effect and the area lost out on those jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">This decentralisation programme was announced with considerable fanfare. I remember the day. There were so many smiling faces that I thought there would be a sing-song in the Members' Bar by members of the Government who were so excited. The next general election was virtually over and done with. It was a good idea but it was overdone in the publicity and PR machine. Sometimes a Government can spin itself back into difficulty and spin itself out. On this occasion there has been too much spin and the Government is spinning itself back into difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">I remember speaking to the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, and everybody was told there were certain criteria. The criteria were that a town must be on a railway line and must not have benefited from decentralisation previously. Of the towns that were left out, I would draw attention to those which were not county towns and which did not get a fair crack of the whip.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">In my area in north Roscommon there were three towns which came up with the idea of applying to get a Department, where one would be able to go from Boyle to Castlerea in 20 minutes and Castlerea to Ballaghderreen in 20 minutes. It would have made a considerable difference to that area. I am not blaming the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, for this. We are all parochial but the Ministers around the table decided where the jobs would go.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Once again, I welcome the fact that the jobs are going into areas like Carrick-on-Shannon, Roscommon town and Longford but more could have been done by way of decentralisation whereby Ballinamore and Mohill in County Leitrim and Ballaghderreen, Strokestown, Boyle and Castlerea in Roscommon could have got jobs. That would have covered every area. The scheme could have been a little more imaginative and could have had a more positive effect on those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">One issue with which I have a difficulty when we speak of decentralisation is that of the county councils. County councils are not being pushed enough to decentralise around the counties. Jobs in local authorities and health boards are much sought after. There was talk of one-stop-shops and, while the councils and county managers are not getting enough funding, the will does not exist to decentralise around the county. In most of the county towns there could be up to 300 people working in the local authorities and it would make a significant difference if these people were decentralised around the county. Some towns are up to 50 miles away from the seat of power. We speak about decentralisation but not in a local authority context.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Decentralisation will be an election issue. There are signs that the taxpayer is being left with a multimillion euro bill for lands as part of decentralisation. The Department of Defence is due to relocate to Newbridge, County Kildare. Twelve sites were considered and a 4.3 acre site has emerged as a contender for the new departmental headquarters but a few miles outside the town, the Defence Forces are in possession of 771 acres. Would it be better practice to locate the headquarters on State lands? I accept the Minister of State must be seen to be doing everything above board but I am concerned that the land of people in the know who have access to Ministers is being considered. I acknowledge the process in place but the Minister of State should be vigilant about individuals being favoured for the award of lucrative Government leases. I am sure he will try to ensure the process is fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">It is worrying that none of the 93 staff at Bord Iascaigh Mhara has opted to move. In addition, the staff of Fáilte Ireland and the National Roads Authority are reluctant to move. I was contacted by a young man employed by Enterprise Ireland who wants to move from Dublin to the west, where he got married recently, but no mechanism is in place to transfer from semi-State bodies to the Civil Service. I ask the Minister of State to consider a mechanism that will accommodate public servants such as him. Many public servants get married in their own area but if they work for organisations such as Enterprise Ireland in Dublin, they are not getting a fair crack of the whip.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">I agree with Senator Bradford that the decentralisation programme is worthy and I would not be negative about. The Government can only be accused of being too hasty in announcing it and generating too much fanfare. Perhaps the eyes of the Government parties were on various constituencies in anticipation of the 2007 election but they have spun themselves out of an advantageous position.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Advance moves have taken place to Sligo, Portlaoise, Thurles, Tipperary town and An Forbacha, County Galway. Decentralisation could have a positive effect and we do not want to return to the days people queued for buses to Dublin in the 1970s and early 1980s, as they reluctantly returned to work in a Department in Dublin. Will the Minister of State consider towns that were not originally considered for decentralisation? County towns have done well and they are major catalysts for changes. Tesco and other companies have moved in but such towns may become the new Dublins. The Government should consider moving a number of these valuable jobs to other towns not mentioned in the programme. The public sector is one of the best areas in which to work because one enjoys good working conditions, a good pension, overtime and so on and smaller towns should reap the benefit of public sector jobs. I wish the Minister of State well in his future endeavours, as it is not an easy job.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_250">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_553">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I compliment him on his contribution. I refer to the speech by the Minister for Finance in November 2004 when two reports of the decentralisation implementation group were published. The recommendations of both reports were accepted by the Government and I very much welcome the decentralisation programme. Every Member supports the programme. It is almost as if they would be opposed to motherhood and apple pie if they opposed it but many "buts" have been mentioned by those who have contributed on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">We are all familiar in the west with successful decentralisation programmes in the past to Galway city, Athlone, Castlebar and Roscommon. It was disappointing when the programme was set at nought in the early 1980s and it did not resume until former Deputy, Ray MacSharry, took over as Minister for Finance in 1987. The national spatial strategy contained a list of towns that were to become gateways and hub towns but a number of them will not benefit under the decentralisation programme, which is puzzling. For example, 1,000 jobs were lost in Tuam when the sugar factory closed in the early 1980s. While the town achieved hub status, it has not been considered for decentralisation. I am even more amazed that the town did not feature in the programme for the roll-out of broadband, even though many towns of a similar and smaller size were included.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">The former Minister of State, Bobby Molloy, played a great role in decentralising public sector jobs to the west. He took a back seat role in 1987 when the programme was restarted under the Fianna Fáil Government but he brought his influence to bear on announcements relating to the west. The most significant benefit of decentralisation is the effect it has on employment in a town. That is why I was thrilled that Ballinasloe was listed for the decentralisation of the National Roads Authority in 2004. Loughrea was also listed for the decentralisation of the Department of Transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">The move to Loughrea has received a successful response but the proposed move to Ballinasloe has been a disaster because the NRA has no intention of relocating to the town. Under the programme, 110 jobs were to be provided. I met a former Minister for Transport in the town last weekend and I asked him whether he had information on the proposed move but he was more than surprised that Ballinsloe has been neglected. If we cannot get movement on this, another agency or Department should be considered for decentralisation to the town. Perhaps the Minister of State can inform me of the progress on decentralising the Railway Safety Commission to Ballinasloe.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">At the end of January, a Japanese company, USCI, announced 125 jobs for Ballinasloe. That is the first announcement of jobs for the town since the arrival of AT Cross and Square D in the late 1970s or early 1980s. We lost those two factories and, therefore, a new company is more than welcome. We are all aware that the only way the Government can deal directly with providing jobs in the town is through decentralisation. If we cannot provide the NRA jobs to Ballinasloe, we will have to consider some other agency for the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Every week financial institutions publish statements showing they are making more money and people criticise them for the large profits they are making. I do not criticise them for making a profit, but I criticise them for withdrawing services from our towns and villages. The withdrawal of such a service was a huge issue in Carraroe in west Galway two years ago, where the travelling bank was stopped for security reasons. The AIB used to come to Mountbellew, a town close to where I live, once and then twice a week. We all thought that the next move would be to a five-day week service, if only to compete with the Bank of Ireland. Unfortunately, AIB withdrew its service leaving Bank of Ireland with a monopoly. We are lucky to have a bank in the town.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">The situation is similar in many towns as I am sure the Leas-Chathaoirleach would agree. We have credit unions and post offices, but I do not see much support for them. The issue has been raised in the Dáil by way of parliamentary question to try to get information from Departments, but there are so many agencies and boards with responsibility for the matter that we are left very much in the dark, whether we are in the Dáil or Seanad. Post offices have closed down in Galway county and been replaced by the smallest post box that cannot take anything other than a small envelope. Recently, I was almost late for the post and met the postman collecting the post from the box. Most of the bigger envelopes were ripped and he said to me that he would have to repackage them or put sellotape on them when he got back to Ballinasloe.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">We must wake up to the fact that we are not providing the services through agencies as we did through Departments. Many agencies are withdrawing services. I hope our committees will follow this up at committee level because it is difficult for us to follow up. We cannot raise issues in the Seanad because we are told they are not the responsibility of the Minister and Deputies have the same problem in the Dáil. We must ensure that decentralisation will be across the board. We must consider the towns that are not hub or gateway towns because they need more people and services, whether through decentralisation of an agency or Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The decentralisation programme and list published in 2004 is good for most other areas. I remember when I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts some years ago, before the Department of Social and Family Affairs opened offices in Sligo, I was told the departmental computers were so large that they could hardly be moved. Technology has ended that problem and it is great that we have such a good ICT system that we no longer have a problem moving it. We will probably have more of a problem moving people. The move to Sligo is one of the best examples of decentralisation we have and people know what Department and town to contact when they want information on welfare benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">We should think of young people when we consider decentralisation. I was at a meeting in Ballinasloe on Monday attended by members of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business who came to talk about Ballinasloe and the regions. Many young people spoke about the great facilities in towns such as Roscommon which has made great improvements in the area of recreation and sports facilities. This is something the young people of Ballinasloe would like to emulate.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">As chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs sub-committee on overseas development aid, I have received many representations from NGOs with regard to the proposed transfer of the ODA unit to Limerick. I do not know if the Minister of State has addressed the issue as I did not have time to go through all his comments. Much money is being spent on ODA, over €600 million, and I am delighted about that. We hope to reach the 0.7% of GNP target by 2012. If, as the NGOs suggest, difficulties will arise as a result of a move to Limerick, we should reconsider it. I have an open mind on the matter. I am in favour of the decentralisation programme, but this appears to be an issue that has arisen again and again. Perhaps the Minister of State will give his view on this particular move.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I applaud the Minister of State on the work done so far and hope he will have accomplish a successful decentralisation programme.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_254">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_568">I see the Minister of State is disappointed I was not here earlier. I do not want to let him leave without a few statements he can later quote. I will start where Senator Kitt concluded because that is probably the best example of the difficulties arising with regard to decentralisation, namely the decentralisation of Ireland Aid to Limerick. The Minister of State did not address this directly in his comments, although he did hint at it towards the end. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, did refer to it in January. Essentially, he said that experts who provide expert advice, sometimes on a consultancy basis, to the Department should not think they are indispensable and that if they are not willing to go to Limerick they can be replaced by others who will.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">That was an unfortunate intervention on the part of the Minister. However, I suspect it is also indicative of a certain desperation that has arisen in dealing with some specialised areas of the Civil Service. These people are particularly vulnerable because many of them are on consultancy contracts. Therefore, they can be easily bullied if that is what the Minister or any of his colleagues want to do. In the case of Ireland Aid, there was a report a number of years ago which examined its efficiency and concluded the section should be integrated within the Department of Foreign Affairs. Now, just a few years later, it is being split away from the Department, not just geographically but in every other way, and when people return from the depths of Africa or Asia, we will ask them to got to Limerick where they will not have the benefit of daily interaction with colleagues within the Department. There is a genuine problem in this regard and it is something the Minister of State should address.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">This problem is indicative of a greater problem that needs to be addressed. I appreciate there must be a certain amount of bluff and counter bluff in the way the issue is dealt with. I appreciate the Minister of State cannot say that if 20% of people is the maximum number of people he can get to move, he will not proceed. It is difficult for him to say that. To be objective, there is a point at which it is not worth doing and at which he must say, in particular with regard to specialised agencies of which there are relatively few proposed for a move in the first stage of implementation, that the workforce, or a significant percentage of it, has a veto.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">I am afraid that the Minister of State will continue to issue statements, as he does when he answers parliamentary questions on the issue, saying that there is great interest, many people want to relocate down the country and that people in Dublin who may not want to move with their current jobs want to move into jobs which will allow them to relocate. Furthermore, promotion and job allocation is being carried out on the basis that people are willing to move down the country and he does not contemplate doing anything other than moving ahead with the implementation phase as quickly as possible. Of course, such statements are not true because there has to be a point at which he will say "we cannot actually do this" because there is a significant percentage, a majority in some cases, of specialised staff who do not want to move. If the Minister of State is serious about the voluntary principle behind the move, he must say that the move will not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">I am afraid that the Minister of State will tell people from the Office of Public Works to go as far down the road as they can, perhaps further than is wise, in acquiring property only to find that the move will not happen. Some progress has been made in acquiring property in Limerick, where Ireland Aid will be located if it moves out of Dublin. In a worst-case scenario, we could end up in a situation where the Dublin office is disposed of, money and effort is spent on acquiring property in Limerick but, having incurred costs and made recruitment and promotion difficult for a period of three to five years, the move does not go ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">It would be in everybody's interest if the Minister of State said now that with regard to the specialised agencies, where we must retain the people and their posts, that we can only go ahead in certain circumstances, the move should be genuinely voluntary and we must establish a point where a clear decision is made as to whether a relocation will occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">In his final comments, the Minister of State alluded to some of the human resources issues that arise. I do not want to go into them in detail but some are extremely important. He has been telling us for some months now that recruitment at senior grades, that is, assistant secretary and higher, is now being done on the basis that the people being recruited are willing to relocate. For the first time, we are recruiting senior people within the Civil Service not on the basis of their ability but their geographical flexibility, which, in many cases, will depend on their family circumstances. There are plenty of people who would be quite happy to move to locations outside of Dublin but whose family circumstances mean it is impossible for them to do so. It is likely that those who are in a position to seek promotion to the senior levels of the Civil Service will not be 21 year olds who have just left college, but people who have put down roots in Dublin, want to stay here and whose family circumstances dictate that they should. This is the wrong approach and I urge the Minister of State to examine this issue closely.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">We know of the particular difficulties with FÁS and I appreciate that a decision was reached on the basis of the fact that there was insufficient consultation in that case. However, it represents a worrying trait because the Minister of State feels obliged to say that everything is plain sailing and the destination is in sight, which makes it hard for him to acknowledge the real difficulties that arise along the way. I wish it were otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">I got into trouble when I last spoke on this issue for my use of colourful phrases. I will not repeat those particular phrases but I do not resile from the sentiment I expressed then. It is apparently fine for people who represent rural constituencies to have a go, so to speak, at Dublin and Dubliners. Nobody bats an eyelid or thinks it off-side to do so. However, when we Dubliners defend the location of jobs in Dublin or seek to attract more jobs into the county, or dare to suggest that would be a good move, we are regarded as being unsound, at best. In fact, much more colourful phrases have been used and this is not reasonable. There are many thousands of civil servants, from Dublin and elsewhere, who simply want to stay here. If the Minister insists that decentralisation is a voluntary scheme, he must take that basic fact into consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">There are a number of well-worn arguments against the decentralisation programme relating to the difficulty that exists with interdiscipline or interdepartmental co-operation and the efficiency of the Civil Service. I will not go into them again because we have beaten the arguments to death at this stage. However, they have not gone away. While I appreciate that the Minister of State will find it difficult to acknowledge this publicly, not least because there is a general election around the corner, such arguments must be dealt with in a serious way in the near future.</p>

          <p eId="para_584">Senator McDowell spoke about Dublin people but there is an enormous number of people who want to move to different parts of the country. The Minister of State said there were approximately 10,600 people working in the Civil Service who have signed up to decentralisation. The vast majority of them are probably in Dublin. In the recent past, up to 13,000 civil servants have decentralised to destinations all over the country and have settled in well. They were made welcome and have made a major contribution to rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">I welcome the decentralisation programme. There may be human resource problems with FÁS and its proposed move to Birr but the staff should visit Birr and the county as a whole to see the schools, shops and so forth, which are the best in the midlands. Information technology developments will ensure that decentralisation to the county will be unproblematic.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">I do not blame civil servants for fighting a battle relating to decentralisation. There may well be some rewards for their unions in ensuring they receive extra remuneration. Great opportunities exist for civil servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Although speakers have commented on the loss of expertise in some Departments, it must be remembered no one is indispensable and everyone can be replaced. Many young well-educated people are coming through the education system who can fill those vacancies. Civil servants may well have to move from one Department to another if they do not wish to decentralise. The programme will work; hopefully sooner rather than later. I understand it cannot happen overnight and that the process will take time. The Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance must secure proper sites and ensure compliance with all planning guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">When the tendering process begins, I hope much work will be done through public-private partnerships. Builders have never been so busy but I hope they will realise the opportunities that exist in decentralisation. In the past building a school was a protracted procedure. That has changed with many builders willing and able to move ahead in the public-private partnership model. When the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, reaches that stage of the programme, great progress will be made. I wish him and his officials well in pursuing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Costs must to be considered. If good office accommodation can be secured in rural towns and a Department's business can be carried on, why should we hold up valuable office accommodation in Dublin that costs ten times more? Although the Government is quickly criticised for budget overruns, the future savings from the programme must be considered. The Minister of State has outlined several valuable sites in Dublin that will be sold. That money will be put to great use. Although it may not be put into the decentralisation programme, valuable use can be made of it in looking after much-needed services.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">I wholeheartedly welcome decentralisation to Birr, Tullamore, Edenderry, Portlaoise and Portarlington. I compliment the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who represent the Laois-Offaly constituency on their work on decentralisation. There is no doubt that they will ensure the programme will come to fruition nationwide. It is about the contributions that Departments and agencies will make to cities and towns outside of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">I wish the Minister of State at the Department of Finance and his officials well with the implementation of the decentralisation programme. I accept Members from Dublin will defend their home city. However, I assure Senator McDowell that had we not to leave for the bus last week, Offaly would have taken Dublin out of the football too.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coonan</from>
          <p eId="para_594">I am in favour of a properly-planned decentralisation programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Senator Moylan and previous speakers have pointed to difficulties with the programme's progress. I have great respect for Senator Kitt as a level-headed and able politician, like the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. He informed the House of the difficulties experienced at Ballinasloe with the programme. Mention was made of FÁS in Birr, County Offaly. Another area where problems have emerged is Roscrea, County Tipperary, where the Equality Authority is to be located.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Recently, at a meeting the chief executive officer of the authority said that not one member of its staff had applied for decentralisation to Roscrea. If not one member of the authority's staff has applied for it, how will it function when it locates to there? The Equality Authority's work is specifically orientated. The CEO also outlined that the authority requires specialised legal advice not readily available in Roscrea. Such advice is often limited in the capital and must be brought in from abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">I raised the matter with the management of North Tipperary County Council which established a decentralisation committee. It informed me that 57 civil servants from other Departments and agencies had applied to decentralise to Roscrea. Will the Minister of State clarify these matters?</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The Minister of State said the figure of 10,600 applications referred to regional centres but not Dublin. Civil servants based in Portlaoise are on to me every day of the week to be transferred to the Garda college in Templemore or Nenagh in County Tipperary within the year. The Minister of State must get his officials to give a clear indication of the number of personnel who want to transfer. He should be open about it. He is committed to the programme and is tenacious about its progress. If anyone can get it going, he will.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">When the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, announced the programme, he knew in advance where he was headed. He was anxious to win a group one race, so the Minister of State was left at the starting stalls with a mess. The programmes needs to be reconsidered, refocused and reorganised. It is important that we get it right. What good is it to people to have the Equality Authority in Roscrea if it is incapable of functioning? Its CEO claims it is important that the authority is located close to the headquarters of those agencies and organisations who use it most, namely employers, IBEC and the unions. Their headquarters, however, are located in the capital. Although we have unions outside of Dublin, the main headquarters and personnel are not based there. Will the Minister of State address these issues?</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The decentralisation programme for towns such as Ballinasloe, Birr and Roscrea is in crisis. A former Minister announced the Garda Síochána Complaints Board was to be located to Roscrea. When I raised it with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, he informed me Roscrea was not an appropriate location as the board must be at the centre of the action. If he was around Roscrea at the weekends, he would see enough action.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">The Government is clearly having difficulties with implementing the decentralisation programme. It will only work when it is properly planned and the unit to be transferred is fully behind it. An example of that is the proposed transfer of the vetting unit of the Garda Síochána to Thurles, County Tipperary. That will work because as one would expect, the Garda authorities will be fully behind a Government decision. A chief superintendent or a higher ranking officer was immediately appointed to oversee decentralisation to Thurles, and it is working well.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">I want to bring the Minister of State a little closer to home. The Garda College in Templemore, for example, is being recentralised in that part of it has been moved out of the campus. The authorities are crying out for land to put in place proper training facilities for the students in Templemore. They have told the Office of Public Works, and I have spoken about this matter to the Minister of State, that they require land urgently on which they can develop services and provide further accommodation. That unit has now moved out of Templemore.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">There is an unwillingness on the part of the Office of Public Works to spend money to provide them with the facilities. Is that not crazy in this day and age? The Minister of State is shaking his head but that unwillingness exists. There is an unwillingness to give market value for land in Templemore. There was no unwillingness to pay an exorbitant price to purchase a site in Dublin on which to build a new prison. An outlandish price was paid for that site yet the Minister will not give market value for the land in Templemore to ensure the facilities can be located in Templemore instead of recentralising them. The Minister is talking about decentralisation yet an opportunity to do that in Templemore is being passed over. That is an example of where decentralisation can work and I look forward to the Minister's comments on that. If, for example, Dell was coming to Templemore every agency and Government body in the country would be offering all sorts of facilities. They would get grants and so on but the Garda authorities are having to battle with everybody to get what they want to provide the facilities that are urgently needed in Templemore.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I wish the Minister of State well with decentralisation. I am not against it, nor am I against the Minister. I want to see it going well, and the Minister knows that. We want to be positive about this but there are issues that must be addressed and we must come clean with the public as to where they stand. I ask the Minister to deal with the Equality Authority, the Garda inspectorate that was promised for Roscrea and the Garda College issue. I ask him to ask his officials, when they engage with the county council, the public or public representatives, to give a clear and accurate picture of what is happening and not give massaged or inaccurate figures that do not reflect the true position. That is what is annoying people the most about decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I hope this process works out but I believe it will take another Government to ensure it does. The Minister of State may well be part of that. I am not being negative in any way but it will not happen in the lifetime of this Government. It will take another Government to get it right, which is essential both for Dublin and the provincial towns where decentralisation will take place. We must get this process right if the services are to be delivered to the people.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coghlan</from>
          <p eId="para_614">Serious problems are being experienced in Killarney. We have lost a number of factories. I always accepted that the Dublin Airport Authority was the wrong home for the Great Southern Hotel Group. As the Minister of State is aware, that is an exceptionally fine property. It has been suggested that it could house many offices, including the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, which is earmarked for Killarney and for which a deal has already been done on a site with the local authority, although I am sure that could be re-arranged if they decided to relocate to the Great Southern Hotels group.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">I am not trying to take anything from anyone but Fáilte Ireland was supposed to decentralise to Mallow yet none of the staff have offered to transfer. Killarney might be a more appropriate location. The Department and Fáilte Ireland could both decentralise to that location. There are human resource considerations, as Senator McDowell pointed out, which must be taken into account. The problem might not be decentralisation as relocation. Many of the people who are offering to decentralise are not in Dublin. The problem is that it is very difficult to get in and out of Dublin. People who are located in Dublin do not want to leave it and those who live outside Dublin do not want to relocate there, much as some of us would like to visit it occasionally.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">Someone said to me that no Sir Humphrey worth his salt would allow his Department move from Dublin. The Minister might be more conversant about those human resources and Sir Humphrey difficulties than me, but Killarney looks forward to that Department decentralising. I am disappointed that only 10% of the staff have offered to move. I do not know where they are from but I look forward to hearing from the Minister of State on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">Perhaps some of this programme could be rejigged. What Senator Coonan said is correct. This process will not happen in the lifetime of this Government but we should try to keep it on track and there might be some scope in terms of some of the locations. For instance, if decentralisation cannot work in Parlon country, Laoighis-Offaly, I am sure we could make it work in Kerry. Perhaps there could be some rejigging of the decentralisation programme, and I say that without taking from any other designated location.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">There is a problem with the figures I have been shown and I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's comments on them. This process will probably come under a ten year plan or whatever. I am sorry I was not here for the Minister of State's opening remarks but I look forward to hearing his closing remarks. In line with the instruction of the Chair, I am happy to hand over to my colleague.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_619">I will be brief. I was present for the Budget Statement of the then Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, in which he announced the decentralisation programme and the scatter-gun approach to decentralisation of Departments to various towns. The only reason for it was to gain success in the local elections but that gun misfired because this Government got its answer in no uncertain terms in the last local elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">There was no thought put into this decentralisation programme. I would go so far as to say there was no consultation with the unions or anybody else prior to the announcement of this election ploy but on the fateful day the Minister made his speech about decentralisation, he said the Government should be judged on the delivery of this decentralisation programme within three years. If that is so, what kind of judgment can the people make on this Government? The way towns have been treated is appalling. The Minister is trying to fool people in towns that are expecting decentralisation. The Government is paying lip service to those people. The Minister can fool some of the people some of the time but he cannot fool all the people all the time. Charlie McCreevy's words will come back to haunt the Government. If it is to be judged on decentralisation, it is dead in the water.</p>

          <p eId="para_632">I attempted to correct the Senator but I should not interfere. It was never intended to move a whole Department <i>en bloc</i> to a particular location. There is a high degree of inflexibility within the Civil Service at present such that people have to crisscross for miles because they are not allowed to move, resulting in a quality of life deficit. The main reason for this is that the public service unions that represent them do not allow flexibility. This is a difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">There is a high degree of interest in decentralisation. Senator John Paul Phelan said a number of people from regional locations were applying to the central applications facility. Civil servants who work in Kilkenny, Portlaoise, Castlebar or elsewhere have the same rights and entitlements as anyone else. If the Senator is suggesting Fine Gael would have proposed a scheme that would have allowed decentralisation from Dublin but would not have allowed the movement of civil servants who had previously applied for decentralisation, he is being ridiculous. It would not work.</p>

          <p eId="para_658">The Senator's contribution was very thoughtful. He appreciates there are difficulties and complexities associated with the programme, through which we have to work. He referred to the human resources issues, which are complex because every individual values his job and lifestyle. These issues are being addressed at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">Senator McDowell also referred to the debate involving the unions representing the FÁS workers, who are balloting on a particular issue. The Labour Court recommends they negotiate with the decentralisation implementation group and the representative bodies. I have no doubt but that there are excellent industrial relations procedures in place that will allow this to happen. The Government is allowing time for this to be worked through, and this is being done. In the meantime, the property solutions are being and will be worked out. I outlined in detail the progress being made on these.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">Senator Moylan was very positive. There was a time when the only job was a Civil Service job and the only building opportunity was to build a local school or Government building. This is no longer the case. Those who ask how many leave the Civil Service should note that the Civil Service will shortly be recruiting new staff. It was suggested that existing staff do not want to move and that there will be an excessive number of them in Dublin because the scheme is voluntary. The Civil Service will be recruiting new staff in Dublin because people are attracted by jobs other than those in the Civil Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Senator Coonan referred to difficulties concerning the National Roads Authority and FÁS. There are certainly difficulties with the specialist agencies. The Civil Service has much scope to transfer between Departments but the agencies do not have this flexibility. This is why there are intense negotiations between their unions and the Department of Finance, the negotiator on behalf of the Government. If a union decides not to come to the table, it poses a difficulty. The union representing FÁS employees is seeking a mandate this week, through a ballot, from 250 of its members. As I stated, the Labour Court recommended that the representatives negotiate with the decentralisation implementation group.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">The OPW is charged with organising all the sites and buildings around the country, relocating its headquarters to Trim and moving other parts of its operations to Claremorris and Kanturk in County Cork. One can imagine the extra pressure on the OPW. The same applies to the NRA, which is responsible for a massive roads programme at present. Everybody is working overtime, yet they must relocate. The NRA may take a little longer but I guarantee that the OPW will be moving with the first of the bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">I understand 57 people have applied to go to Roscrea, about which town Senator Coonan asked. There is no greater advocate of decentralisation than the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who is responsible for moving the Garda Síochána Complaints Board and the Equality Authority to that town.</p>

          <p eId="para_665">I have no doubt that people outside the Equality Authority will be able to operate there. The authority is drafting an implementation plan for itself and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Secretary General have the main responsibility in this area. Progress is being made in every area and every Department is responsible for ensuring it will be able to provide an efficient service in its new location.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">On the question of people seeking to join an organisation since the announcement of decentralisation or seeking promotion, their doing so is conditional on their being able to move to a new location. Despite a reference to six people, I believe closer to 70 have either been promoted or have signed up to move to Birr since the decentralisation of FÁS was announced. There are many positive aspects to decentralisation, the most positive of which is that, by the end of 2006, a very substantial number of civil servants will be at their desks in new locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Senator Browne asked about Carlow and I am sure he already knows, given that he asked the question, that the OPW is seeking accommodation in Carlow for 80 people on a temporary basis before we establish the full headquarters of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

I appreciate that decentralisation will be an election issue and look forward to this, irrespective of whether the bums on seats in towns are associated with temporary or permanent posts, or whether there are new buildings being constructed or new sites being bought, be they in Roscommon, Birr or Thomastown.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">Senator John Paul Phelan spoke about the proposal to decentralise the Health and Safety Authority to Thomastown. No agency has an attitude to decentralisation that is more positive than that of the authority. I understand that the authority is actively pursuing a location in the area for a new agency that is being set up. The authority wants to establish the new people who are being recruited to a highly-technical area in County Kilkenny, rather than in any other location, before its headquarters is moved there. The Senator can rest assured that we are making good progress in that regard. I am delighted to advise the House on the progress of the decentralisation programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_681">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_682">"(1)(<i>a</i>) That, having regard to:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_683">(i) recent reports that US aircraft landing at Irish airports may have been used to transport persons to locations where they may be at risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment; and</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_692">(<i>c</i>) The Select Committee shall have the powers defined in Standing Order 65(1) to (9) inclusive.”</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Tá fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Ó Treasaigh, mar a bhíonn i gconaí. This is one of the more extraordinary debates in which I have been involved. Like other Members on both sides of the House, I participated with considerable goodwill and flexibility in an effort, proposed by Senator Norris but essentially initiated and driven by the Leader of the House, to establish a select committee to examine the reports which were gradually emerging in the media of extraordinary happenings. The group that tried to establish the committee worked thoroughly to that end.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">As I have said a few times without betraying any confidences, I suggested at the group's meetings that if the select committee was to have any weight and standing, it was appropriate and right that it should be composed as all committees of this House are composed, meaning that it should have a built-in Government majority. Like all other Opposition Senators, I did not want the select committee to be able to bushwhack the Government. I like bushwhacking the Government, but I regarded this issue as being of such seriousness that I was willing to forego that possibility. I thought everyone else was just as keen for it to be taken seriously. I was under the impression that there was consensus across all parties that this issue was deserving of the fullest support.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">The group in question carefully assembled terms of reference for the select committee. It is worth saying that the terms of reference are not about condemnation or prejudging. They relate to the fact that reports had emerged that aircraft used in what we call "extraordinary rendition"— it is unfortunate that the phrase is now part of normal parlance — had used Irish airports before, during or after such activities. Although I may hear to the contrary, I do not believe anyone disputes that it is definite that such aircraft used our airports. One could argue about whether one accepts the word of the United States that no such prisoners were on board the aircraft when they landed in Ireland. That the aircraft landed here and that the aircraft were used in the practice of extraordinary rendition is a view that I take to be shared virtually universally. The issue of whether the individuals in question were tortured is a matter for further investigation, although I believe the case is pretty overwhelming.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">As I have said, the first task of the select committee will be to examine the reports of such activities. In light of those reports, the second task of the select committee will be to ascertain whether this country can enforce what it accepts as its international obligations under the UN Convention Against Torture, for example. Ireland has further obligations in line with its status as a founding member of the European Convention on Human Rights. Ireland was one of the first countries to accept courageously extra-territorial jurisdiction from the European Court of Human Rights. Like other countries, Ireland has suffered as a result of the ups and downs of that relationship. It has never flinched from its belief that it is right to accept such jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">Having looked at the reports, the select committee will make an assessment of their validity and consider whether Ireland is willing and able to meet its obligations under various international agreements. That is all the committee will be charged with doing. Much of the motion before the House relates to the structure of the committee. It does not set out in advance what the members of the select committee believe to be the case. It has been proposed on foot of the considerable disquiet and evidence in this regard, which is found in other countries as well as in Ireland. Similar bodies have been established in other parliaments, for example, by the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe and by the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">While the group I have mentioned was attempting to draw up terms of reference, and in the immediate period afterwards, the Government was responding to queries from the Council of Europe, in particular. I was glad to hear the Government telling the Council of Europe it was in complete opposition to the practice of so-called "extraordinary rendition", although it was nothing less than I would have hoped for from an Irish Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">The Government also told the Council of Europe that "a thorough examination of practice throughout the State ... revealed no indication of the occurrence" of any such practices, which would be "plainly in breach of international law, Irish law, and of the principles upon which the Council of Europe is founded". That is the Government's stated position, as outlined to the Council of Europe. I want the committee to investigate what the Government says it has already investigated. It is clear that the information is already in the Government's hands, assuming the Government is telling the truth, as I always do until it is proven otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">I would like to know who carried out the "thorough examination" to which the Government referred in the document it submitted to the Council of Europe. Was it carried out by an individual, by an agency or by the Department of Foreign Affairs? What form did the "thorough examination" take? Were aircraft inspected as part of the examination? I do not refer to binoculars being trained on aircraft from 150 m away at Shannon or Baldonnel. Were the aircraft actually inspected? Did those who carried out the examination ascertain who owned the aircraft which are the subject of so many reports? Did they bother to do so?</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The Council of Europe has been told that our Government carried out a "thorough examination". I seek the establishment of a select committee that would ask such questions, not of the US Administration or any other foreign administration but of this country's Government. Although the Government has claimed that the select committee's work has already been done, the public does not know how it was done.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">Does the Government acknowledge, as the US Secretary of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, has done, that the practice of rendition exists? There may be a dispute about the definition of "torture". Dr. Rice has said that extraordinary rendition is used in defence of "our freedom", although she denies that the United States uses, facilitates or approves of torture, or allows it to happen. I am sure the Minister of State is aware that there was a serious dispute between members of the US Congress and the current Administration in Washington about the prohibition of the use of inhuman and cruel practices in interrogation. It was a debate that was about the different forms of torture. There is a no doubt — there is widespread literature available on this — that some people in the current US administration favour practices that would be regarded as torture in other countries, especially in western Europe. The US Secretary of State, Dr. Rice, acknowledged that such practices are carried out. The administration acknowledges that it believes that in certain circumstances, certain practices that could be cruel or inhuman might be justified.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">Our Government has stated that such practices are in breach of Irish law, international law and of the principles upon which the European Convention on Human Rights was set up. What did the Government do to vindicate those rights? What did it do to vindicate Ireland's position as a country which believes that one of the fundamentals of its foreign policy is the vindication of human rights? Were any of the aircraft examined? If there is a reasonable suspicion that an aircraft that lands at Shannon was used in the process of depriving another human being of his or her most basic rights, does the State have any willingness or ability to investigate that aircraft? Does it have the willingness to search it, to carry out forensic tests on it for evidence, or to question the crew?</p>
          <p eId="para_704">These are the issues that this committee was supposed to investigate. These issues were to be investigated by a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas dealing with Irish people. We were not attempting to be the Skibereen Eagle keeping an eye on the Czar of Russia. We were attempting to ensure that human rights best practice was being practised in Ireland. We were not asserting that anybody was on board any of these aircraft.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">There is a <i>prima facie </i>case that aircraft which landed in this country were used in rendition. The US authorities deny that anyone was on board and our Government has assured me that it accepts the word of those authorities, which was given on the most categorical terms. That was said by senior officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and I am not in a position to question it. However, that is not to say that the issue is not of fundamental importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">I have outlined what we were going to do, but somewhere along the line, the Government took fright. We had got to the stage where we had agreed reasonable terms of reference on a cross-party basis.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_708">We agreed it with the Leader and with the Whip of the Progressive Democrats in the House. I could not go around and shake everybody's hand on the issue. I know that some Fianna Fáil Senators opposed this motion before they knew what was in it. Some of them did not realise that the committee was to have a Government majority. They did not realise that we would put temperate language into the motion, yet they still opposed it. About what, therefore, did they take fright?</p>
          <p eId="para_709">We are constantly being told that the US is a friendly country. Let us suppose that our neighbours in the UK were accused of doing something like this to an Irish citizen north of the Border. Does anyone believe that the sensitivities about hostile acts expressed by Senators on the other side of the House would interfere with their crusade to defend human rights north of the Border? They would be right to defend those human rights. The major party of the Government has decided that for an Oireachtas committee to ask questions, which the Government claims it has already asked, would constitute a hostile act. In effect, the Government is stating that human rights are not indivisible. It is stating that human rights matter when other people whom we do not like transgress them, but when our friends in the US are dodgy about the law and its fundamentals, then all we can do is blink, turn our backs and pretend it never happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">At this late stage I know that there is still a significant majority in this House in favour of setting up this committee. The Opposition is in favour of it as are a significant number in the Government parties. Let them assert themselves just this once in the same way that those who are opposed to this motion asserted themselves. They should not be walked into the voting lobbies just because a local lobby based around Shannon Airport has put human rights behind their naive belief that there are jobs involved in looking up to Uncle Sam.</p>

          <p eId="para_711">I am very happy to second this motion and I am very grateful to Senator Ryan for giving me the opportunity to do so. Like many other people, I was astonished when this committee was deliberately collapsed. In reply to my question about the committee on 1 December 2005, the Leader stated that if the European Parliament is taking the issue seriously, then we should do likewise. We had about six meetings and the legal representative of the Oireachtas was there to advise us. The terms of reference were agreed between all parties, yet suddenly, the whole thing was punctured and I am sure that this was not without the intervention of the Government. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the House have been gombeens on this issue. I use that word advisedly and I would like to rub it in. A gombeen is one who sells out one's ideas for cash and it is a perfectly parliamentary term to use. Such people do not care if human beings are tortured or murdered, because we know this has actually happened.</p>

          <p eId="para_718">I want to refer to five specific flights. The first flight landed on 17 June 2003. Hassan Osama Mustafa Nasr, known as Abu Omar, was abducted in Milan. He may not have been a very nice person, but he was treated with contempt for his human rights. He was taken via a military air base in Aviano, Italy and Rammstein, Germany to Egypt on a Gulfstream jet, which later flew to the US via Shannon.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_720">That is the very fudge the Senators on the other side of the House are trying to make. Under international law, it constitutes complicity in a crime if one assists in the flight. This is what we have done and this is what the Government has tried to conceal. I would appreciate less nonsense from that side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">The suspect was then taken to Egypt, was tortured and released without charge. He was then re-arrested and he has not been seen since. He was probably murdered in Egypt.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The plane used for the second flight was registered as N379P, which made several changes when it was discovered that we were following it. The Americans were obviously more embarrassed about it than the Government. That flight, known as the "Guantanamo Bay express", was spotted at Shannon Airport in 2002 and had been involved in the abduction of two men from Stockholm in 2001. There is a criminal case pending on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_724">Since yesterday, we have been in possession of information stating that the British Government, despite its repeated denials of the use of its bases for rendition, has been involved in such a process. The following three flights are of interest to this House because they were routed back through Shannon. Flight N313P arrived from Brize Norton at 10.15 on 19 October 2003, departed to Tripoli at 13.00, arrived from Tripoli at 15.35 on 22 October, departed to Tripoli at noon on 28 October, arrived from Tripoli at 17.10 on 29 October and departed to Shannon. Flight N379P arrived from Islamabad at 15.50 on 18 October 2002, departed to Washington at 9.00 on 20 October, arrived from Amman at 12.50 on 16 January 2003, departed to Shannon at 10.00. Flight N8068V arrived from Marrakesh at 12.10 on 15 May 2004, departed to Luton at 13.00, arrived from Luton at 11.05 on 17 May and departed to Shannon at 8 a.m. The sole purpose of these airplanes was rendition of illegally kidnapped victims and we facilitated that by refuelling those airplanes at Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">The Human Rights Commission, on 23 December last, called on the State to inspect flights into Shannon. This is not just a group of cranks on the backbenches of Seanad Éireann. I will now turn to the response of the Government to the Marty committee. We were told that inspection was not necessary because it was duplication. As a result of a complaint I made to the Garda Commissioner, I was visited by two detective superintendents. They told me, and I confirmed it this afternoon, that the Garda has no power to enter these aircraft in these conditions because of the way the UN convention on torture was incorporated into Irish law. The Government said something totally contradictory in this report, so which is correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_735">I have indicated that some of it is contradicted by senior Garda officers. The Senator also asked about aid or assistance in the transportation by aircraft or otherwise of persons so deprived of their liberty. Is it beyond the intelligence of a small section of the Fianna Fáil Party to understand plain English? If one refuels an airplane, one is facilitating its operation. It is part and parcel of the flight and would be so understood in international criminal law.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">The Government says that in the interests of the proper operation of the security and safety of an aerodrome or the security and safety of persons, aircraft or other property thereon, a garda may arrest without warrant any person who assaults or whom he or she reasonably suspects to have assaulted another person. This is a series of five flights where we know that people were assaulted. This has been determined in several European courts. The pilot of that airplane was the same pilot who brought it back through Shannon. We know he was involved in the assaults. Why was nothing done? Why did the Government not ask who was in the airplane? Why were the airplanes not inspected?</p>
          <p eId="para_737">The gardaí told me — this is laughable — that they interrogated the cleaners. The cleaners might notice the odd cigarette packet on the ground but they would not notice the subtle adaptations so people can be shackled and manacled in the aircraft. The Government signally failed in its duty to inspect and that is why this part of its answer is a downright lie and a disgrace to the Irish people.</p>

I sincerely hope that the people for whom the Government has been complicit in their kidnap and torture will sue the State and I hope the record of Seanad Éireann and the fact that I and others have pursued this over the past few years will stand as evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">Senator Marty mentioned "by act or omission". We have not covered the State's act of omission but I am aware of what the Government is trying to do. It is trying to squirt out obfuscation so it can pretend it did not know. However, ignorance of the law is no defence in law. The Government said it is fully aware of its obligations. It might be but why did it do damn all about them? Where the Secretary General's request is concerned, the Government said the issue arises largely — and this is the fudge — in the context of the transport of any individual while so deprived of his or her liberty. The transport of an individual includes the return leg. That is what the Senators are so afraid of, but can one in conscience think of people being tortured?</p>
          <p eId="para_741">The CIA says that if one wants somebody tortured, one takes them to Jordan or Syria and if one wants them killed, one takes them to Egypt. This is on the record from a senior CIA operative. Look at the destinations of those flights. Where were they going?</p>

          <from>Mr. Lydon</from>
          <p eId="para_749">On 21 November 2005, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Mr. Terry Davis, wrote to the governments of all of the member states of the Council of Europe. Exercising his powers under Article 52 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the Secretary General sought from each state an explanation of "the manner in which its internal law ensures the effective implementation" of certain provisions of the convention. This was done against the background of, and I quote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_750">. . . recent reports suggesting that individuals, notably persons suspected of involvement in acts of terrorism, may have been apprehended and detained, or transported while deprived of their liberty, by or at the instigation of foreign agencies, with the active or passive cooperation of High Contracting Parties to the Convention or by High Contracting Parties themselves at their own initiative, without such deprivation of liberty having been acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">There are two parts to this request. The first part asks for an explanation of the adequacy of domestic law relating to unacknowledged deprivation of liberty and the activity of foreign agencies. The second part asks whether any public official or "person acting in an official capacity" has been involved in any unacknowledged deprivation of liberty during the period since 1 January 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">The actions of all persons in the territory of Ireland are governed by Irish law, including those relating to the deprivation of liberty. Irish law confers specified privileges and immunities upon certain representatives of other states and international organisations, which could present a procedural bar to the enforcement of Irish law against such persons. These are diplomats and representatives of some international bodies which are given special remission. In addition, Heads of State and Ministers for Foreign Affairs enjoy immunity while on Irish territory.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">It is appropriate to outline the controls which exist in respect of the acts of officials of foreign agencies who transit Irish territory by aircraft. The law applicable to both civil and state aircraft is somewhat different. With regard to civilian aircraft in flight, Ireland's competence to exercise jurisdiction in cases of criminal offences committed on board foreign civilian aircraft is governed, as regards aircraft in flight, by the 1963 Tokyo Convention. Article 4 of the convention allows Ireland to exercise criminal jurisdiction <i>inter alia </i>in respect of such offences committed on Irish territory.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">When the aircraft is not in flight, the Tokyo Convention places no restriction on Ireland either investigating or claiming jurisdiction to prosecute in respect of a criminal offence appearing to have been committed on board an aircraft registered to another state. Civil aircraft used by foreign officials which land on Irish territory are not entitled to any state immunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">With regard to foreign state aircraft, it is a requirement of Irish law that prior permission must be sought for a foreign military aircraft to land on Irish territory. In such circumstances, the foreign military aircraft enjoys immunity from search by Irish officials unless permission is conditional upon the waiver of this immunity. Non-military state aircraft must also, in accordance with international law, seek permission to over-fly or land in Irish territory if immunities are to apply. If a person, who is believed to have committed an offence in Ireland, leaves the aircraft, he or she can be arrested, charged and prosecuted, including for a crime committed against an Irish person on the aircraft, or an international crime, wherever committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">Article 40.4.1° of the Constitution provides that "No person shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law". Under Irish law the deprivation of a person's liberty can only take place in defined circumstances. There is no concept in Irish law of a detention, which is simultaneously both lawful and secret. Irish law provides numerous mechanisms to prevent an unlawful deprivation of liberty.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">There are only two circumstances in which Irish law permits lawful deprivation of liberty by foreign agents in Ireland and where the authorities of another State can detain a prisoner on Irish territory. Section 40(1) of the Extradition Act 1965, permits the transit through Irish territory of a person being conveyed from one country to another, pursuant to an agreement in the nature of an extradition agreement. In such a case, the transit must be consented to by the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and is subject to the relevant extradition provisions and any condition the Minister thinks proper. The Ireland-US extradition agreement of 2001 additionally permits detention of prisoners by officials of the United States as they pass through Ireland. However, the agreement at Article XV requires the consent of the State for each such transit.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may also consent to the transfer of a sentenced prisoner through Irish territory pursuant to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons 1983, when he is satisfied that Article 16 of that convention is applicable. It is not lawful for the Minister or the State to consent to the transit of a prisoner through Irish territory other than in the two circumstances I have outlined. All detention, whether secret or otherwise, which does not have the positive authorisation of law in the State, constitutes the criminal offence of false imprisonment.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">Section 33 of the Irish Air Navigation and Transport Act of 1988 provides that in a case where it is suspected that a crime is being committed on a civil aircraft, an authorised officer, which includes a member of the Garda Síochána, may, in the interest of the proper operation or the security or safety of an aerodrome, or the security or safety of persons, aircraft or other property thereon, arrest without warrant any person who assaults, or whom he or she reasonably suspects to have assaulted, another person.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">Section 49 of the Irish Air Navigation and Transport Act 1998 provides for an authorised officer to enter an aircraft in an Irish airport when he considers it necessary for the purpose of exercising any power conferred upon him by, or under, this Act, or the Act of 1988. Section 49(3) provides that the authorised officer may, at any time, require the operator or registered owner of the aircraft to produce for inspection by him such documents, relating to the aircraft or passengers or goods on board the aircraft, as he may require; or inspect the aircraft for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the relevant legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">The availability of <i>habeas corpus</i> application, the procedure for which is set out in Article 40.4.2° of the Constitution, provides a mechanism by which all forms of unlawful detention can be judicially challenged. This remedy is supported by the unenumerated constitutional right to communicate with the court for the purpose of making this application.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">When the request of the Secretary General refers to the possibility of the involvement in unacknowledged deprivation of liberty of any public official or person acting in an official capacity either by action or by omission, it raises two questions. Investigations have confirmed that no unacknowledged deprivation of liberty has occurred in any of the State's detention facilities as a result of an act of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. Similarly, investigations have revealed no instance of unacknowledged deprivation of liberty to have occurred in any of the State's detention facilities as the result of an omission of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">The Government is fully aware of its obligations to prevent involvement by omission in the unacknowledged deprivation of liberty, and to fulfil all its positive obligations in respect of this matter. As far as the Secretary General's request is concerned, the issue arises largely in the context of the transport of any individual while so deprived of their liberty, which has become known as "extraordinary rendition". When the Government became aware in 2004 of allegations regarding extraordinary rendition, urgent contact was made with the United States authorities, through both the US embassy in Dublin and the Irish embassy in Washington, to ensure that the Irish position was fully understood and respected.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">The Government sought and received assurances that prisoners had not been, nor would they be, transferred through Irish territory without the express permission of the Irish authorities. It was made clear that in conformity with the relevant domestic and international law, permission would not be granted for the transit of an aircraft participating in an extraordinary rendition operation or for any other unlawful act. The US authorities' assurances were subsequently reiterated in a number of meetings throughout 2005 and they were confirmed at a bilateral meeting in Washington D.C. between the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the US Secretary of State, Ms Condoleezza Rice, on 1 December 2005. They have been repeated at several meetings since. The Government accepts these assurances, which are of a particular clarity and completeness. They are factual and in no way qualified by any reference to the circumstances in which, or the purpose for which, any hypothetical prisoner might be transported.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">The Government has carefully considered the value of these assurances having regard to its obligations under the convention. It is satisfied it is entitled under the convention to rely on clear and explicit factual assurances given by the Government of a friendly state, on a matter which is within the direct control of the Government. Notwithstanding the US assurances, investigations have taken place, two of which were forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions. In neither case was any charge made.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The Government has fulfilled all of its positive obligations in respect of preventing unacknowledged deprivation of liberty, particularly with respect to any possible transport of individuals while deprived of their liberty. There is, therefore, no question of any public official or person acting in an official capacity being involved in such activity by omission.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">In no circumstances would the unacknowledged deprivation of liberty be legal in Ireland. In this respect, all of Ireland's obligations in respect of the European Convention on Human Rights are fulfilled. On 10 November 2005 the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, made clear the Government's very deep concern over allegations of the possible existence of secret prisons. On 14 December 2005, he recorded the Government's complete opposition to the practice of so-called extraordinary rendition. A thorough examination of practice throughout the State in response to the Secretary General's request has revealed no indication of the occurrence of either unacknowledged deprivation of liberty, or the transportation of any individual while so deprived of his liberty. This is entirely in keeping with the Government's stated position on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">Therefore, I see no reason for the establishment of a committee at this time. I have absolute faith in the Government and the Garda to investigate such matters if necessary. In response to a pervious speaker, who referred to the US not being a friendly state, I say when the chips are down we call on Uncle Sam.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_359">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_769">The previous speaker stated that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, had expressed his total opposition to a policy of rendition and also gave his view that the practice is not being facilitated by the State. This is what this important motion is about. It is not about party politics; it is a moral issue. It is deeply disappointing from the parliamentary point of view of Seanad Éireann and from a human rights perspective that it appears the Government has decided for political reasons that the Seanad cannot investigate this crucial human rights issue. I am getting signs from my colleagues across the floor that the Government has made no such indication and therefore it must be from the Government Members of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">On numerous occasions in the past three or four years we have debated the issues arising from the Iraq war and in particular the human rights ones. These debates were not held at the behest of any individual Member of the House. It was almost on a consensus basis that some months ago we decided informally to establish this committee. A small group of us representing each of the parties and the Independent group sat down to agree reasonable wording establishing an all-party committee to examine the vital issue of rendition. As Senator Ryan outlined in his opening remarks, the committee's job was not to act as judge or jury but simply to inquire, examining the issues and the reports already available, and try to achieve some knowledge of what might be happening at Irish airports. It was a responsibility this House should have been honoured to take on. Senators should have a special duty to ensure respect for human rights at home and abroad. Where they are concerned, rendition must be considered in detail, since it breaches human rights on a massive scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">We are all aware that in recent years we have been in the midst of what some term a war on terror or terrorism and others a clash of civilisations. Undoubtedly, a case can be made that democracy must be defended and freedom advanced. I fully agree with the idealistic goal of defending democracy and trying to spread it, since it is the great guarantor and protector of civilisation at home and abroad.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_773">Unfortunately, one neither defends democracy nor advances freedom by losing the moral high ground. Once we start allowing, or closing our eyes and ears to the illegal practice of torture and the possibility of rendition, we are truly losing the human rights battle and the moral high ground that Western civilisations have traditionally claimed. For almost 50 years after the Second World War, there was a clash of ideology on the European continent. On one side of the Berlin Wall was the communist system of government, while on the other was an open, politically-free and market-driven economic project. However, the essential difference between those two governmental systems was that one allowed human rights, democracy and freedom to flourish, while the other did not. In the end, it was unsurprising that freedom won out.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">I am greatly concerned that, as we look across today's world at what some call the clash of civilisations, to win the so-called battle, those who proclaim most loudly that they are advancing freedom and democracy have thrown away their moral compass, reducing themselves to practices outside civilised norms. The committee that we are attempting to establish in Seanad Éireann would investigate whether some of those illegal practices were facilitated or occurred at Irish airports.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">As some speakers have said, the subject is currently being discussed at the Council of Europe, and several colleagues, including Senator Ormonde, would have attended the most recent plenary session a few weeks ago, where the rapporteur on the matter, Senator Dick Marty, presented his interim report. It is of course fair to say that the report probably raised more questions than it answered. However, it was the start of a process, and the Council of Europe expects each of its member states to respond and clarify the issues raised by the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">We in this committee could have played a role in that process. In a sense, we were being asked to do no more than the Government should have been doing. Senator Norris outlined his grave disquiet at some of the answers the Government has apparently given, and we must take on board much of what he has said. A significant body of opinion suggests that our airports are being used in a manner that the vast majority of citizens would neither accept nor wish to see. We should have been able to establish a committee in this House to ask the hard questions and determine the real position. It would have been in everyone's interest if we could have done so. No one gains from the current situation whereby we are expected to ask the US Government for an answer without any independent method of verification.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">It is my deepest and dearest wish for us to conduct such an inquiry in full, investigating and examining all the claims made to us, ultimately finding that there is no practice of rendition, extraordinary or otherwise, through Shannon. Unfortunately, if we as a parliamentary group cannot even begin to ask the questions, we will remain in a fog of confusion and doubt. The questions of right versus wrong, morality versus immorality, torture and the abuse of human rights will only lead to further despair and disaster. We elected Members, guardians of the Constitution, have a duty to ask every possible question, using whatever mechanism is available to us, regarding any degree of attack on the human rights of citizens on our soil or those passing through our country. Those issues must be raised and the attacks ended.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">I hope that, given the very reasonable and fair motion before us and the all-party agreement that obtained up to a few weeks ago, we might re-enter that spirit and establish a committee of which this House and the Irish public might be proud.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_362">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_779">I join previous speakers in welcoming the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Treacy, and his officials to the House. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this grave topic.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">When the Council of Europe reported on alleged secret detentions, it was careful to set out the context of its work at the start. Senator Marty was particularly struck by the fact that it was in the United States that discussions on this topic first really took off. We must recognise that this is not a case of Europe preaching down to the US from the moral high ground, asking them to take heed and open their eyes. I cannot reiterate enough the importance of separating the legitimate concerns of the Irish people about the activities of governments and agencies from tunnel-visioned, irrational, anti-American, ill-founded rants. It does not serve this House, or the interests of the rightly concerned public, if we descend into the latter.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">As I said, it was in light of an article in <i>The Washington Post</i> and a report by Human Rights Watch published last November that the international media reported allegations that the CIA is or was running a system of secret prisons, including prisons in certain “central and east European democracies”.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">The point most specific to our debate today is that aircraft chartered by the CIA allegedly flew over, to and from European territory, benefiting, therefore, from airport facilities including Shannon Airport, to transport suspects, completely illegally, to those secret centres. Senator Marty's report to the Council of Europe is very careful and precise in its use of language, and I encourage all to follow suit.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">The Opposition motion refers to "recent reports that US aircraft [are] landing at Irish airports [and] may have been used to transport person to locations where they may be at risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment". It refers to recent reports and not to evidence. While there have been allegations and reports, there has been no evidence. While I do not suggest that Members suspend their concern or suspicions — I certainly will not — contributions should be made on the basis of what is known. Without entering Donald Rumsfeld's world of "known unknowns" and "unknown unknowns", Members should restrict themselves to first discussing what they know and second how best to reveal that which they do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">The Opposition motion suggests that a select committee of this House, known as the Select Committee on the Use of Irish Airports, and consisting of seven Senators would make a valuable contribution to this second objective. Without creating any possible negative ripples in our important and beneficial relationship with the United States, I am unsure whether anyone can say with certainty that either of these propositions are absolutely true. I can state that the claim in this House on 2 March by Senator Norris that the select committee "on rendition flights through Shannon Airport [was] disestablished by ... the Government ... on the basis there was nothing to examine" is absolutely untrue.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">Members will be aware that I worked on drafting the terms of reference for the proposed select committee and was pleased to so do. Hence, I will make my point as clearly as possible. The select committee was not convened because a majority in this House did not support it and not because a majority in this House felt there was nothing to examine. I share the view expressed by the Leader of the House on 1 March "that it was not my wish that [the issue] was ending in this manner". I consider that this House was done a disservice by pursuing a process towards establishing the select committee so far and so publically. However, I am not inclined to undermine this House by proposing defiance of its determination and the will of the majority.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">Returning to the substantive issue, namely, the value of another investigation, Members should, as I suggested, consider what is known. Senator Marty's report for the Council of Europe noted that he was informed of the many questions to the Government and the replies received. The Government expressed its total condemnation of the practice of what has been termed "extraordinary renditions" to the investigation and stated that it had never authorised any overflight of Irish territory by chartered aircraft for that purpose. Interestingly, references to Ireland constituted just five lines of his 25 page report.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">What else is known? The United States has given Ireland repeated, clear and explicit assurances that no prisoners have been nor would be transferred through Irish territory without Ireland's permission. In December and several other times, the Secretary of State, Dr. Rice, has confirmed these assurances. Ireland was one of only three countries to receive categorical and unqualified assurances on the non-use of its territory for rendition. As far as the Government is concerned, Shannon Airport is not used in any way for extraordinary rendition. The report to the Council of Europe verifies this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">The role of the Oireachtas must not be confused with that of the Garda Síochána and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Those bodies make the independent determination as to whether there is enough evidence in respect of reports and allegations. Our system of justice and separation of powers is in place for specific and important reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">This brings me to third point in the Opposition's motion, namely, the mechanisms to investigate allegations. I understand that the Attorney General has strongly advised the Government that the Garda Síochána has the legal basis to board planes and investigate. Furthermore, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform assured the Oireachtas and the public that the Garda has full power to board civilian chartered aircraft such as those about which many of these allegations have been made. As for the value of any select committee, its objectives and capabilities would be obliged to clearly extend beyond those of both the investigation by Senator Marty and the work undertaken by Mr. Terry Davis. Members must also consider the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committees on European Affairs and Foreign Affairs and any sub-committees envisaged by those bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">The Government continues to follow the long-standing practice whereby details supplied by the United States authorities to the Department of Foreign Affairs are accepted in good faith as being accurate. While the Opposition Members will undoubtedly decry this practice, I warn them to be careful as to where their logic might lead them. If Ireland was to take a stance on ceasing any engagement with any entity or operation that in any way facilitates the running of a military operation, it could have serious and unforeseen consequences. Should we ask Intel, Hewlett Packard or Microsoft to cease operation in this country because armies employ their technology, such as microchips, computers and operating systems? Should we ask Pfizer, Abbott, Wyeth and all our pharmaceutical companies——</p>

          <p eId="para_795">The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Treacy, is welcome to the House. I am particularly glad of his presence, as he listens to debates. I hope to speak in a moderate tone on this issue. I can remember an advertisement which appeared long before the Minister of State's birth. I believe it was for Palmolive soap and its slogan, "what even your best friends are unwilling to tell you", pertained to body odour. While I apologise for bringing the subject up, I do so because I regard myself as a very good friend and admirer of the United States and am particularly conscious of the economic and social ties that bind us so closely together. However, there are times when one is obliged to state that one considers that one's friend may be making a mistake.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">As I also noted the last time I spoke on this matter, one does one's friends no service by pretending they have no shortcomings. It is indeed part of the role of a friend to gently point to where a person has gone wrong, if indeed he or she has done so. While one should be loyal to one's friends and give them the benefit of any doubt, this does not mean closing one's eyes to reality. I believe that the concept of "my friend, right or wrong" has no place in friendship.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">While in the United States last month, I expressed unease regarding the rumours and suggestions of possible torture in Guantanamo and elsewhere. I was surprised at the reaction of some former senior American administrators, who informed me that such actions did not run counter to their constitution, as it only protected their own citizens. I had never heard such an argument before. It would be useful to have a debate on that subject and the United States should be glad to hear it.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">I wish to add my support to this doomed motion and to tell those Members who oppose it that their action is short-sighted and not in the interests of those they seek to protect. As Senator Bradford has spoken well on this subject, I will not repeat it. If democracy means anything at all, it means a readiness to discuss difficult subjects. Hopefully, one discusses them in a reasonable way while basing one's case on genuine evidence. However, a disservice is done to democracy if one attempts to sweep difficult issues under the carpet in its name. I believe this is in danger of happening with regard to this matter. Democracy demands that one is always ready to hear both sides of an argument, however much one might disagree with the other side. Democracy is always ill-served when a majority uses its strengths to stifle debate. The history of Northern Ireland has something to teach us in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">One of the reasons used by Members to justify the Seanad's existence to a highly sceptical outside audience is the promotion of this House as a place where reasoned discussion can take place and where people can come together in a less adversarial way than is usually the case in politics. That is one of the reasons why guillotine motions are so rarely imposed in this House. I believe this greatly enriches our legislative system, given that Committee Stage debates of many Bills in the Dáil are truncated by the use of the guillotine. I would have hoped, therefore, in this safe House that people would have shown themselves big enough to allow the formation of the sub-committee proposed in this motion. The fact that this is not so means that this is a bad day, not just for democracy in general but for the reputation of this House in particular.</p>

Like the Senator I too would consider myself a friend of the American people and like him I was there a few months ago and was staggered — one does not get this impression from the American television media — at how many people are so alarmed by the situation into which they have got regarding Guantanamo Bay, regarding the possibility of people being sent for extraordinary rendition, the fact that there have been such abuses carried out by American and other personnel in the prisons in Iraq and the fact the Iraqis seem to be running a regime for the thousands in their prisons far worse than that which was run by the former regime of Saddam Hussein. They are worried about the infiltration of Iranian militia into the south of the country and the fact that there are now so few journalists on location to report on it. I was there at a time when one of the last American journalists working in that part of Iraq was shot dead. No wonder we do not hear about Basra because there are no journalists there anymore to tell us about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">We must take on some responsibility for telling our friends that we think they are making a serious mistake. It is clear they have already lost the battle in promoting human rights and democracy. When one now goes anywhere in that part of the world one finds Americans who say they pretend they are Canadians. I have never known of Americans in the past being anything other than enormously proud of the fact that they were Americans. I understand what people are saying about our significant economic dependence on America but it will not do to let them go to hell in a hand-cart, because this is what is happening at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">When we speak of torture I sometimes wonder if people really take in what we are speaking about. The other day I read the forms of torture to which people who have been sent for extraordinary rendition said they were subjected. One of course is hanging up by the arms, which does not sound too uncomfortable until one realises that people are frequently hung by their arms tied behind their back. If one wonders why Senator John McCain, although a member of the Republican Party, speaks out repeatedly against extraordinary rendition and Guantanamo Bay, it is because that is how he was treated when he was in Vietnam — one may notice he is no longer able to raise his arms above a certain level. This is someone who has stated that when he was tortured by the Vietnamese and they would ask him for the names of his platoon and battalion, he used recite the names of various baseball teams because it was all he could remember. His objection to torture is that he thinks it is useless. I am sure he has humanitarian reasons as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">There are people who are subjected to water-boarding. This is where they are held on a board, submerged, head backwards, into vats of water so that they think they are drowning and pulled out at the last moment. The following occur in the countries to which people are sent for extraordinary rendition: the pulling out of finger-nails, which has been going on for years; electric shocks to genitalia and lips; beating of the soles of the feet; beating of the back; beating of the soft parts of the body so that internal tissues are damaged, which is serious because it can cause internal bleeding, etc.; and keeping people in uncomfortable positions, not for ten minutes but for months, where they can neither stand up nor stretch out, in dank, cold conditions without sanitation, and frequently naked. When we ask that we want to be sure nothing like this with which we could in any way be involved could happen to people, many of us want to speak out as well on the entire practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">While of course I understand the extent to which the economic situation troubles Senators on the other side of the House, those in America to whom I spoke are desperately worried about what happened, for example, to the young Syrian computer engineer from Canada who was taken off an airplane in Boston and held for ten months in such conditions in Syria. He now cannot work, cannot go on airplanes and says that while he is grateful when people tell him — his case was all over the Canadian and international newspapers — in supermarkets how sorry they are for what happened to him, all he can do is cry. He says his life is over, and he is in his thirties.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Treacy)</from>
          <p eId="para_805">Tá mé lán sásta freastal ar an ábhar an-tábhachtach cuimsithe idirnáisiúnta seo. Táimid an-buíoch don Fhreasúra gur chúir sé an rún tábhachtach seo faoi bhráid an Tí seo agus go bhfuilimid le chéile chun díospóireacht a bheith eadrainn air.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">I welcome this opportunity to address the Seanad on this most sensitive issue. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have on numerous occasions made clear in Dáil Éireann the Government's complete opposition to the practice of so-called extraordinary rendition. It is my privilege to do likewise here in Seanad Éireann, not alone on my own behalf but also on behalf of my party and on behalf of the Government. Consistent with this opposition, the Government is determined to ensure that all of our obligations to protect human rights, under both international and domestic laws, are fulfilled. There can be no question of sacrificing human rights in the fight against terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The question before the Seanad this evening is, however, more specific. It is whether this House should establish a select committee on extraordinary rendition and the use of Irish airports. According to the terms of the Private Members' motion, the select committee would consider four points, namely allegations relating to certain landings at Irish airports, the way in which the State can determine the purpose of different flights, the way in which the State can investigate allegations in this area and the adequacy of Irish laws in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">I recommend that Senators not support this motion for the following reasons. First, comprehensive investigations on extraordinary rendition are already underway in the Council of Europe and the European Parliament. It is difficult to see what value an additional inquiry here would add to these investigations. Second, Ireland, along with only two other European countries, has received specific, categoric and unqualified assurances on this issue from the United States authorities that prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Third, it is clear from the recent report published by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe that Ireland's practices with respect to dealing with the different categories of aircraft that land at Irish airports are fully in line with those of our partners. Fourth, and most significantly, I would emphasise the complete lack of any specific evidence that the law has been breached at Irish airports in any way. Indeed, there are not even any concrete or particular individual allegations. Finally, one week before we celebrate in Washington D.C. the many links binding our two countries, I would invite Senators to consider for a moment the value that we all attach to Ireland's relationship with the United States. When all of these points are considered, I hope the House will agree that the proposed establishment of a select committee is unwarranted and unnecessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">Senators will already have seen copies of the Government's comprehensive reply to a questionnaire on the subject of the possible unacknowledged deprivation of liberty circulated by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Mr. Terry Davis. In its reply, the Government confirmed that in answering the questionnaire it had unearthed no occurrence of unacknowledged deprivation of liberty, including in the context of extraordinary rendition. On 1 March last, just one week ago, the Secretary General released his preliminary analysis of the 46 replies which he had received. Ireland is one of only 13 countries whose replies the Secretary General deemed sufficiently comprehensive not to require clarification. His report shows that Ireland's practice is fully in line with that of all partners, and does nothing to undermine the value of the factual, categorical and unqualified assurances that we have received from the United States authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">The Government's reply makes clear that investigations have not been confined to the international level. In addition to the inter-departmental investigations that were occasioned in order to provide a comprehensive reply to the Secretary General, the Government's reply notes that three investigations were conducted by the Garda Síochána into complaints surrounding extraordinary rendition. In two cases, in accordance with standard procedures, papers were forwarded to the DPP. In neither case was any further action found to be warranted, owing to the inadequacy of the evidence that any unlawful activity had occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe is also conducting an inquiry, in addition to that of the Secretary General. Separate to the Council of Europe, the European Parliament has established a temporary committee to investigate allegations made in this area. The Government has stated it will co-operate to the fullest extent practicable with this investigation. There will, presumably, be a considerable overlap, between the investigation of the European Parliament and that of the Council of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">I would like to turn to the issue of the assurances that the Government has received from the United States authorities. When our Government became aware in 2004 of allegations regarding extraordinary rendition, urgent contact was made with the United States authorities to ensure that the Irish position was fully understood and respected. The Government sought and received explicit, categorical assurances that prisoners had not been, nor would they be, transferred through Irish territory, without the express permission of the Irish authorities. It was made clear that, in conformity with the relevant domestic and international laws, permission would not be granted for the transit of an aircraft participating in an extraordinary rendition operation or for any other unlawful act.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">The US authorities' assurances were confirmed by the Secretary of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, at a bilateral meeting in Washington, DC, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 1 December 2005 and they have been repeated at several meetings in 2006. The Government accepts these assurances, which are of a particular clarity and completeness. That only two other European countries have received bilateral assurances of such a categorical nature only goes to emphasise their credibility and solidity. The assurances do not depend on any interpretation of what is or is not legal under international law, as they relate to a simple question of fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">The Government has carefully considered the value of these assurances having regard to our obligations under international law. The Government is satisfied that it is entitled under international law to rely on clear and explicit factual assurances given by the government of a friendly state, on a matter which is within the direct control of that government. Contrary to what some have suggested, the case law of the European Court of Human Rights does not hold that diplomatic assurances cannot be relied on in such a situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">Aside from regular scheduled airline flights, US aircraft visiting Ireland can be divided into three categories: military aircraft, troop transports — civil aircraft, which have been chartered by the US military — and private civil aircraft of the type alleged to be involved in extraordinary rendition flights. Military-state aircraft form a specific class of aircraft, which require permission to land in Ireland. Once permission is granted, such aircraft are immune from search in accordance with the internationally accepted principle of state immunity. There is no suggestion that this category of aircraft has any involvement in extraordinary rendition. Troop transports, similarly, are not mentioned in the allegations concerning extraordinary rendition. These aircraft, which are treated as normal civil aircraft for the purposes of search and inspection, are required to seek permission to land in Ireland, owing to the fact that troops they are transporting tend to travel with their personal weapons.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">The final category of aircraft comprises mainly small business jets. In accordance with the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, civil aircraft making unscheduled flights such as these may land for technical stops such as refuelling without a requirement for permission. Thousands of such aircraft pass through Ireland every year. As with the troop transports, the Garda is fully entitled to search these aircraft if it has a reasonable belief that a crime is being committed on board. This right of search derives from a number of sources, including our Constitution, the common law and the air navigation Acts and it is described in detail in the Government's reply to the Council of Europe questionnaire. It has been suggested by some, that the lack of a power of search, contained in the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Act 2000, somehow undermines the right of the Garda to search these aircraft but this is patently untrue. The fact that legislation may not contain search powers does nothing to undermine the fact that they exist and are derived from other sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">The Secretary General's report and inquiries by our embassies abroad, confirm that Ireland's practice is squarely in line with that of other partners in respect of all three categories of aircraft. Not least given the quality of the assurances that we have received, it would not be wise or appropriate for Ireland alone to depart from standard international practice. Secretary General Davis has, in very general terms, suggested that such practice be reviewed. He says he will in due course make concrete proposals. If and when he does so, we will carefully examine them with our partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">Those opposed to the Government's position in this debate, have highlighted that, to date, the Garda has not searched any aircraft for prisoners or signs that prisoners may have been transported. They have suggested it is the fault of the Government that such a search has not occurred. We are fortunate that we do not live in a society where searches are carried out or prosecutions launched at the bidding of the Government. The Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions have the independent capacity to launch a criminal process, if the grounds exist for them to do so but the reality is there is a complete lack of evidence of illegal activity. A striking feature of most of the allegations made in this area is their vague and circumstantial character. They depend on the retrospective imposition of a pattern of activity on a range of data long after the alleged event and long after any conceivable action, could have been taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">The most frequently repeated, specific allegation with which everybody will be familiar is that on 18 February 2003, a Gulfstream jet, which had delivered Abu Omar, who had been seized in Milan, to Cairo landed at Shannon on its return leg to Washington DC. Even this allegation accepts the fact that no prisoner was on board, as the aeroplane came through. The allegations as to the previous activities of this aeroplane are substantiated, it is claimed, although no supporting materials have been provided, by the retrospective interpretation of flight logs and FAA data. Even if they are true, it would have been entirely impossible at the time, to have known of the aircraft's involvement in an earlier extraordinary rendition operation, as it passed empty though Ireland. Moreover, it is impossible to verify or control the previous or future activities, which might take place outside our jurisdiction, before or after an empty aeroplane passed through. In what way do the Government's critics suggest that any action they recommend would have had the slightest practical impact in this case?</p>
          <p eId="para_821">There is nothing of significance in the recent release of flight data by the British Ministry of Defence. The aircraft mentioned have been the subject of media reports over a long period and their landings at Shannon Airport were confirmed to Dáil Éireann in December 2005 in reply to a parliamentary question by the Minister for Transport. In his reply, the Minister informed the House that these aircraft landed at Shannon for technical purposes, namely, they were technical or refuelling stops, to which I have alluded. In accordance with the 1944 Chicago Convention, civil aircraft may land in Ireland for technical stops without notifying the Department of Transport. Thousands of such aircraft pass through Ireland every year. There is nothing in the newly released data to contradict or undermine the specific or categoric assurances we have received from the US authorities that prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory nor would they be without our permission.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">I referred to the quality of the assurances we have received from the United States authorities, but I would like to touch on the value of our relationship with that country. Ireland has derived substantial economic benefit from its close relations with the USA. It is our largest export market and the main source of foreign direct investment. The commitment that the US has shown in nurturing the peace process in Ireland is witnessed in tangible form by its contribution of $458 million to the International Fund for Ireland, since 1986, an average of $28 million per annum. It is not just about money. Among other things, the US is home to millions of people of Irish birth and descent, including the undocumented, on whose behalf the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs will lobby next week. We receive ongoing active and constructive support from the US for the peace process in Northern Ireland. This support, from both Republican and Democratic administrations over the years and from both sides of Congress, has played a profoundly important role in underpinning the peace process on this Island.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">In March 2003, Dáil Éireann voted to endorse the Government's decision to continue the long-standing practice of making landing facilities available to US military aircraft at Shannon Airport. I know this is appreciated in Washington, and only last week, President Bush availed of the facilities on a stop-over. The transit through Shannon of US forces, on their way to Iraq is covered by a number of UN Security Council resolutions, dating back to 2003. The most recent of these was agreed by the Security Council, unanimously, on 8 November 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">Despite our closeness to the United States, this does not mean that though friends we are in any way unwilling or hesitant to convey clear views on issues of concern. We have done so consistently, I have spoken to the United States ambassador on such issues and we constantly communicate our position at the highest level, from the Taoiseach to the President, from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Secretary of State and across all diplomatic levels. We have made clear that we do not believe that extraordinary rendition is justifiable in any circumstances. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has made clear our belief that the Guantanamo facility, should be closed. This has been made clear publicly and privately.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">We come to a view on the merits of each particular situation. In this instance, it is emphatically not the case that we are unduly or unreasonably influenced by our relationship with the United States. However, it would be irresponsible for any Government, in the absence of a good and sound reason for doing so, to act as if it did not believe clear assurances, which have been repeated at very high levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The situation with which the Government is faced with respect to extraordinary rendition and the use of Irish Airports is twofold. On the one hand, we have categoric, specific assurances from the Government of a country with which we enjoy exceptionally close relations that prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be without our permission. On the other hand, we have a loose collection of unsubstantiated allegations which claim to cast doubt on these assurances but are unsupported by any evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">Given this situation, I trust Senators will agree that there is no reason to change Government policy in this area. Furthermore, I urge, following my description of the different investigations already under way along with the quality of the assurances we have received from the US Authorities, the lack of evidence of any misuse of Irish Airports and the fact that our practice is completely in line with that of our partners, that this House reject the motion to establish a select committee. I trust that this puts the matter in full context for all members of the House.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_370">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_828">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. The last time he was here when I was speaking, I mentioned that he was the Minister of State with responsibility for delivering the Lisbon Agenda on competitiveness throughout the country, an extensive package of reforms. Now we hear his extensive knowledge of Iraq and the issues surrounding it. I was, therefore, interested in what he had to say in the context of this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">I support my colleagues in the House who have sought the establishment of a select committee and I will explain my reason for this support. It is important to state that this country has friendly and good relations with the United States of America and its people for good reason. Nobody suggests that as a sovereign independent republic we should trade this off against the historic and long-standing relationship we have had with the US.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I support the United States of America. It was America that came to Europe at its gravest hour, that put in place the international, multilateral approach after the Second World War that led to the establishment of the United Nations, that helped fund the rebuilding of Europe after the ravages of fascism in the 1940s and late 1930s and that put in place an important international architecture of international law which has remained in force from the 1950s to date. I recognise all that is good in that multilateralism. However, in more recent years the drift of US foreign policy has not helped America or the world in terms of establishing a peaceful order and an international agreement on international rights that should be understood and recognised by all.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">I make a distinction with regard to the role of this House in the Government's right to have its programme implemented in the House and with regard to our not standing in the way of Government decisions and manifesto commitments. It is never the responsibility of the House to stand in the way of the Dáil when it comes to the implementation of Government policy. However, there is a fundamental distinction between the Government's right to implement its agreed programme and manifesto and the role of this House to ensure that fundamental human rights we all recognise are adjudicated in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">The Government has missed a glorious opportunity in the context of Seanad reform by not accepting this motion.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_834">What is the Government afraid of? The Minister of State speaks about the quality of assurances. Those assurances are from one government to another, not from one Parliament to another. I do not understand the Government's difficulty with allowing the establishment of a select committee that would ensure this House could come to the same set of conclusions as the Minister has on the basis of assurances he has got from the Executive of another state.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">I have an open mind on the issue. If, tomorrow, we had a select committee established with a Government majority and it came to the same conclusion as the Minister of State within a few months, that would be fine. What difficulty has the Government got in allowing the work of this House to fulfil its role in supporting fundamental international human rights? Why will it not allow the work of this committee to commence and come to some conclusions?</p>
          <p eId="para_836">It is important to establish this committee. If the Government prevents this basic reform and approach, we have a bigger problem on our hands, namely, the problem of the reform of the Seanad. I have said previously that unless this House reforms itself, it should be abolished. The timescale for reform has long since come to an end. The view of all Members of this House when it met after the last Seanad election was that there should be reform. We put in place a reform committee that produced excellent proposals. We now see a way of implementing those proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">The problem now is that we cannot seriously talk about reform of the House unless the Government is prepared to allow the Seanad to come to its own conclusion on matters such as the establishment of a select committee. I question the intention of the Government to bring about serious reform of this House if it uses its blocking majority to oppose what is an innocuous select committee being established to examine this important matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">The people of the Shannon region would be more than happy to see this committee in place or to allow this Parliament to do its job. I refer Government Senators to the clear commitment in the Standing Orders of the House that select committees are to be established in this House to report to it in a forthright and immediate way on any matter of concern brought to its attention. I have much more faith in the Members of this House and their ability to make honest conclusions than some Government Senators. I have much more confidence in the Members of this House to do their job, but unfortunately the Government refuses to allow the Seanad to do its constitutional job. In that process, it is ruining the prospect of Seanad reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">Unless this House reforms itself and shows itself relevant to the issues raised by ordinary citizens on a constant basis, it will soon be abolished. As important as this motion is, that is the message I would like to pass on. We must reform this House and the tangible, demonstrable way to start that process is to accept this motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanDaly" eId="spk_373">
          <from>Mr. Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_840">Leaving aside the main issue, reference was made earlier to this motion and the creation of an all-party committee. Senator Ryan, though he may not have intended to, gave some indication of the difficulties with this when he mentioned the fact that the motion was being rejected before Members knew its contents. Perhaps if Members had been more informed this situation would not have arisen. If one wants to set up an all-party committee, a party that is expected to be part of that committee should be allowed to give some indication of its views on the matter. I listened carefully to Senator Minihan and presume that before he was involved in the discussion about setting up such a committee, he sought guidance and advice from members of his party.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">The Leader of the House explained at the conclusion of the discussion she had with the Opposition about this motion that many of the Fianna Fáil Senators were not fully aware of its contents or objectives. They were being asked to take part in an all-party committee without all-party conclusions. I would be concerned about a committee of this type and fully endorse what the Minister of State has said tonight. I was a member of the Council of Europe when the initial frenzy in the media commenced on this and related issues. It commenced in November 2005 when an article appeared in the <i>The Washington Post</i>, containing information provided by Human Rights Watch.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">I would have concerns about information from Human Rights Watch. The human rights watch taking place at Shannon involves one or two individuals under cover of darkness with binoculars at the perimeter fences of Shannon Airport, supplying aeroplane registration numbers when we have at the disposal of the Council of Europe and the European Parliament, details of all flights from Eurocontrol and, if necessary, from the satellite communication system of the Council of Europe, based in Spain.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">The initial complaint in <i>The Washington Post</i>, on foot of information from Human Rights Watch, did not concern renditions but allegations that secret detention centres had been set up by the CIA in Poland and Romania. The Polish and Romanian authorities immediately rejected that allegation, as did those in the Czech Republic, Armenia, Georgia and other countries in central and eastern Europe. On foot of those allegations, the Council of Europe undertook the initial investigation, under the Secretary General, Mr. Terry Davis. The European Parliament is also engaged in an investigation and Deputy Coveney is taking part in that. It would be very unwise to rely, as Senator Norris appeared to, on the evidence of an ex-member of the CIA. I do not know where he met him or what discussions he had with him, but I would be very wary of anything the CIA would tell me with regard to renditions or secret detention centres. A thorough investigation of the issue was undertaken by a number of Departments <i>vis-à-vis</i> the questions raised by the Council of Europe. A response was given and it has been accepted by Mr. Davis that Ireland is one of the few countries where no further questions or doubt arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">There is widespread confusion with regard to what takes place at Shannon and the Minister of State has clarified the situation this evening. The public would be well advised to read carefully the information the Minister of State has put on the record. There is an idea abroad that diplomatic immunity, that is the immunity conferred on diplomats, Heads of State, Foreign Ministers and others who travel through or operate here, applies equally to operators of civilian aircraft that may be used by the CIA. No such diplomatic immunity applies to officials of foreign aircraft. Immunity does not apply to flights other than those that are cleared by the Department of Foreign Affairs and for which notification and all necessary details regarding those on board is supplied.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">I live closer to Shannon Airport than most of the people who have spoken this evening. I have been through the airport on countless occasions and have represented the area since 1973. There has never been any suggestion that prisoners on their way to Guantanamo Bay or other places of detention are being transferred through Shannon. There is no evidence of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">I would not be a party to the type of activity we have seen by those who are putting misinformation into the public domain. They are the very same people who protested in Shannon, broke down perimeter fences, damaged aeroplanes, frightened people who were boarding flights, caused untold damage in the vicinity of the airport and did a disservice to the issues involved here, whether they relate to American troops on charter flights, the President of the United States of America or anybody else. As an indication of the public support for their attitude and their unfounded, wild allegations, which have been examined and rejected by the Director of Public Prosecutions, four people turned up to protest when the President of the United States was going through Shannon last weekend. The public in Shannon are well aware of the facts but it is important that there is no confusion between those with foreign diplomatic immunity and other personnel going through the airport on civilian aircraft.</p>

          <p eId="para_847">The Minister of State referred to the investigations on extraordinary renditions that have been set up the Council of Europe and the European Parliament and said that it "is difficult to see what value an additional inquiry here would add to these investigations". I have just read the working document of the temporary committee of the European Parliament on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners, which directly contradicts what the Minister of State said. The working document of the committee states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_848">On the basis of the answers given to the Council of Europe, EU National Parliaments and Parliaments of relevant third countries should be invited, through their committees responsible for the Control of Secret Services, to answer the questions contained in the Temporary Committee mandate:</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_852">iv. Have EU/EC law, national legislation, international/bilateral conventions been violated?</p>
          <p eId="para_853">Not only does the mandate envisage the committee liaising with national parliaments but that Ireland will have its own committee to inquire into the subject matter. It also states, "Furthermore, the Presidents of National Parliaments should be invited to provide information on current or past parliamentary enquires on the matters provided by the Temporary Committee mandate". Assuming the Taoiseach is the "president" of our Parliament, he will send a representative to the committee to provide information on our current and past parliamentary inquiries on the matters covered by the temporary committee mandate. The committee proposed in the motion has already been foreseen by the temporary committee's mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">What the Minister of State said is undermined by the temporary committee's mandate. He claimed the Council of Europe report shows Ireland's practice is fully in line with that of all partners, and does nothing to undermine the value of the factual, categorical and unqualified assurances that we have received from the United States authorities. The Council of Europe report actually contradicts the Minister's statement. When Terry Davis, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, launched the report, he said, "These obligations are of a positive nature, which means that the member states are obliged to actively prevent such human rights violations from taking place, and not simply react if they stumble upon them accidentally".</p>
          <p eId="para_855">The report did pick up on Ireland. It claimed states are not systematically requested to provide passenger lists or cargo information, even though they could be. Terry Davis has stated the work of the report is not the end of the process but the beginning. For all countries involved, legal safeguards, frameworks, etc., need to be put in place. The taking away of personal liberty must be made a criminal offence. A legal framework must be introduced for the activities of foreign agents.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">As Senator Brian Hayes pointed out, the ongoing work of the Council of Europe report will require the Oireachtas to do its job as a legislative body. It may well require us to put in place additional legislative provisions. If the proposed committee is established, it will inform our work as legislators. The Minister of State trusts Senators will agree that there is no reason to change Government policy in this area. The motion proposes for Members to do their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">It is not a radical proposal; it has to do with reform. Although there are calls for the Seanad to be abolished, it is recognised that it has done important work in the past. It is absurd that Government Senators will not agree to this motion because they could well be doing themselves out of a job.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">At the launch of the Council of Europe report Terry Davis stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_859">. . . hardly any country, with the clear exception of Hungary, has any legal provisions to ensure an effective oversight over the activities of foreign security services on their territory. In Hungary, the competent authorities are instructed by law to detect any activities of foreign secret services interfering with or threatening the sovereignty, or the political, economic or other important interest of Hungary.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">There is evidence that such foreign service activity is occurring. If it was not a fact, these inquiries in the Council of Europe and the European Parliament would not have been conducted. If such activity is going on in Ireland, it undermines our sovereignty in a unilateral way. The Government is ceding our sovereignty to the United States.</p>

          <p eId="para_866">To establish such a committee is irrelevant, particularly in light of the existence of the Council of European and European Parliament committees which have Irish representation and are receiving the full co-operation of the Government. These committees will have much greater powers in getting information and intelligence-gathering because their remits are European-wide. What additional purpose would the proposed Irish committee serve? It will only fan the flames of the anti-American agenda.

          <p eId="para_872">Such a committee would be used by certain opponents of the United States, as indicative that the Government has taken sides with the US, thereby, ignoring our neutral stance. For 50 years, Shannon Airport has been used by military blocs; during the Cold War, the Russians used the airport when they were not flavour of the month through all sorts of atrocities.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">There were no objection from the revisionists at the time who now seek to change Government policy on US military flights through Shannon Airport. The committee is a backdoor way of getting at the flights. It would establish an unhelpful witch-hunt.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">The agenda is not about extraordinary rendition or torture on Irish soil. It has more to do with an agenda associated with military flights through Shannon Airport. The issue of extraordinary rendition and torture has been dealt with through the assurances, as the Minister of State outlined, given by the US Administration. I am prepared to accept those assurances in good faith. Not to accept them from a friendly nation and a country with which Ireland has enjoyed an enormous level of positive social and cultural interaction would be a setback.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">There was much talk about the necessity to maintain a good working relationship with the United States. Senator Quinn used the soap slogan about telling a friend of his or her body odour. An old saying is that if a friend needs to be told something, do not do it from the altar. There are diplomatic channels through which the Government has on many occasions managed to get its point across to the US Administration about the atrocities that have taken place in Europe. Senator Brian Hayes spoke about it being an innocuous committee. The House certainly does not have an innocuous image in the US.</p>

          <p eId="para_897">I will make my contribution in a bullet point fashion because there are a number of issues to be dealt with. Let us first get rid of the anti-American notion. I had the privilege of meeting Senator John McCain last September to talk about Irish illegals in America. Senator McCain is a brave American. He was the one who led the charge against his own Administration to ensure that American agents everywhere in the world were bound by American law. He did not believe he was being anti-American by insisting that America stand up for its principles.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">The debate about extraordinary rendition is about a lapse in standards on the part of the United States that it claims to support. None of us who criticised them were being anti-American. We support what America stands for and are asking that America stand for what it claims to stand for but it has singularly failed to do so. Let us get away from the anti-American aspect. I believe in the principles on which the American republic was founded.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">Let us then look to our friends in America. I had the great privilege to be involved in the protests against the war in Vietnam nearly 40 years ago. Those protests were led by the Irish Voice in Vietnam, which was presided over by Dan Breen, who was a founding member of Fianna Fáil and an inspiring figure for people in Fianna Fáil. He had no worries about upsetting his friends in America and did not listen to people whinging about American investment in Shannon when there was a principle of the oppression of a small country to be defended. That was the Fianna Fáil that used to be; the current Fianna Fáil is an entirely different animal.</p>

It is fine for the European Parliament and the Council of Europe to investigate it but it is not appropriate for the Irish Parliament. I know the reason for that. It is about parliamentary accountability. The Government does not want to establish a principle where Parliament would make it accountable for matters of foreign policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_981">I will be brief because I have a pretty definitive question to put to the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher. Like many people, I am concerned about the number of deaths on our roads. When I have read about road accidents in newspapers, I have often noticed that one of the vehicles involved has been a truck. I am conscious there have been many tragic accidents involving pedestrians and trucks in recent years. The trucks involved have not necessarily been going that fast. A young woman was tragically killed by a truck in Carrigaline, County Cork, some years ago. I cannot remember the exact details of the accident, but I think she was walking with a child whom she was employed to mind when the child's pram got caught under the truck. She was pulled under the truck and killed, unfortunately, as she tried to save the child. There has been a number of similar accidents involving pedestrians in recent years. Many of the accidents about which I read seem to involve two or more vehicles, one of which is often a truck. I am concerned that many fatalities are caused in such circumstances. It seems to me that trucks are involved in fatal accidents to an exorbitant extent, but we need to analyse the figures in that regard before we make any decisions about the measures which need to be put in place. I understand that the Irish Road Haulage Association has called for legislation to impose additional safety measures on heavy goods vehicles. I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_442">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_982">Before I outline the many measures aimed at trucks, including legislative, regulatory, testing and enforcement measures, which are in place to improve road safety, I will give some statistics relating to collisions and fatalities. There were 334 fatal accidents and 374 fatalities, including 70 pedestrian fatalities, in 2004. There were 23 single vehicle fatal collisions involving goods vehicles and pedestrians in that year. Some 399 people lost their lives on the roads in 2005 and some 77 lives have been lost so far in 2006. As the statistics relating to 2005 and 2006, to date, have not yet been fully analysed, I am not in a position to say how many fatal collisions in those years have involved goods vehicles and pedestrians. An NRA study of the number of kilometres travelled by vehicles in Ireland in 2001 indicated that the average number of kilometres travelled by goods vehicles was significantly higher than the average number travelled by other vehicle types. There is no evidence that heavy goods vehicles are significantly more likely to be involved in road collisions. However, the consequences of a collision with a heavy goods vehicle are generally more severe than the consequences of a collision with a smaller type of vehicle, unfortunately.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">National regulations require speed limiters to be fitted to larger goods vehicles and buses so that their speed may not exceed 90 km/h and 100 km/h, respectively. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, recently made regulations to transpose Directive 2002/85/EC, which extends the requirement to have speed limiters fitted to goods vehicles with design gross vehicle weights exceeding 3,500 kg and to all passenger vehicles with more than eight passenger seats. The speed limiters are required to be set so that the speed of such vehicles may not exceed 90 km/h and 100 km/h, respectively. Notwithstanding the requirement to have a speed limiter fitted, goods vehicles with a design gross vehicle weight exceeding 3,500 kg and passenger vehicles with more than eight passenger seats are subject to an ordinary speed limit of 80 km/h, unless the road is subject to a lower speed limit.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">In accordance with EU requirements, trucks are required to undergo roadworthiness tests when they are one year old and annually thereafter. EU Directive 2000/30/EC, which deals with random roadside inspections of vehicles, requires member states to put in place a targeted system for the roadworthiness testing of heavy goods vehicles and buses at the roadside, to supplement the annual roadworthiness test which is carried out on such vehicles. The directive, which has been transposed into Irish law, requires the stopping of a significant number of such vehicles at random, checking for the annual roadworthiness certificate and carrying out checks on specified items, including brakes, emissions, tyres, lights, tachographs and speed limiters. The Department of Transport is actively engaged in augmenting the vehicle tester resources available to increase activity in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">EU law on maximum weights and dimensions for vehicles is set out in Directive 1996/53/EC. Under that directive, which has been fully implemented by Ireland, a member state may not prohibit the use in its territory of vehicles from another member state which comply with the authorised maximum weight and dimension limits set down in the directive. Vehicles which exceed the specified weights and dimensions, such as vehicles used for the transport of abnormal loads, require permits to operate on public roads. Such permits, which are issued by local authorities, may include limitations aimed to prevent unnecessary damage to public roads or which after consultation with the Garda they consider expedient to protect other road users.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">EU Directive 7l/320/EEC, as amended by Directive 98/l2/EC, lays down braking standards for type-approval of vehicles, including standards for anti-lock braking systems for large buses and lorries. While the standards are not mandatory for buses and lorries, the Minister is considering transposing the directive for such vehicles to make it a requirement that new vehicles of this kind registered here would be required to have anti-lock braking systems, in accordance with the directive. My Department is currently in consultation with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">The issue of blind spots in heavy goods vehicles has been much discussed of late. Directive 2003/97 lays down new standards for the type of approval of certain categories of vehicles, particularly lorries, regarding the field of vision of drivers and it requires that all new lorries meet the new standards from 26 January 2007. The directive, which has been transposed into Irish law, harmonises the rules relating to the type-approval of devices for indirect vision on motor vehicles and of vehicles equipped with these devices. It provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for an extension of the field of vision to address the issue of blind spots. These enhanced requirements should lead to a reduction in fatalities and serious injuries involving pedestrians and cyclists due to the driver’s inadequate field of vision.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">In April 2005, the Irish Road Haulage Association, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation were requested to consider advising their members to retrofit vehicles with blind spot mirrors or indirect vision devices. The Society of the Irish Motor Industry was also asked to ensure, in advance of the deadline for new vehicles on 26 January 2007, that all new HGVs put on the market meet the higher standards required by Directive 2003/97/EC. The Irish Road Haulage Association responded positively, indicating that for the past number of years it has actively encouraged its members to fit convex mirrors to their vehicles and to request these when acquiring new vehicles. The Society of the Irish Motor Industry informed me that it received a very positive response from vehicle distributors to the request for early implementation of the directive and it anticipates that by the end of March 2006, up to 80% of new vehicles of the relevant categories will meet the requirements of the directive.</p>
