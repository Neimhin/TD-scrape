            <p eId="para_13">I thank Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, for attending. I am a former Chairman of the health committee, which engaged in pre-legislative scrutiny of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 which became the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018. The Minister of State, who was a very valued member of the committee, is now Minister of State at the Department of Health. We have been waiting on the enactment of the minimum-pricing part of the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 since October 2018. If Members and people watching or listening to the proceedings today have observed the advertising of alcohol and alcohol being used as a loss leader by the retail sector over the last couple of months, they could only be but alarmed.</p>

            <p eId="para_15">It is every day, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. If one compares prices over a ten-year period, a bottle of Jameson is €20 today, while it was €26.99 in 2009. A 700 ml bottle of Smirnoff was €30.99 in 2009, while it is €22.49 today. A bottle of Bailey's is €10 today, while it was €18.60 in 2009. A bottle of Hennessey is €25 today, while it was €30.99 in 2009. A bottle of Bacardi is €15 today, while it was €24.99 in 2009. Those are just examples. I could have picked beer.</p>

            <p eId="para_16">I wish to add that I have seen ads for one of those brands with a 1 l bottle for €20.</p>

          <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_17">Yes. Some shops are advertising that a person can buy two for €20 or €30. I am not complaining about the retailers, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, but we have a problem with below-cost selling. I want to ensure local businesses survive and jobs are created. However, we have not dealt with the misuse of alcohol. I refer to the importance of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015. We had very stringent debates around particular sections of that Bill, now the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 in this House.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> We must have a sensible approach to alcohol, to the selling of alcohol, in terms of its pricing, and to the way in which we sell and serve alcohol. We must also ensure that the retail sector is responsible, and by and large, it is responsible.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> I refer to the price. VAT at 23% is included in the prices I mentioned. It demonstrates that VAT returns are being lost and what damage is being done. Young people now are buying alcohol more cheaply and more easily than a decade ago. The price of alcohol in our retail sector is very cheap.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> The alcohol Act was a roadmap which we, as a State, signed up to. I know we were waiting on Scotland and on the EU ruling.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> If one takes, for example, the loyalty card in Dunnes Stores, a person can get money back on a variety of goods, including alcohol. If a person spends €50, he or she may get €10 back. However, a person cannot use it on baby products. A mother or father buying nappies or baby products cannot use that.</p>

            <p eId="para_23">I try to be. What I am saying is that alcohol is so cheap and the retail sector is using it in the way I have described. Why can Dunnes, for example, not say to the mum and dad, the single mother, the two dads or the two mums that they may use the loyalty card to buy nappies or other baby products for their kids rather than alcohol?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Catherine Byrne)<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_25">I will address some of the questions Senator Buttimer raised. I thank him for raising this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> The Public Health (Alcohol) Act was enacted on 17 October 2018. On 1 November the Minister, Deputy Harris, commenced 23 of its 31 sections. Some of these sections have already become law. By restricting the advertising and promotion of alcohol, they are changing the environment in which our children will grow up.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> Last November three of the advertising provisions of the Act came into force. One provided that alcohol advertising in or on public service vehicles and at public transport stops and stations was prohibited. Alcohol advertisements were also prohibited from within 200 m of a school, crèche or local authority playground. Alcohol advertising in cinemas was prohibited except in a licensed area and around films with an 18 certificate. Children's clothing that promotes alcohol was banned.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> Next year, on 12 November, our supermarkets and other mixed retail outlets will look different as alcohol products and their advertising will be confined to either a single area of the shop which will be separated by a 1.2 m high barrier, or storage units in which alcohol products cannot be seen up to a height of 1.5 m, or a maximum of three standard storage units with no visibility restrictions. In addition to these areas of the shop, alcohol products will be allowed to be stored, but not be visible, in a unit behind the counter.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> From 12 November 2021 there will be a prohibition on alcohol advertising in sports areas during sporting events, at events that are aimed at children or at events in which the majority of participants or competitors are children. Alcohol sponsorship of events which are aimed at children or events in which the majority of participants or competitors are children will also be prohibited. Finally, driving or racing events involving motor vehicles will no longer be allowed to be sponsored by alcohol companies from November 2021.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> Eight sections of the Act have yet to be commenced. These include section 12, on the labelling of alcohol products, and section 13, on the content of advertisements for alcohol products. These two sections will not be commenced until the regulations which must be made under them have been finalised and submitted for assessment at EU level. Once those regulations have exited the EU process, the Minister, Deputy Harris, will commence the sections. Businesses will know well in advance exactly what their obligations will be in respect of the labelling and advertising of their products.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> We are determined to implement minimum unit pricing as soon as possible. When the Government of the day approved the drafting of a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill in 2013, it specified that implementation of minimum pricing should happen simultaneously both north and south of the Border in order to meet concerns about possible impacts on cross-Border trade. The suspended Administration in Northern Ireland has meant that our colleagues have not been able to progress their legislation. The coming weeks may see developments in this regard, but if the implementation of minimum unit pricing continues to be delayed, the Minister for Health intends to seek a revised Government decision to allow minimum pricing to be implemented here without the need for simultaneous implementation in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> I met the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the British-Irish Council and we discussed minimum-unit pricing. One thing he said was that since Scotland had brought it in, it had resulted in a huge reduction in the amount of cheap alcohol sold, particularly to young and more vulnerable people. He also said there was no evidence of people crossing from Scotland into England to buy cheaper alcohol there.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> The health and well-being of our young people is very important, and we all know the difficulties they face and the pressures on them. Today we see many young people drinking much earlier, even at the age of 11 or 12, so it is really important that when we take legislation such as this through the Seanad or the Dáil we act as quickly as we can. Unfortunately, what has happened in the North has delayed the implementation of minimum-unit pricing. I am assured by the Minister, Deputy Harris, however, that he will seek a Government decision to allow minimum-unit pricing to be implemented as soon as possible. This does not have to be in conjunction with Northern Ireland if the Northern Ireland Assembly is not back up and running by the time of implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> I will speak to some of the other points the Senator made in my supplementary response.</p>

          <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_11">
            <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_35">I thank the Minister of State for her response and her personal commitment. The main point is that retailers are using alcohol products, particularly those with high alcohol by volume, such as whiskey and vodka, to drive footfall and increase market share. As the Minister of State said, young people today are drinking at an earlier age and drinking a variety of alcohol products. Minimum unit pricing, judging from our work on the committee and debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas, is an important part of combating cheap alcohol products. The risk to public health from such products is too great. I accept that the Minister of State's commitment is unquestionable.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> It is important we ask the retailers, such as Dunnes Stores with its VALUEclub, to give money back to parents for use on baby products, not just alcohol.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CatherineByrne" eId="spk_12" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health">
            <from>Deputy Catherine Byrne<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_37">In September the Minister, Deputy Harris, submitted a draft regulation made under the Public Health (Alcohol) Act for assessment of compatibility with EU law and initial market principles. The purpose of the regulations is to restrict pricing promotions of alcohol products. Now that the EU assessment process is complete, it is the Minister's intention to make those regulations in the new year and prohibit the use of loyalty card points on alcohol products, the sale of alcohol products at a reduced price or free of charge on the purchase of another product or service, and short-term price promotions of alcohol products. There will be a one-year lead-in time for businesses and consumers to prepare for these changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> These regulations and minimum-unit pricing are both designed to ensure that alcohol products can no longer be sold at a very low price. Together with these measures we will continue with our objective of delaying the initiation of alcohol use by young children and young people. We will also ensure that the price of alcohol reflects the serious nature of the harms caused when it is misused.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> I thank Senator Buttimer for raising this matter. I look forward to continued support from this House on this very important process of reducing the level of drinking, particularly among young people and people who are very vulnerable. There is a mirror image in Scotland in that minimum-unit pricing has been introduced there and has reduced the amount of alcohol being drunk, particularly among vulnerable and young children. We will continue with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> I agree with Senator Buttimer about loyalty cards. As someone who shops in Dunnes all the time, I am very conscious that I pick up nappies and baby food for the children we have at home and that the loyalty card does not give young parents the opportunity to avail of discounts on such products. However, it is for those who want to buy three or four bottles of spirits from the shop. I will raise the matter again with the Minister, Deputy Harris, during the day.</p>

            <from>Senator Tim Lombard<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_43">I assure the Minister of State that it is not a sign of things to come. It is great to have him here again. It is the second time I have had the pleasure of seeing him perform in the Seanad. He was here last week, I think, and was very comprehensive in his response.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> The Commencement matter I have tabled concerns the need for the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to provide an update on the efficiencies of the farm safety schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">The Minister of State has been involved in this space for the past three and a half years. The number of unfortunate deaths is a blight on the agriculture industry, which has the highest percentage of loss of life of any industry. As a father, the frightening statistic that always gets to me is that 10% of those deaths are of children. It is a major issue that we need to start discussing. This House conducted a report into farm safety a few years ago. While that was welcome, we need to keep debating farm safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> I will raise a few issues. This is about trying to ensure that we get appropriate coverage of the level of farm injuries and deaths. Farms have improved dramatically in this context in recent years, but the nature of farming, particularly under the new regime, sees someone out working by himself or herself. The demographics of the farming population are changing dramatically, with those involved being older. Older people's ability to get away from cattle, machinery and so on is an issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> Something that always annoys me about the question of farm safety is that farmers have the ability to claim back VAT on everything bar farm safety equipment. If one changed a power take-off, PTO, shaft on a tractor, one could claim the VAT back. The tax code, though, does not allow for VAT to be claimed back on them on hard hats, visors or even farm safety signs. The Minister for Finance needs to examine this matter so that we have the ability to claim back VAT on those products. There are farmers whose finances are tight but who would love to do more, and giving them 23% VAT back would be a fifth or more off the original cost. We need to consider innovative approaches to encouraging farmers to do more around their farm yards.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> Speaking as a farmer who works by himself when farming, the main issue is the use of a mobile phone. A farmer in a pressurised situation could ring for help. Three or four weeks ago in my parish, a farmer got into difficulty. His mobile phone saved his life. Promotions along those lines should be considered. The Minister of State has done much in this space. It is a sad statistic that so many young families are bereaved every year because of these issues. Like we all do, I look up farming websites. We read the tragic stories every two weeks. They would frighten someone as a farmer.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> Today is about trying to raise awareness and get a handle on where we are with this year's figures. It is also about the possibility that we could do more in terms of promotion and awareness. We need to consider the VAT issue as well. A VAT exemption on farm safety equipment is something that the Minister for Finance should consider for next year's Finance Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> I would welcome the Minister of State's response to my points. I might then ask a supplementary question.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_16" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Business,_Enterprise_and_Innovation">
            <from>Deputy Pat Breen<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_51">I thank the Senator for raising this issue. As a farmer in Cork, he is conscious of the issue of farm safety and has spoken to me about it a number of times. I have also met him at a number of farm safety demonstrations. It is an issue that is close to the heart of most people. No matter where I go, everyone knows someone who has been killed as the result of a tragic accident. These are life-changing situations that affect many family farms. As the Minister of State with responsibility for the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, one of the events that I attend each year is a memorial at which we lay a wreath for all those who have lost their lives in accidents. It is one event that I can think of quickly each year, and I recall there those who have lost their lives in farm accidents.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> I encourage Senators to continue raising the issue of farm safety. I have focused closely on it in recent years. I mean it passionately when I say that I remain deeply concerned at the high numbers of fatalities in the sector. The HSA has consistently prioritised the farming sector in its annual programme of work. In addition to targeted inspection campaigns, the authority has in recent years through high-profile information campaigns and collaborative efforts with stakeholders sought to embed a crucial mindset change in the farming community to embrace farm safety and, importantly, take ownership of this critical situation. A mindset change among farmers is needed. When they get up every morning, they should think about their own safety. They should think about their families and loved ones and about how something can change their lives forever in the blink of an eye.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> The HSA has a significant presence at the main agricultural events, including the National Ploughing Championships and the Tullamore Show. Such events provide invaluable opportunities to interact directly with the farming community and provide information, advice and practical demonstrations of good farming practices while highlighting the devastation caused by bad farming practices. Someone attending the ploughing championships in recent times would have seen the line of clothes, Wellington boots and shoes that have been donated to the HSA's stand there to highlight those loved ones who are no longer in their homes. It is poignant to see at first hand the names of those to whom the Wellington boots or shoes belonged, be they children or whoever.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> The HSA utilises the expertise of the farm safety partnership advisory committee. The committee is drawn from the heart of the farming community itself with representatives from the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, Macra na Feirme and other organisations such as Teagasc and the Farm Relief Services Network.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> Arising out of the recent farm safety task force that I convened, work is being finalised on the proposed regulations to make the wearing of appropriate protective head gear mandatory when using all-terrain vehicles, ATVs, quad bikes and so on at work. This has the potential to contribute to improved behaviour, prevent life-changing injuries and save lives. Let us consider the statistics for those who have died in farm accidents. They involve older farmers who are probably not used to modern machinery on their farms, and children. People also die after falling from heights. They climb roof sheds and do not realise how dangerous that is. We have witnessed many such incidents in recent times. Senator Lombard might recall how members of the same family died in Northern Ireland a number of years ago from inhaling slurry tank gas. It devastated that family, but it created an awareness in farmers' mindset about the dangers of slurry spreading. We saw a reduction afterwards, but it took that terrible accident to get into their heads the dangers of inhaling this invisible gas.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> As a good farmer, Senator Lombard will be well aware that farming is unique in several respects, not least because it predominately comprises self-employed and self-supervised people who often work alone. The farm is linked to the family home and family life and several generations can live and work on farms. That is a factor in the number of elderly farmers' deaths, with many old and young people exposed to workplace risks.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> Notwithstanding all the challenges, I have noted the Senator's comments on VAT for our next meeting with the HSA on this subject. I am working closely with the farming organisations and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed. We need to drive the message about farm safety home and continue to work closely with the farming community to ensure that we can bring lasting change and improvement to the family farm.</p>

            <p eId="para_59">No, but I thank the Minister of State for his contribution. It is important that we get the message out there that there is so much happening in this space. I saw the line of clothes at the National Ploughing Championships. It was a frightening demonstration of the loss of life happening on farms. That is the kind of promotion we need to see.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> Farmers work on their own, so they need a little more help and reassurance to make sure that everything is okay.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">We need to consider the VAT issue. It is quite unfortunate that the Government might claim 23% VAT on a product that could save a life.</p>

            <p eId="para_62">At any time of the year farm accidents are devastating for the family involved, but particularly so at this time of the year as we approach Christmas. I appeal to all those who are watching this debate and the media to highlight this. The fact that the Senator has raised this matter demonstrates his awareness of this as a farmer. I appeal to farmers to ensure their own safety and the safety of others on the family farm to prevent more fatalities. Statistics can be an unsympathetic measure but, over the past ten years, more than 200 people have lost their lives while at work on farms. These deaths have an impact on families, friends and the community. Some people's lives are changed, they lose their sight or a limb. The family farm may have to be sold as a result of the farmer's death. We have to remind people of these things. An interesting statistic is that so far this year, 16 people have died on family farms.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> The best way to reduce these figures is for farmers to look into better farm practices and have an acute awareness of what is happening around them, the high-risk nature of farming practices. Farming is one of the most dangerous occupations. That safety first message must be embedded for everybody on the farm. The HSA and I stand ready to continue to work closely with the farming community and to bring in some new initiatives in 2020 to ensure that we can make the farm a safe place of work. I sympathise with all those families who have lost loved ones over the past 12 months. It is devastating for them but as legislators we need to make sure to make the farm a safe place.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">There are concerns about the lack of adequate regulation for road haulage in Ireland and I have raised the fact that road haulage gets a special tax relief with the Minister for Finance and others. This relief is on the purchase of diesel at a time a carbon tax is being brought in and many others are being asked to pay more for fuel. The relief has been increased in next year's budget. In early December, the road haulage sector invited a number of Fine Gael Members to a patrons' reception. It is an unusual and strange framing for this. The Government needs to consider a more robust and regulated relationship with the road haulage industry and particularly engage on the issue of heavy goods vehicles, HGVs.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> HGVs comprise 3% of the European vehicle fleet and 7% of the driven kilometres across Europe but are involved in 18% of fatal accidents. Those are figures from 2008. According to more recent figures, more than 4,000 people have been killed in crashes with trucks and HGVs and of those fatalities in excess of 1,000 were vulnerable road users such as cyclists and pedestrians. A friend of mine was killed by a HGV on the quays in Dublin a few years ago. The approach so far has seemed to be more roads. There are some European regulations and I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with responsibility for Europe, will comment on the new regulations due to come into effect on 1 September 2020 for a new design of cab for HGVs. Will she press to ensure they are the only kind of vehicle we see on our streets and moving through the city? There has been a long push on the issue of blind spots. Many people will have seen the shocking video from the UK circulating this week about a blind spot in a truck where a car was not seen. I think it was on the A40. There is a concern that cars are obliged to have clear vision but HGVs are not. The lead-in on the EU regulation is up to 2028, which is an extraordinary and dangerously long period for action on this. The Minister of State will also be aware that all new vehicles should be required to have intelligent speed assistance technology because given the fact that the blind spots have been addressed too slowly, speed is one of the factors we can address and it is one of the issues that contributes to the large number of fatalities involving HGVs.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> On the issue of toll roads and bypasses, there are safety concerns because people feel they cannot allow their children to cycle or they cannot walk safely because of the number of HGVs going through small towns. In many cases, the response is another bypass and another road, even in areas where there are already many roads. For example, there is discussion of a bypass of Slane yet the M1 is nearby. In many cases, drivers go through Slane because they are made responsible for paying the tolls by their employer. In the road haulage sector in which drivers are underpaid, and where terms and conditions are not as strong as they should be for them, all moneys matter. Drivers are avoiding the toll in Drogheda by taking a route off the M1 onto the N2 and going through Slane. Some people have talked about no tolls but that may not be an option. If there was an annual toll or fee attached to the HGV not payable by the driver, who may pass once or twice through this country and through other countries, instead of an instance-by-instance fee, there would no longer be an incentive for HGVs to avoid tolls and take narrower routes. Every day 2,000 HGVs pass through Slane. A large number of those HGVs do not need to pass through but do so to avoid tolls. I am looking for an overhaul of the toll system and a new approach. It is not always a question of new roads but of incentives for those on the roads and how we manage our toll system. </p>

            <p eId="para_67">I thank the Senator for raising this important issue. I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, who cannot be here this morning because he is attending a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport. He sends his apologies. The Senator has raised a number of matters and I will try my best to answer them. Where she has any suggestions to highlight that are not in my response and that I cannot address, I will certainly convey them to the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> I offer my condolences to the Senator on the loss of her friend and to anyone who has lost a loved one or relative in a road accident. Our entire objective throughout all of this and the changes we have made at European and local level is to try to bring down the number of road deaths. We have set ourselves an objective of reducing road fatalities to 120 annually by 2020. Unfortunately, last year, we lost 142 people on our roads. We need to address that slight increase. A huge volume of work has been done particularly in respect of HGVs. Much of this has been done at EU level and been implemented locally. Manufacturers of HGVs must comply with requirements for a range of compulsory safety features and this is part of the EU's type-approval regime. This regime sets the safety, environmental and technical standards for motor vehicles that must be adhered to in order for those vehicles to be placed on the market and registered in EU member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_69">While some high-end vehicle types already have a variety of high-tech safety features as standard, it is important that such systems are progressively introduced into all vehicles across the board. In order to achieve this goal, a new European regulation, as the Senator has mentioned, replacing what is known as the "general safety regulation", is due to come into effect shortly that will introduce a new range of mandatory safety features, particularly for HGVs. These features will be gradually introduced over the next number of years, I suppose to allow those who need to upgrade or to install them within their vehicles to do so in a cost-effective manner. An example of the new safety systems includes pedestrian and cyclist collision warning, particularly for those in towns and cities. I note there has been a five-axle ban from Dublin City Council within the city since the opening of the port tunnel but, obviously, there are those who have a licence to come in. Given the amount of construction happening within the city centre, hopefully, this is something that will help to protect pedestrians and cyclists. Further examples of the new safety systems include: blind spot information, direct vision, tyre pressure monitoring, emergency stop signal, alcohol interlock installation, drowsiness and attention detection and event or accident data recorders.</p>
            <p eId="para_70"> These mandatory safety features will be gradually introduced into the type-approval regime on a phased basis over a period from 2022 to 2029. They are being heralded by the European Commission as having "the same kind of impact as when the safety belts were first introduced", and one will be aware that thousands of lives were then saved. The Commission expects the proposed measures will save 25,000 lives and avoid at least 140,000 serious injuries across all vehicle types by 2038. There is a considerable amount of work being done in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> Briefly at the beginning, the Senator mentioned the climate agenda. In recent years, the diesel rebate scheme was introduced to support an industry given that Ireland is an island, we export 90% of what we produce and we need to make sure that it is feasible for our hauliers and for these companies to work and continue their job. At the same time, we are clear that the future fuelling of any freight operations over time needs to transition to cleaner greener fuels and that is something that has been included as part of the new cross-Government strategy to try to reach our 2030 emissions target but also, as we agreed at a European level this week, to ensure that we are climate neutral by 2050. That will certainly include this industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> In relation to tolling, the Senator mentioned Slane. As a resident of Slane and somebody who has worked on this bypass before even being elected, I am aware that a considerable amount of work has been done on showing why toll bans, specifically, for the M1, do not work, and why all of these other measures in terms of banning HGVs have not worked. There has been at least two or three years' work done by the local authority to show why a bypass is necessary. I take the Senator's reasoning that not everywhere needs a bypass but the village of Slane has had countless needless deaths, not only along the bridge which, although not quite from the time of King James I, has been there so long it needs to be upgraded. A bypass is the only way that we can prevent the trucks from coming through because much of it is down to habit or knowing particular routes. This is why, particularly also given that the M1 is almost reaching capacity as well, we need to see an upgrade along that route.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> In terms of the tolling, and this is a question that I have asked around, there is a difficulty for people paying tolls when there is the M3 in Meath as well. There are two tolls between Cavan and Dublin as well. Unfortunately, the Department I represent today, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, has responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme but individual national roads come under Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TIl, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Any issues the Senator has raised regarding this, including toll roads and the establishment of a system of tolls, are within the remit of TIl. Like the Senator, I think these issues will continue to be raised within the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. I will come back to the Senator on any specific issues she has.</p>

            <from>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_74">The issue of tolls, while affecting local authorities, requires a national strategy. An example of a bad hostage to fortune that was given, for example, is the idea that the State now compensates for whenever there are not vehicles on roads as well as when there are. There is a concern. It was an example of poor policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> Similarly, in terms of poor policy, the idea of the diesel rebate scheme needs to be re-examined. It is extraordinary that we would not be just giving an exemption. Ideally, we should be pressing for fuel efficiency as part of these European directives. We should be asking for them to move forward. Clearly, the road haulage industry is an effective lobbyist but the fact is we cannot afford the lives lost to this industry by poor practice. We should be looking for more fuel efficiency in the vehicles but, nonetheless, to incentivise and refund the purchase of unclean fuels is an extraordinarily regressive step. That is one that we need to revise.</p>
            <p eId="para_76"> I accept we will be under pressure with Brexit. I do not believe that companies will stop delivering goods to Ireland if they have to pay the same price for diesel as anybody else. I think that they will continue in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> I look forward to engaging with the Minister of State. I appreciate the Minister of State's engagement in relation to Slane. I understand the situation. I note that sometimes extra roads are added, as when an extra road was added through the centre of Kilkenny, and doing so does not reduce the vehicle traffic. In that case, what we saw was more vehicle traffic. We suddenly had two roads which had the same number of vehicles. There is a concern, not specifically in terms of Slane, that the research internationally has shown that providing more roads does not automatically reduce traffic. What it tends to do is incentivise and send the signal that roads are the main mechanisms. In fact, freight haulage, which is something which Ireland has neglected and which is another issue I raised in the past with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, is somewhere that we will need to look for long-term sustainability as we depend increasingly on the ports and on land travel and that connection between rail and port down the line.</p>

            <p eId="para_78">I will highlight another few areas, particularly on overall emissions, to show that a considerable amount of work is being done.</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> The rebate was introduced at a time when the industry was under particular pressure. It was needed to try to ensure that individual businesses did not go under and that they were sustainable. It was acknowledged that they were still in significant difficulty.</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> On the range of new alternative fuel solutions, they are emerging across the HGV fleet spectrum. Electrification is slow but gas-fuelled trucks are available right now. We have a number of incentives in place to encourage gas use in freight. For example, we have a low excise rate for natural gas and for biogas. We have an accelerated capital allowance scheme for investment in trucks and refuelling infrastructure at the Department. They are also working on a grant scheme which will be introduced next year. Gas Networks Ireland is rolling out the refuelling infrastructure - the gas filling station - at Dublin Port. It is now open. The low-emissions vehicle task force recently finished its work on the potential role for alternative fuels, including compressed natural gas, as a pathway to biomethane, biofuels and hydrogen in the freight sector. All of this will take time.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> Only last week, the new Commission President, Dr. Ursula von der Leyen, published and launched the new green deal, which is intended to cross all spectrums and all industries, sectors and business, such as freight. The focus of the new green deal was not the loss of jobs. It was not to place a burden on people. It was to be innovative, to help produce jobs and to help sustain industries and sectors. The HGV sector will certainly be one benefiting from that.</p>
            <p eId="para_82"> Finally, on Slane, I would hope, particularly given that the route was announced this week, that the ban on HGVs, as well as the proposal of the bypass, will allow for the village - which has been destroyed with HGVs over recent years - to be able to flourish and grow given its considerable potential as such an historic and important village next to our oldest and most important structure of Newgrange.</p>
            <p eId="para_83"> I thank the Senator for her question. I certainly will relay the Senator's concerns to the Minister.</p>

          <from>Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_86">I want to mention the awful and tragic death of Nadine Lott and to offer my condolences to her family, particularly her young daughter. Nadine Lott from Arklow died last night after succumbing to the horrific injuries she sustained. Last week I highlighted the alarmingly high rate of domestic violence and deaths of women in their own homes, in front of their children and often with their children. I want a debate on domestic violence in this Chamber as soon as we return from the Christmas break. The women of Ireland are facing a great crisis, namely, the crisis of domestic violence, which is not being tackled. We are furious it is not being tackled properly. I would like to request that a specific committee be set up to examine the issue, although not over a long period. I would like a committee made up of people who have an interest in and knowledge of this area to produce a report within a matter of weeks because this cannot continue. A number of women have been murdered in similar circumstances, and it is no longer acceptable. We need to respect the memories of these women by taking action.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> I would like to raise an issue facing thousands of crèches, childcare facilities and early education facilities throughout the country, namely, the insurance crisis. As we all know, there is only one insurer in the market. Many facilities are without insurance at the moment. If they want insurance, they have to go to one insurer which is offering outrageous rates. It is tripling the insurance premiums of the previous year, even though no claims are outstanding or no claims have been settled in a particular facility. This is absolutely outrageous. Not one Minister from the Department of Finance, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Justice and Equality or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has met the insurance companies or their industry body since taking office in 2016. That is symptomatic of the hands-off approach taken by this Government to the insurance crisis facing many businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> There is a severe shortage of childcare places in north County Dublin, and if any facilities close because of this issue, it will cause great distress in an already squeezed market. It has been coming for months, but the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs seems surprised. We have been highlighting this since last April but it is only the now that the Minister is seeking to do something about it. It is probably a little too late. These facilities are providing a public service. Early years education is a vital public service, yet these facilities are being treated appallingly by the Government. They are not being offered any support or assistance, and it is an outrage that this crisis has gotten to this point. I want the Leader to address this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">I thank the staff of the Oireachtas, who have always facilitated all of us at any time that we needed everything. We would like to wish them all a happy Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> Now that all the niceties are over, we will go away and most of us will have a comfortable, warm, happy Christmas in our homes. It would be wrong to let the day go by without thinking of those who do not have a home, who will spend Christmas in hotels, hostels or on trolleys in hospitals. It is an awful time of the year. It always baffles me that we get so excited and concerned at Christmas when this is happening year-round. I see people in this Chamber and elsewhere stand up to talk about how they would fix the system and such. I was in the regional hospital in Galway when I was ten and my bed was in the middle of a ward because it had no beds. The staff were putting beds in the middle of wards and putting people on trolleys. That was in the 1960s. Nothing has changed over the years. I know of no fix that will make the world a better place without everybody pulling in one direction. Cheap shots at one another, especially in the areas of health and education, will never solve the problem. The problem requires all of us to put all of our shoulders to the wheel.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> Today, we might think of those who we have let down badly. This country has become a very wealthy country again. People are coming back from Helsinki, from an EU meeting. I was amazed at the number of children who were on the flight, having flown to Helsinki to see Santa. I was thinking about the children who were walking the streets of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford because they had to leave the hotel at 12 o'clock in the morning. There is a lot of inequality. I know we are coming to the end of the lifetime of this Government. Whatever Government comes in, that inequality has to be tackled. I do not know that there is a way to solve it in the current political system but my thoughts are with those people today.</p>

          <p eId="para_102">I do not know whether I second the Leader's motion on secretarial pay, which is being taken without debate, now or at the end of the Order of Business. It is brilliant to see that everybody in the Chamber has come together to place a real value on the work of the people who make our work possible. I was thinking about why it is so important. It is not only because people deserve to be paid well but because the efficiency of this House relies on a level of knowledge and experience. If one does not pay the people who work within one's office well, one will have a constant turnover and constantly lose that level of experience and knowledge that a person working in the office brings, with the substantial workload that those people do. I thank everybody in the Chamber for lending their support to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> When I knew I was speaking on the Order of Business, as with Senator Clifford-Lee, much was on my mind. I find it very hard in the aftermath of something so wrong and evil happening to a woman. I get a pain in my heart where I struggle to even articulate what it must have been like for that woman, her family and the people in her community. As someone who was no stranger to violence or male control, I find it hard to find the words to even begin to express the anger and collective trauma that the women of Ireland often feel when something unjust, wrong and violent happens to another woman and another mother. I would like to remember that today and second what Senator Clifford-Lee has said about it. I know we have domestic violence legislation but we need to look at how that is impacting or not impacting on the issue and how we can begin to address, in a real way, violence against women in their homes and in general.</p>

          <p eId="para_106">Like others, I want to send my solidarity to the family of Nadine Lott. As this is an alleged assault, we cannot comment further on the particulars, but we know that 230 women have died due to violence in this country since 1996, with six so far this year. We have asked for a debate in the House to look at the impact of the legislation and how it is being implemented. It is important that we do that in the new year. We need an all-island approach to domestic violence and violence against women.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> Today, I want to speak about the lack of State services being given to An Post and why this Government is encouraging people to bypass post offices and do their transactions and claims online. They should have their local post offices as the first option, not the last option behind being encouraged to conduct transactions online. Why is motor tax not available through the post office? Why is the Central Bank not encouraging people to bank through their post offices? Another problem is that, in the case of some of the post offices that were closed temporarily and then reopened in parishes such as Ballycroy, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is not interacting with the post offices. All their claims have been moved to another post office but they were not automatically changed back though they should have been. All of the claimants got letters when the post office was closing but they did not get letters when the post office was reopening. Payments need to be brought back to local post offices. People are afraid to move payments from one post office to the other because they are afraid of losing their payments or that their payments might be late. I ask that the Leader take this up with the Minister and ask the Minister to look at the temporary closure of post offices and the transactions with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> The CEO of An Post, David McRedmond, said in an interview on Sunday that the general incompetence of the Government is to blame for citizens not being able to access the full range of State services through the post office network. The Government really needs to get serious about our post office services. In 2018, 159 post offices were closed, mostly in small rural areas. We cannot allow this to continue. Post offices are a vital part of our rural communities. They provide a social and economic hub for people, and they provide valuable local employment. The Government should look at improving the post office network and ensuring that it gets the full range of Government services. The Government must look at a coherent and properly resourced strategy with firm proposals that will secure the future of post offices and the thousands who are employed. I ask for a debate on that in the new year. We should bring the Minister in to present concrete proposals about how these matters regarding rural post offices will be addressed. Areas without post offices are not areas that serve the community well.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">I know that yesterday in this House and the other House, tributes were paid to Cormac Ó Braonáin who died so tragically at the weekend at the age of 19. He was national chairperson of Labour Youth. I add my voice to those as a friend and comrade of Cormac. I express sympathies to his parents, Lú and Eva, his sister Muireann, and his family and friends.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">I had the great pleasure of knowing Cormac well. I canvassed with him over many different campaigns during recent years. For someone so young he had incredible reach, charisma, leadership and talent. I was at the vigil for him in Lios na nÓg, his former school in Ranelagh, where so many people spoke movingly of their own knowledge of him, friendship with him, and of his work with the scouting movement. He was a leader in the scouting movement. He worked with the Irish language movement and undertook fundraising for the school and his former secondary school as well. He is an incredible loss to us in the Labour Party, to all of us who knew him and to all the many people and communities he touched. There will be a funeral service for him tomorrow in the Mansion House. I know many more tributes will be paid to him there but I wanted to put mine on the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> I support the sentiments of Senators Clifford-Lee, Conway-Walsh and Ruane in calling for a debate on domestic violence. It is really important. I wish to express sympathies to the family of Nadine Lott. It is such a tragic story and death.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> I am glad we are putting forward a motion on secretarial assistants. I think every Senator has signed it. That is great. I wish to pay tribute to Senator Ruane and Seb in her office for leading on it. It is important and it is good that we are coming together on the last sitting day to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> I wish colleagues and Oireachtas staff, yourself, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and the Cathaoirleach the very best wishes for Christmas and the new year.</p>

          <p eId="para_114">I wish yourself, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and all my colleagues and the staff a happy Christmas and a prosperous new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> Senator Craughwell outlined the housing issue. It is an issue that needs to be dealt with. I was in Leitrim last Monday. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, opened or turned the sod on 53 new homes in four different developments to the tune of €12 million. A great deal is being done. I was delighted to see all the young couples and people getting the keys to their houses and moving in. It was a joy to see the Christmas tree in the houses. We need to do more but the personalised attacks on the Minister have been most unfair. Some people say that because he is from Dublin he knows nothing about the west of Ireland. However, he was comfortable and very much at ease. If I was the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government the same question would be put to me. I would be asked what could I know about housing in Dublin. We get personal about it, as when discussing health or housing. We have to be careful that we do not personalise it too much. That does not take away from the suffering of the many thousands of people who are without a home. We have to work. We are doing our best. We are putting serious money into this issue. There are some positive aspects of the delivery of housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> I have talked about the UK election. It is obvious that Scotland is going in a different direction to England. Northern Ireland will be using Dublin and Ireland as a base to work through the EU. This opens up extraordinary opportunities for us. Mike Nesbitt, the ex-leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and a member of the legislative assembly, said something profound. He said all his life Northern Unionists were looking over their shoulders at Irish nationalists. However, the people they now need to fear most are English nationalists. This is very symbolic.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> I want to thank Fianna Fáil. In fairness, people in Fianna Fáil have been great advocates of the Commonwealth. Yesterday, Deputy Stephen Donnelly and Deputy Malcom Byrne said that what we need to do for a united Ireland was to rejoin the Commonwealth and celebrate 12 July. They were following in the footsteps of de Valera when he met Churchill in Westminster in 1953. He said that if he had been Taoiseach in 1949, Ireland would not have left the Commonwealth. We burnt down a potential bridge with our neighbours. In 1999, 20 years ago, the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, addressed students in UCD. He said that leaving the Commonwealth in 1949 was particularly clumsy and that we succeeded in cutting off most of our English-speaking friends around the world. I am absolutely delighted and I hope my colleagues in Fine Gael can be as forthright in their thoughts as those in Fianna Fáil on the Commonwealth. I thank them very much. It is a wonderful idea and I am with them on this one.</p>

          <from>Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_118">I was deeply concerned this week to hear that GPs are charging general medical scheme patients for taking bloods in some circumstances. Medial card patients are still being charged for blood tests despite the HSE ruling that blood tests should be covered by the card and that patients should report their GPs if they are being charged.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> Doctors have previously argued that the medical card contract was not designed to cover the amount of routine blood tests that patients now need. This confusion is hitting the most vulnerable people in their pockets. This issue has arisen several times in my clinics. Many of those reporting it are elderly. This cost is really something they would consider a luxury. Some might put off getting a test because of finances. That is the opposite of what the medical card is supposed to achieve. It really concerns me that people are now telling me that they cannot afford to get their bloods done. I have been contacted by several people with chronic illnesses who require regular blood tests. They absolutely cannot absorb the cost. We need to have an option. If a person goes to hospital, there is free blood testing. However, Carlow does not have a reliable transport system. The hospital in Kilkenny is our nearest hospital. That is not an option for us. Again, rural Ireland is forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> Will the Leader ask the Minister whether GPs have received recommendations from the HSE to the effect that patients are not to be charged? Discussions are ongoing on the contract at the moment. It is generally understood that GPs provide necessary care for their patients. This would and should include blood tests. I want to know whether this can be clarified. Can the position be stated so that the public can know exactly where they stand? This is absolutely a major issue for me. I wonder whether the Minister could clarify the matter for me.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> I agree with the previous speakers. My sympathy goes to the family of Nadine Lott. We need to have a major debate in the House about domestic violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> I wish to congratulate the new IFA president, Tim Cullinan. It is great and I wish him well. I believe he will really represent the beef farmers. That is what we need to do because they really need support now. I will absolutely be giving my support to him and to the beef farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> I wish everyone a happy Christmas. I believe 2020 will be a busy year for all of us. I hope everyone has a lovely and peaceful Christmas. We will all see each other in January.</p>

          <from>Senator Ian Marshall<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T11:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_124">I wish everyone Christmas wishes. It is lovely to see the House with so much goodwill. It abounds. It is unusual and nice to have such goodwill to all men and women.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> I rise today to make specific reference to the recent developments in the political landscape in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Both jurisdictions have seen significant changes to personal and elected representatives. They have seen significant swings in the balance of power. No one, including the experts, saw much of this coming. No one could have predicted the monumental shift in support in Great Britain based on the information and indicators pre-election. However, many could see that there was a lot of apathy north of the Border. People were frustrated by the lack of an executive and a lack of government. They could be mobilised to demonstrate their frustration by shifting to the moderate middle ground. That is what they did <i>en masse</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> Change is sometimes good and change can sometimes move things on. Sometimes it can give an impetus to do things differently or to look at things in a different light. In fact, change could have given some of the larger players the nudge they need to go the extra mile, think outside the box and consider things previously unthinkable. Following a period where uncertainty was the order of the day, we must return a degree of normality to the business of politics and refocus on the bread-and-butter issues, including Brexit, with a greater degree of certainty and more clarity around the implications of any such exodus of the UK from the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> We have seen the result of the general election in Great Britain and the significant majority. Whatever side of the Brexit discussion we are on, we now have a situation where decisions can be taken, rightly or wrongly. We will be able to identify the decision-makers, engage with them, argue and debate with them, reason and row with them and at least begin to make plans for the future based on arguments. We can make the case for deals and arrangements that mitigate risk and develop opportunities in a new era of engagement between the UK and Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> The relationship between the UK and Ireland is symbiotic and really important for both sides. In fact the interdependence, is important north, south, east and west. I do not believe for one minute that the UK Government, or the UK Prime Minister, would, or would have any desire to, act in such a way to hurt, damage or make poorer the citizens of the UK, especially those constituents who have now placed trust in his party. They would not hurt, damage or make poorer the people of Ireland due to the importance of this relationship across trade and business, sport and tourism and most especially the people on the two islands.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">Taking these changes into consideration, it could be argued that we are much better placed this week compared to last week to get on and start planning. Furthermore, yesterday saw the launch of the report of the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. That is a clear indication of the serious work to be undertaken by both civil servants and Members of both of Houses in an attempt to reduce the risk and prepare everyone for the potential changes that may be ahead. As Dwight D. Eisenhower said, it is not about the plan, it is all about the planning because plans always have to change. At least Ireland has done, and continues to do, the planning, despite any changes that may be necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> Whatever faces this House and Government in the next few weeks it is imperative that we speak with one voice, stand shoulder to shoulder and ensure the best outcomes are achieved for this country. An impending general election should be regarded as something to stabilise the political system and present an opportunity to reset the sails to catch the wind. As Dolly Parton once said, we cannot direct the wind but we can adjust the sails. The one thing I am sure is that the sky will not fall in and the relationship and interdependence between the two islands will continue. However, everyone in this House needs to work hard to weather this storm.</p>

        <speech by="#GabrielleMcFadden" eId="spk_45">
          <from>Senator Gabrielle McFadden<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_131">I want to mention the very sad passing of Nadine Lott. I have raised the topic of domestic violence in this House on numerous occasions. This Government has done more since coming to power to legislate on domestic violence in the home and community than was done in the previous 30 years but we need to build a strategy that can make a real change in how we respond effectively to domestic violence. I support, therefore, the call for a debate on the matter early in the new year. Having attended Safe Ireland's conference recently with my colleague, domestic violence is a topic of conversation that comes up from time to time but it seems to have been dropped again. Interestingly, this morning every Senator who mentioned it was female. We, therefore, need have a proper debate on domestic violence in the new year. </p>
          <p eId="para_132"> I wish to refer to Irish Water. There have been several water restrictions in place in the Athlone area over the past number of months because the treatment plant in Athlone is working at capacity all the time and there is not enough water being treated to supply the town. The water restrictions are difficult for families, people with young children, elderly people and people who are sick. It is also not ideal as this time of year is busy for businesses. I know Irish Water is doing its best. I ask the Leader to consult the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and ask him to put pressure on Irish Water. There was a suggestion that the company would install a temporary treatment plant in Athlone as a short-term solution until work was done and investment made in a new treatment plant. </p>
          <p eId="para_133"> I thank the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Cathaoirleach, all of the Whips of the different parties, Senators of all parties and none, the Seanad staff and, indeed, the staff of the Houses because there are staff in every corner of this House that keep it working throughout the year, for what they did for us in 2019 and wish them a very happy and peaceful Christmas. God bless and thank you. </p>

          <from>Senator Máire Devine<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_134">I echo the Christmas wishes for everybody and hope that 2020 will be a fabulous year for us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> I refer to the retention of records that were transferred to the National Archives following the Ryan commission. Every Member has probably been intensely lobbied on this. A total of 15,000 survivors submitted testimonies. The Retention of Records Bill 2019 has been somewhat controversial from the first time that it was mooted. The proposal to seal the records for 75 years is disproportionate, unnecessary and would suppress information that is in the public interest for an extraordinary period until 2094 or 2095. The testimonies are a record of our collective social history. </p>
          <p eId="para_136"> The Bill was due to come before the Joint Committee on Education and Skills but it was deferred and, instead, the experts presented to the committee. The legislation will not pass in its current form. There is also a growing belief that it may not be required at all. We believe that the records are covered by the National Archives Act 1986. Many people have lobbied us, including the families of survivors, and the legal and archival experts. I refer to Dr. Maeve O'Rourke who is a lecturer in human rights law. In her submission she stated: "We cannot overstate the potential impact of this Bill’s contents on our country's historical record, on survivors' and their families' personal lives, and on our State’s ability to prevent abuse in the future." Sinn Féin believes that further discussion is required. We will, therefore, oppose the progression of this Bill until we feel that both experts and survivors are satisfied with how the Government is proceeding.</p>

          <from>Senator David Norris<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_137">I want to raise a difficulty that surrounds the Irish National Immigration Service, INIS, particularly for people who are granted refugee status in this country and then try to get their relevant papers. They are blocked because of a website that has been set up by the Department of Justice and Equality. This is the only way that refugees have to book an appointment to get a Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, card in Dublin. The website is hopeless and it lacks basic functionality - the kind of things one would expect from an appointment system with a ticketing system, a queue and some basic filtering. When one goes to the website, one enters one's details on the make appointment page and then one can click a button to search for available slots in the next ten weeks or choose a specific date within that timeframe. In reality, even if one clicks the button 100 times over a week or a month one will have wasted one's breath and one will not get a single appointment. This is the most common experience and is the result of the zero functionality of the website.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> A really sinister problem has arisen. The website has been unable to filter out people who make block bookings for appointments, which they then sell on social media. It is utterly shocking that people use social networks and messenger apps to sell things that have been funded by taxpayers. It is an absolute scandal that third parties are profiteering on the backs of the taxpayer. I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Department and ask its officials to do something about it rapidly to facilitate people who are in this difficult situation. </p>

          <p eId="para_139">I would also like to be associated with wishing a happy Christmas and peaceful new year to Members, the Seanad staff and all of the staff throughout the whole facility whether they are in the catering section or the printing side, which might not be popular at the moment. I wish everyone a happy Christmas and peaceful new year, and I hope that we will all be back here in the new year to debate further.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> I extend my sincere sympathy to the Lott family on their tragic loss. One must remember that there are two sides to domestic violence and that some men are in domestic violence situations. We must take that into consideration. A case of was highlighted recently in the public domain. We should look at both sides of this and I support the ladies who have asked for a debate on domestic violence. I will participate in the debate because people have brought cases to me where men have been subject to domestic violence. Unfortunately, most of the tragedies occur on the female side but there are some men who are in difficult married or relationship situations. </p>
          <p eId="para_141"> I agree with Senator Clifford-Lee on insurance for crèches. This is one of a number of sectors that have been affected by the sudden increase in insurance premia, including small businesses around the country. There are many legs to this chair. I ask the Leader to either arrange a debate or establish a committee to look into the legal costs associated with insurance. Yesterday, I highlighted the fact that 85% of litigation results in awards of less than €100,000 as ordered by the courts, yet 63% of every award comprises legal costs. </p>
          <p eId="para_142">If people go through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, the average fee is €752 and the average award is €22,631. In 85% of the cases going through the courts the awards are under €100,000. The average award is not very different from that in the PIAB at €23,199, but the average legal costs are €14,684. That is an additional 63%. It is no wonder our insurance premiums are going up. The Seanad should have a debate on this issue. If we cannot have a debate, we should establish a committee to investigate the legal fees being charged in this country. When the troika was here one of the issues it highlighted was legal fees. We must deal with them. They are part of the reason for our insurance premiums being so high.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> On a final matter, a Kildare man, Mr. Brian Rushe, was elected deputy president of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, yesterday. I wish him all the best for the year ahead. I also extend best wishes to Mr. Tim Cullinan. They both have difficult tasks ahead with regard to farming incomes and Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, payments.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">I join my colleagues in congratulating Mr. Tim Cullinan on his elevation to the highest role in the IFA. I understand he is a beef farmer from County Tipperary so he will be acutely aware of the difficulties in that sector. Undoubtedly, he will use his experience in his new office to try to find credible solutions to the difficulties beef farmers are currently experiencing.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> While it has been a tough time for farmers, it has also been a tough time for many businesses, especially those located in Monaghan, Cavan and elsewhere along the Border. The dark cloud of Brexit has been hanging over the country and especially Border counties. The two counties of Cavan and Monaghan have also had the added pressure of rates revaluations, which resulted in rates increasing for many businesses to such levels that many businesses cannot see a future. That is difficult. At this time of the year I encourage people to shop in their local town or village where possible and wherever they may be. I am acutely aware of Cavan and Monaghan and I will be requesting the people there to consider doing that. Many towns like Monaghan and Cavan have voucher schemes in operation whereby people can buy a gift and the business stays in the town. As we all know, the first door we knock on for support for the GAA club, a community event or a soccer club is that of the local shop or business. I ask people to be cognisant of that this Christmas and to spend their money locally where possible. That supports jobs and the businesses support the local community.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> At this time of the year we are conscious of those who find themselves in hospitals or nursing homes at Christmas, as well as the staff who must work there over Christmas. They are in our thoughts at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> I wish the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Leader, the Members of both Houses and all the staff of the Houses a very happy Christmas. I hope they enjoy the break. We will be back here le cuidiú Dé in January for whatever 2020 might bring. I wish everybody a healthy and happy 2020.</p>

          <p eId="para_149"> On a serious note, I strongly welcome the passing of the Microbeads (Prohibition) Bill 2019 last night. It is a template for co-operation across parties from the former Senator, Grace O'Sullivan, MEP, Deputy Sherlock and the Minister, given the urgency it required. However, we must still keep our eye on the ball with regard to climate change and biodiversity. Under the climate change legislation there is an onus on each Minister to report to the Seanad annually on the progress each Department is making. When will that be scheduled in the new year? Will the Leader try to ensure it does not happen in the same way as it did last year, whereby the Ministers queued at the back of the Chamber, came in, spoke for five minutes and then left? We should put some thought into how we will interact on such an important matter. I would welcome an opportunity to discuss with the Leader, at his earliest convenience, how to manage that in the new year.</p>

          <p eId="para_150">I seek the Leader's support in asking the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to intervene in the situation of Limerick FC. It was announced last Wednesday that the club is due to be liquidated. While Limerick FC has acquired many debts over the years, soccer is still the most played sport in Limerick. Limerick city is the third largest city in the country and not having a senior soccer team will have a detrimental effect on both schoolboy soccer and the local clubs. Many volunteers and families have been involved with Limerick FC and soccer in general over many years. There is a great knowledge bank in Limerick with the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology and all the people involved in sport. They should all be brought together to form a group to ensure the future of soccer for Limerick FC. People have had great enjoyment over the years in Thomond Park, Hogan Park and the Markets Field where the club is currently located. Markets Field is a category 2 UEFA stadium and holds up to 4,500 people. It is in the heart of a socially disadvantaged area and has brought great life to that area. There is also great involvement between the stadium and the community, education and business. I want the Minister to intervene by bringing all the relevant stakeholders together to put soccer back on the map until trust can be rebuilt between the business community sponsors and the people who have put so much effort into Limerick FC and soccer over many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> I wish the staff of the Seanad and of the Houses generally and every Member a happy Christmas. Incidentally, I have written to the Minister, Deputy Ross, and I am seeking the Leader's support on this.</p>

          <p eId="para_154"> I also wish to be associated with the tribute paid by Senator Bacik to the late Cormac Ó Braonáin. As somebody who married into that extended family, I cannot comprehend the loss his death will be for his parents. I hope they get some consolation from the kind words and words of admiration that have been expressed about him. It is a real loss. It should be noted that his great-grandfather was one of the early Senators and was elected on three occasions to the Seanad in the 1930s and 1940s. Cormac Ó Braonáin's death is a loss and his idealism is a model for young Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> On a different note, I wish to criticise the Government very heavily.

          <p eId="para_157">Some time ago our colleague, Senator Ned O'Sullivan, complained about seagull activity and ran into heavy derision in the media for his stance against seagulls and his complaint about their outrageous behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">Recently, Senator Feighan said he was the subject of a similar attack. It occurred to me there must be some culpability on the part of Government for all of this. Happily, crossing St. Stephen's Green the other day, I discovered that it is, in fact, seagull central. There must be 200 seagulls sitting on the ponds in St. Stephen's Green. Whose fault is that?

          <p eId="para_159"> I ask the Leader to bring the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, to the House to explain to us why he is giving facilities to the seagulls of Dublin to maraud around Dublin Bay South in particular from their pond base in St. Stephen's Green, and to do something about it once and for all. </p>

          <p eId="para_166">This will be the last contribution on the matter, but we have had this problem in Balbriggan for many years, so it would seem the tribe is expanding. There can be a serious problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> I want to raise an important issue that was raised again with me at a meeting yesterday but has been raised over the last number of weeks, namely, the issue of the cost of insurance. Many of the comments made by Senator Lawlor were in regard to costs and there are a myriad of problems involved. I want to congratulate the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, on the signing into law of his Judicial Council Bill, which will help for the first time, in a more formal way, to provide for the continuing education of judges, the creation of guidelines for awards on personal injuries, the creation of sentencing guidelines, the creation of a judicial code of conduct and the introduction of a mechanism for dealing with complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> It is a complex area but, as we break for Christmas and look forward to celebrating Christmas with our families, there are businesses that fear they will not be able to open in the new year, many of them crèches. Many people are afraid they may not have a job in the new year and many parents are wondering if they will be able to keep their job if their childcare arrangements have to be changed or suspended.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> The Ministers, Deputies Zappone and Donohoe, and the Taoiseach met about this yesterday and they are addressing it. They need to address it urgently and I would encourage them to do so. I hope we can get an urgent solution to the immediate problem but we need a much more sustainable solution in the longer term, addressing all of the other issues that have been raised by Senators Lawlor and Clifford-Lee.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> I wish everybody a happy Christmas, particularly the Leas-Cathaoirleach and the Cathaoirleach, and all the staff of the Houses and all fellow Members. Again, I hope we will see urgent action taken to address the insurance issue. I commend Mr. Justice Frank Clarke on his work in getting the various preparatory works through the committees, and I hope they would look on this is an urgent issue and expedite the outcome of their work. </p>

          <p eId="para_171">I want to thank everybody for their patience and perseverance during the year, particularly the staff, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Leader and the Cathaoirleach, and to wish everybody a happy Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> At the risk of sounding like Boris Johnson, can we get something done for the secretarial assistants? It is great that everyone signed the motion and it is fantastic we got the support. The pay rises have been outstanding for over a year and it is in the Government's hands to deal with this. I ask the Leader to ensure it is done. We cannot let these people down beyond the end of this parliamentary term.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> On Christmas Day, Mohammed Ramadan and Husain Moosa are due to be executed. It is what Bahrain likes to do; it is a good day to bury bad news. These two men have been framed and forced to confess to terrorist charges. They were arrested without warrant, tortured into confessions and denied access to legal counsel. They are both due to be executed on Christmas Day by the Bahraini authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Bahrain is one of the most wicked regimes anywhere in the world in terms of how it treats migrant workers - it is basically a slave economy - and how it treats women. If a woman gives birth in Bahrain, unless she is married to a Bahraini national, her children have no right to Bahraini citizenship. Yet, the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, was out there last month, talking about the wonderful dynamic economy in Bahrain and how we can contribute to developing business with it. There was no mention of human rights, no mention of torture, and no mention of the fact two men are due to be executed - shot, most probably - on Christmas Day.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> I am calling for a debate on the issue of Bahrain and on the broader issue of our foreign relations. This Government has lost its moral compass. We have seen how it has behaved in regard to Senator Frances Black's Bill, where it was appalling to see a Government standing up for an apartheid regime. Here, we have one of the most wicked regimes in the world, yet we see that our Minister of State is willing to ignore all sorts of horrific human rights abuses and just go touting for trade and business. Surely to God, any Government should be better than that. </p>

          <p eId="para_176">I want to join the wide condemnation of insurance companies and to call out their carry-on. Everybody is supposed to be sitting at the table, including the Minister and all the stakeholders, to try to find a resolution to the crisis in the insurance industry, which is crippling motorists, businesses and crèches, and taking money out of people's pockets with the premia they have to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> The most recent report published by the Central Bank showed the insurance companies have no bona fides in this regard. They keep pointing to fraudulent claims and the size of awards. Everything is pointed at except the fact that, so long as they are nursing their profits, they do not mind. It is quite shocking that premia on motor policies have gone up by 42% in the last ten years when the cost of those claims is down 2.5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> I support the Minister in his efforts. The insurance companies have to be made accountable for their carry-on. I believe that, on the whole, we have to look at the amount that is being awarded in claims, given we know we are ahead of averages in many other countries. The law of negligence and the duty of care are very broad, and to try to curtail that is another issue. However, if people think they are in a position to argue they have been failed in a duty of care towards them, whether by a council or some other public body or private business, they will always do that. It is about the amounts they are getting. People have gone to the courts and have seen what others got money for, and have seen that was not a fraudulent claim. If people trip over their own feet but someone else was the cause, they could be compensated. The fact there has been much more coverage of this by the media means people might think this is fraud. It is not fraud; it is the way the law of our land is. Either we cap it and get to grips with it, and deal with these insurance companies which are putting money in their back pockets, or we will be putting a great amount of trouble on our citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_179">I want to add my voice to the call from Senator Gavan for a debate on human rights and trade policy. These are going to be crucial issues in regard to the trade agreements we make on Brexit also, so a general consideration and discussion on how we incorporate and reflect human rights principles in our trade policy would be very welcome in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> I rise in the main to speak about the human rights advocate, Cormac Ó Braonáin, who I know was acknowledged earlier in the House. I knew Cormac when he was an 11 year old, a very passionate 11 year old who was already writing political songs with his school friends at the time. I had the honour of working alongside him in campaigns, including the presidential campaign and others, and seeing him as an activist.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">I spoke to him last Saturday at the rally for peace. As he so often did, he was standing in international and national solidarity with the most vulnerable groups in society and arguing for progressive and positive change. It was extraordinarily tragic to hear of his passing later that evening. It is a significant loss to his family and all those with whom he worked and, indeed, the Labour Party - he was recently elected the chair of Labour Youth - as well as the broader progressive movement and debate within society. In his 19 years, he had an extraordinary impact. I know many people from all kinds of parties and backgrounds and of various ages who were affected by the conversations they had with Cormac and found his passion infectious and ideas compelling. His effect will continue to be felt. I hope that we can, through our political work, honour some of the principles he put forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> His spirit of activism, delivery and wanting change is reflected in many of our parliamentary staff, including secretarial assistants, people who work for Members of both Houses and give their time and energy to multiply and amplify our work. I am proud to sign the cross-party motion encouraging and demanding that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and his Department engage on the matter to ensure we do not go into another Oireachtas term in which those who work with us as Senators are not recognised or adequately resourced. Their work, skills and the qualifications many of them have are not being recognised. We need to look at their pay and conditions.</p>

          <p eId="para_185">Recommendations 8.13 and 8.14 of the report of the implementation group on Seanad reform call for a review and these issues to be addressed.

          <p eId="para_186">I offered my thanks to the staff and everybody else yesterday but the Leader was not present. I wish to take this opportunity to thank him. It is not easy to be the Leader of the House, try to reach consensus and keep everything moving. In particular, I thank Ms Orla Murray and the other support staff in his office. It is not an easy job. Senators always get on with each other. In spite of what those watching these proceedings may think, we are pragmatists and need to get our work done.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> Yesterday, I quoted Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>. As I was leaving the Chamber, several people asked me to identify the quote. It is important and I will repeat it. We are richly blessed and honoured to be able to walk in the gates of our Parliament and represent the people we represent locally, nationally or internationally. It is a great honour and privilege to so do. As one who walks into the Chamber every day, I am particularly pleased to be in this job, as are all Senators. We are blessed and enriched by our time here. I again quote Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, "Reflect upon your present blessings - of which every[one] ... has many - not on your past misfortunes, of which all [of us] ... have some."</p>

          <p eId="para_190">I will not quote Charles Dickens. Senator Marshall quoted Dolly Parton earlier, which might be the first time she has been quoted in the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> On a sad note, I wish to pass on my sympathies to the family of the late Cormac Ó Braonáin. I did not know him but I know many people involved in youth politics in Fianna Fáil and other organisations who did. He lived close to where I live. His passing is very sad. I pass on my condolences to his family, friends and all of his support base. It is clear that he was a very gifted and popular young man. I pass on my sympathies to all who knew him.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> On a happier note, I wish a very happy Christmas to the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Cathaoirleach, Senators, their staff, our Leader and his staff. I do not think anyone elected to the Seanad approximately three and a half years ago thought we would get this far. It is great that we have. Although some legislation took a significant period to be passed, other legislation has been dealt with very efficiently. This Seanad has dealt with many Bills. Last week, I compiled a summary of the parliamentary party business in the Seanad for the Fianna Fáil national executive. A significant volume of legislation was dealt with in this term. Credit is due to all who work on every side of the House to improve and, ultimately, pass legislation. We have more business to do this afternoon. I thank everyone across the House. The staff of the Seanad Office are small in number but great in quality and very efficient in everything they do. I thank all the staff of the Houses.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the family of the late Cormac Ó Braonáin. I also offer my sympathy to the Labour Party on its great loss. It is obvious that he was a very fine young man.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> I wish the Cathaoirleach, Leas-Chathoireach, Mr. Martin Groves, Ms Bridget Doody and all of the Seanad staff well, as well as the Leader and his staff. People do not realise the volume of work that must be done in the background to get Bills through the House and passed and to ensure that everything works efficiently. I congratulate them all and wish them a happy and safe Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> I wish to raise the issue of the renewal of driver's licences. Some time ago, the Government awarded the contract for the issuance and renewal of licences to an external company. There are Irish people all over the world, including in Australia, China, America, England and elsewhere, but a person who loses or mislays a licence or whose licence expires must present himself or herself in person at one of the licensing offices dotted around the country. There is such an office in Castlebar in my area. In this day and age, one can renew one's passport in any part of the world using one's smartphone. One takes one's photograph, downloads an application, fills it out and uses one's credit card to pay the relevant fee. Irish people all over the world need to renew their driver's licence for one reason or another. In many cases their licence is used for identification purposes. They should be able to download a renewal application, take their photographs on their smartphone and renew the licence from wherever they are without any hassle. I call on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to bring this to the attention of the company that has the contract for the issuance and renewal of licences such that it upgrades its technology to allow our citizens around the world to renew their driving licence remotely.</p>

          <p eId="para_200">On a sombre note, like all other Senators, I wish to offer my condolences on the tragic death of Cormac Ó Braonáin to the Labour Party, and in particular to his family. All Senators started their political careers as activists at his age. His death is a tragedy for Ireland. The ideas that would have come from him would have made a difference in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> Like others, I wish the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Leader, Ms Orla Murray, and Mr. Martin Groves, Ms Bridget Doody and company all the best for Christmas and thank them for their help, co-operation, indulgence and understanding. Christmas is a time to spend with family. It has been a busy period, particularly for those of our colleagues who had by-elections. I hope that they get a break before the next big one, in which we will all be involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> A final point about Christmas has to do with the importance of shopping local. Clare County Council and Clare FM in my area ran a fabulous campaign about shopping local. They put a series of videos up on social media that were professionally done. After watching them, one would just want to shop local, they were so good. Every €1 that is spent in small local chemists and gift shops is worth more to our economy, job creation and job retention than spending the same amount in multiples, including internationals, or online.</p>

I thank my colleagues for their help, assistance and, sometimes, criticism, which has been valid and helpful. I thank those colleagues who helped me in the by-election.

          <p eId="para_215"> A matter that we should put on the agenda for debate is the increase in the cost to the health service of medical negligence claims. I was looking at the figures. There was a good report in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on the matter. The level has gone from €62.1 million in 2013 to more than €245 million in 2018. That is a 300% increase in a very short time. My understanding is that, in 2019, the figure will be more than €300 million. Facing this enormous increase in litigation while also trying to provide healthcare is a major challenge for our health service. Early in the new year, we should debate what action needs to be taken to help reduce the figure and whether there is an alternative way of dealing with the litigation. We must be mindful that, if people have an adverse outcome where there is negligence, they are entitled to compensation. It is not about placing restrictions on that, but about how we will deal with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">I thank the 25 Members of the House for their contributions on the final Order of Business of the term and, as Senator Marshall stated, of the decade. When we come back, it will be a new decade and a new opportunity for this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> Senators Clifford-Lee, Lawlor, Reilly, Mulherin and Horkan raised the issue of insurance and the disappointing news of the withdrawal by Ironshore Europe from the market. It has created a strong sense of worry and frustration. The issue of insurance is a priority for the Government. The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, set up a working group. Senators will be aware that, regardless of who is in government, the Government and the Central Bank are constrained in how they can get involved in the market and pricing therein, but there has been significant reform in the insurance industry. However, it is fair to say that there is a need to ensure that insurance companies play ball, are fair in their pricing and do not rip people off. The Government is conscious of that. The Judicial Council Act 2019 is one mechanism that hopefully will drive prices down. I would be happy to have the Minister of State return to the House in the new year on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> Senator Craughwell referred to homelessness. At this time of year, many people are vulnerable. I remind the Senator that the Government will expend €2.4 billion on housing and homelessness in next year's budget. This is about ensuring that we increase housing supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> Among others, Senators Ruane, Bacik, Gavan and Clifford-Lee spoke about the issue of secretarial pay and conditions. It is a cross-party motion supported by us all. As I stated last week, the role and nature of the job have evolved and changed, and pay must therefore be commensurate with what is expected in light of the educational backgrounds of many of our staff. I hope that there will be a prompt and expeditious change. We will take the matter up with the Minister and the commission and we will place it on the agenda of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> My learned colleague and friend, Senator Conway-Walsh, spoke about An Post and the Government's role. I remind her that, a number of years ago, the Government introduced a suite of its services for delivery through An Post - social protection payments, driving licences, property tax, dog licences and television licences. At the risk of ridicule and condemnation by many, we even refused to change the post office's model of delivery of television licences. People would have been critical of it. The post office handles passports. Garda fines can be paid via An Post. In 2018, An Post reached an agreement with the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, whereby there would be no further compulsory closures of post offices. The Senator is a member of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach and an eminent finance spokesperson in this House. I remind her that An Post was in profitability to the tune of €40 million in 2018 and €8.4 million in 2017. More Government services have been given to An Post than ever before, but I look forward to having a debate about An Post in the new year.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">Senators Bacik, McDowell and Higgins and many other Members of the House spoke very eloquently about the sad and tragic passing of Cormac Ó Braonáin. I was not here for the Order of Business yesterday. On behalf of Fine Gael and on my own behalf, I offer deepest sympathies to his family, his parents and the members of the Labour Party. He was a fine young man who was making a very valuable and positive contribution in politics and human rights and was making life better for his fellow citizens. His sad passing at a very young age is very hard to take. His family may take solace in the fact that his very short life was very well-lived and was full of endeavour, enthusiasm and positivity. It was rooted in doing what we should all try to do, making our world a better place for everybody. I had the pleasure of meeting him. He was a very fine and decent young man. I am deeply sorry to have to offer my sympathies to his family today. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> Senators Feighan and Marshall made reference to the changing political landscape in the UK and in the North. I congratulate all of the victors in the different constituencies in the North of our country last week. I wish them well. In the context of Brexit and last week's election, it is important that we now see the power-sharing Executive in Stormont return. There is a duty on all sides to ensure that a government is back up and running. I appeal to all members from all political parties to ensure that a power-sharing Executive is put in place in January at the latest. I believe 13 January is the deadline. We can have political differences but we must come together in the interests of the people whom we serve on our island, whether North or South. </p>
          <p eId="para_244"> Senator Murnane O'Connor raised a very important issue regarding GPs and charging. No agreement has been concluded. It remains to be resolved. It is a matter for the GPs, the HSE, and the Department to sit down and resolve it. I will be happy to hold a debate in the new year if the Senator has not received an answer by that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> Many Members raised the issue of the very tragic death of Nadine Lott. We offer our deepest sympathies to her family. Senators Clifford-Lee and McFadden called for a debate on the issue of domestic violence. It is not acceptable that 230 people have died as a consequence of domestic violence since 1996. We have proposed significant legislative changes. There is also work to be done in respect of education. I will be very happy to have a debate in the new year. It is a pity that the Order of Business was not held after the meeting of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee because, in the context of the very genuine contributions on the issue of domestic violence, it is an issue which the committee should take up in the new year. The Leas-Chathaoirleach chairs that committee. To be fair to all Members of the House, we should give consideration to this issue and park others because it is very important. It has received cross-party support-----</p>

          <p eId="para_247">I was not referring to the Senator. If the Senator took notice of what I was saying, she would know I am not talking about being against any issue. This is about one issue that unites all of us in the House. We should have a forum for debate and consultation with a view to ending the scourge of domestic violence in our society. As Senator Lawlor said, this issue affects men as well. It is not just a women's issue but an issue for all of society. I thank all Members of the House. Senator Clifford-Lee is right. Many cross-party committees have been formed in the House. We should establish a very strong cross-party committee on this matter. I support the Senator 100% in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> Senator McFadden raised the issue of Irish Water capacity in Athlone. It is a very important matter on which we need to see Irish Water act. Senators Murnane O'Connor and Lawlor congratulated Tim Cullinan and Brian Rushe, the new president and vice president of the IFA. I join with them in congratulating the new leadership. I wish Mr. Cullinan and Mr. Rushe well as they take up leadership of a very important organisation representing farmers in our country. It is a critical time for the farming sector, which has had to endure a very difficult time over recent years. I am sure they will work constructively with the Minister, Deputy Creed, on behalf of the Irish farmer.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> Senator Devine raised the issue of the Retention of Records Bill 2019 and the emails we have been receiving. I am not sure about the progress of the Bill.

It is important that people take cognisance of the genuine concerns expressed within those emails.</p>

Those of us who every week meet people who are dealing with this issue will know that it is very vexing and needs to be resolved. I have a very simple philosophy. There should always be a human interface in this matter. I do not think electronic means are good enough. I know the system is designed to save time and so on. Perhaps the Senator can table a Commencement matter on the issue rather than calling for a debate. If he cannot, we can discuss how to proceed. It is an important matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_271"> Senator Gavan raised the matter of human rights in Bahrain in the context of two people who are threatened with execution on Christmas Day. As I said before, there is a need for us, as a Government, to be very proactive with regard to human rights around the world and not to sell our soul for business. I have a very simple view on that. We must get the balance right. We should never recoil or withdraw from promoting human rights and calling people out. I agree with the Senator in this case. Bahrain's policy on human rights in unacceptable and leaves a great deal to be desired.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Senator Paddy Burke raised the issue of the renewal of driving licences. He makes a very good point and I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House in the new year. </p>
          <p eId="para_273"> Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of medical negligence and the increased costs. The Joint Committee on Health that I chaired and of which he was a very valuable member did some work on that. It is a source of concern and I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House in the new year. </p>
          <p eId="para_274"> Finally, mar fhocal scoir, I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Cathaoirleach for their stewardship of the House, as well as the Acting Chairmen. I wish the Cathaoirleach a very healthy 2020 and the same to the Leas-Chathaoirleach. I thank the Acting Chairmen for their strong role in the House and note they always helped to keep the debate flowing.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Catherine Byrne)<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T13:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_316">I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the House on the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2019. As Senators will be aware, the Bill concluded its passage through the Dáil last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> This is a short and technical Bill comprising six sections all focused on the specific issue of health insurance regulation. The provisions outlined in the Bill will ensure the ongoing sustainability of the private health insurance market and seek to keep health insurance policies at an affordable price for all citizens, young or old, sick or healthy. Over 45% of the population in Ireland hold private health insurance. Health insurance in Ireland is provided according to four principles, namely, open enrolment, lifetime cover, minimum benefit and community rating.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> Open enrolment means that insurers in Ireland cannot refuse to provide cover to someone who might be a risky customer for them, and there are maximum waiting periods for pre-existing conditions. Lifetime cover means that once a person has health insurance, an insurer cannot stop cover or refuse to renew their insurance, except in very limited circumstances such as fraud. Minimum benefit means that all insurance contracts must abide by regulations issued by the Minister for Health to make sure that everyone who holds health insurance has a minimum level of cover. Community rating means that health insurers cannot alter their prices based on an individual's current or potential health status.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> In order to support one of the fundamental principles of Irish health insurance, community rating, legislation is needed each year to update and revise the scheme that enables the sharing of risk across the insured population. As part of the process, the independent market regulator, the Health Insurance Authority, carries out an annual evaluation of the market, focused on the claims costs that every insurer has paid over the year. Based on that analysis, the authority recommends the level of credits and stamp duties that should apply the next year, so that risk may be shared across the market and the principle of community rating is maintained. The rates for next year, recommended by the authority, have been considered and accepted by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance. This year's Bill will provide for a general decrease in the credits payable in respect of those aged over 65 years, and there will be some changes in the stamp duty levies on contracts. No amendments were made to the Bill during its passage through the Dáil, the Bill is as initiated.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> I will now outline the specific sections of the legislation. Section 1 defines the principal Act as the Health Insurance Act 1994. Section 2 amends section 11C of the principal Act to provide for 1 April 2020 as the effective date for revised credits payable from the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Section 3 amends Schedule 3 to the principal Act with effect from 1 April 2020, whereby the applicable hospital utilisation credits payable from the fund in respect of insured persons are revised. Section 4 replaces table 2 in Schedule 4 to the principal Act with effect from 1 April 2020, whereby the applicable credits payable from the fund in respect of certain classes of insured persons are revised. Section 5 amends section 125A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to specify the applicable stamp duty rates for 1 January 2020 to 31 March 2020, and from 1 April 2020 onwards. Section 6 provides for the Short Title, commencement, collective citation and construction of the Bill. To summarise, this Bill allows us to maintain our support for the core principle of community rating, which is a long-established and well-supported Government policy for the health insurance market. I commend this Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_322">I welcome the Minister of State. Fianna Fáil is happy to support the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill. The Bill is something akin to a finance Bill or a social welfare Bill, in that it arrives here every November. The measures within are designed to support risk equalisation and to sustain community rating in our health insurance market in order that older citizens and people with illnesses can afford health insurance and are not discriminated against in favour of younger, healthier people. Risk equalisation and community rating is something that Fianna Fáil has always supported. There is a small increase in the levy for advanced cover, with reductions for non-advanced cover. The average annual health insurance premium increased from €935 in 2011 to €1,197 in 2018. The levy for advanced cover increased from €205 to €444 in that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> While many people would find the health insurance area to be a bit of a minefield, I think that for many citizens who can afford health insurance, the renewal is very confusing. One could be disingenuous and say that it is deliberately constructed that way by insurance companies to confuse people about the plan they are getting. It is a criticism that I regularly get from many people. I do not know how many different plans there are and it is hard to differentiate between one plan and another. I do not know why that is. I would welcome the Minister of State's comments on that. Is there any way that we can insist on plans being more straightforward so that when people renew their health insurance or go to a different provider, the plans are more easily read in order that people can follow exactly what they are getting? I encourage people with any insurance product, especially health insurance since it has become so expensive, to shop around every year and to change provider if necessary. Sometimes we hear stories of people who get a quote from a particular insurance company. When they shop around, get a cheaper quote and go back to the original provider, lo and behold, the figure can be reduced. It goes to show the advantage of shopping around.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> Very few in this country can afford health insurance and the cost seems to increase yearly. My thoughts are with those people who cannot afford it. We need to get to having a system where, regardless of whether a person is fit to pay for it, the health service should be equally accessible to all. Unfortunately that is not the case at present. I would be interested in hearing what plans the Government has to arrive at that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">I support this Bill, the concept of community rating and whatever is necessary to strengthen community rating. The Leader mentioned on the Order of Business that car insurance premiums were coming down. I have a different experience. I had €150 extra loaded onto mine for no reason. When I checked it out with my broker, the broker said he would ring up the insurance company, and it promptly took €100 of the €150 off it. I think gouging is happening and I am afraid the Leader is out of touch. I fully accept what Senator Gallagher said. We have to have a health system whereby the consumer is entitled to shop around to get a decent bargain. We also need a bit of good faith from the insurance industry, such that it does not just rely on inertia to get a few more euro out of people who are not in a position to and are reluctant to change horses.</p>

        <speech by="#ColmBurke" eId="spk_142">
          <from>Senator Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_326">I thank the Minister of State for bringing forward this Bill. It is brought forward annually and is about risk equalisation. The big challenges in this area are with the growing elderly population and making sure that they can get insurance in a fair and proper manner, and that it is not loaded because of their ageing. Risk equalisation and community rating make sure that there are no excessive charges for older people. It is interesting to see how, while there may be much criticism of our health service, the average life expectancy in Ireland has increased by seven years since 2000. That is a substantial change in a short time. It means we will have more people over 65 for whom risk equalisation kicks in. I am not sure what sort of challenges that will pose for the health insurance sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> I received a letter from the Higher Education Colleges Association. I acknowledge it is not covered by this Bill but I feel it is important that I raise this matter. The letter related to international students being unable to get a visa to come here unless they have health insurance. The Higher Education Colleges Association is concerned that while some students were coming in on insurance that would normally cover visitors, that is now being changed. There was a High Court decision and a decision by the Court of Appeal was due yesterday about whether students would be classified as ordinarily resident. The court has ruled that once they are here as a student, they are deemed as ordinarily resident. I understand from the association that the cost of health insurance for them as a result of that court decision, though I am not sure what the Court of Appeal decision yesterday was, was approximately €450 per student, which put pressure on the colleges as they tried to attract people here. I have spoken to officials in the Department and know that they are working on the matter to have a half-way house to deal with this issue. These people will not be permanently here. On average, they stay here for a period of four years and I do not think they should be penalised excessively. It is about trying to find a middle ground or half-way house for the charge that is imposed on them. If they are going to be deemed to be ordinarily resident, we should put in place a mechanism so that if they stay here for just four years, they are not be penalised by the cost of insurance. It is important that people who are to be granted visas have health insurance before the visas are granted. I think we need to find a solution to this problem. I thank the Minister of State for bringing forward this Bill.</p>

          <from>Senator Máire Devine<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_328">I think this is my third time taking this Bill. It comes up every year. It is another reminder of what seems to be protection and favouring of private healthcare above all else. I know that people are afraid of entering the public system and being left to wait for months or years for treatment. Many scrape together to fund private healthcare but others simply cannot access the market. With each passing year, equity of access based on need is a missed opportunity that is detrimental to the nation's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">We all know the statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> Today, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, Trolley Watch measure shows there are 552 people on trolleys, which is a reduction from the all-time high reached last month. We know about the waiting lists, the cancelled operations, the cervical cancer scandal, etc. In the health landscape, there appears to be an increasing trend towards care being delivered through the private sector. This Bill does not change the role of the State as the ultimate guarantor of the realisation of our health rights and obligations, but it makes implementing that responsibility more difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> As I said, we deal with a version of the same Bill every year. It is about taking away the risk from insurance companies to equalise the risk for certain policyholders. Were the Government as quick to intervene in the market in other areas, we would have an improved country. We will support the passage of this Bill in order that older people and others are protected but we do so with serious reservations about our health service, which is buckling under the weight of demand. We point out that fear drives people to take out health insurance. Indeed, many patients lying or sitting comfortably in a hospital bed today, fast-tracked there via private health insurance, would acknowledge the inherent unfairness of private versus public provision. I have consistently urged the Minister, Deputy Harris, to ensure that this intervention is not used as an excuse to hike up insurance premiums. We know from the work of my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, that the Government has lost the reins when it comes to the insurance sector. We must not afford the industry the opportunity to increase premiums for health insurance customers. The social justice issue in respect of health insurance is not about equity of premium but, rather, inability to pay and a chaotic public service. That is what we should be discussing. The argument is that risk equalisation benefits the ordinary person who may be sicker or more at risk than his or her neighbour but we would not need this benefit if all our citizens had access to a properly-functioning public health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> I understand the Minister, Deputy Harris, will make an announcement on Sláintecare and its implementation in the coming days. I hope that announcement will focus on actions that will result in the implementation of the recommendations set out in the programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_333">I have one problem with this Bill and I am glad that Senator Colm Burke, on the Government side, already raised it. I am sure the Minister of State will be sympathetic to our concern, which relates to the penalisation of international students. A recent Health Insurance Authority, HIA, decision fundamentally changed the medical cover system applicable to international students temporarily resident in Ireland. They are now facing a considerable increase in what they must spend on health insurance, which is unfair. If the decision stands, international students will be treated as ordinary residents for the purpose of health cover, meaning a dramatic increase in the cost of cover. International students' medical expenses insurance traditionally cost €100 to €150 per year but, as Senator Colm Burke pointed out, that cost will now rocket to €450. As international students are charged enormously increased fees compared with Irish students to study here, they are already paying a significant premium. We are the second highest charger for these services in the European Union. When the British leave the Union, we will have the distinction of being the most expensive. That is completely wrong. The Department has dealt with the situation for many years, with 200,000 students having gone through under the existing, fairer, system. I am asking the Minister to look at the possibility, at some stage, of introducing an amendment to the Health Insurance Act in order that international students are specifically left out of the definition of "health insurance contract" in the same way that other temporary residents, such as temporary workers, are omitted. It is a question of natural fairness and decency.</p>

          <p eId="para_334">I thank Senators for their contributions. Senator Gallagher referred to the confusion around renewals, and he is correct, as it is something I deal with myself on a daily basis. A lot of people, when renewing their insurance, whether motor insurance, health insurance or otherwise, find it difficult to access information that would help them to comprehend prices and other options. There are more than 300 plans on the market, which is a reduction of some 30 since last year. The HIA has a price comparison tool on its website that can help consumers to choose. I acknowledge the difficulties people experience. I often think that some health insurers, who I speak to on a regular basis, do not make it simple and user-friendly for people to buy into policies they understand. It can be confusing. I will convey the Senator's remarks to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> Senators Colm Burke and Norris asked about international students, an issue which is the subject of legal proceedings. I have just been informed that there are many plans available on the market offering young adult rates starting at €180. I understand the legal proceeding is still in progress.</p>

          <p eId="para_338"> I thank Senators for their support for this Bill. Its provisions are technical but they are important for all the people who want an opportunity to buy into a health insurance scheme and to have proper guidance in making their choice. Health insurance is held by a large proportion of people in Ireland relative to other countries. It is important to have taken the opportunity to discuss this Bill and the positive effect that community rating and other aspects of health insurance regulation have on people's daily lives. The Bill deals specifically with issues relating to health insurance regulation, including provisions for revised credits and the stamp duty level to apply to health insurance policies from April 2020. The voluntary health insurance scheme operates on the basis of community rating, which means that everyone pays the same price for the same product. This is supported by the scheme, which aims to keep health insurance more affordable for older and less healthy citizens. In other health insurance schemes internationally and in other insurance markets in Ireland, the level of risk presented by an individual directly may affect the premium he or she pays. We are all aware of that from our own dealings with insurers.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> I thank Senators again for their support for this technical Bill. I will convey the issues that were raised by Senators Gallagher, Norris and Colm Burke to the Minister, Deputy Harris. I thank the Acting Chairman and the Cathaoirleach's office for accommodating the debate this afternoon and wish Members and staff a happy Christmas.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">This is an example of politics and engagement on an issue working. A number of concerns were raised in the other House about the issue of minor sanctions. The Bill as drafted provides that so-called minor sanctions of advice, admonishment or censure will require confirmation by the High Court before they take effect, as is the case with the more serious sanctions provided for in the Bill, which include removal from the register and the attachment of conditions to registration. Concerns were raised in this House on Second Stage and during the Bill's passage through the Dáil that this measure would impose an unnecessary additional cost, delay the finalisation of proceedings and bring an additional degree of publicity to registrants receiving the most minor of sanctions. Having to go to the High Court for what in the Bill is envisaged to be a minor sanction was seen as quite an undertaking. I therefore undertook to examine this issue and, having consulted with the health regulators, the professional representative bodies and the unions, as I was asked by Senators, I have now decided to remove the requirement that the minor sanctions of advice, admonishment or censure be confirmed by the court. This has been welcomed by those I consulted, including the representative bodies. I thank Senators on all sides of this House for their constructive input on this change.</p>

          <p eId="para_355">As with the previous set of amendments, we had quite a discussion on this here and in the other House. This is similar to the High Court confirmation of minor sanctions. Senators will recall that concerns were raised in this House about the mandatory publication of minor sanctions. It was suggested in particular that this measure would have a disproportionate impact on those receiving even the most minor of sanctions. I was therefore asked by this House to consult with key stakeholders such as those I mentioned earlier, including regulators and representative bodies. I have now decided to introduce amendments to provide that the publication of minor sanctions will be subject to a public interest test to be applied by the regulator. This will allow regulators to exercise their discretion and to publish information relating to minor sanctions only where they are satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so. Again, I am very pleased to say these proposed changes have been welcomed by the representative bodies and are considered, I think, to be a balanced approach to the treatment of minor sanctions. When this group of amendments is read with the previous group in the context of the removal of the need to go to the High Court for confirmation, plus the removal of the provision for mandatory publication of a minor sanction and its replacement with a public interest test, this is a more proportionate and balanced approach.</p>

          <p eId="para_356">I welcome these amendments. I think we all know what it might be like to be in the public spotlight following, say, an allegation of medical malpractice or neglect of duty of care. I have been in the offices of An Bord Altranais several times to represent nurses, sometimes for really minor misdemeanours. However, their reputation goes before them, even if they are found not guilty or not having a case to answer. Obviously, they then find it quite difficult to expand their careers, find jobs somewhere else or increase their professionalism in the areas they have been deemed guilty of misdemeanours. I welcome these amendments because this can often be very trying. Obviously, we need to protect the public interest, but not for the sake of small errors in perhaps recording something or anything else that does not directly impact the health and well-being of the patient. Well done on these amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_357">Under Part 3, specifically section 30, an effort is under way to move competent authority status from the Department of Health to the HSE. Such a move has been raised with us by the environmental health officers. They have stated it would give huge power to their employer in determining what constitutes what an environmental health officer, EHO, is. EHOs have a wide range of further concerns about this proposed change and feel it would seriously affect their credibility and, more importantly, their independence as a profession. The chairperson of the Environmental Health Association of Ireland has expressed frustration that the association was not consulted on the movement of competent authority status from the Department of Health to the HSE. The move outlined in the Bill presents a blatant conflict of interest whereby the employer, namely, the HSE, can essentially dictate the constitution of the profession of one of its employees, namely, the EHOs. The move would also greatly diminish the independence and credibility of the profession, and it is very questionable from an industrial relations standpoint. Furthermore, a growing number of EHOs work within local authorities, including Dublin City Council, DCC. Many EHOs in Dublin City Council work in the areas of housing, public health protection, air quality management and noise control. Is it not odd that one public employer of EHOs, namely, DCC, must defer to another public employer of EHOs, namely, the HSE, to ascertain whether a potential employee is deemed qualified for the position? I ask the Minister to table an amendment on Report Stage to address this matter. We in Sinn Féin will propose our own amendment to this end on Report Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_358">I thank Senator Devine for raising this matter. The Bill, as the Senator correctly says, amends the Health Act to give me, as Minister, the power to designate the HSE as the competent authority to compare the equivalence of non-Irish qualifications to the qualifications it sets for certain health professionals. These are professions which are not regulated on a statutory basis but which are regulated for the purposes of the EU professional qualifications directive. The professions which currently come within the scope of the directive and which are being considered for transfer are those of audiologist and environmental health officer. I am aware that in recent days concerns have been raised that a potential conflict of interest might arise, with the HSE acting as both the competent authority and the employer. In light of these concerns, my Department sought the advice of the Attorney General's office. The advice received was that providing an independent unit within the HSE to sign off on the qualification approval process would eliminate any such potential conflict of interest. It is my view that the body that sets the qualification requirement is best placed to compare foreign professional qualifications against the requirement and is perhaps much better placed than the Minister for Health of the day in this regard. However, the Senator has indicated her intention to table an amendment on Report Stage, so I will undertake to engage with her on the matter in advance of Report Stage to see if we can provide further information on this.</p>

There has been as much lobbying on this in my family as anywhere else and I am very aware of how long this has been a live issue which is of real concern to so many registered pharmaceutical assistants, of whom there is now only a contained grouping. The Minister is well aware of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> Amendment No. 9 would insert a new provision relating to registered pharmaceutical assistants into section 53. Pharmaceutical assistants have a long history and tradition. They are professionals who carried out a course which has been discontinued. The course ceased in 1982, although the profession of pharmaceutical assistant was originally regulated under the 1890 Pharmacy Act. No new pharmaceutical assistants have qualified in the State since 1986. The Registered Pharmaceutical Assistants' Association has written to Members about this issue and so they will be aware of it. There is no current pathway for qualification to this historic qualification. However, the Pharmacy Act 2007 recognises registered pharmaceutical assistants, and section 2 defines a pharmaceutical assistant as a person who is competent under the prior 1890 Act to "transact the business of a pharmacist in his or her temporary absence". Section 30 of the 2007 Act also provides for the saving for temporary cover by a registered pharmaceutical assistant and section 13(1) enables the council to set up the register of registered pharmaceutical assistants. I lay that out to illustrate for colleagues the long history and existing statutory framework for the regulation of registered pharmaceutical assistants.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> Over the many decades during which this qualification existed, pharmaceutical assistants have carried out enormously important and valuable work and made a huge contribution to the work of pharmacists, many of whose pharmacies could not continue in business without the cover provided by pharmaceutical assistants. I speak from personal experience of seeing my mother working in this role. There has never been a statutory definition of "temporary absence", although section 30 of the 2007 Act provides for it and gives it a statutory basis. However, it has been interpreted relatively widely over many years and there have been various codes and ongoing negotiations with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI, on how to regulate it. As the Minister and colleagues are well aware, in recent years the PSI has sought to curtail the practice of pharmaceutical assistants. Proposed rules, which have not been signed by the Minister, would reduce the level of cover pharmaceutical assistants could provide, reduce the interpretation of "temporary absence" to one hour per day and limit what a pharmaceutical assistant could do, if enacted. This would have huge implications for the pharmaceutical assistants - mostly women - who qualified under this historic four-year apprenticeship, training and education pathway. They are now a contained group of about 305 persons, although there are many like my mother who are retired. We think that about 97% of people who hold this qualification are women. If passed, those rules would have a catastrophic effect on the livelihoods and earning capacities of these women as well as having a devastating effect on the many pharmacies which have relied on the cover provided by pharmaceutical assistants for so long. That is the background on why this amendment has been put forward by the Registered Pharmaceutical Assistants' Association, with the huge support of colleagues across the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> The amendment would delete section 53 and insert a new provision into section 7 of the 2007 Act. The amendment is twofold. First, it would include pharmaceutical assistants in section 7 of the 2007 Act. That section provides for the functions of the society, which are currently to regulate the profession of pharmacy, to which the amendment would add "and pharmaceutical assistants". Second, subsection (b) of the new section 53 would substitute a new paragraph enabling supervision of compliance with the Act by pharmacists, pharmaceutical assistants and pharmacy owners in their respective capacities. It would lay out and clarify the position of pharmaceutical assistants, thereby addressing the purported reason given by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland as to why it appears to be seeking to curtail the work of pharmaceutical assistants. The amendment seeks to address the concerns expressed by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, although it has never put forward an evidential basis for why it is seeking to curtail the level of temporary cover pharmaceutical assistants can provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> I will not speak any further on this amendment, as I am aware and very grateful that the Minister has indicated the Government will not be opposing it. I look forward to working with him and other colleagues between now and Report Stage to see if further work can be done to strengthen the amendment. I acknowledge that the Minister is appreciative of the position of pharmaceutical assistants but this is effectively a legacy issue and we need to ensure a legal mechanism and statutory framework are in place in order that pharmaceutical assistants can continue to do their important work and provide an important service to pharmacists and members of the public, and to ensure their own livelihoods are protected as well. I am grateful to the Minister and my colleagues for their support. I am particularly grateful to the Registered Pharmaceutical Assistants' Association and Ms Anita Finucane, who drafted the amendment, for all the work they have put in to ensure this amendment received such support. It was done on very short notice because we did not think the Bill would come to us on Committee Stage until the new year.</p>

          <p eId="para_388">I will be brief as I am conscious that we are endeavouring to make as much progress on Committee Stage as we possibly can today. First, I sincerely thank pharmaceutical assistants across the country. It is important that I as Minister for Health say that, because I know the job they have done and currently do, as well as the difference they have made to pharmacies and communities in towns and villages the length and breadth of our country. I know how valued they are by pharmacists, but more importantly by the people who come into contact with them as patients interacting with our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Pharmacies are very much a part of our health service. Today I formally thank pharmaceutical assistants for the role they have played in our health service. It is important to say this in light of the uncertainty and stress that I know many of them have endured, as I have had the opportunity to meet a number of them on many occasions. I very much welcome those who are in the Gallery to the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> I thank Senator Bacik for bringing forward these amendments with Senator Devine and others across the House and note the significant support for them. As is often the case, when one engages with Senator Bacik it is hard to dispute her logic.</p>

          <p eId="para_392">It can be frustrating at times but it is hard to dispute her expertise when it comes to the law and her knowledge of these matters. As the Senator knows, because I articulated such comments to her earlier, I have a concern about the practical implications of some of these amendments. Having said that, however, I do not intend to oppose them. I intend to engage with Senator Bacik and interested colleagues in my party and the Opposition between now and Report Stage to ensure we get the best possible outcome. This House is trying to ensure that those who are pharmaceutical assistants today will be able to continue practising in their career, using their qualification for their livelihood, knowing this is a legacy issue and there are not new pharmaceutical assistants being trained in Ireland and the numbers are declining year on year. They should also know that out of respect, dignity and an acknowledgement of the major contribution they make, they should be allowed to continue and finish their careers with certainty.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> One of the frustrating aspects of being a Minister is that on occasion I am precluded from really saying much more about this. There is a legal case, a regulatory structure and regulations in my Department. I hope those people can take where I stand from my words of thanks and gratitude, and the fact that I do not intend to oppose the amendments today. I will engage further with Senators between now and Report Stage as to whether this amendment is the best way to achieve the same outcome. It is certainly the view of Seanad Éireann and my view that the sensible thing to do is allow the amendment pass on Committee Stage and engage further between now and Report Stage.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_168">
          <from>Senator David Norris<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_394">I very much welcome the Minister's comments. It is a very good day for the Seanad that this amendment has been accepted in principle. Pharmaceutical assistants have done great work and there has never been any dissatisfaction expressed in them. I do not see any reason they should reduce their hours. There are approximately 300 pharmaceutical assistants in the country, predominantly women in their mid-50s and upwards. If the position remained unaltered, a temporary absence would be limited to one hour, which is absolutely ridiculous and a complete and utter nonsense. It would make quite a large number of these 300 people unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> I will put on the record a couple of statements from people who have written to me, as they will let the Minister know how these people feel. One states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_396">Please stand by us as I feel we need all the help we can get. We are all pushing on a bit but do not deserve to be dumped on the rubbish heap at this stage of our lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">That is the language used. It is "dumped on the rubbish heap at this stage of our lives.". Another states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_398">Since qualifying in 1984 I have worked all my life in a pharmacy as a qualified assistant, aware of the limitations of my certificate that I may act in the temporary absence of the pharmacist but that I could not own or manage a shop on my own account. It has been custom and practice for qualified assistants to cover pharmacists' absences ranging from annual holidays [which is a hell of a lot more than one hour] to sudden emergencies, illness, death etc. This is since our qualification came into being in 1890. "Temporary absence" remains undefined by statute to this day. When the Pharmacy Act 2007 was being proposed, we attended information meetings on the subject and we were reassured that where the Act reads "pharmacists" we could take it that it covered us as well but that did not happen. So now I have no job in pharmacy and no prospect of returning to work in a job that I love and have worked at all my life. At 60 years old I am one of the youngest qualified assistants and in a few short years the qualification will be no more as we retire.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> I am very grateful to the Minister for the positive attitude he has shown towards this amendment and I look forward to it being passed.</p>

          <from>Senator Máire Devine<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_400">Most people have covered the purpose of the amendment. The Minister sought to sign into law new rules pertaining to pharmaceutical assistants. Sinn Féin tried to rectify this in the Dáil but, unfortunately, our Report Stage amendment was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> These proposals extend the right to undertake continuing professional development to pharmaceutical assistants and subject them to a code of conduct, thus addressing in a more proportionate manner a perceived public safety matter related to the profession. There are other similar and ongoing issues within nursing - I refer to the introduction of or the increase in the nursing assistant grade - with concerns related to regulation, accountability, responsibility and a code of conduct in that respect. It is great to see something positive happening at this end, especially for a profession that is 90% female.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> Pharmaceutical assistants are very knowledgeable as locals will go into pharmacies and chat to them, seeking advice and getting information on common or everyday ailments. A person would be guaranteed that the advice would work and not do any harm. Demand will increase on pharmacies and pharmaceutical assistants because of the paucity of GPs and what is often a long wait for GP appointments. I am delighted this Bill will go through and it looks like everybody will support it across the Seanad.</p>

          <p eId="para_404">With that in mind, I will keep my contribution as short as possible. I welcome the members of the Registered Pharmaceutical Assistants Association to the Gallery. As I stand today in favour of these measures, I should say that patient safety comes first. I see nothing but improved patient safety coming from the role of the pharmaceutical assistant, who is there to help in terms of giving advice, helping with compliance and knowing patients over a long period. We have all been told how long most of these people have been practising. They have a right of expectation when they qualify and get a title that they would be allowed to practise and not be deprived of that livelihood. We have plenty of precedent across medicine, architecture and many other professions of grandfather clauses. In this instance, it might be more appropriate to call it a grandmother clause but on a serious note, had the Minister decided otherwise, I believe it would have resulted in litigation, as there is a right of expectation in the contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> I thank the Minister for taking the approach he has. We are all aware that sometimes, when we put down amendments with the best will or intention, some tweaking must be done to get the result we want. It is very clear from the Minister and everybody here that we want to see this title maintained. While there will not be any more pharmaceutical assistants, people have a right of expectation to finish their careers with dignity, as the Minister pointed out, and with certainty, which is very important. In no way should anything we do be seen to undermine or demean the excellence of service that this title and grade of assistant has delivered in communities right across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> As a GP, I know that when people come to me I am not the first person they have consulted. They may have consulted mammy, granny, the pharmacist and the public health nurse before they bother coming to see me. The role we are discussing today is very important and without it, the health service would be in serious trouble.</p>

          <from>Senator Maria Byrne<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T13:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_407">I thank the Minister for his commitment today and answering the many phone calls during the week about this. I also thank him for meeting me and other colleagues. When contacted about this, he was very forthcoming in saying he would see what he could do about this. As there are four pharmacists and a pharmaceutical assistant in my family, I suppose at this stage I have a vested interest. Many of these people went to college, as eloquently described by my colleague, Senator Bacik.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I commend Senator Bacik on putting down the amendment and on the work she has done in getting the amendment before the House today.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> Pharmaceutical assistants have a valid role to play. As was said by Senator Reilly, patient safety is what we are all concerned with. These people have saved many lives. They have given great advice to people over the years. To turn around and tell them now they can only work one hour per day unsupervised makes no sense. I know a pharmacy where there is a pharmacist and an assistant in the practice. If the pharmacist gets sick, the assistant has to take over. It is not easy to get a locum at short notice. There are many knock-on implications. If this was not accepted today, it would affect the running of pharmacies. I thank the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> I wish to namecheck Francis Campion Cassidy in Limerick. He has been part of the Minister's group and to the forefront in bringing this to our attention. I thank the other members of the Minister's group who are from the Limerick area. I have had considerable contact from them over a lengthy period.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> Senator Bacik referred to continuing professional development. Many of the pharmaceutical assistants currently participate in CPD but making it compulsory is encouraging because it will ensure that everyone is up to speed with everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> I thank the Minister for accepting the amendment today. It is most welcome.</p>

          <p eId="para_416">In fact, I have some proximity to pharmaceutical assistants myself. Some people say the Seanad is not representative. I find that bizarre given the testimony from Senator Byrne. It seems we all have relationships with pharmaceutical assistants and we are only too well aware of the important work they do in our community.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> There has been extraordinary frustration among members of the Registered Pharmaceutical Assistants Association in recent years since this issue first came to light. I took a keen interest in it from day one. I thank the Minister for his pragmatism and the perspective that he articulated today.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> The amendment is tightly drawn but if we can secure the same outcome with improvements to an amendment on Report Stage, I know Senator Bacik, myself, as a co-sponsor of the amendment, and many others would be happy to work to try to achieve the objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> We know the strain our acute medical services are under. We know too that it has been the ambition of successive Governments to ensure pharmacists and the pharmacy sector can contribute more to community-based interventions and primary care interventions in terms of wellness and well-being and the general health of our population. To remove a cohort of highly professional qualified and experienced individuals from this sector would have been disastrous for healthcare in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> Senator Reilly is right. We have a long history of grandfather clauses in professional titles, including in architecture, for example. In a previous life I worked with the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland before I came to these Houses. We have a tradition and history of doing that. That is the pragmatic thing to do. I thank the Minister. I look forward to working with him on Report Stage. We will ensure the Minister delivers on his commitment - I know that he will. We want to work with him in the interests of the pharmaceutical assistants and all who depend on pharmacies throughout the country, which is everyone.</p>

          <p eId="para_431">These are essentially technical amendments. I am proposing amendments to the sections of the Nurses and Midwives Act and the Medical Practitioners Act which enable the relevant bodies to make rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> The Bill as passed by the Dáil inserts a new subsection (15)(<i>c</i>) into section 20 of the 2007 Act. Section 20 of that Act deals with membership functions and procedures of the committee and council and sub-committees of the council. The new subsection provides that sub-committees of the fitness to practise committee may perform any of the functions of the committee as if they were the fitness to practise committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> Section 11 of the Act sets out the powers of the council to make rules. I am concerned that the rule-making power of the council does not reflect the breadth of functions intended by subsection (15)(<i>c</i>). I propose replacing the wording "into different groups founding a complaint" with the wording "into complaints referred to that committee". I am also making an identical amendment to the Nurses and Midwives Act. These are essentially technical amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_436">This also is effectively a technical amendment. Section 38 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 addresses areas that overlap between the practice and other health professions. Under existing legislation where a person holds a dual qualification in medicine and in another profession, for example, dentistry, this section allows that person to lawfully practice those areas of dentistry which overlap with medicine without having to be on the register of medical practitioners. Section 37 provides that a person must be registered with the Medical Council in order to practise medicine in the State. This amendment, recommended by the Office of the Attorney General, clarifies that the requirements of section 37 do not apply to a person registered as a dentist, nurse and so on, who is practising medicine when carrying out tasks in the context of other specified health professions.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_440">It is nice to be back in the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> This amendment relates to a new provision inserted in the Bill on Committee Stage. The new provision would require all schools to provide to both parents and the Department information relating to voluntary contributions inclusive of the total moneys collected annually and a detailed expenditure of those moneys by the school and would require my Department to publish all of this information on its website on an annual basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> During the Committee Stage debate, I outlined my concerns about this provision and indicated to the House that I would examine it in more detail, and would, if necessary, bring forward an amendment to address my concerns. In particular, I outlined that I needed to reflect carefully on the additional administrative burden that it would place on schools. This is a particularly important consideration for me. I had been clear that it is not my intention or the intention of this legislation to unnecessarily add to the administrative burden on schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> In the period since Committee Stage was completed, I carefully examined this provision and I have some concerns arising from that examination. Of particular concern is that this provision will undoubtedly lead to an additional and significant administrative burden for schools. It puts in place an entirely new and much more extensive financial reporting requirement on schools. This new requirement is in addition to what I have already provided for in the Bill in relation to schools providing information on voluntary contributions and how they are spent directly to students and to parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> The wording of this provision is also problematic. It refers in general terms to information on detailed expenditure being provided to parents and to the Department but it does not specify what information or level of detail must be provided. The provision is, therefore, unclear and is not consistent with the overall approach in the Bill, which involves the charter guidelines setting out clearly the specific information that is to be provided to students and parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> The guidelines will be developed following a consultative process with the education partners. This consultative process will help ensure the reporting requirements put in place under the charter guidelines are clear to all, the relevant information needed for transparency is made available, and the reporting requirements are straightforward and workable at school level. In addition, all schools must comply with their obligations under the charter guidelines and the Minister may issue a direction to any school that is not so complying, including where it is not complying with the requirement to provide information in relation to voluntary contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> The inclusion in the Bill of another requirement outside of, and entirely separate from, the charter requirements for the provision of a further and potentially more detailed set of data to parents and the Department does not make sense. The publication of such data would also inevitably lead to the creation of a new type of league table - this time about school finances and levels of voluntary contributions. We all know that league tables that take account of only one aspect of a school's life are unfair, lacking in context and do not reflect the individual school's efforts, circumstances and challenges. Similar issues would arise in relation to the publication of data on voluntary contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> Every school is different and has different fundraising requirements and priorities. At any given time, these may differ. Those requirements and priorities can also change over time within a particular school.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> Publishing data that allow for a comparison of schools based on moneys raised and spent in a given year without any consideration of context would be misleading for parents and unfair to the schools concerned. For example, such comparisons would not reflect the difference between a school that consistently seeks high contributions and a school that in a given year or for a short period is fundraising for a particular project or facility but typically does not seek or raise significant amounts from parents. It also would not distinguish between those schools that are clear to parents that all contributions are voluntary and those schools in which parents may perceive that there is an obligation to make a contribution even though it is voluntary.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> In this Bill, I am putting in place an obligation on schools to be transparent on voluntary contributions and to provide key information to parents on the moneys raised and how they have been spent. I am doing this in a structured and clear way as part of a school's obligation under its student and parent charter. I believe that the approach that I have taken in the Bill in this regard is clear, fair and balanced and will not be unduly burdensome for schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> I accept that the intentions of the Senator at all times on the issue were motivated by his own insights into this. I regret having to delete a provision previously voted in by the House but after taking the time since Committee Stage to examine this addition provision in detail, for the reasons I have outlined I propose to delete it from the Bill.</p>

          <from>Senator Paul Gavan<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_451">I welcome the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> This is one of the most disappointing moments in my three and a half years working here. It is only a couple of weeks ago that we had widespread support for this amendment. The amendment stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_453">"... Schools shall ... provide to both parents and the Department of Education information relating to voluntary contributions, inclusive of the total monies collected annually, and a detailed expenditure of those monies by the school; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_454">(b) The Department of Education shall publish this information on the website, updating it on an annual basis.".</p>
          <p eId="para_455">It was a simple amendment calling for transparency in school voluntary contributions. It commanded the support of every party in the House and Independents with the exception of Fine Gael.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> I must be honest with the Minister. This is an opportunity that he should have embraced. It is an opportunity to give parents transparency. More important, it is an opportunity to show the total amount of school voluntary contributions made each year.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> I must be blunt with the Minister. The reasons he put forward for rejecting this amendment simply do not stack up. Frankly, the phrase "additional administrative burden" is nonsense. Schools make totals in respect of the school voluntary contributions. There is no additional work. The work of the Department would simply be to request an email detailing the funds and then total them; that is it. It is, therefore, a smokescreen. The nonsense about league tables is just that.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> Here is what really disappoints me. If the Minister was serious about reforming school voluntary contributions, he would have contacted my office. The Minister would have said to me that he had concerns regarding the Bill and asked whether he could work with me and consider the wording. There was not a single call, not a single email. That is because the Minister does not want a light shone on the total amount of underfunding of schools in this State. That is what this amendment would do. This amendment would require the Department to detail the total amount of school contributions and, thereby, the total amount of under-funding every year, and it would embarrass the Department. That is why the Minister does not want to go ahead with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> The Minister has chosen the last afternoon of the last sitting day of the year on the basis that there will be Senators missing here this afternoon when I push it to a vote. Of course, I will push it to a vote, not only for Sinn Féin but for the parents out there who want and expect transparency from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> It is a shameful moment for the Government to decide it will put these figures back in the dark and hide them because the underfunding, which is consistently a problem in the education system, is a cause of embarrassment. Despite the wishes of the vast majority of parents in this country, the Minister wants to keep these figures in the dark.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> It is a poor moment for Deputy McHugh as a Minister. I will oppose the amendment.</p>

          <from>Senator Maria Byrne<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_462">I thank the Minister for his explanation.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> Following the discussion we had on Committee Stage, I spoke to a number of school principals and some parents. There were mixed views regarding what had been proposed by the other side of the House. One of the principals said that not everybody is in a position to make a voluntary contribution, there are circumstances in which a contribution is not given and that it is not compulsory, but they would not like to highlight that one family gave it and others would be missing from the list, and they currently put together a comprehensive report that they give to their parents' council and the school governing body or whatever, where the money is accounted for, as is how it is spent. It is not as though it is not accounted for is the point that was made. I contacted four schools of different groupings and the opinion seemed to be the same. I support the Minister's call.</p>

          <from>Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_464">We all have concerns about this amendment. My understanding was that the Minister had spoken to my party's spokesperson for education, that this would go through today and if there were amendments in the Dáil, it would be addressed. The Minister has now said that he is removing it. It was unexpected for all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The fact that it is proposed to remove it is of concern. There are concerns about the Government amendment. As the Minister is aware, some schools do a lot of fundraising, whereas others may not be in a position to so do. We need to strike a balance. I am somewhat surprised that it is proposed to remove the amendment made on Committee Stage. That is my main concern. Senators were not made aware that the amendment was to be removed and I have concerns in that regard.</p>

          <from>Senator Lynn Ruane<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_466">There have not been many occasions when a Minister has come to the House to ask the Seanad to reverse the will it previously expressed, although attempts have been made in the Dáil to amend or remove amendments made in the Seanad. I was disappointed when the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, attempted to persuade the Seanad to reverse its decision. She did not succeed. At the time, it was seen as disrespectful to the Seanad to expect that, having voted once on the matter, Senators would change their minds on it within a few weeks. Attempting to reverse Seanad amendments in the Dáil is fine; it is a different House and we cannot control it.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> The points made by Senator Byrne on the effect of Senator Gavan's amendment are inaccurate. It would not be the case that students' family situations or the names of parents would be printed on a list. This is about accounting within schools and identifying where the money is being spent. It is not a ledger of which families have paid. That is a bit of a red herring, as are the league tables. If anything, Senator Gavan's amendment would highlight the stark inequality in school funding and identify that certain families in certain communities can provide more than others. As Senator Gavan stated, by looking at the amount that schools are taking in through voluntary contributions, it would be possible to identify where there is underfunding and discern by how much we need to increase the capitation grant. I urge the Minister to rethink the amendment because this section of the Bill as it stands would provide invaluable information for the Department on how much schools are bringing in through voluntary contributions.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_468">I am trying to be consistent regarding the motivation behind the student and parent charter. In the early stages of our extensive consultation with education partners and schools on the charter, we were clear that it would not put an extra administrative burdens on schools. Senator Gavan suggested that it would only involve one email but it is not that simple. There is an administrative requirement. There are 4,000 schools in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> The point made by the Senator on transparency is already embedded in the legislation. There are guidelines within the Bill to ensure that schools are obliged to make information on the moneys they raise and the subscriptions made available for public consumption. That would achieve the goals which the Senator claims are the motivation behind the amendment which was made on Committee Stage. The last thing I want to do is to put more of an administrative burden on schools and principals. A key term to which I was introduced at a very early stage in this job is "initiative overload". There will be an obligation under the student and parent charter for schools to publish information on any money raised and how it is spent. If there is a better mechanism to ensure that is done in a way that will allay the Senator's fears, I am open to continuing that conversation when the Bill returns to the Dáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_512">This amendment is in two parts.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">Part (a) provides that the Minister may allow for a review of the charter guidelines from time to time, as he or she considers appropriate and with the review of the charter guidelines to take place before the end of each relevant period. Part (b) provides for a definition of the relevant period, which is every five years starting from the date on which this section of the Bill comes into operation. On Committee Stage, Senator Gavan proposed an amendment to provide that the charter guidelines would be reviewed at least every five years. I could not accept the Senator's amendment as worded at that time, but I agreed to introduce an amendment to achieve the Senator's aim on Report Stage. The amendment I am now proposing still allows for the Minister to review the guidelines from time to time if he or she needs to, but it also ensures that they must be reviewed at least once in every five-year period starting from when the relevant section of the Bill is commenced, as Senator Gavan proposed. It is important that the Bill provides for a mandatory periodic review of the guidelines while also allowing the flexibility to review the guidelines at a shorter interval if a matter addressed in the guidelines needs to be updated or revised, or if an urgent or new issue emerges in schools that could be addressed in the charter guidelines. I thank the Senator for identifying this need on Committee Stage and I am pleased to be able to bring forward the amendment to address it now. I hope both the Senator and this House can support this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_514">On Committee Stage, Senator Craughwell tabled an amendment which proposed to make explicit reference to teachers in section 27C(c), in order to make clear that the provision was referring to mutual respect and communication between teachers, students and parents. While I could not accept the amendment as worded on Committee Stage, I outlined at the time that I was open to making such a provision and my officials have since engaged on the matter with legislative drafters. As a result, I am pleased to bring forward this amendment, which ensures that section 27C will now make explicit reference to teachers. The provision, when amended, will refer to "mutual respect in communications between the school, including teachers or other staff of the school, on the one hand and students or their parents on the other hand". The majority of day-to-day communications in a school are between teachers or other school staff and students or their parents, and I am happy to make explicit reference to this in the Bill. It is appropriate that the amendment refers to other staff in the school. Everyone in this House will agree with me about each individual's role and contribution to school life. I have taken the opportunity to ensure this explicit reference to teachers and other staff also applies in subsection (d), which concerns confidentiality in communications between schools and students and their parents. I thank the Senator for raising this issue on Committee Stage and I hope he and the House can support my amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_515">I do not completely understand the distinction being made, which seems to be quite arbitrary. When we talk about a school we know quite well that we are talking about staff, teachers and everyone who makes up a school community. The amendment now makes reference to schools and teachers on one hand and students and parents on the other. What is the arbitrary distinction between schools and teachers and students and parents? It does not seem like mutual respect. There seems to be a direct relation between the communication and the respect between two distinct groups. Am I misreading that? I do not follow it. Could the Minister elaborate on the amendment?</p>

          <p eId="para_516">Senator Craughwell raised this matter in a Committee Stage amendment and it is something about which we have thought. When there is communication between students and a school, or parents and a school, that includes the whole school body. School bodies are made up of teachers, caretakers, SNAs, special education teachers and secretaries. At the heart of every school is the acknowledgement of all those who play a significant role. We are all on the same page regarding the value of teachers, and this amendment is just about including that in the Bill. I was happy to accept the Senator's point. It is not making a distinction between anyone or singling anybody out.</p>

          <p eId="para_528">Amendments Nos. 4 and 6 seek to better recognise and embed the role of the Ombudsman for Children in the procedures set out in this Bill. We had a discussion about this on Committee Stage so I do not propose to go into it in detail, but the simple fact is that the role of the ombudsman under the 2002 Act has a significant arbitrary restriction as he or she cannot investigate a complaint into the actions of a school until the local procedures have been exhausted. As I said on Committee Stage, there is a significant concern that a belligerent board of management could deliberately frustrate the ombudsman's role by drawing out the local complaints procedure, in direct opposition to the interests of the child at the centre of the complaint. I am therefore proposing the removal of this arbitrary restriction on the ombudsman's role, in order that he or she could intervene in a complaint against the school at whatever stage he or she felt was appropriate, and would not have to wait until the local procedures are exhausted. We need to trust the office of the ombudsman, which has previously served this State with distinction, with the power to intervene at the point which is in the best interests of the child, rather than those of the school or the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> I thank officials in the Department for engaging with my office in respect of these amendments. I appreciate that we do not want to disincentivise parents and students from using the local procedures as a first port of call, but this is an issue that can be dealt with in the guidelines outside of the law and the office of the ombudsman should not continue to be arbitrarily restricted on those grounds. I also appreciate the concern that there may be confusion among parents if there were both local and national complaints options available. However, I do not believe avoiding confusion is an adequate reason to further disadvantage the office of the ombudsman. It is surely not outside our abilities as a State to properly arm parents with clear and comprehensive information. That is why I retabled amendment No. 4, which would require that guidelines around grievances should have to explain the role of the Ombudsman for Children in this respect. I have redrafted the amendment submitted on Committee Stage to incorporate concerns expressed by the Department. This new charter process must be overseen by an expert in children's rights who has their best interests in mind. The Ombudsman for Children must be released from an arbitrary restriction which flies in the face of best international practice and his or her role in other areas. I understand that the Minister is considering amendments in the Dáil which would make the role of the ombudsman somehow contingent on the progress of a complaint through local procedures, which is not good enough. I do not understand why the Department or the Minister for Education and Skills would be so fearful of giving the ombudsman a remit in this area. We are talking about a democratically selected expert in children's issues and the idea that he or she would abuse or misuse this new power, or use it without the best interests of the child at heart, is ludicrous and non-existent. I urge the Minister to take these amendments on board.</p>

          <p eId="para_531">Amendment No. 4 would require the grievance procedures under the charter guidelines to include an explanation of the role of the Ombudsman for Children under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 as it relates to complaints against schools. On Committee Stage I advised the House that while I did not think it was necessary for the Bill to provide the grievance procedures set out the role of the Ombudsman for Children, I would have my officials consider this issue further with a view to bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage if required. Having examined this proposal further, I am satisfied that including this in the Bill is not the appropriate way to achieve the Senator's goal. As the Senator is aware, the role of the Ombudsman for Children is set out very comprehensively in the 2002 Act. I acknowledge that the Senator has adjusted this amendment to refer to the role of the Ombudsman for Children insofar as it relates to complaints against schools. However, there are many provisions in the Act which governs the ombudsman's remit regarding complaints against schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">It is not appropriate, nor would it be possible, to summarise in this Bill or in school grievance procedures this extensive legislation or to attempt to summarise the various conditions and provisions that apply to the role of the Ombudsman for Children under the 2002 Act insofar as it relates to schools. Doing so in this Bill risks casting doubt on or limiting the statutory role of the Ombudsman for Children under its own legislation. For the same reasons, it would also not be appropriate to require schools to provide an explanation to students or parents of the role of the Ombudsman for Children. The appropriate body to do this is the office itself. I will, however, make it a requirement under the charter guidelines that the grievance procedures would require that schools must always inform students or parents of the fact that they may be able to make a complaint to the Ombudsman for Children. I also intend that schools would be required to provide students and parents with contact or website details of the Ombudsman for Children in order that they can make their own contact with the office to determine independently whether a complaint can be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> I strongly agree with the Senator that this is very important information for students and parents and I will ensure this requirement will be included in the guidelines on the grievance procedures. However, for the reasons I have outlined, the approach to setting this out in primary legislation is not appropriate and it may cast doubt on or potentially limit the remit of the Ombudsman for Children with respect to schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> On Committee Stage I advised the Senator that I needed more time to consider what is now amendment No. 6. Since Committee Stage, my Department has undertaken significant further analysis of the matter and engaged with the Ombudsman for Children, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General. With this matter I am endeavouring to balance factors such as the valid issues raised by the Senator, the current legal framework under which the Ombudsman for Children operates, the autonomy of schools and a general desirability that grievance procedures at school level would be followed before the Ombudsman for Children would become involved in a complaint. These are complex and interrelated matters and great care is required to ensure we get the balance right.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> I agree it may be appropriate for the Ombudsman for Children to intervene in some limited cases, such as where a school is deliberately delaying or frustrating local grievance procedures, but I must also balance that against a need to ensure the matters should be resolved at local school level where possible. That is the best and most satisfactory approach for both students, parents and the schools involved. It is better for all concerned if, in the first instance, the school considers and deals with the grievance at local school level, even where the outcome is not to the satisfaction of the complainant. This gives all parties the opportunity to present the position and come to an understanding of the perspective and position of the other parties. I also do not want to create a position where students and parents may be confused about any perceived overlap between the local school grievance procedures and the Ombudsman for Children complaints procedure. I am therefore not fully persuaded at this time that deleting section 9(2) entirely would be an appropriate step.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> I am exploring, however, whether an approach that instead sets some limits on section 9(2) or qualifies it in some way would be more appropriate. The aim would be to ensure that for the majority of cases, the local complaints procedures would have to be exhausted, but it must also cater for those exceptional cases where awaiting exhaustion of the local process would not be appropriate. There are complex legal and practical considerations that require further work before I will be in a position to decide the best way to do this. I acknowledge the Senator's efforts in communicating with the Department and putting forward her views on the matter. I assure her I will continue this work with a view to bringing forward an appropriate amendment on this matter once the various legal and other issues are teased out. I cannot accept the amendment but I assure the Senator that we will continue to work on this matter with a view to resolving the complex issues involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_538"> With regard to amendment No. 6, no ombudsman would intervene too early in a matter. There would not be resources or time to step into local procedures where it is not absolutely necessary. I do not foresee a position where parents or children would be confused about the role of national and local procedures. A student or parent would only look outside the local procedures if they struggled to operate within the local procedures. I am pretty confident there would not be a big influx of people trying to access a national complaints procedure before a local one. This would not be overly complex and it may be made more confusing than it is. The Office of the Ombudsman for Children is eager to see the office being able to intervene and we must trust that it knows when or when not to do so. Possible confusion is not an adequate reason to not push this amendment. I am willing to withdraw amendment No. 4 but I will be pressing amendment No. 6.</p>

We must also acknowledge the great principals, teachers, school boards, staff and students. A number of issues remain to be addressed at a later stage in the Dáil. A paper was published by University of Limerick and ESRI academics yesterday showing that there is a need for the Department of Education and Skills to play a greater role in defining how digital devices are used in schools. We need a concrete vision for this in the coming years. It is a major issue and I know the Minister will address it. This legislation must go back to the Dáil, but overall it is very welcome.</p>

          <p eId="para_580">I thank the Members for the discussions in here and conversations. Certainly, we all come from different backgrounds, but as always in the Seanad, people's convictions are as consistent as ever, which I always respect. Where I cannot meet people halfway, I try to go as far as I can. The amendments that I brought in here today arising from Committee Stage stem from the different suggestions that were made in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> The purpose of this Bill is to give young people and parents a voice, and it is particularly focused on the youth voice. Anybody involved in politics globally at this stage knows that the youth voice is getting louder and stronger, so it is a case of what we do to facilitate that voice. I hope that this Bill will act as a mechanism to meet that demand coming from young people. Any of the challenges, such as the last one raised by the Senator in terms of technology in classrooms, at the heart of those challenges have to be young people because they are people who were born after the Internet came into existence. I think the sociological label for young people is digital natives. Some of us in this House were born at a time when there was not even a landline. I am assuming that the Leas-Chathaoirleach and I are in the same boat.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Michael D'Arcy)<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_588">The Appropriation Bill 2019 is an essential element of financial housekeeping that must be concluded by both Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of the year. The Bill serves two primary purposes, the first of which is to authorise in law all of the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2019 on the basis of the Estimates that have been voted on by the Dáil during the year. Section 1 and Schedule 1 set out the amounts to be appropriated for supply services. These relate to the amounts included in the Revised Estimates for 2019 voted by the Dáil earlier this year and the Supplementary Estimates voted by the Dáil on 12 December. In aggregate, these Estimates amount to €54.6 billion. The comparable amount in the Appropriation Act 2018 was €50.9 billion. Therefore, the amount to be appropriated this year represents an increase of €3.7 billion on last year's net voted expenditure. The second key purpose of the Appropriation Bill is to provide a legal basis for spending to continue into 2020. The passage of the Bill will allow for continued funding in the period before the 2020 Estimates are approved of social welfare payments from the social protection Vote, Exchequer pay and pensions and other voted expenditure. If the Bill were not enacted before the end of December, there would be no authority to spend any voted moneys in 2020 from the start of January until approval of the 2020 Estimates, since this authority for 2020, as contained in the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965, is based on the amounts provided for in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> Under the rolling multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in budget 2004, Departments may carry over from the current year to the following year unspent capital up to a maximum of 10% of voted capital. The multi-annual system is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the management by Departments and agencies of capital programmes and projects. It recognises the difficulties inherent in the planning and profiling of capital expenditure and acknowledges that capital projects may be subject to delays. The carryover facility allows for a portion of unspent moneys which would have been lost to the capital programmes and projects concerned under the annual system of allocating capital to be made available for spending on programme priorities in the subsequent year. The Appropriation Act determines definitively the capital amounts which may be carried over to the following year. The aggregate amount of proposed capital carryover from 2019 into 2020 is €215.4 million, which represents 2.9% of the total Exchequer capital programme of over €7 billion for 2019. The amount carried over from 2018 into 2019 was €93 million. The proposed amounts to be carried over by Vote are set out in Schedule 2. The Revised Estimates Volume for 2020 sets out detailed financial and key performance information for Departments and offices. In Part II of the Estimates for each Vote availing of the capital carryover facility, a table is included listing the amounts to be deferred by subhead.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> Certain Exchequer liabilities and social welfare payments are due for payment by electronic funds transfer on 1 and 2 January next. The banking system will be closed on 1 January so funding will need to be in place in departmental bank accounts before the end of this year in order to meet those liabilities on a timely basis. In addition, An Post needs to be pre-funded before the end of the 2019 in respect of certain benefit payments due in the first week of January 2020 in order to physically transfer cash to its network of post offices throughout the country. These Exchequer pay and pension and social welfare payments form part of the supply of services for 2020 and, consequently, the funds to cover these costs will be included in amounts disbursed from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account as part of the 2020 supply issues. These costs will come under moneys voted in 2020 in respect of which the usual processes and mechanisms for voted moneys in 2020 will apply. In line with last year, section 3 of the Bill includes a specific provision to allow for an advance, not exceeding €185 million, from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account, with this advance then being repaid to the Central Fund in January.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> The signed Appropriation Act is required by the Comptroller and Auditor General for clearance of the end of year issues from the Exchequer. Under Article 25.2.1° of the Constitution, the President may not sign a Bill earlier than the fifth day after the date on which it is presented to him. However, there is provision in Article 25.2.2° whereby, at the request of the Government and with the prior concurrence of Seanad Éireann, the President may sign a Bill on an earlier date than the fifth day mentioned. In view of the urgency of this Bill, the provision in Article 25.2.2° is sought and a motion to this effect is placed before the Seanad. Such an early signature motion has also been sought in respect of the Appropriation Bill in previous years.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> The Appropriation Bill is an essential element of housekeeping which those of us in both Houses of the Oireachtas are required to undertake. The passing of the Bill will authorise in law all of the expenditure that has been undertaken in 2019 on the basis of the Estimates voted on by the Dáil during the year. Of fundamental importance to those who depend on our essential public services, the passage of the Bill will also ensure that payments funded from voted expenditure in 2019 such as housing assistance payments, jobseeker's allowance, disability allowance, non-contributory State pension, nurses' pay, teachers' pay and all other pay and pensions funded from voted money, can continue to be funded in 2020 in the period before the Dáil approves the 2020 Estimates.</p>

I will not delay the House. My party supports the Bill and we do not have any amendments to it. No amendments have been tabled to the Bill and I do not think there is any opposition to it. We all want to make sure people get their pensions, social welfare, children's allowance and other payments in the first week in January.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Michael D'Arcy)<recordedTime time="2019-12-18T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_599">The proposed Migration of Participating Securities Bill comprises 16 sections and provides a legislative mechanism to facilitate the migration of Irish issuers from their current central securities depository, CSD, Euroclear UK &amp; Ireland, to an alternative CSD provider. I would first like to provide some background information on the CSD migration project and the reasons for bringing this legislation forward. CSDs are specialist financial institutions that hold securities and facilitate trading between market operators. CSDs are a vital and systemic part of market infrastructure that enable the effective functioning of settlement systems. The Irish market relies upon a CSD based in the United Kingdom called Euroclear UK &amp; Ireland which operates the CREST settlement system. Once the UK becomes a third country, under the relevant European legislation, the central securities depository regulation, CSD-R, Euroclear UK &amp; Ireland may no longer be able to provide its services into Ireland. As a result, Euronext Dublin, formerly the Irish Stock Exchange, announced in October 2018, its intention to transfer the settlement of trades in Irish equities and other exchange traded instruments to Euroclear Bank Belgium. Most European CSDs operate what is known as an intermediated holding model. In order for Irish issuers to migrate to one of these alternative CSDs, the title of the participating securities must be transferred from the current holder to the designated CSD or its nominee.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> It is important to note that while the title will be held by the CSD's nominee, the beneficial ownership of the shares is retained by the ultimate investor who remains the owner of those shares and will continue to exercise their voting rights and participate in corporate actions. Since the beginning of the migration project, officials from the Department of Finance, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Central Bank of Ireland have been engaging intensively with stakeholders across the Irish market. One outcome of that engagement was a request from issuers and the Irish legal community for a legislative mechanism to facilitate migration by providing for the transfer of title to the migrating securities by operation of law. This would provide an alternative and simpler means of migration to that of a scheme of arrangement under Part 9 of the Companies Act 2014. In the absence of an alternative legislative mechanism, issuers would instead have to rely upon a scheme of arrangement under Part 9 of the 2014 Act to obtain the approval of the High Court which imposes higher legal and administrative costs on issuers.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> On 17 July 2019, the Government approved the general scheme of migration of participating securities Bill to facilitate the migration of Irish issuers. Since that time, the Department of Finance and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation have been working with all interested stakeholders and the offices of the Attorney General and Parliamentary Counsel on the proposed legislation. The legislative mechanism, as provided for in the Migration of Participating Securities Bill 2019, will allow for a more orderly migration of the market from Euroclear UK &amp; Ireland while reducing the legal and administrative burdens. Early enactment will also facilitate the holding of the necessary shareholder votes during the 2020 annual general meeting season while giving the market confidence that an orderly migration can be completed by the deadline.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> I will now turn to the Bill itself and some of its key provisions. Section 3 provides for a definition of "migration" and that a reference to "migration" is to be interpreted as the title to those migrating securities becoming and being vested in the nominated central securities depository or a body nominated by that central securities depository with respect to its operation as a central securities depository for the purpose of recording those securities in book-entry form and the settlement of trades in those securities. This section also provides clarification that the provisions of the Companies Act 2014 will continue to apply to those issuers that have migrated and nothing in the Act shall operate to divest security holders of their relevant rights and interests in the participating securities.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> Section 4 sets out the conditions that an issuer must satisfy in order to consent to migration of its securities and that migration, as provided for in this section, will have effect notwithstanding the Act of 2014 nor any provisions in the participating issuer's constitution. Section 5 sets out the following: the conditions that must be complied with in order for an issuer to consent to migration including: passing a special resolution specifying the CSD to which the securities will migrate; the name of the member state in which the designated CSD is authorised; if applicable, the nominated body to which the title to the securities will transfer; confirmation that the CSD is authorised in a particular member state; and certain conditions that must be met in order to name a CSD in the special resolution including that the issuer has notified that depository in writing of its intent to migrate to it, that the depository has provided a written statement to the issuer with regard to its obligations under Article 23 of the CSD-R, that the securities have been accepted for admittance by the depository and that if not already in place, the CSD will have obtained authorisation to passport its services into Ireland on and from the date migration will take effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> Section 6 sets out further conditions that an issuer must comply with to consent to migration, in particular the content of the circular that must be issued to the issuer’s members with the notice of the meeting to vote on the special resolution, including an explanation of the proposed migration and its impact on the members; an explanation of the options available to those members who do not wish to have their shares subject to the migration; an explanation of the options available to those members who currently hold their shares in certificated form who wish to have their shares included in the migration; a summary of the relevant laws in the member state in which the CSD is authorised; a list of the documents related to the migration and where they can be accessed or otherwise inspected; and a recommendation from the directors of the issuer on the merits of the proposed migration, including a timetable of key dates in the process and any other information considered relevant to migration. Section 7 provides that an issuer or its officer that defaults in complying with the provisions of sections 5 and 6 shall be guilty of an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> Section 10 provides for the necessary filings to be made by an issuer to confirm that it has complied with the requirements of the legislation and is ready to migrate, including a filing with the listing authority and a statement provided by the directors of compliance with the legislation in the form of a sworn affidavit. The listing authority must maintain a list of issuers that have completed their filings and publish the list on its website. An issuer or its officers that defaults in complying with these provisions shall be guilty of an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> Section 11 provides for the disapplication of certain provisions of the Companies Act 2014 that are not relevant to a CSD in the conduct of its function. For the purposes of migration, section 94(4) requiring a written instrument of transfer and section 99(2) of the Companies Act 2014 requiring an issuer to issue share certificates to the CSD shall also not apply. This section further disapplies section 18 of the Competition Act 2002 and section 8(3) of the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997 so that the transfer of title to the CSD for the purposes of migration does not trigger statutory change of control provisions in those pieces of legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> Section 12 provides the listing authority with the relevant powers to set by order the live date on which the title to those participating securities will transfer. The listing authority may also set dates past which it will no longer accept further filings and it may vary the dates set in the relevant orders if necessary. Section 14 provides the Minister with the necessary powers to make regulations prescribing anything required by the Bill to be prescribed, which includes a prescribed form for the purposes of section 10, and requires that such regulations be laid before the Oireachtas, whereupon they may be annulled by resolution within 21 days. Section 15 provides that no liability will attach to the listing authority in fulfilling its obligations under section 12 or any other function it may carry out under this Act. Section 16 repeals section 4 of the legislation on 30 March 2021 which is the date set down in the European Commission’s equivalence decision for UK-based securities depositories in the event of a hard Brexit. This will mean that the other provisions of the legislation will remain in effect after 30 March 2021 but it will not be possible for an issuer to avail of this migration mechanism after the cessation date as it would not be able to consent to migration without the provisions of section 4 being in effect. The Minister may extend this date if the Commission extends its equivalence decision to a later date subject to the approval of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

I acknowledge the briefing that was done in advance by the Minister of State's officials, Andrew Doyle and Oliver Gilvarry, who were very helpful in meeting me, and I am sure others, in advance of this legislation being brought in. If we wanted to really simplify it, we would say that the UK is leaving the EU and the Irish Stock Exchange, now called Euronext Dublin, was using the UK. It will not be able to do that in the longer term because the UK will not be in the EU so it is moving to Belgium. There is a lot of legislation required to make sure that all works well. It is right and proper that this House and the other House, which has already dealt with it, make sure we are facilitating smooth commerce and transactions in terms of the stock exchange requirements. We are facilitating them through this legislation. It is important legislation. It is not the kind of thing we might put on the front of a leaflet, but at the same time it is most important that we have a working stock exchange that can do its business for the benefit of everybody in this country and ultimately for all those companies involved with the Stock Exchange. I thank the Minister of State and his staff for a comprehensive statement. There is no point in me repeating all that he has just given us. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_612">As was said, this is a highly technical Bill which seeks to make a contingency provision for the transfer of the settlement of trades in Irish equities and other securities from CREST in London to Euroclear in Belgium as a result of the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. The CSDs allow the transfer of securities and financial instruments to the electronic book entries in a central register rather than through physical delivery. Ireland has relied on the CSD based in London. The CSD is operated by Euroclear UK &amp; Ireland, which uses a settlement system knows as CREST. I am not going to go into all that is covered in the Bill. It has been covered quite comprehensively. However, it does raise the question as to why we are not like other countries. The Minister of State might address that. Why do we not have the CSD based in the financial services in London rather than in another country? Following the decision to move its settlement to Euroclear Belgium, I understand that a White Paper was published in May to set out a new model for the market. It speaks again to the impact of Brexit and our dependence. It is important for us to have a positive relationship with our neighbours but I think we will increasingly see how we need to be as in charge as we can about all of our affairs, our financial and other affairs, within this State.</p>

          <p eId="para_613">I thank the Minister of State and his officials. It was very helpful that they went to the trouble of giving a comprehensive and detailed briefing to assist us to understand the Bill and gave us an opportunity to seek clarification in the run-up to today. It is a highly technical and complex Bill. We are in the hands of professional advisers in the Department of Finance and others. I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State's staff and thank the Department for facilitating us with the briefing and responses to our queries. I will be supporting the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_616">In the third paragraph, the Minister of State says it all. The Irish market relies upon a CSD based in the United Kingdom operated under the CREST settlement system. Once the UK becomes a third country under the relevant European legislation, the central securities depository, Euroclear UK &amp; Ireland, may no longer be able to provide a service into Ireland, so it has to find a new provider. The Minister has outlined in great detail how all of that will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> On section 8, in respect of the calling quorums, there are new ways of holding corporate meetings now and they are done online and through conference calls and all that.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">When a quorum is called, will people have to be present physically or will it be possible to have a quorum through a conference call, etc.? I would like clarification on that issue. I welcome the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_620">I will try to clear up those issues. The UK becoming a third country as a result of Brexit and the potential knock-on effects for settlement is a market issue that will require a market-led solution. Ultimately, CSDs are private market operators. Euronext Dublin, formerly the Irish Stock Exchange, announced in October 2018 that it would transfer the settlement of trades in Irish equities and other exchange traded instruments from CREST to Euroclear Bank Belgium. The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, and the Central Bank use the Euroclear Bank ICSD in Belgium for their monetary operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> This legislation for the issuers that choose to avail of it will facilitate this migration. Issuers, however, are free to migrate to any CSD that complies with the requirements of the legislation. No CSD provider has come forward to offer this service in Ireland. The Central Bank, with funding from the European Commission, is finalising a CSD authorisation framework for use should a service provider look for authorisation in Ireland. In effect, it was a decision of what was the Irish Stock Exchange to move in this direction. There was a consultative process. </p>
          <p eId="para_622"> There was a question regarding why we do not have our own one. We did, but we had a joint one between Ireland and the UK. That was a single entity going back to 1995. There was interconnectivity, therefore, in respect of what was a much smaller market in Ireland. We used the UK system and we piggybacked on that because, going back to that period, it was not essential for us to have our own. At some point in the future, I would like an Irish CSD, but that is for the market to provide, if it sees fit and if the size and scale of the Irish market requires it.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> I would like to clarify for Senator Burke that there will have to be a physical presence for a quorum.</p>
