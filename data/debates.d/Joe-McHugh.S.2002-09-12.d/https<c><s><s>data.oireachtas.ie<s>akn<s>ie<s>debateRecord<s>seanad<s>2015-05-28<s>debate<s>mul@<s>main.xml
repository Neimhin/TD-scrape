            <p eId="para_14">I welcome the Minister of State. There was confusion within the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government yesterday when I proposed this item. It did not understand whether it came under its remit or that of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. That says it all about this gasification technology, that senior people in Departments are unaware of it. I tried, through the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, which provides a fantastic service, to get a bit of information on this and the Government’s position on it but it could not provide much. My own research has found international examples.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> It is of huge concern, especially to the people of west Limerick but also throughout the county. I do not want to see my county being treated as a dump. People have had to live next door to Gortadroma for the past 20 years and the local authority was well aware of the problems associated with it. If the Minister of State drives around the area she will see shells of houses which people have left. The property is worthless. Those people had to leave the area. Having put up with that over all those years, the communities are now expected to lie down and take this huge gasification unit which will be built on their doorstep.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> The justification for this is that it will be a terrific economic driver in the area which will create a heap of jobs, that the council will get a huge sum in rent - the figure quoted ranges between €3 million and €5 million per year - and that everything is hunky-dory with this. That is not the feeling of the people in the area. It is my duty and that of every public representative to represent the public but that has not happened in this instance. It is one year since the amalgamation of Limerick County and City Councils. The Putting People First document, published by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, is the biggest oxymoron I have ever heard in respect of issues such as this because people have not been put first in this instance, quite the contrary. Many of these decisions were made clandestinely. Councillors from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Sinn Féin and Independent Fianna Fáil in the municipal district talked about this and came to the conclusion that it was a good idea. They went back to their party groups in the council with the disposal notice when it was agreed at municipal district level and a decision was taken at the full council meeting, which was a rubber-stamping job. </p>
            <p eId="para_17"> Council meetings in Limerick have become a circus since the amalgamation. This was put down to teething problems but the situation has not improved at all. Issues such as this, with potentially huge effects on the people of the area, were not discussed. There was no presentation on gasification to all council members when they voted on the disposal notice. They had no clue what they were voting on. Some were duped into voting on this. It is not good enough that the council has conducted itself in this way and manipulated the systems put in place by the Department's Putting People First document so that its decisions and those of county management are put ahead of the people who voted for the councillors. I would like to hear the Minister of State’s response on where the Government stands on gasification because I have not seen where it can fit in or improve or help move Ireland towards the 2020 targets.</p>

          <speech by="#AnnPhelan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Ann Phelan)<recordedTime time="2015-05-28T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_18">My response is to the question that was put: "The need for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to clarify the Government’s position in relation to gasification plants, and how this fits with the Government’s 2020 targets."</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> Ireland currently has an ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction target under the 2009 EU effort-sharing decision for each year between 2013 and 2020. Under the decision, we must limit the growth of greenhouse gas emissions to 20% below 2005 levels in the period 2013 to 2020. In terms of renewable energy, Ireland has been set a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. We aim to meet this target by using renewable resources for 40% of electricity demand, with 10% of transport fuelled from such sources and 12% of heat.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> Attaining the greenhouse gas emission reduction target requires a concerted national effort, and the Government has responded energetically to the challenge. Following on from the adoption of the national policy position on climate action and low-carbon development in 2014, and in anticipation of enactment of the climate Bill, which is currently before the Oireachtas, work has begun on preparing a national low-carbon transition and mitigation plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> A primary objective of the national mitigation plan will be to bring a clear and strong focus to both the challenges and the opportunities of transitioning to a low-carbon future, and the importance of a forward-looking and cost-effective national transition agenda. The plan will also track the implementation of steps already under way and identify additional measures in the longer term, including in the area of emerging technologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> With respect to renewable energy, our national energy policies recognise the importance of other renewable sources such as biodegradable waste. In this regard, both the alternative energy requirement, AER, and the renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT, schemes support electricity generated from anaerobic digestion, landfill gas and the biodegradable element of municipal solid waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> In terms of further developing waste as an energy resource, the draft national bioenergy plan, published last year, recommends optimising the availability of waste for energy and continued support for innovative energy uses for animal by-products. Furthermore, analysis underpinning the draft bioenergy plan demonstrates that an additional bioenergy-focused measure in the heat sector would represent the most cost-effective means of meeting a number of our policy goals. In this regard, I understand it is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, subject to further Government approval and State aid clearance, to introduce a renewable heat incentive in 2016. Research suggests there is a potentially significant role for biogas and biomethane in the transport sector. However, I understand that more detailed economic analysis of the supply chains, from production through to distribution and use, would be helpful to guide future policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> In terms of the Senator's reference to gasification plants, it is important also to outline the role of waste policy. National waste policy is predicated on the management of waste in line with the waste hierarchy as set out in Article 4 of the waste framework directive of 2008. Gasification and incineration with energy recovery occupy the same tier of the waste hierarchy, called "other recovery", and national waste policy does not favour one particular technology over the other in this instance. Similarly, while the waste management plans that were recently launched by the regional groupings of local authorities support the development of up to 300,000 tonnes of future additional thermal recovery capacity at a national level, the plans do not differentiate between different thermal recovery technologies.</p>

            <from>Senator James Heffernan<recordedTime time="2015-05-28T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_25">I thank the Minister of State for her reply. The last part of her reply says it all when gasification and incineration are put in one bracket. That is what people fear, certainly in Ballyhahill, Foynes, Shanagolden and such areas, as they see them as all the one. I cannot see how this will improve the 2020 targets in the slightest. The Minister of State mentioned other renewable sources of energy. What is proposed to be burned in this plant is thousands of tonnes of tyres and plastics, which will emit all sorts of poisons and toxins into the air. That is something we do not want. Much truck has been given to the EPA, with people saying it will provide protection when it comes to emissions.</p>

            <p eId="para_27">Judging from what I have heard from the EPA, I am not confident that it can fulfil that role, given that it has immunity from prosecution, which is an issue that the Department needs to look at. That has been raised here by me and others on a number of occasions and is the big elephant in the room. I do not see how the response from the Government can inspire confidence in this plant.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">Climate change, waste, how we deal with waste, energy sources, energy resources and renewables are not specifically the remit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. If the Senator were to engage also with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, it might help him to see the other side of the equation. I can sense the Senator's frustration. It may help to inform him that if he was to engage with the officials in that Department, they may be able to provide some specific information on biomass targets and how they see the position. He could then put the two pieces of information together to arrive at a more informed opinion. As it is not only the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that deals with this issue, the Senator may need to get some more information from the other Departments to help him. I am not sure if the Senator finds that helpful, but I think it would be helpful.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">Cuirim céad fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Tá brón orm gur tharraing mé isteach sa Seanad inniu é, ach bhraith mé nach raibh an dara rogha agam mar gur chur mé ceist chuig a oifig trí seachtaine ó shin maidir leis seo. Leis an gceart a thabhairt dó, dúirt sé go gcuirfeadh sé ar aghaidh é chuig an Roinn le freagra a fháil ach ní bhfuair muid freagra le trí seachtaine, in ainneoin gur chuir mé dhá mheabhrúchán chomh fada le hoifig an Aire Stáit. Baineann an cheist le scéim na gcampaí samhraidh, scéim a bhfuil an-rath agus an-tóir uirthi agus atá ag déanamh an-leasa go deo sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Is scéim í seo ina bhfuil páistí na Gaeltachta ag neartú na Gaeilge i rith an tsamhraidh, ag spraoi agus ag baint an-sult as. Tá go leor eagraíochtaí deonacha ag riar campaí samhraidh ar fud na Gaeltachta. Is iontach go deo an scéim í agus ba mhaith linn í a fheiceáil ag láidriú agus ag neartú, ach tamaill ó shin, rinne Roinn an Aire socrú nach í an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta feasta a bheadh ag riar scéim na gcampaí samhraidh, ach go bhfuil an scéim sin anois le tabhairt ar lámh do Mhuintearas le reachtáil.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> Níl aon rud agam i gcoinne Muintearas <i>per se</i>, ach tháinig roinnt mhaith daoine chugam ina dhiaidh sin ag cur roinnt ceisteanna síos. Chuir mé na ceisteanna seo chuig an Aire Stáit. Baineann siad leis an mbuncheist seo: cén fáth ar ghlac an Roinn an cinneadh seo agus cén fáth nach bhfuil sí féin ag leanúint le riaradh na scéime seo. An ndearna sí athbhreithniú ar an scéim? Má rinne, an bhfuil tuairisc ar thorrthaí an athbhreithnithe sin le fáil? Ba mhaith le daoine fáil amach cén chaoi a roghnaíodh Muintearas leis an scéim a riar. An raibh fógra poiblí ann? An raibh próiseas tairisceana ann? An ndearnadh gearrliostú ar iarrthóirí agus an raibh próiseas caighdeánach roghnúcháin i gceist? Cé a rinne an cinneadh? An ndearnadh an tAire Stáit an cinne nó arbh iad feidhmeannaigh na Roinne a rinne an cinneadh ar a shon? An bhfuil an tAire Stáit sásta leis an gcinneadh?</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> An bhfuil aon imní air maidir le coinbhleacht leasa a bheith ann de bharr go mbíonn Muintearas féin ag plé le campaí samhraidh? Seo ceist a chur roinnt daoine orm. Is grúpa é seo a bhí ag baint tairbhe as an scéim seo é féin le campaí a reachtáil, campaí a bhfuil an-rath orthu, de réir mar a thuigim. Bhraith daoine go raibh sé aisteach go raibh ceann de na grúpaí a bhí ag fáil an airgid roimhe seo ag riar na scéime anois agus go bhféadfadh coinbhleacht leasa a bheith ann. An bhfuil an tAire Stáit sásta nach bhfuil coinbhleacht leasa i gceist?</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> Cén buntáiste a bheas le fáil ag pobal na Gaeltachta as an gcinneadh a bheith glactha? An bhfuil sé chun a bheith feabhsaithe? Cén buiséad a bheas le riaradh ag Muintearas don scéim seo gach bliain? Cén próiseas riaracháin a bheas ann maidir le meastóireacht ar iarratais? An mbeidh próiseas neamhspleách athchomhairc ar fáil agus má tá, céard é? Tá daoine ag fiafraí díom an mbeidh siad in ann athchomharc a dhéanamh muna bhfuil siad sásta leis an gcinneadh a bheas glactha ag Muintearas faoin iarratas agus má dhéanann siad sin, cé aige a dhéanfaidh siad é.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> Cé mhéad den bhuiséad a bheas caite ar riarachán na scéime agus cé mhéad a bheas le dáileadh ar lucht eagraithe na gcampaí? An mbeidh cuid den airgead atá ann do na campaí samhraidh seo á chaitheamh ar riarachán i Muintearas, nó an mbeidh an t-airgead ar fad ag dul i dtreo na gcampaí? Cén comparáid atá idir sin agus nuair a bhí an Roinn i mbun riaracháin? Má bhí méid áirithe airgid ar fáil ón Roinn le haghaidh na gcampaí go díreach, an mbeidh an méid céanna le fáil go díreach ag na campaí a bheas á riar faoin scéim? Cén plé a rinneadh le lucht eagraithe na gcampaí maidir leis na riachtanais atá acu sular ghlac an Roinn an cinneadh? An bhfuil aon dul siar ar an gcinneadh ag an bpointe seo? Sin iad na ceisteanna a ardaíodh liomsa. Bhí daoine ann nach raibh ag iarraidh na gceisteanna seo a ardú go poiblí, mar bhraith siad go mb'fhéidir go gcuirfeadh sé isteach ar aon iarratas a dhéanfadh siad, agus sin nádúr na scéime. Mar a deir mé, tá an-mheas agam ar an scéim seo. Tá an-tóir ag páistí na Gaeltachta uirthi. Baineann siad an-tairbhe aisti, ach caithfidh mé a rá gur tháinig an cinneadh seo aniar aduaidh ar dhaoine, nár thuig siad cén réasúnaíocht a bhí taobh thiar de agus go bhfuil siad ag ardú na gceisteanna seo ar mhaithe leis na campaí a neartú agus a láidriú amach anseo. Bheinn an-bhuíoch den Aire Stáit as ucht soiléiriú a thabhairt dúinn ar maidin.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)<recordedTime time="2015-05-28T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_36">Tá an ceart ag an Seanadóir. Fuair mé cúpla ceist ón Seanadóir trí seachtaine ó shin agus fuair mé freagra cuimsitheach cúpla lá ó shin. D'ardaigh an Seanadóir 11 ceist agus chomh maith leis sin tá freagra cuimsitheach anseo agam. Níl sé le síniú ach tá sé anseo.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> Tá mé buíoch den Seanadóir as an ábhar seo a ardú inniu. Bunaíodh scéim na gcampaí samhraidh i 1999 chun cabhrú le caomhnú, leathnú agus buanú na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus go háirithe chun í a threisiú mar theanga labhartha i measc aos óg na Gaeltachta. Rinneadh é seo trí réimse imeachtaí oideachasúla a eagrú, mar shampla ríomhaireacht, ceardaíocht, drámaíocht, ceol agus spórt. Is imeachtaí trí Ghaeilge atá i gceist le scéim na gcampaí samhraidh seachas foghlaim na Gaeilge <i>per se</i>. Is tríd na himeachtaí seo a spreagtar féinmheas i measc an aosa óig agus meas ar a n-oidhreacht agus ar a gcultúr. Ina theannta sin, tuigeann pobal na Gaeltachta i gcoitinne an tionchar dearfach is féidir a imirt ar úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht trí na gníomhaíochtaí atá i gceist leis an scéim.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> Tá comhphlé ar bun le tamall anois idir mo Roinn agus Údarás na Gaeltachta maidir leis na bealaí go bhféadfaí cur le héifeacht na scéimeanna agus na ngníomhaíochtaí a thagann faoi scáth an dá eagraíocht agus an luach is fearr ar airgead a fháil don Stát. Tá sé seo á dhéanamh i gcomhthéacs chur i bhfeidhm córasach na Straitéise 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge. Tá sé á dhéanamh fosta i gcomhthéacs na bhfreagrachtaí breise atá sainithe don Údarás faoi Acht na Gaeltachta 2012 mar a bhaineann sé le cur i bhfeidhm an phróisis pleanála teanga sa Ghaeltacht.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> Ag eascairt as an bplé sin, aontaíodh le gairid go n-aistreofaí an fhreagracht do scéim na gcampaí samhraidh sa Ghaeltacht ó mo Roinn chuig Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tháinig an socrú sin i bhfeidhm ar an 15 Aibreán. Tuigim go ndearna an t-údarás cinneadh ina dhiaidh sin an fhreagracht maidir le reáchtáil na scéime a thiomnú chuig Muintearas Teoranta, atá mar fhochuideachta de chuid an údaráis.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> Tá mé sásta go ndéanfaidh Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Muintearas Teoranta an scéim a riar go héifeachtach. Ní bheidh aon laghdú ar an mhaoiniú a bheidh ar fáil dóibh siúd a bheidh ag eagrú campaí samhraidh sa Ghaeltacht agus beidh na rialacha céanna i bhfeidhm faoin scéim agus a bhí anuraidh. Cuirfídh mo Roinn allúntas de €300,000 ar fáil don údarás i mbliana don scéim agus suim nach mó ná sin i 2016 agus i leith gach bliain ina dhiaidh sin go dtí 2020. Beidh Údarás na Gaeltachta freagrach as gach gné den scéim a reáchtáil agus a riar go ceann cúig bliana. Déanfar athbhreithniú ar an socrú seo in 2020.</p>

Is dócha gurb í an bhuncheist anseo ná go bhfuil difríocht idir Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Muintearas, cé gur fochuideachta é Muintearas de chuid Údarás na Gaeltachta. Bhí Muintearas féin ag baint leasa as ciste na gcampaí samhraidh agus braitheann daoine áirithe atá ag plé le campaí samhraidh go mb'fhéidir go bhfuil coinbhleacht leasa i gceist ansin. Ní dóigh liom go mbeadh deacracht acu dá mbeadh an scéim á riar ag Údarás na Gaeltachta é féin ach braitheann siad go bhféadfadh - agus níl mise ag cur i leith Muintearas go mbeadh - coinbhleacht leasa a bheith ann. An aontaíonn an tAire Stáit leis sin nó an bhfuil sé 100% sásta nach bhfuil coinbhleacht leasa i gceist sa chás seo?</p>

            <p eId="para_42">Mar is eol don Seanadóir, rinneadh an cinneadh ar an 15 Aibreán i mbliana. Tá an t-údarás freagrach as an scéim. Bhí aistriú ar siúl ar an lá sin. É sin ráite, rinne an t-údarás cinneadh an fhreagracht maidir le reachtáil na scéime a thiomnú chuig Muintearas Teoranta, atá mar fhochuideachta de chuid an údaráis. Is comhlacht neamhspleách é Muintearas ach tá ceangal mór foirmiúil idir an t-údarás agus Muintearas. Mar atá a fhios ag an Seanadóir, tá go leor oibre déanta ag Muintearas ar an talamh ar son na teanga Gaeilge maidir le Óige na Gaeltachta, maidir leis na cúntóirí teanga agus an nasc leis na heagraíochta deonacha ar an talamh. Maidir le cur i bhfeidhm an phlean Gaeltachta 2012, tá ról mór agus tábhacht mór aige agus tá go leor oibre ar siúl ar son Acht na Gaeltachta 2012. Tá Muintearas ag obair ar an talamh. Tá taithí mór aige agus tá ceangal ann idir na bunscoileanna agus Muintearas. Caithfear a rá go bhfuil dúshlán mór ann sna ceantair Ghaeltachta maidir le hAcht na Gaeltachta a chur i bhfeidhm. Beidh athrú ar siúl i ngach áit agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil na campaí samhraidh i lár an turais leis an obair atá ar siúl acu ag spreagadh na Gaeilge trí dhráma, trí spórt agus trí chultúr. Tá ról mór acu. Táim sásta leis an aistriú. Táim sásta go mbeidh an t-údarás freagrach as an scéim go 2020. Táim sásta leis an bplean atá ann idir Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Muintearas Teoranta, fochuideachta an údaráis, agus tá ceangal foirmiúil ann. Táim sásta leis an scéim. Níl an scéim á chur i bhfeidhm. Tá súil agam go mbeidh obair dhearfach agus thábhachtach ar siúl an samhradh seo chugainn.</p>

            <p eId="para_44">The Cathaoirleach will be delighted to know that my contribution will be short and sweet. Former employees of the Department of Social Protection contacted me on this matter. I want to find out why former employees, who were temporary clerical officers working in the Department of Social Protection and possibly in other Departments, have been waiting more than 12 months for payment of arrears of pay. Under the Haddington Road agreement, circular DPE/071-1213, their rate of pay should have been increased from 1 November 2013. The client I am dealing with left the Department of Social Protection in May 2014 without having received that increase. To date, she has not received her arrears. This week she received a cheque for €327 but she is owed approximately €1,110. The cheque amount seems to equate to approximately eight weeks pay instead of 28 weeks. I fail to understand the delay because the CPSU has secured arrears of pay for all serving temporary clerical officers with the exception of former employees. It is a shame I have to raise this matter in the House in order to have these arrears sorted out. The situation should have been settled long ago. It is 12 months later and these people are still waiting for their arrears. I await the Minister of State's reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">I thank the Senator for raising this matter. As she pointed out, current temporary clerical officers have received their arrears of pay. The Department only received lists from PeoplePoint - our HR shared service-provider - of all TCOs affected by the change in October 2014. The total number is 644. A total of 132 temporary clerical officers who were still employed by the Department received their full arrears in December 2014. The Department commenced the payment of arrears to the remaining 512 temporary clerical officers during April 2015. The computation of the arrears are being processed and then paid. A total of 61 payments have issued to date. The remaining 451 are being processed and will be paid as quickly as our payroll resources allow. I ask the Senator to contact me if any particular difficulties arise for individuals.</p>

            <p eId="para_46">I thank the Minister of State and I will bring a particular case to his attention. These people do not wish to jeopardise their chances of being re-employed and they are nervous about coming forward as a result. They have been waiting for 12 months and it is not a large number of people. Four hundred and fifty-one people have been waiting a year and a half. I am astonished that it would take so long to process arrears due to them. They are now being paid in dribs and drabs. Why give a partial payment rather than the whole payment? It does not make sense. Perhaps more payroll staff are required.</p>

I expect those payments will be made quite quickly as payroll resources allow.</p>

            <p eId="para_49">I know the Minister of State has a very busy schedule and I thank him for taking the time to deal with this important matter. Cork has had major flooding on a number of occasions. The most recent flooding was extremely severe. The Office of Public Works drew up plans following detailed consultation in July 2014. It is important that we are given an outline of the intended work and its timeframe. It is unfortunate that this work was not undertaken many years ago because Cork has been subjected to severe flooding on a number of occasions in the past 20 years. Therefore, this matter deserves immediate priority.</p>

            <p eId="para_50">I thank Senator Burke for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity to provide some updated information to the House on our plans for Cork city. I thank Senator Burke for pursuing this matter with me on several other occasions in the past year.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> Work on developing a flood relief scheme for Cork city has been underway for some time. The scheme covers the area from Inniscarra dam to downstream of the city on the River Lee and it will also include proposals for Blackpool and Ballyvolane which are affected by tributaries of the River Lee.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> The scheme is being progressed under the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Acts. A number of public information days on the scheme have already been held. Under the statutory provisions, a four to six week consultation period will take place through a formal public exhibition which is planned to commence in the third quarter of this year. On a number of days members of the design team will be in attendance to deal directly with members of the public. These events will be widely advertised in the Cork media.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> At that stage, the outline design of the proposed scheme will have been completed and will be displayed with full drawings to ascertain the views of the public and other stakeholders. Significant consultation is expected to take place with interested parties at this stage. All submissions made during the exhibition period will be fully considered in the following months and any amendments arising from such submissions will be incorporated, as appropriate, in the detailed design stage of the scheme. It is very important for us to consult with the local business community and the residents so that we implement the correct scheme which will be acceptable to the business-owners and to the residents of Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> Subject to the proposed scheme being accepted by the people of Cork and the statutory bodies which will be consulted during the exhibition stage, the detailed design of the scheme will be commenced. During this stage, the procurement of a civil works contractor will also be commenced. Once the detailed design is complete, the scheme will be submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for confirmation as required by the Arterial Drainage Acts. This approval process requires an independent review of the environmental impact statement before the Minister can approve the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> If and when the scheme is confirmed it would be the intention of the OPW to appoint a civil works contractor and to commence construction in mid-2016. Due to the likely scale of the proposed scheme, it is possible that the scheme will be undertaken on a phased basis under a number of contracts. This will be a very significant scheme with commensurate costs and it is anticipated that the works will take at least four to five years to complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> The scheme is a complex one as it involves the use of a flood warning system and the optimisation of dam discharges so it is hugely important that all the necessary technical analysis is carried out thoroughly before the outline design of the scheme is finished. This work is very detailed and the necessary time must be given to allow it to be completed properly.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> The estimated cost of the scheme is currently being assessed in the context of the preparation of a cost-benefit analysis to be completed prior to public exhibition. The Government is, however, committed to providing the necessary funding to carry out the works. I reiterate that funding commitment today.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> The Government remains fully committed to the provision of a flood relief scheme for the people of Cork city and the OPW has made provision for the cost of implementing the scheme in its multi-annual budget profiles.</p>

            <p eId="para_59">I thank the Minister of State. I note he referred to the third quarter of 2015. I ask that work would commence in the very early part of the third quarter because this matter should be progressed as early as possible. The ESB has implemented flood control measures in Inniscarra and Carrigadrohid dams and this is welcome. The local authority has a warning system in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_60">We have a lot of work to do, as the Minister of State outlined. It will take four to five years. Therefore, it is highly important that the work commence at the earliest possible date. It would be helpful to have a consultation in the early part of the third quarter in terms of moving on and making sure that we set clear targets in order that the work will start in mid-2016.

We had a very good engagement and I was left in absolutely no doubt of the importance of the scheme to the people of Cork, the business owners of Cork and the local economy. We are very eager that the scheme be in place. The funding is in place, which is the crucial message I wish to get out today. The Government is fully committed to funding the scheme, and the OPW has included it in its multi-annual budgets.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> I have already outlined that the scheme is likely to be phased. It is likely that the Blackpool part of the scheme will be implemented as a separate scheme, even though we may exhibit it with the Cork city scheme. No decision has been taken on the phased nature of the main city scheme, but it is unlikely to be undertaken in one contract. It will probably be broken into a number of contracts. Ballyvolane will probably be advanced by the local authority with funding from my office under the minor works scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> I know this scheme is absolutely vital. I am very eager to ensure that it will get under way as quickly as possible. I want to see the works commence in mid-2016, but I also want to make sure we get the best scheme possible, that we get all the technical analysis right and that there is adequate consultation with the business owners, who, rightly, have very strong views and have done a lot of work on the issue, and with the public. I look forward to the public exhibition getting under way as quickly as possible within the third quarter.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">I circulated two motions earlier this morning. The first was to the effect that Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to reject the offer from IAG to purchase the 25.1% stake in Aer Lingus, thereby protecting Ireland's strategic interests into the future. The second motion was that Seanad Éireann recommends that should the Government proceed with the sale of the 25.1% stake in Aer Lingus, the moneys received should be used to reduce the savage cuts imposed on Aer Lingus pension scheme members. Both of those motions were submitted this morning.</p>

          <p eId="para_67">They were submitted this morning. They are not on the Order Paper because, in fairness, while it is not the fault of the Leader, the manner in which the debate on Aer Lingus has taken place in the Lower House has been nothing but farcical in terms of timing and when the debate will finish. We thought the Minister might come to the House yesterday evening but he did not. He could not. That is fair enough as he was in the Dáil. He is back in the House today at 5 p.m., 18 minutes after the Dáil will vote on the sale of Aer Lingus, to take statements on it. What is the point? The reason I tabled the motions this morning was that, in effect, at least the Seanad would have a voice in this and it would be able to give its opinion on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">I ask the Cathaoirleach to strongly reconsider motion No. 1, which I tabled on my behalf and that of my colleagues in Fianna Fáil. I look for support from everyone else for the motion to be taken today, before the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, comes to the House. </p>
          <p eId="para_69"> A number of issues have arisen. I listened to Deputy Michael McNamara outline in the other House why he would not support the sale. I also note with interest that SIPTU will not support the sale. I am astonished that neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Transport, according to the Taoiseach, has had sight of the Nyras report, which highlights the potential for massive job losses within Aer Lingus. The Taoiseach said yesterday that he had not seen any of the documentation, yet the Cabinet made a decision on it. I discussed this with Senator Bacik yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> There was a very good reason for selling 74.9% of the airline, namely, to invest money in it, new aircraft and making the airline viable. Under EU state aid rules, direct Government investment in the airline was not allowed. The reason 25.1% was kept was to ensure that the State kept a strategic interest in the airline and its direction, and to make sure that the sphere of influence for the airline stayed in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> A false process has been going on for two years or more, since the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, brought in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2013. That was the start of it, because it gave the Minister the power to remove people unilaterally from their pension schemes and reduce pension scheme benefits unilaterally without the permission of members. That was to make sure that Aer Lingus and the IASS knew they could build up the deficit. They doubled the deficit within two years because the Government had laid out the roadmap for the changes it intended to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> The Government then brought in savage cuts in the State Airports Act, for which Fine Gael and the Labour Party voted, and took 60% of pension benefits from long-service members and six weeks' pay from retired people who had given their whole lives to the airline. The Government did that. Lo and behold, two weeks after that, an offer came in from IAG to buy the Government stake. I do not think it is a coincidence; it was all choreographed and had been coming down the track. I said that to the Tánaiste over two years ago and she denied it at the time. The Labour Party denied it at the time and it lied at the time. That is a fact, because this was all choreographed. </p>
          <p eId="para_73"> The reality is that the 5,000 workers in the airport and the 3,500 working in Aer Lingus are concerned about their jobs because the Government has not exercised proper due diligence on this offer and considered the Nyras report which highlights job cuts of 20% in ground handling, 40% in catering, 15% in maintenance and 25% in heavy maintenance, as well as cabin crew and pilots.</p>

          <p eId="para_75">The problem is that all of this will not be discussed in the Seanad until the Government sheep in the other House march behind their Ministers and vote for what they said only two months ago they would not do. At the Labour Party conference, it was said if Aer Lingus was sold, the money would be used to defray the cuts to IASS members. That will not be done. The money will be put into a connectivity fund. Why is that needed if there is no threat to connectivity between Ireland, Britain and the rest of the world? It is absolute nonsense.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">He provided helpful reassurance on the issue of registered employment agreements, compulsory redundancies and outsourcing, three of the key issues which most concern many of us in the proposed sale.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> I welcome the announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government today of a €91 million investment in housing. Senator Hayden will also welcome the announcement, as she has spoken eloquently on the issue on numerous occasions in this House. The fund is hugely welcome. It will make social housing available in greater quantities, which will improve housing for people with disabilities. The investment includes funds for retrofitting homes to improve energy efficiency. It will also ensure that more than 1,000 vacant social housing units will be refurbished for people who are on the social housing waiting list, at a cost of €20 million. Vacant units are known as voids, and this is one of the issues that many of us have raised here repeatedly. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in early course on the issue of investment in housing. In the meantime, I welcome this important announcement. </p>
          <p eId="para_117"> Finally, I ask the Leader for a debate on prison and penal reform in light of the 11 reports by the prison visiting committees which were published yesterday by the Minister for Justice and Equality. Some of the reports were positive, certainly with regard to the refurbishment and greatly improved conditions at Mountjoy Prison. The reports also clearly identified many key challenges that remain, including the imprisonment of young people and the issue of drugs within prisons. I ask the Leader for a debate on prison reform, in light of those reports, before the end of the summer.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">I second the amendment proposed by Senator Darragh O'Brien.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> I would like to ask for a debate on ethics in sport in view of the situation regarding Sepp Blatter. The whole international sports world is a byword for corruption. The International Olympic Committee is a mess. FIFA is a complete and absolute disgrace, with hundreds of millions of dollars washing around being used as bribes. Now Mr. Putin has come out and made the matter an international political thing. If anything would make me look further for the resignation of Sepp Blatter, it would be the support of Mr. Putin.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> Mr. Blatter is the chief executive of FIFA, so he should know what goes on. There was the extraordinary situation in which a football match was awarded to Qatar but was scheduled to take place in the middle of the summer, which was absolute, utter and outrageous madness. The chief executive is responsible when there is systematic corruption, just as is the case in politics. If there is political corruption then a Minister is expected to resign. The corruption may be deemed somebody's fault down the line but the Minister resigns, and it should be the same for Sepp Blatter. The chief executive is either a nincompoop or a crook. If he did not know what was going on then he is a nincompoop and if he did then he is a crook.</p>

          <p eId="para_127">I wish to raise the issue of home care providers, which was featured on the front page of the <i>Irish Examiner</i> this morning. The fact is someone can serve five years in Mountjoy jail and still set up a company to provide home care the day after release. There is no regulation governing the matter. I published a Private Members' Bill on the matter over four months ago. Resistance to a debate on the matter came from the Department of Health and not from the Minister. The issue is now out in the public domain. It is scheduled to be a major issue for discussion at a conference taking place in Dublin today. Therefore, I ask that time be allocated for a debate on my Private Members' Bill in this House. The Bill, which is important, seeks to put in place proper regulation to cover people who provide home care. A huge number of people require a professional standard of home care and, therefore, a proper legislative structure should be put in place. The draft Bill has been published and is in this House. I ask that the matter be put on the agenda for a debate at the earliest possible date.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">I have already given the Cathaoirleach notice of my intention, in accordance with Standing Orders, to seek an adjournment of the House in order to discuss the specific and urgent matter of Aer Lingus. I wish to make an appeal to the Leader. What vision do we have for the Seanad if we are only discussing Aer Lingus after the horse has bolted in the Dáil? What is the Seanad for? Is it merely a debating Chamber? Do we merely rubber-stamp things? Is this a House of Parliament? If this was a serious House of Parliament then a debate on Aer Lingus would have been scheduled to take place before the Dáil vote so that all voices could be heard before the Dáil made its decision. I acknowledge that it is a decision for the Dáil. The idea that we can discuss Aer Lingus afterwards is plainly ludicrous. We do not need the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to be present. It would be useful to have him attend, but we do not need to have him here, particularly if he is busy in the Dáil. We are here to make our voices known and to put them on the record of the Seanad. Perhaps our views can be taken into account by our colleagues in the Dáil. Among our number is Senator Barrett, who I presume is attending the banking inquiry at the moment. He is the foremost transport economist in the country. The idea that the opportunity to hear his views and vision must be postponed until after the Dáil vote is plainly ludicrous. The Seanad is for voices such as his. Senator Barrett was one of the people, in the 1980s, who helped to ensure that the Dublin to London airline market was opened up to competition, a move that has resulted in huge benefits for the country. I would like to hear his voice, if he is not attending the banking inquiry, before the Dáil votes on this matter at 4.42 p.m. I understand that is the time the vote is scheduled to take place. We will make a holy show of Parliament if we allow the debate to happen after the Dáil votes. One is left wondering whether the people should have abolished the Seanad when Fine Gael asked them to. The Leader is running the place into the ground if he allows this to happen, and we will have become completely irrelevant. I appeal to the Leader to have the debate before the Dáil votes so that all voices can be heard. </p>
          <p eId="para_129"> I wish to briefly mention another matter. I tabled a Commencement matter the other day when the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Ann Phelan, was in attendance. <b>
						</b>She gave me certain information, which I forwarded to local media and residents in a particular area, using her exact words. Deputy Helen McEntee then stepped in to say that the Minister of State was wrong and merely gave her own opinion. Can we rely on what Ministers or Ministers of State tell us in this Chamber? Do Fine Gael backbenchers know more than Ministers or Ministers of State? If a Minister of State comes in here and does not state the facts of a situation in response to a very specific question, then she should not be a Minister of State and should resign. We need procedures in place to deal with this matter. It is a matter for the Cathaoirleach as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">I wish to raise an issue with regard to the terms and conditions of the new beef genomics scheme created by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The issue is unique in nature because a huge majority of farmers in County Galway do not wish to participate in it. Under the scheme farmers will be given money, but they do not want it because they fear the terms and conditions of the scheme. I cannot blame them for having such fears. Recently I attended a meeting of the IFA and its members held in Tuam, County Galway, where as many as 700 farmers were present. On foot of the meeting I reviewed the terms and conditions of the scheme, and now I have serious reservations about parts of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> The Department needs to go back to the drawing board when it comes to the six-year rule. The clause needs to be eliminated, because I firmly believe that every year should stand on its own merit. If somebody is disqualified from participating in the scheme, then it is patently unfair and inequitable that every payment ever made under the scheme can be clawed back, irrespective of a lack of proof of previous breaches. The clause is wrong and flies in the face of natural and constitutional justice. I have written to the Minister about the matter. Clawbacks of this nature are more punitive, rather than less. It is important that the Minister understand that clawbacks would be unenforceable in a court of law if, on balance, they are deemed to be penalty clauses.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">I raised the matter because the scheme will close quite soon and, therefore, it is important to extend the deadline. It is also important that the Minister come in here to discuss the matter. We have a situation in which farmers will be penalised in the short term but the State will be penalised in the long term if farmers pursue a legal action through the courts. I want a debate arranged to discuss the scheme with the Minister at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

          <p eId="para_140">I was planning to congratulate the Leader on arranging the debate on Aer Lingus because it was not planned yesterday but we were told one was scheduled late last evening. However, having listened to Senators Darragh O'Brien and Thomas Byrne today, it does not make sense to have a debate at 5 p.m. after the Dáil has made its decision, nor does it make sense because, as Senator Thomas Byrne said, Senator Sean D. Barrett will not be in the House before the decision is made. We are very fortunate Senator Sean D. Barrett, the foremost transport economist in the country, is a Member of the House, but he is tied up at the banking inquiry today. I urge the Leader to find time to accept Senator Darragh O’Brien’s amendment. We should have that debate immediately after the Order of Business, which will give us time to do all the other jobs we have to do. </p>
          <p eId="para_141"> The news today that Ireland has slipped back to sixteenth place in the competition league is bad. The Taoiseach wants Ireland to be the best small country in the world in which to do business and yet we have slipped to sixteenth place in the world.

          <p eId="para_142">I support Senator Higgins’ call for a debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the beef genomics scheme. The one bit of good news is that he has announced an extension of the deadline for applications, giving farmers an additional week to apply. Approximately 15,000 applications have been received to date. I hope that number will increase significantly in the coming week. There are a few issues of concern to the farmers and it is important to have a meeting with the Minister to tease some of those out so that the level of applications will increase significantly.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> I very much welcome that €91 million is being made available for social housing initiatives, as announced today. Of this €5 million will be spent in County Galway, €689,000 will be spent on bringing 42 units back into use. In total over 1,000 units will be refurbished nationwide. In Galway city and county €2.7 million will be allocated for investment in housing adaptation grants for older people with disabilities, which is very welcome. In addition, €1.2 million will be spent on retrofitting social housing in Galway to make it more energy efficient. I hope this is a significant start in making much more social housing available so that the long waiting lists in our county can be reduced significantly over the next couple of years. </p>

          <p eId="para_145"> What is happening around the Aer Lingus debacle is really disgraceful, rushing through such an important and strategic decision without the full information being given to these Houses, without proper debate and without allowing the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications to go through it in great detail. It reminds me of previous debacles such as Irish Water and the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, when the Government said “Don’t worry lads, this will be all right, just take our word for it”. We can see what happened as a result. I support the call for the amendment to the Order of Business. The fact that workers’ rights are being left as the final thing to be tied up or discussed in such situations is indicative of the way this Government approaches workers’ rights. There are other situations, such as the Dunnes Stores scenario and the zero hour contracts, which are ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> This type of attitude is filtering into local communities. I am aware of a nursing home in Tuam in County Galway that refuses to recognise the rights of workers there to union recognition. The workers in that nursing home work very hard and have been looking for that right through the State’s mechanisms but the employers are turning it down point blank. It is about time the Labour Party stood up, said enough is enough and that it will not stand for this trampling on workers’ rights any more. The problems around the pensions in Aer Lingus show that Fine Gael has made the Labour Party capitulate on these issues. This is Labour Party’s chance to stand up and be counted and try to salvage something from a Government which has a pitiful record on workers’ rights.</p>

          <p eId="para_147">I agree with the statements of Senators on the other side of the fence that it is a futile exercise to have a debate on Aer Lingus this afternoon after the decision has been made. It should happen sooner, if at all possible. I encourage the Leader to fit in an hour and cancel what is already on the programme to discuss it. Whether we can make a difference is another matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> From 1 July new household food waste regulations will come into existence. These require that food waste be segregated from other waste and no longer placed in the black bin. Once segregated, food waste must either be subjected to a home composting process, which would save householders' money, or brought to an authorised treatment facility run by county councils. It is a significant change and I am calling for a debate on this. Many landfill sites throughout the country have, thankfully, been closed down. Where landfill sites still exist less is being deposited in them. I am concerned about what will happen to sites that have been closed for years. Are there proposals to use some of them for "gasification", a word used here yesterday by my colleague from Limerick? An urgent debate is required as soon as possible to alleviate people’s fears because this is a big change for householders and businesses.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">I refer to the lack of progress on the charities regulator with the Minister for Justice and Equality. Jim Cusack, a journalist at the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, wrote recently about a children’s charity because four of the seven directors have resigned, citing irregular governance and expenses. A raft of questions need to be answered. The charities regulator has not commented on the case, and that is as it should be as an investigation is ongoing. We had much debate on this issue and celebrated 18 months ago the fact that the Charities Regulatory Authority was put in place but it is in a no-win situation, with high expectations from us and the public as a champion of transparency and integrity. The Minister for Justice and Equality is not putting the necessary funding or manpower into this. On 17 April, she provided charities with another year to register. Now, a very prominent children’s charity seems to be in trouble and four very prominent people have resigned from it. I need the Minister to interject, give us her thoughts and give the regulator some teeth in order that we can all have faith. The Government gives between €4.5 billion and €5 billion to the charity sector. We need it regulated.</p>

I know the Leader is a decent man and I ask him to change the Order of Business.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> I wish to raise today Article 44.2.2° of the Constitution, which guarantees that the State will not endow any specific religion. It has come as something of a shock to me to find out that, quite to the contrary, the State is endowing a religion through the chaplaincies that are appointed in institutes of technology all over this country. There are a number of serious issues involved. Salaries of €30,000 to €50,000 a year are being paid to chaplains but there is no selection process or application process and there are no criteria under which these chaplains are appointed, yet Trinity College Dublin pays its chaplains out of its own coffers. There is something seriously wrong in a country that, on the one hand, says it will not endow a religion and, on the other, appoints a specific set of religious preachers to third level education institutes, when the people who attend those institutes are all adults capable of making up their own minds as to what religion they want to follow. I ask the Leader to organise a debate which would include the issue of chaplaincy in schools and hospitals throughout the country and who pays for them.</p>

          <p eId="para_155">I strongly support what my colleagues have said in regard to the Aer Lingus debacle. Without going into the specifics, this House is being disrespected today by the Government in not allowing for a debate prior to a decision being taken in the other House. We are dealing with a matter which is being driven by vested interests at the expense of the public interest. We are not being given the opportunity here, as public representatives, to debate an issue of national significance and importance ahead of a decision being taken. I know it may not be at the discretion of the Leader and he may be forced into a situation by the Government. However, I would ask him to stand strong and represent the Seanad, not accept the push which is coming from the Government on this issue and to have a debate in the House before a decision is made in the other House.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> I agree with other Senators that we should have a debate in regard to agriculture, particularly the beef genomics scheme, the closing date for which is today. It is not workable at all. We need a debate on that issue and on the other environmental schemes from Pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy. These schemes are not working. Money is coming from Europe but farmers are unable to draw it down and unable to apply, given the complexities of the schemes. It needs a deeper debate than is possible in a Commencement debate because there are issues that need to be teased out with the Minister in the House. I ask that this be organised in the next few weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> I call on the Leader to have the Minister for Finance come before the House for a debate on the most recent European Commission recommendations and opinion on the national reform programme in Ireland. There are some damning statistics, information and opinion in the report, which outlines that while there is some level of economic improvement in the country, there are other issues like private and public debt which are not being addressed by public policy interventions. The report outlines the crisis in the health sector and also looks at the banks' self-reliant techniques in order to deal with people who find themselves in debt which they are unable to pay. I ask that the Minister for Finance come to the House for a debate on the report. In all of its public policy interventions, the Government is failing to deal with the outlook being expressed not only by the European Commission, but also by the IMF and others.</p>

          <from>Senator James Heffernan<recordedTime time="2015-05-28T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_158">To follow on from what my two Fianna Fáil colleagues have said about Aer Lingus, a debate today is essential. As other colleagues have said, Senator Sean D. Barrett will be busy at the banking inquiry this afternoon and will not be here. In fairness, the Senator is one of the few independent voices on this issue. He is a man who makes quite a lot of sense and is someone who should be listened to.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> We are told this is a great deal by those members of the Dublin Airport Authority and the people in paid Government positions in Shannon and Cork. I do not take great heed of what they say. This is a further demonstration of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's lack of commitment to the regions, in particular the mid-west. Limerick yesterday launched its campaign for the 2020 capital of culture, one I hope the Government will put its weight behind. However, by 2020 there may not be connectivity to bring people to the area. The Leader knows the road from Waterford to Limerick is diabolical, the road from the Cork to Limerick is a disgrace and the road from Limerick to Killarney and other areas is terrible. This move could be a serious blow to Shannon's connectivity in the mid-west.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> It is not good enough. Even if this deal, unfortunately, seems to be a <i>fait accompli</i>, and perhaps there is not a whole pile that can be done about it, I believe that debate should take place earlier rather than later. I hung around yesterday because I thought the debate was going to take place at 9 p.m. last night but it did not happen, and I had thought it might have happened a couple of days ago but it did not. It has now been pushed aside again. I would like the Leader to accede to the amendment to the Order of Business and support calls for that debate to take place today.</p>

It was not possible to have it last night because the debate in the other House lasted until 10 p.m. The Minister will be in the other House until 5 p.m. today debating the issue. As far as I know, he does not yet have powers of bilocation; therefore, there is no prospect of having him here. However, having listened to what Members had to say, I am prepared to amend the Order of Business to have the debate immediately but without a Minister present.</p>

          <p eId="para_177"> Senator Ivana Bacik and others referred to the €91 million investment in housing announced today by the Minister for the Environment, Community Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, which is certainly to be welcomed. A further debate on housing is overdue and I will try to arrange it.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> Senator Ivana Bacik also called for a debate on recently published reports on prison and penal reform. I will ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to attend the House to debate them.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> Senator David Norris raised the question of ethics in sport. The Minister of State with responsibility for sport has been in the House on several occasions recently. There are certainly concerns about FIFA, football's governing body. I note the Senator’s points about the chief executive officer of that body and suggestions of corruption and so forth. That is a matter for FIFA to deal with. I do not think anything we say in this House will make any difference, but we can certainly consider and have a debate on the question of ethics in sport.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> Senator Colm Burke called for proper regulations for home care providers. As he rightly pointed out, he has a Bill dealing with the issue on the Order Paper. We will certainly consider debating it on the next occasion Fine Gael raises an issue during Private Members’ business.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> Senators Lorraine Higgins and Brian Ó Domhnaill called for an extension of and a debate on the beef genomics scheme with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I am sure the Minister would be quite willing to come to the House to deal with the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> Senator Feargal Quinn pointed to how Ireland had dropped several places to 16th in the world competitiveness standings. We had an excellent debate last night about the Springboard scheme. The issue of competitiveness is important in the development of the economy. I note the Senator's points in that regard. The Government is mindful of the issue also.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh referred to workers’ rights, an issue on which the Government has been strong. I was very disappointed by the number of contributors to the debate yesterday on the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Bill 2015. Many Members have called for a debate on this issue in the past few weeks and months. However, when the legislation was before the House yesterday, a paltry number of Members spoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> Senator Terry Brennan raised the question of food waste segregation. The House will deal with an environmental planning Bill later in the session and I am quite sure a number of speakers will want to come in on it. The Senator can raise the question again at that stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> Senator Mary Ann O’Brien referred to the charities regulator. I assure her the regulator has teeth and powers which can be used. Owing to requests from quite a number of charities, the Minister has granted them an extension of time to register with the regulator. Where irregularities have occurred, the regulator can investigate them. I was not aware of the specific case raised by the Senator She can bring it to the attention of the Minister who I am sure will ask the regulator to act on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> Senator Gerard P. Craughwell raised the issue of payments to chaplains in third level institutions and institutes of technology. Chaplains play an important role in these educational facilities. The Senator said Trinity College Dublin paid its own chaplains. By whom are the others paid?</p>

          <p eId="para_200">The motion for the sale of the 25.1% share in Aer Lingus is being debated in the other House. It is a financial matter and a financial decision. As Members will be aware, this House does not have a say in financial matters. However, I have agreed that the House would debate the issue, as requested on the Order of Business.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> This is a good deal for the taxpayer and a good deal for Aer Lingus and there is no question that this is a good deal for the country. It has been agreed that up to 635 jobs will be created by 2020, with 150 new jobs next year. There are plans for four new transatlantic services. As has been stated, the guarantees hold as they are written into the articles of association. A seven-year guarantee has been given regarding the use of the Heathrow slots as part of the deal and will begin once the transaction is completed. The use of the slots will be defined by the summer and winter schedules. The current frequency of use will be maintained across a seven-year period. This is a significant guarantee. As I mentioned on the Order of Business yesterday, the Government has been in contact with the European Commission regarding the legal mechanisms and the Government has indications that the Commission will not oppose the guarantees.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> The fact that all the airports involved in the operation of these slots have welcomed this deal is an indication of the confidence which the airports have in the operation of the guarantee which currently does not exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> The question of outsourcing and redundancies is a matter for the unions and management. However, I draw the attention of the House to a letter received by Mr. Kavanagh which stated that they will look at the scope of the registered employment agreements and will look to extend the number of employees covered by the REAs.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> The Nyras report was mentioned on the Order of Business. This report was commissioned by the chief executive officer of Aer Lingus and it has nothing to do with IAG, no matter what way Fianna Fáil or other parties might paint the picture that the Nyras report is connected to the sale. There is no question of this being part of the sale because this report was commissioned by the CEO of Aer Lingus and this type of exercise is part of the normal course of business in the highly competitive and international airline sector and it would have been commissioned before any talks on a sale. Any airline would commission such a report on a regular basis and Aer Lingus is no different in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> It beggars belief that the party which privatised Aer Lingus and bankrupted the State is now trying to play politics with such a great company as Aer Lingus. Over the course of the past few days Fianna Fáil members have, on one hand, praised Aer Lingus management for turning the company around and making it a success while, on the other, claiming that they are determined to sell out the interest and that of workers and customers. They cannot have it both ways but that is the way they operate on the other side of the House; it is a case of on one hand and on the other. They do not know whether they are coming or going with regard to Aer Lingus.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> I look forward to listening to measured comments and contributions from all sides of the House. I will relay the contributions to the Minister before any decision is made in the other House. However, it is ultimately the decision of that House and we will have no say on the sale. I will relay the measured comments of Members of the House to the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">I thank the Leader for amending the Order of Business. However, I wish to put on the record of the House that we are debating without any Minister or Minister of State in attendance.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> The Leader and other Members will be aware that I live and I have grown up beside Dublin Airport. I have spent my whole life there and I know families, friends, members of my own family and work colleagues who work there. Whole families have been employed at Dublin Airport and in Aer Lingus. It is a very important company for this country and from a selfish Dublin and north Dublin perspective. I know the airport and Aer Lingus very well. I have grown up with the airline.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> It is a fact that Dáil Members will be making a decision this evening. My constituency colleague Deputy Alan Farrell admitted that he had not read any of the reports before he spoke in the other House. With the exception of Deputy Michael McNamara, they are making their decision on trust, without doing any research. The State will get about €340 million out of this deal. As I said on the Order of Business, this has been choreographed for the past two to three years. The Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, the Tánaiste, Deputy Joan Burton, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the Taoiseach all know this. That is why they butchered the pension scheme. That is why the Fine Gael and Labour parties enabled legislation for the first time in the history of the State to allow a company's private pension scheme to be changed by legislation to reduce people's pension benefits by up to 60%, to take six weeks money from retired people in their 70s, 80s and 90s, in order that there would not be a deficit in the pension scheme when they flogged off the State's interest. Those are the facts. That is what the people think and what the people know. The Fine Gael Party has done it and the Labour Party has facilitated it.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> It does not surprise me with regard to the Fine Gael Party because the selling of State assets has always been its strategy; it would sell them all if it could and that is why NewERA was set up.</p>

          <p eId="para_212">I will deal with that point. The Senator may not have been here earlier or yesterday. The reality is that the Fine Gael Party would sell. However, from the perspective of the Labour Party, the number of U-turns its members have done in the past four years means their heads must be spinning. The founders of the Labour Party must be spinning in their graves because of what the party is allowing to be done to the strategic interests of this State. I will explain again for those who are a little slow on the uptake that the reason the 25.1% stake was kept was to protect the State's interest in the airline. The 75% that was sold was invested in the airline for new airplanes, new staff, to improve the company and to make the company profitable and viable.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">This company is profitable and has nearly €1 billion in cash reserves. It carried more than 11 million passengers last year. Based on the record of British Airways, in terms of what it does with airlines it takes over, the whole move towards consolidation is bad for consumers and is certainly bad for an island nation. While the Minister can spin it whatever way he wants, the reality is the Government has been sold a pup and is selling the State short.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> I am disgusted with Deputy Joe Costello and others who made a big play at the Labour Party conference of getting a motion passed to stand up for Aer Lingus and its workers. They were going to stand up for the pensioners but they sold the pension scheme members down the river. I would say to those reading the transcript or watching this debate that if Fine Gael is re-elected, this will be the first of many. All it is about is cash. It is not good for Ireland or for jobs. </p>
          <p eId="para_215"> The Minister mentioned the Nyras report and yet the Taoiseach has admitted he did not even read it. It is not just a stand-alone report. Does the Minister think for one moment that Willie Walsh and IAG are not going to look at that report and identify where they can cut staff in Aer Lingus? It is outlined and given to them on a plate. That is what is going to happen. If the Minister thinks any of these allegedly cast-iron guarantees are going to stand up in the commercial operation of a future Aer Lingus, that is complete nonsense. No one has even explained how the B share will work in reality. The Minister for Finance says there is no veto and the Taoiseach says there is. It is an absolute farce and a mess, brought to us by the Government that created Irish Water. Why should I trust this Government in anything it does?</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> I know Aer Lingus and the people who work there who have given their life's work to turn the airline around. I know why the 25.1% stake was kept; it was to make sure Ireland's interests are protected. Fine Gael and the Labour Party are selling our interests cheaply and they will regret it. I have debated with the Minister, Deputy Pasachal Donohoe, on numerous occasions what he has done to the company and the pension scheme. He, his predecessor, now Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Joan Burton, will be remembered for doing this, and not favourably. </p>
          <p eId="para_217"> We have talked about Dublin but what about Shannon and Cork airports? There are no guarantees there. There is practically nothing. They have been left swinging in the wind as they do not matter. It is an awful shame that the Minister is not here to listen to the views of the Seanad. I endeavour to represent the views of those who have been in contact with me, namely, the employees of the company who I know and people in many different roles in the company. Those who have been suffering the brunt of this since 1 January are the 15,000 people in the IAAS scheme. The Government's decision today will have an impact on the company, the airport and all the other companies and people who work in that airport. This is a cheap sale. After its acquiescence in this decision, the Labour Party has proved it has no role in the Government, certainly not in economics. It has rolled over again and it is shameful.</p>

We are a small island nation and connectivity to mainland Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States is one of the most important things we have. The Government's decision to sell its share in Aer Lingus and the takeover by IAG of the Aer Lingus group will secure the future for air transport. It is about jobs. Senator Darragh O'Brien said jobs are under threat but he is totally wrong on that. The plan is that 150 extra people will be employed by 2016 and we hope to have 635 new jobs by 2020. Those are not just new jobs in Aer Lingus but around Dublin Airport, the services, airport police, customs, etc. The Senator said this will be detrimental to the country and that the Government is failing the people. This is the Government that supported the tourism industry. He said the highest number of passengers, 11 million, came through Dublin Airport last year-----</p>

          <p eId="para_225">We have been given commitments on connectivity and the Heathrow slots from IAG. Those slots are the most important part of the Aer Lingus package, as Heathrow is the busiest airport in Europe. They give us connectivity to the rest of the world. The vision is that rather than Heathrow being used as a hub for the north Atlantic, Dublin and Shannon airports will be part of the overall view of IAG's transatlantic travel. The Aer Lingus brand is one of the most recognisable in Ireland and worldwide. Ireland does not have many brands. There is Kerrygold in the food industry, and Aer Lingus is similar type of brand.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> IAG has given a commitment that it will continue to grow our transatlantic routes. By 2016, we will have two new routes and, by 2020, four more. That will bring 2.4 million extra passengers through the Aer Lingus brand, the IAG brand or British Airways brand, whichever it uses. Senator Darragh O'Brien and Fianna Fáil seem to have a crystal ball. The Senator told us this will have a detrimental effect on jobs in Dublin, Shannon, Cork and Knock airports, yet the Fianna Fáil crystal ball could not see the economic crash coming. I do not believe the Senator on this matter. The Fianna Fáil tactic most of the time is to scaremonger. </p>
          <p eId="para_227"> This is the correct decision for the future of the airline industry in this country. The Minister is not here but I ask the Leader to pass on one concern. The Heathrow Airport slots are the most important slots. The only two airlines flying into Heathrow from Dublin are Aer Lingus and British Airways. It is important that we do not allow a monopoly where people could be exploited in terms of prices. We have Ryanair but it does not fly into Heathrow. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission should look into this to ensure people are not exploited.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> I thank the Leader for the debate. This is an important decision for the country which will secure the future of an Irish brand, Aer Lingus, the tourism industry and connectivity with the rest of the world. The investment IAG will make in the Aer Lingus brand will further enhance it and make it a success. Aer Lingus has been successful in the past few years after its restructuring. I hope by 2020 we will have 650 new jobs, 2.4 million extra passengers and four new transatlantic routes and that, if Senator Darragh O'Brien is in either House of the Oireachtas, he will acknowledge that the right decision was made.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">I am grateful we are having this debate. It is not ideal not having a Minister here but it is better than what was going to happen at 5 p.m. I congratulate the Leader in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_237"> We all have a great affection for Aer Lingus. It is one of those brands that has been around for some time. If I am not mistaken, I think Aer Lingus and I were born in the same year and, therefore, I feel particularly proud of it over those years. I feel a particular pride as I arrive in another country and see the Aer Lingus shamrock logo on an aeroplane on the runway. The danger of losing that is something none of us wants. The people of the Netherlands were quite concerned when Air France took over KLM. They felt they did not have ownership of KLM anymore and that it was their own national airline. On that basis, we will all be sorry if this happens. The steps that have been taken have enabled the Aer Lingus brand to stay alive but it will depend, to a large extent, on its ability to run it in a manner which will keep it alive and healthy.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> I have a little concern when governments run businesses. Governments very often run businesses not with the objective of running them as good businesses for their customers and for their success, but for other purposes, such as political purposes or, perhaps, as Senator Pat O'Neill stated, for jobs, and that is wrong. I was chairman of a hospital in the 1980s when we were having difficulty with unemployment. The Government would write to us every month asking how many jobs we had created in the hospital. Even though we did not need them, the aim was to see if we could create jobs, and that is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> Look what happened in the airline industry when Ryanair suddenly turned up. Ryanair is not a government-owned company but it came along and stated it did not need cleaners because it would get its own staff to do the cleaning as aeroplanes landed. As one arrives anywhere on a Ryanair flight, an Aer Lingus flight or on other flights, one does one's own cleaning - in other words, the staff come along with a plastic bag and one puts all the rubbish in it. In recent years, I have travelled a lot to Brussels and Ryanair flights flying into the airport close to Brussels unload and load up in seconds. The turnaround is so efficient. That would not have happened with a government-owned airline but, because Ryanair led the way, others had to follow, and that is what will happen here too. Aer Lingus has certainly become healthy because of competition. I am a great believer in competition which is much more likely to happen if the airline is not solely owned by a government which perhaps has other objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Having weighed up all the pros and cons, I am inclined to say I support the objective of this deal. It seems to be the best deal we can get. I am happy to see that Aer Lingus will continue - I hope with seven years guaranteed. I hope it succeeds as well as it can on that basis and continues for a lot longer than that.</p>

          <p eId="para_241">I am grateful to Senator Feargal Quinn for allowing me participate in this debate. We have consolidated in order that if Senator Sean D. Barrett, our acknowledged expert in this area, comes in, he will be able to speak. I think he is at the banking inquiry, but I telephoned his office to alert it.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> We should have an independent, stand-alone and State-owned airline. When the Fianna Fáil Government denationalised Aer Lingus, I spoke and voted against that. Like Senator Feargal Quinn said, I feel pride flying into London and elsewhere when I see a stack of Aer Lingus aeroplanes in their bright green colours.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> It is peculiar that an English court would make a judgment on competition grounds against Ryanair's holding and then would seem to allow the amalgamation of two airlines without a squeak. I note there are also concerns about competition on the Government side, and I welcome that. This really needs to be looked into. It would be a very great irony if the release of Aer Lingus, or at least 25.1% of it, from national control led to a lack of competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> I stated yesterday, and I believe strongly, that part of the €335 million or so gained from this sale should be set aside to resolve the disgraceful situation where Aer Lingus deferred pensioners have been squeezed out of their rightful entitlements, with a cut, in some cases, of 60%. I ask every Member of the House how he or she would feel if his or her income was cut by 60%. It is an absolute disgrace.</p>

          <p eId="para_246">The Government eventually resolved the Waterford Glass situation and it has an absolute moral obligation in this area as well. Whatever is needed from that money must go to the deferred pensioners. It is inhuman to expect pensioners who have worked for 40 years to experience a cut of 60%. I would very much like to hear the Labour Party on this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> With regard to the pensions, will the Government carry out an investigation into the administration of the IASS fund? It is disgraceful. I was provided with a comparison sheet, between IASS, AVIVA, Davy Assets, Friends First, Kleinwort B., Merrion, New Ireland, Setanta, Standard Life and Zurich Life. They all are well up over what they were in 2007 but the IASS is still down, at 67%. This represents a disastrous investment policy on behalf of the administrators of the fund. There was legislative interference from the Government in this area to deprive people of their pensions. This is what set up Aer Lingus for sale in the first place. It could not have been sold with this pension issue hanging around its neck.</p>

Let us hear from the Government on what it will do about this. There is an imperative and a moral case for the Government to give at least a substantial part of these funds, not into education, hospitals and all the usual stuff, but to the people who were defrauded of their pensions. What will the Government do? Will the Leader refer this question as a matter of urgency, because the Minister is not here? The Leader is a thoroughly decent man who was gratified when the Waterford Glass pensioners were dealt with and I ask him to ensure the same level playing field for Aer Lingus pensioners.</p>

          <from>Senator Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2015-05-28T12:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_250">I thank the Leader for arranging the debate at the request of the House. I was one of the Senators who looked for the debate. Will all of those who shouted so loudly on the Order of Business now turn up to participate in this debate? My own position, as leader of the Labour Party group, is that I opposed the effective privatisation of Aer Lingus and the sale of the controlling share by Fianna Fáil in 2006 - the 74.9%. It is difficult to listen to the hand-wringing by Fianna Fáil now. I would remind colleagues that the 2004 Aer Lingus Act which set up the privatisation was enacted by Fianna Fáil and the PDs in 2004. In July 2006, the Fianna Fáil Government introduced its motion to the Oireachtas to privatise Aer Lingus and the privatisation plan, which was introduced by the then Minister, Mr. Martin Cullen, allowed for a 25.1% shareholding to be retained. I have listened to Fianna Fáil Members speak of this as if it were some sort of virtue but it is instructive to remind colleagues that the report from the Government steering group shows clearly the limited nature of that 25.1% interest. According to the report, the 25.1% minority shareholder enables the State to have a degree of influence, comprising mainly a range of negative or blocking rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">There is no express right or power to direct Aer Lingus in the conduct of business, there is no control over employment levels in Aer Lingus by the State and the State cannot prevent a reallocation, reassignment or cessation of use of Heathrow slots by Aer Lingus in accordance with the current shareholding. I remind colleagues of the very limited nature of that shareholding. </p>
          <p eId="para_252"> While I would have preferred, and I said this before, that we had retained the 25.1% share, the key reason for retaining it - Fianna Fáil Members have addressed this - was to try to secure connectivity, yet, when one considers to what the 25.1% share entitles the State, it does not have a guarantee on connectivity. What we have seen with the significantly improved bid from IAG is a greatly enhanced guarantee of connectivity. It is important to look at the details. Stronger protection will be granted to the State in terms of the ownership of Aer Lingus's current Heathrow slots than the protection that exists today. We know that the Minister for Finance will retain a B share. For the information of Senator Darragh O'Brien, that will be enshrined in the Aer Lingus articles.</p>

          <p eId="para_254">Again, the nature of the share is set out in the steering group report. That share will enable the Minister to block any proposed disposal by Aer Lingus of any of its Heathrow slots indefinitely. Therefore, it is a much strong stronger protection than currently exists. I think this addresses the connectivity issue. I note that my colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, pointed out the protections also for regional airports because connectivity is crucial, in particular, for regional airports. Deputy Ciarán Lynch noted the assurance about retaining existing winter and summer frequencies to Heathrow. There are very specific details for seven years for the Cork and Shannon airports, in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> The connectivity issue is one issue. Many others have mentioned such as the branding issue. Like others, I share the emotional attachment to the Aer Lingus brand and that is quite right. I am glad we have got a legal commitment in terms of maintaining the brand, the company name, the head office location and the place of incorporation for an unlimited period, a protection the State currently does not have. Jobs were a key concern for Labour Party colleagues. Others mentioned the group of eight Labour Party Deputies who put a motion to the party conference. That motion had four issues in it which, if acquired, any taker of a bid would have to address in order to be supported. One of those issues was connectivity, which I spoke about, and another was about guarantees for regional airports. I spoke about that also. Another issue was the independent valuation of the assets of the company and ensuring the bid reflected the true value of Aer Lingus. As we know, the current bid is significantly above the original share value. The fourth issue in that motion concerned the protection of Aer Lingus workers' terms and conditions of employment. With the improved deal, IAG has agreed that a registered employment agreement will be introduced which will protect the terms and conditions of Aer Lingus employees. </p>
          <p eId="para_256"> Members may be aware that we have also received a copy of a letter from Mr. Stephen Kavanagh, CEO of Aer Lingus, to the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash. I was one of the Labour Party members who met Mr. Stephen Kavanagh yesterday morning. In his letter, Mr. Kavanagh emphasises again the commitment to ensuring that the limited number of job losses will be met through voluntary redundancies. He has informed us that a much greater number of applications have been made for voluntary severance than would be required. The plan refers to 50 redundancies through to 2016 but to a net increase of 150 jobs by the end of 2016 and more than 600 jobs by the end of 2020. Other colleagues on this side of the House have referred to that aspect. Mr. Kavanagh's letter also gives significant assurances in terms of engagement with the representatives of the workers in Aer Lingus and also on the registered employment agreements. That is very welcome. In terms of the IASS fund, we have spoken on this issue previously and I agree with colleagues on the plight of the deferred pensioners. That is a separate issue. Clearly, that issue has been ongoing prior to the issue of the sale.</p>

          <p eId="para_258">I agree with colleagues that we should be able to see whether money can be put aside from the sale of Aer Lingus for this fund. I am certainly happy to take that up with the Government as I am sure my colleagues will also. In regard to the connectivity fund of €335 million, the Labour Party has secured agreement that the proceeds of this sale will be ring-fenced into a fund operated by the Strategic Investment Fund for investment in transport and other connectivity projects. Again, there should be a way of ensuring money is available for the IASS pensioners, although that issue has been ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> I ask colleagues to look fairly at the report of the Government's steering group. Despite my own view against further privatisation in principle, I accept the strong commercial and strategic rationale that the report makes clearly and succinctly in terms of moving forward with Aer Lingus. Somebody on the Fianna Fáil side said earlier that privatisation in 2006 was done to ensure capital investment in the company. Why do they think IAG is making this bid? IAG has indicated that two new transatlantic services will be added as early as 2016 and is talking about eight additional aircraft by 2020 and up to 2.4 million more passengers. As a small airline, significantly smaller than Ryanair, if it does not change, can Aer Lingus grow or will it be faced, as so many other domestic State-owned airlines have been, with falling back into the unprofitability witnessed in 2008 and 2009? We all welcome the current positive financial performance of Aer Lingus which is a tribute to all who worked on it. There have been periods of unprofitability in the past. The airline industry is cyclical. There have been severe impacts from different shocks and Aer Lingus is not immune from future shocks.</p>

          <p eId="para_262">I wish to start on the last point made by Senator Ivana Bacik. The world is now a smaller place and more people are travelling by aircraft. Aer Lingus profits in the company were up by €71 million in 2014, some 9% on the previous year. In its own right, Aer Lingus is growing exponentially year on year. Much has been said on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> I am amazed that the Labour Party, a party that is supposed to represent the views and interests of workers, is allowing 15,000 people with pension entitlements to be effectively rail-roaded given that the Government is allowing individuals involved in the take-over bid to receive pension entitlements of almost €0.75 million. There are vested interests at play here. The workers in Aer Lingus and the taxpayer will be the fall guys. In the 1980s, people had to pay up to £400 for a flight to and from London. The arrival of competition, in the form of Ryanair which played a major role, reduced costs. The State had to allow autonomy in terms of Aer Lingus. The 2006 decision to dispose of 75% of the shareholding in Aer Lingus allowed that autonomy to take place and allowed the company to become more effective and efficient, but critically allowed the State to have a 25.1% shareholding in Aer Lingus. </p>
          <p eId="para_264"> Senator Ivana Bacik appeared to water down the significance of that shareholding. Anyone who plays the role of director in any company will know that a 21% or a 25% holding in any company is a significant and strategic underpinning of that company's decision-making power. The State has that role at the moment, a role in financing the company but also in developing the future direction of the company and the decision making process whether through routes, employment, efficiencies or the effectiveness of the company. That shareholding is being sold off to private investors, IAG. Some of its shareholding is owned by Qatar Airlines. Who can say whether it will have an influence over a future decision of British Airways in the years to come? We are not just dealing with a CEO, Mr. Willie Walsh, who appears before a committee of the House and provides assurances. We are dealing with shareholders living in the Middle East, controlling other airlines. We are diluting competition in an area where the State has tried in the past, under Fianna Fáil, to improve competition by allowing the company to become more efficient. British Airways must be laughing all the way to the bank because, effectively, its record is very poor when it comes to transatlantic routes in other regions. For example, when British Airways bought British Midland Airways, it brought about efficiencies by reducing the number of staff and the number of routes. It has almost driven British Midland Airways to the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> British Airways does not operate any transatlantic routes from Scotland, an issue which was a bone of contention during the recent referendum debate. It offers no transatlantic routes from the North of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">Now it is telling us it will provide a commitment in the British Isles, if one wants to call it that, which is how it views it. This is a commitment to provide transatlantic routes out of Dublin. I simply do not buy it, because the record of British Airways does not stand up to scrutiny. In the future, what is to stop British Airways from breaking the seven-year commitment? The State or other interested parties may take it to court, but the very worst it could face would be a fine. No court can direct that it reinstate the routes. There is a lot of smoke and a lot of hot air. Ultimately, in my view, the Government is bowing down to the vested interests, including those who are involved in this decision-making process, riding roughshod over future pensioners in the company and ensuring that the individuals who are making the decisions will gain financially in a personal capacity. It is disgraceful. Ireland is a small country on the edge of the world. There is an economic argument that governments should not become involved in airline companies, and this was the basis of the 2006 decision to take a step back. However, given our geographical location, there is a need for the State to at least have an involvement in keeping prices and costs down for our punters, our consumers and all our constituents who want to travel to the USA or Europe. According to Pádraig Ó Céidigh, by selling the shares in Aer Lingus at a reduced price of at least 25% below what they are worth, we are selling a strategic State asset but we are also diluting competition within the airline industry, which will ultimately result in prices rising and routes being diluted. Eventually, if we want to travel to the States, we will have to travel through London, unless Ryanair, which is a private company, intervenes.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> The decision does not stand up to scrutiny. The report was a joint report and not just an Aer Lingus report. It was a report commissioned in February by Aer Lingus and IAG. It showed that jobs in ground handling would be slashed by 20%, jobs in catering by 40%, maintenance jobs by 15%, and heavy maintenance and eastern European staff by 25%. We talk of 635 additional jobs, but those jobs would have been created anyway due to the growth of air traffic through Dublin Airport and the regional airports. Those jobs were in the pipeline anyway. However, what will happen is that jobs will be cut. The company and the shareholders, including Qatar Airways, will strive to reduce the bottom line, to increase efficiencies within the company, to reduce employment numbers and to increase profits. The State will have no input. Shame on those involved in selling off this asset.</p>

          <from>Senator Kathryn Reilly<recordedTime time="2015-05-28T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_268">Plain and simple, this is the wrong deal for Ireland. Aer Lingus is worth infinitely more to Ireland than the €335 million the Government will get for cashing in on the 25% stake that Fianna Fáil left the State with. We should retain our Aer Lingus shares, recognising that it serves the island. It would be a productive investment by the State, rather than a divestment at a time when investment in the economy is quite low. We need to think about a long-term industrial and enterprise policy and the role of indigenous firms. Enterprise policy is not confined to one company and a cashing in of these shares; we need to think about how our share in this airline serves our enterprise policy as part of a bigger picture. We no longer own Aer Lingus, but the retention of our share is very important. State ownership and the holding of stakes should not simply be to rescue a company; rather, it should be a method for ensuring long-term growth, particularly as this is an open island economy. Aer Lingus is a valuable asset, not just for the quick buck it could return but in terms of delivering long-term sustainable benefits to the island economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> I refer to a think-piece published by TASC earlier this year in which Paul Sweeney argued that instead of selling our shares, Ireland should invest more in Aer Lingus by increasing its shareholding in the company from 25.1% to 50.1%. He argued that the current push to sell Aer Lingus was not motivated by the best interests of Ireland or Aer Lingus, and that Aer Lingus has many strengths, such that consolidation into a major airline group is not necessary to ensure its survival. Aer Lingus is one of the most profitable airlines on the transatlantic route, and this would not have happened if it had been under the control of IAG. Between 2018 and 2020, Aer Lingus will take delivery of €2.5 billion worth of assets in the form of nine Airbus A350-900 aircraft. This means that, if bought new, the current fleet held would cost €5.3 billion. Of course, it is not a brand new fleet, so depreciation must be allowed for. However, the IAG offer of €1.35 billion for the whole company is ridiculous. </p>
          <p eId="para_270"> Aer Lingus brings secure and consistent connectivity to Ireland, which is vital for any island but particularly for a country that has attracted major multinational companies in recent years. Aer Lingus has made Ireland an attractive destination, and its reputation for quality promotes a positive image of Ireland across the world, as we saw during The Gathering, for example. Irish people have taken pride in Aer Lingus and continue to do so. However, if this deal goes ahead, Aer Lingus is facing an uncertain seven years, which could possibly be its last seven years as we know it. It will also be a very uncertain time for the thousands of workers who make their living as part of Aer Lingus or peripherally to Aer Lingus operations in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> We have heard about commitments and assurances, but these are perhaps just a stay of execution which should never have been entered into. Behind that lies the major question about whether these assurances can be enforced or fulfilled. Do we really believe it is possible for this State, in selling 25% of a company, to hold a major multinational conglomerate to agreements in our interest for seven years and onwards? We must remember that IAG is a private, for-profit organisation with only two interests - its bottom line and its shareholders, of which Ireland is not one. IAG has no interest in the best interests of Ireland, its people or the 4,000 employees of Aer Lingus. </p>
          <p eId="para_272"> IAG's track record shows that its interest is not in providing jobs or supporting the countries from which its airlines come. For example, when Iberia became part of IAG in 2011, 4,500 jobs were cut, more than the entire staff of Aer Lingus. Other Senators have referred to the Nyras report and said that the targets for efficiencies could result in cuts of €60 million. We need only look at the example of Iberia when it became part of IAG. No one on the IAG board will be arguing on behalf of Ireland's interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> It has been made clear on many occasions that the Heathrow slots are crucial for Aer Lingus and for Ireland, as they provide connectivity with one of our main sources of trade. However, what we are getting for our stake in Aer Lingus is less than the value of Aer Lingus's Heathrow slots alone. If IAG decides to sell Aer Lingus and wrap up the company, who knows what would happen to the assurances we have been hearing so much about? As mentioned by other speakers, under this deal, Ireland will, in time, become like Scotland, which was ignored by IAG through British Airways, which was purely interested in increasing its business out of Heathrow. What hope, then, for Cork, Shannon and other regional airports? Chambers of commerce and other bodies in these areas voiced grave concerns about the bid when they attended the joint committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> Like other Senators, I wish to raise concerns about the workers who have deferred pensions. They will be forced to take a 40% cut in their pension entitlements. What hope do they have of a fair resolution after this sale?</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> We are facing another seven years of uncertainty and a struggle for the State to maintain its connectivity. There will be seven years of industrial strife and hardship for workers and, for this island, seven years of being dependent on the crumbs from a major multinational in order to provide the much-needed connectivity on which we have come to depend. Sinn Féin opposes this decision.</p>

          <p eId="para_296">How could anybody propose to vote for such a wishy-washy, vague piece of paper? That is what is being done. The Minister is selling the shares and that is it. The Members of the Dáil are voting on waffle about Aer Lingus’ preference for a registered employment agreement. It can change a preference tomorrow. My favourite colour today is blue and tomorrow it might be red. It has a preference to utilise direct labour, wherever efficient. That is not a commitment, it is a preference. I thought collective agreements, registered employment agreements, were unconstitutional and had not been re-enacted. Maybe somebody could correct me on that. If they are going to come in, that is good but there is no commitment by Aer Lingus to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> There is no question but that the Labour Party gang of seven was a front for the Government, to give it cover. They were getting top coverage from all the top political journalists who get their feeds from the Government. It was a sham and a fraud on their constituents. They were opposing it but they knew some extra items would be gathered from the negotiations and then they could row in behind the Government saying they had gained a victory, that it was all because of them. Nobody believes that. People are very cynical and they do not believe that type of nonsense. No one in that group has shown him or herself to be principled, with the possible exception of Deputy Michael McNamara, who has a strong constituency interest in the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> We have kept this share as a strategic commitment to the airline, to make sure it has a strategic commitment to us. The way this sale has happened seems to be in complete breach of what the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, talked about when he described the hands-off nature of the sale of State assets. When he was talking about the sale of the national lottery he talked about appointing certain officials in his Department who would work on it and no Minister would be involved, etc. We have found out, however, that in the past few months the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, has been entertaining Willie Walsh and others from IAG in his office, on a private basis. Presumably, if we made freedom of information requests about these meetings they would be found to be commercially sensitive, although we certainly should attempt to get the minutes of all those meetings. Then there is a debate for a day and a half in the Dáil to rush this through. It brings us back to Siteserv and the sale of the mobile telephone licence. This is a common theme when Fine Gael is in government. If we decide to sell assets we should look for full market value and sell them in the interests of the State and we should not decide to flog something because someone comes along and says he or she would like to buy it. What if someone wanted to turn the Government offices into a hotel? That would be completely ludicrous but someone comes along to buy a 25% stake in an airline that he or she is so desperate to get and is entertained, there are official meetings and an agreement to do business, and there is great excitement that it is protecting the airline. Government backbenchers, with the exception of Deputy Michael McNamara, are reading off the notes they have been given because they do not know what went on. They have no access to the information passed between the Minister, the Government and the executives of IAG.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> The ironic point is that this deal is not through yet, which could make a laughing stock of Parliament because it has to get the competition consent at the European Commission. Virgin Atlantic has complained and expressed its concerns and presumably will object to this. If that complaint were to succeed and this deal were to fail, as the proposed Ryanair takeover of Aer Lingus failed, it would make a mockery of the Parliament. It also depends on Ryanair’s consent, which has not been announced. It will need to take all of the shares in the company. In their excitement Parliament and the Government are rushing in to get a few quid. As someone, Senator Sean D. Barrett I think, told me yesterday, it is two hours’ public spending. For the length of this debate the amount of money generated by the Aer Lingus sale would be spent by the public service around the country. It is completely ludicrous, valueless and unacceptable. The process is wrong that the Government can negotiate behind closed doors and then tell the Dáil. </p>

          <p eId="para_303">That is a good question. It certainly was not Sinn Féin. We have heard many assurances, which could have been photocopied from those we were given about the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and Irish Water when they were being set up. This quite patently is the wrong deal for Ireland and we know that the Labour Party knows it but it does not have the courage to act on that knowledge. My colleague, Louise O’Reilly, who will be the Sinn Féin general election candidate for Dublin Fingal, has resurrected a statement by Deputy Stagg in 2006. When addressing the Fianna Fáil Minister for Transport at the time, he asked if the Minister was aware that the Labour Party had taken a very firm decision on the matter of privatisation, particularly in regard to Aer Lingus, and that it would not involve itself in any future Government which would advance such a policy. That is one of those statements one makes before elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> Aer Lingus is certainly worth infinitely more to Ireland than the €335 million this Government will get for cashing in the 25% that Fianna Fáil left the State with after its calamitous reign. Thanks to Fine Gael’s desire to sell off State assets at all costs Aer Lingus is facing into an uncertain seven years, which very possibly will be its last seven years, certainly as we know it. It will also be a very uncertain time for the thousands of workers who make their living as part of Aer Lingus or peripheral to Aer Lingus’ operations in Ireland. The Government says it has assurances from IAG that it will not sell the slots, which was a major concern due to their strategic importance to the company. It claims to have got a commitment that the Aer Lingus slots will remain under the company’s control for seven years. Do we really believe it is possible for this State to hold a major multinational conglomerate to agreements for seven years? IAG is a private profit operation with only two interests, its bottom line and shareholders, of which Ireland is not one. It does not care about the interests of Ireland, its people or the workers who make up the almost 4,000 employees of Aer Lingus. What hope have Cork, Shannon or other regional airports in that environment? </p>
          <p eId="para_305"> The deferred members of the IASS, who worked for Aer Lingus, are being forced to take a 40% cut in their pension entitlements, facilitated by legislation. What hope do they now have of a fair resolution? This is a bad deal for Ireland, Aer Lingus and its workers. It will usher in seven years of uncertainty and struggle. It would be seven years of industrial strife and hardship for workers who will be left on the scrap heap. In seven years’ time we will be left an island dependent on the crumbs of a major multinational to provide the crucial connectivity we have come to depend on. The day will come when the Labour Party will see the cost of its cowardice just as Fianna Fáil must surely see the end result of its own rush to privatisation. The message is very clear: Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil cannot be trusted in government with decisions such as these. We call on the Government, even at this stage, to reverse this decision, to pull back, take stock, listen and take on board all the different reports that are available to make an educated decision and to listen to that man in the west who used to work for eircom who said “Don’t do it again because it was a disaster when ye did it with eircom”. </p>

          <from>Senator Gerard P. Craughwell<recordedTime time="2015-05-28T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_306">I understand the Leader’s position but it is regrettable that Senator Sean D. Barrett cannot be here. He is tied up in the banking inquiry and he simply cannot leave it. It is deeply regrettable that we will not hear his voice today.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">I speak today on behalf of those who cannot speak in this House, namely, the Aer Lingus staff who suffered severe cuts to their pensions as a result of the actions of this Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_308"> I am not interested in political point-scoring but it is shocking that there are so few Members on the Government side present in the House to defend the sale of Aer Lingus. I appreciate their having remained in the House throughout the entire debate. It is outrageous that there are many Senators wandering around Leinster House today hailing this as a great deal for Ireland, yet they have not presented in the House for this debate. In fairness, Senators Maurice Cummins, Pat O'Neill, Michael Mullins and Ivana Bacik have contributed to this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> If there were a free vote in Dáil Éireann today, how many Government backbenchers would actually support the sale of Aer Lingus? As in the case of Irish Shipping, Aer Lingus will slip off into the memories of people, and within seven years, in the context of the much talked about guarantees, most people will have forgotten all about Aer Lingus. The Government speaks of the sale of this organisation being about jobs. Following completion of the sale, 50 jobs are to be cut from Aer Lingus. That is not saving jobs. The remainder of the deal is platitudes and promises.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> On Aer Lingus the brand, I recently met some soldiers who have served in the Lebanon. They told me that as they finished their tour of duty and reached a hill overlooking Tel Aviv, where they would see the Aer Lingus jets on the tarmac waiting to take them home, they knew they were safe and would soon be home. Most of us in this House and most of our families and relations have travelled all over the world. There is nothing like arriving at an airport and seeing the shamrock. I do not believe for one minute that IAG will retain the brand for any longer than it has to.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> I recently heard that one of the members of the board of Aer Lingus will walk away with a €4.5 million payment. How many pensions would that have topped up? Other members will walk away with up to €750,000 each. It is outrageous that people will be allowed to walk away with that amount of money. Will the Government publish the data on the amount, to the penny, each member of the board or management will be paid following completion of this deal? How much of the sale price will be diverted to the pensioners, those who built up the brand that is being sold at a giveaway, knock-down price? Senator Bacik said - I am sure that, as a member of the Labour Party, it was the right thing to say - that she will fight to ensure some of that money is diverted back to the pensioners. I would like a report to the House on precisely how much of that money will be diverted to the pensioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> We never learn in this country. All one sees when one drives around this country is broken railway lines that once served places such as west Clare, Connemara and so on. All these lines were ripped up because it was the economic thing to do at the time. The tram system in Dublin because ripped up because it was the economic thing to do at the time. We are now spending billions to replace it.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> If Senator Sean D. Barrett were here, he would speak about the irony of the British courts ruling on competition between two Irish-based companies. There is something terribly wrong about that. He would also speak about the way IAG serviced the regional airports in the United Kingdom and how terrible that was. Unfortunately, I do not have the expertise of Senator Barrett in the area of transport economics. He is the only voice I have heard in all this that is truly independent and has no axe to grind with anyone. We are told that the Government's influence, in terms of the 25.1% shareholding, was limited. I am sure that someone advised the Government of suppression in any relationship of the minor shareholder. It had influence. From what I hear, the golden share is not worth the paper its written on. Where does that leave us?</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> On the Heathrow Airport slots, as pointed out by one of my colleagues, the sale price does not even cover the value of the Heathrow slots. Let us not for one minute think the Heathrow slots will remain in Ireland's ownership; they will not. As far as I am concerned, today is a bad day for Ireland and the workers of Aer Lingus and a terrible day for the Aer Lingus pensioners. I hope and pray that the one person with the backbone to stop this, Michael O'Leary, refuses point blank to divest himself of his shareholding and the Ryanair shareholding in Aer Lingus, thus leaving us with what we have.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> I thank Senators Maurice Cummins and Ivana Bacik for representing the Government in this debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_324">The Bill is the latest of a series of measures which have been enacted since the establishment of the statute law revision programme over a decade ago, as well as further measures planned for the future, to overhaul the Irish Statute Book. The Bill is the largest repealing measure in the history of this or any other state, measured by the number of laws expressly repealed. Previous statute law revision Bills have been brought before this House and received cross-party support. Those Bills have dealt with primary legislation dating from before Independence. This Bill now continues the process and deals with secondary instruments such as proclamations and orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> The Bill revokes all Government orders or other secondary instruments made prior to 1821, apart from a specific list of 43 instruments which are being preserved. In total, the Bill expressly revokes 5,782 secondary instruments, and repeals almost 7,000 others implicitly. In addition to the revocation of secondary instruments, the Bill also amends the Statutory Instruments Act 1947 by removing the exemption of certain statutory instruments or classes of statutory instruments from publication, which will lead to greater transparency in our Statute Book.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> Statute law revision refers to the process of removing legislation from the Statute Book that has lost its purpose and relevance. The term "Statute Book" is a broad term referring to all primary legislation - that is, statutes or Acts - and secondary legislation, which consists of orders, regulations, rules, schemes, by-laws and similar instruments, that have not been formally repealed or revoked. Much material remains on the Statute Book simply because of inertia, and this material is obsolete or has long since served its purpose, or has ceased to be in force without ever being formally repealed. However, until it is actually removed, it will continue to clutter the Statute Book. The purpose of such revision is to enhance public accessibility to the Statute Book and pave the way for further modernisation measures. There is a particular need for such revision in Ireland, as we have a unique legislative past which has left us with a complex stock of legislation, with enactments from Parliaments of Ireland, England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom. Ireland's pre-Independence statute law consists of primary legislation - public, local and personal, and private Acts of Parliament - and secondary legislation such as Government proclamations and orders. Best practice in regulatory governance requires states to review their stock of legislation on a regular basis and to repeal and revoke that which is spent, unused, unnecessary, or otherwise appropriate for removal from the Statute Book.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> The benefits of statute law revision, which have been well documented, include the creation of certainty as to which laws remain in force, facilitation of the process of regulatory reform, enabling modernisation of the Statute Book, enhancement of public accessibility to the Statute Book, the facilitation of steps to put the texts of in-force laws online, the facilitation of future legislative measures to repeal or re-enact legislation, with amendments where necessary, and the codification or consolidation of the statute law of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> This Bill continues the important work of the statute law reform programme, which is part of the current Programme for Government 2011-2016 and is a specific element of the public service reform plan for 2014 to 2016. The current programme of statute law revision was established in 2003 and has resulted in four Statute Law Revision Acts, in 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2012. Collectively, these Acts have repealed approximately 95% of pre-Independence primary legislation either expressly or implicitly. Taken together, this Bill and its predecessors expressly repeal 13,547 pieces of legislation and implicitly repeal more than 47,000 others.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> In 2012, the statute law revision programme was transferred from the Attorney General's office to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Following this transfer, the Statute Law Revision Act 2012 completed the review of pre-Independence primary legislation. In July 2013, the Government approved a second phase of statute law revision, including the drafting of this Bill to revoke secondary instruments. A draft list of instruments and details of the Bill was published by the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> The preparation of the Bill began in September 2013 with the chronological identification and assessment of numerous secondary instruments such as orders and proclamations. There is no single source, or even index, of pre-Independence secondary instruments applicable to Ireland. As a result, a full review of items contained in <i>The Dublin Gazette</i>, <i>The London Gazette</i> and certain other printed collections was carried out by the statute law revision programme. Secondary instruments identified following this review were then examined as to whether they were applicable to Ireland and suitable for revocation. There are 43 instruments that were found to be applicable to Ireland but not suitable for repeal, and these are listed in Schedule 1 for retention. A total of 5,782 instruments were identified as suitable for revocation, and these have been listed in Schedule 2. As with previous Statute Law Revision Bills, the format of the legislation will be to revoke all instruments coming within the ambit of the Bill, except those listed in Schedule 1. Schedule 2 provides, for information purposes, a list of revoked instruments.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform engaged in a consultation exercise with other affected Departments, and a draft list of instruments and details of the Bill was published on the Department's website in September 2014. In addition, relevant bodies and organisations that could potentially be affected by proposed repeals continue to be made aware of the ongoing work of the statute law revision programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> A review of the instruments listed in the Bill gives significant insight into the regulatory environment of the period in question. It includes details in regard to matters at international, national and local level, concerning areas as diverse as the exportation of corn and cattle, Catholic suppression and the plantations, quarantine on account of the plague, pardon of deserters and rewards for information in relation to murders and thefts, and also orders for the sitting of Parliament. Examples include an order of 1815 directing that a prayer of thanksgiving be held for the victory at the Battle of Waterloo; an order of 1654 prohibiting any papist, Irish or other, whatever his nation, to teach school or instruct children; a declaration of 1655 ordering the removal of all Irish papists remaining within Dublin; and a declaration of 1560 prohibiting the sale of corn from the Pale.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> One of the earliest references in the Bill is to an order concerning the publication of the Magna Carta in 1215. As many Senators will know, the Magna Carta is celebrating its 800th anniversary this year and its significance still resonates today, as it is seen as the foundation of both the common law and many human rights instruments. It is of note that aspects of it and the Irish Magna Carta of 1216 continue in force in Ireland today, having been retained by the Statute Law Revision Act 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> I wish to outline to the House the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is the interpretation section. I want to refer to one definition in particular. "Instrument" is a key term of the Bill and is defined to cover three categories of instrument. Category (a) means any instrument that describes itself as an order, regulation, rule, by-law, scheme, or proclamation that is made under statutory, charter or executive or administrative authority or published in <i>The Dublin Gazette </i>or<i> The London Gazette</i>. Category (b) covers similar instruments, irrespective of their descriptions, which are of a regulatory, general or public nature, where such instruments were made under statutory, charter or executive or administrative authority or published in <i>The Dublin Gazette</i> or <i>The London Gazette</i>. This category will capture instruments that are akin to orders, regulations and rules but are not described as such. The definition specifically excludes charters and letters patent, because these will be the subject of a separate Bill, in accordance with the Government decision of July 2013 to which I referred to earlier. Category (c) relates to instruments referred to in Schedule 2, which lists instruments that will be revoked by the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> Section 2(1) is the central feature of the Bill. It provides for a fundamental clarification and simplification of the Statute Book by drawing a line at 1 January 1821 and revoking all instruments made prior to that point except for the instruments listed in Schedule 1. Schedule 1 contains the instruments that it is considered necessary to retain. Section 2(2)(a) saves the instruments in Schedule 1. Section 2(2)(b) saves, for the avoidance of doubt, any transitional or continuing provision that applies to any instrument that has already been revoked prior to the present Bill. Section 2(5) provides a clear new power to revoke the instruments in Schedule 1, as in some cases the original power to revoke has ceased to apply, such as where the order was made under the prerogative or has become unworkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> Section 3(1) provides that, for information purposes, Schedule 2 will list the instruments identified by the statute law revision programme as coming within the scope of the revocation by section 2. These are the specific instruments which were identified as being obsolete, unnecessary or as having ceased to be in force. Section 3(2) provides that an instrument being omitted from Schedule 2 does not imply that the instrument is saved. Section 3(3) provides that the inclusion of an instrument in Schedule 2 does not deem it to have been of full force and effect immediately prior to the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> Section 4 assigns citations to any instrument that is listed in Schedule 1. The section is based on section 4 of the Statute Law Revision Acts 2007 and 2009. However, unlike in those Acts, there is no reference to existing citations as none of the instruments already had citations. Section 5 provides for a standard savings clause and is based on section 9(1) of the Statute Law Revision Act 2007 and section 6(1) of both the subsequent Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> Section 6 amends the Statutory Instruments Act 1947 to remove the power to exempt statutory instruments from publication. Section 6(a)(i) inserts a new subsection, (2A), into the Act of 1947, to exempt instruments made under certain sections of the Defence Act 1954 and the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990 from the operation of the general application of the Act of 1947. Instruments made under those sections will not be affected by the amendments to the 1947 Act. Section 6(a)(ii) repeals sections 3 and 4 of the Act of 1947 and section 6(a)(iii) removes references to directions from section 2 of the Act of 1947, which is a consequential amendment. This will have the effect of removing the power, which has existed for nearly 70 years, to exempt instruments from normal publication. I hope the House will agree that this provision is a further important step towards transparency in our Statute Book. Paragraph (b) of section 6 will delete the obligation of the Stationery Office to send hard copies of all instruments to the chambers of commerce. Given that all statutory instruments are now available online, the need to send out hard copies has significantly lessened and the removal of this provision will achieve savings and greater efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> Section 7 provides for evidence of instruments and is based on section 8 of the 2007 Act. There are, however, a greater number of sources for the pre-1820 instruments. It also includes a number of abbreviations used in the Schedules. Section 8 provides for the powers in relation to evidence of early Acts to transfer from the Taoiseach to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. This reflects the transfer of the programme to my Department in 2012 to which I alluded earlier. Section 9 provides for a Short Title and collective citations including a collective citation for the 36 previous Statute Law Revision Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> Schedule 1 lists the instruments to be retained. Each part of Schedule 1 lists the instruments which it is considered are not appropriate for revocation at this stage and are being retained in force specifically. The format of the Schedule is based on the Schedules to the Statute Law Revision Acts 2007, 2009 and 2012 with the addition of a new column 1 with a reference number and a new column 4 to identify the Minister conferred with a revocation power in respect of that instrument pursuant to section 2(5). Schedule 2 lists the specific instruments identified in the course of the review as appropriate for revocation at this stage because they have ceased to be relevant or have become unnecessary. They will be instruments which, while applicable to Ireland, have been identified in the course of the review as appropriate for revocation because they are spent, obsolete or have otherwise become unnecessary, and where no existing revocation has been identified at this stage of the research. They are not saved by the saver in section 2, and thus will cease to be in force following enactment of the Bill. Other instruments that do not relate to Ireland or have only a tenuous connection with Ireland will not be included in Schedule 2 but will be implicitly revoked by virtue of the general revocation in section 2.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> Having regard to the volume of legislation involved and the careful analysis given to each instrument, it is clear that the Bill is the culmination of a significant programme of work. The progressing of the statute law revision programme has required meticulous research and has underpinned further modernisation and accessibility measures such as the electronic availability of the majority of Acts that were retained by the Statute Law Revision Act 2007. The Law Reform Commission has made available for the first time the text of most of the pre-1922 public general Acts that remain in force and those texts are now on the Irish Statute Book website. In addition, the statute law revision programme has provided assistance to other Departments on the repeal and re-enactment in modern form of extant pre-1922 Acts in some subsequent sector-specific legislation. The project staff also received texts of legal instruments and valuable assistance and co-operation from the Oireachtas Library and the National Library of Ireland. I express my gratitude to those institutions for their continued and ongoing support and assistance. I give a special mention to the Irish Manuscripts Commission, which was responsible for the publication of the five volumes of the Proclamations of Ireland between 1660 and 1820, edited by James Kelly with Mary Ann Lyons. These volumes were of great assistance particularly due to the quality and clarity of the texts contained within the publication.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> As I mentioned, the Bill should be viewed in the context of the wider programme which includes not just the major Statute Law Revision Acts already enacted, but further measures planned as part of the next steps for the programme. I am pleased that work is well under way on the next Bill which will repeal spent and obsolete Acts enacted after 1922. This is the first comprehensive review of Acts enacted by the Oireachtas. Work has also commenced on a further Bill to continue the review of secondary instruments to dovetail with the current Bill and to deal with the post-1820 period. The Bill before the House today will achieve the repeal of almost 6,000 spent or obsolete legal instruments. The removal of these instruments represents another important step towards the aim of a clear and concise Statute Book which reduces the regulatory burden on businesses and citizens and enhances accessibility for the general public. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_186">
          <from>Senator Thomas Byrne<recordedTime time="2015-05-28T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_343">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. This is a very important series of work that has been ongoing since 2006, if not earlier. The Minister of State's officials have been working very hard on it. It has been ongoing since 2003 and there were Acts in 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2012. A significant amount of work has been done on trying to get the Statute Book in order in the best way we can, acknowledging all the laws still exist. It always interests me to see matters that are of particular interest to my locality. If one takes the time to look through the Bill, as I have done, one finds some very interesting matters. I am glad to be able to tell the people of Warrenstown and Dunshaughlin-Culmullen parish that their pilgrimage to St. John's Well in Warrenstown, Drumree will no longer be the subject of a proclamation banning such pilgrimages which was issued by the Lord Lieutenant in 1710. His text stated: "Whereas 10,000 papists riotously assemble at place commonly called St. John's Well under the pretence of worship ... they are a great terror to her Majesty's Protestant subjects and so endanger the peace of her kingdom the High Sheriff will suppress such insolent practices with a posse [Senator Norris can be in the posse] and apprehend the principal actors in the said riot and have them prosecuted with the most rigorous of the law."</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> The legislation will remove this from the Statute Book, and I am very glad of it. All joking aside, these were very difficult times for the Roman Catholic population of the country and it would be very unwise of us to forget it. It would also be very unwise of Roman Catholics to forget it in the context of the possible oppression of other people, which has sometimes happened in our history when the Roman Catholic Church got too much power. The objective should be to have tolerance and respect for all different faiths, which certainly did not exist during the Penal Laws. Also of considerable local interest would be the provision in the legislation which continues two orders from 1781 regarding the Conyngham family, the family of Lord Henry Mountcharles. Lord Henry will be glad to hear his name is safe with the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> There is an amazing amount of history in these laws. There are proclamations issued in counties Antrim, Cork, Meath, Clare, Westmeath and Tipperary instructing Tories, robbers and rapparees to surrender to the authorities. There is also an order promising a pardon to anyone involved in the theft and fire at a house on the estate of the Lord Bishop of Meath. I presume it refers to the Church of Ireland Bishop of Meath, who is a very respected lady and an excellent Bishop. Anybody who robs or burns her house will no longer be pardoned if this legislation is passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> We support the legislation. It is part of a programme of work that was started when we were in government and we are delighted to see the Government continuing with it. It should not take up too much of our parliamentary time and I hope the work will continue. It has been a long but very necessary piece of work. This year, I hope to attend the pilgrimage to St. John's Well in Warrenstown knowing that it is no longer banned and that this particular Penal Law, among many others is being removed by this legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh. I echo Senator Thomas Byrne's remarks and marvel at what was required to bring this Bill to the House. The sheer volume of the legislation is unbelievable, and the programme has taken 12 years work, which is phenomenal. When I look at the Acts and orders that are being repealed, what jumps out at me is the proclamation prohibiting the sale of cattle other than on a market day that dates from 1543. One could not call it a spring clean of the Statute Book, as it took 12 years, but when one sees the number of Acts and the number of secondary instruments, which run into the thousands, that had to be repealed, one would realise it was laborious. I do not envy those who were tasked with this work, which will put the Statute Book on a better standing. Should people from other jurisdictions look at the Statute Book, they would see laws dating back to the 1500s, but I hope that when this body of work is completed we will have a modern, up-to-date Statute Book. I congratulate the Minister of State on this body of work.</p>

          <from>Senator David Norris<recordedTime time="2015-05-28T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_348">This is the third time I have had the pleasure of speaking on this kind of Bill. I remember the time when Dr. Martin Mansergh was Minister of State. I thank those Ministers who preceded the present Minister. The Irish Manuscripts Commission did very valuable work in preparing the volumes concerning these defunct statutes. I think we owe a great debt to them and also to the National Library of Ireland and the Oireachtas Library, which have done tremendous work. I pay tribute to the people who went through these statutes, but unlike Senator Tom Sheahan, I think it would have been a fascinating task. These old laws give one a tremendous feeling of the history of the country. Sometimes from our current perspective they appear laughable, but they were far from laughable at the time. The Minister of State is quite correct when he said that much material remains on the Statute Book simply because of inertia. This material is obsolete and has long since served its purpose. It is out of date and is cluttering everything up, so it is good to get rid of it. It will continue to clutter up the Statute Book until it is removed. This is done not just as a kind of tidying-up exercise but to enhance public accessibility to relevant and vibrant statute law.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> Among the issues dealt with are restrictions on exports. I found that interesting, because that law hampered this country during its association with the neighbouring island, which, in a very mean-minded way, restricted Irish trade. People such as Molyneux, Jonathan Swift and Bishop Berkeley were all to the fore in resisting it. There is a reflection of religious wars, the proclamation of James II, followed by restrictions on Catholics. There were also a number of instruments that specify persons. It is astonishing that there should be statutes dealing with individual citizens - so-and-so who was a victim of robbery, or somebody who was impeached and a reward was offered for them. I have picked out a number of things of particular interest. We could spend the whole afternoon on this fascinating work - I see the Leader is nodding his head in agreement. On 26 June 1663 there was a proclamation ordering the burning by the common hangman of a book about the "murthers" and massacres committed on the Irish. That is a very interesting example of censorship. There were murders and massacres committed against the Irish and the Government was intent on preventing any dissemination of these ideas. Something we could do with, and that I think should not be repealed - I wonder if I should table an amendment providing that it be retained - is a proclamation ordering the apprehension of street robbers in Dublin. Why are we getting rid of that? Street robbers should be apprehended. I do not see any reason for getting rid of that at all. On 3 February 1755, there was an order for the surveying of pavements in the city of Dublin. Was that ever more relevant? Have a look at Parnell Street, which would benefit from a survey of the pavements. Do we have the opportunity of tabling amendments?</p>

          <p eId="para_354">Exactly. When will the Leader move it? There is the Leader's privacy Bill and my privacy Bill. I think the three matters I have isolated are of particular concern still.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> Two on the same page have a certain poignancy, particularly for Members in this room. I am talking about the proclamation of 11 May 1798 promising a reward for the discovery of Lord Edward FitzGerald, wanted for high treason. FitzGerald would have walked many times through these rooms. There is a proclamation on 29 June offering a £1,000 reward for the capture of Beauchamp Bagenal Harvey, another one of the great people of 1798. The Minister of State referred to the first citation among the instruments of England from 1066 to 1707, "Proclamation publishing the peace (Magna Carta)"; therefore, we can see that by 1215 the Magna Carta had reached Ireland. There is a tremendously interesting amount of history and for that reason I am not surprised that the Irish Manuscripts Commission published this series of volumes of scholarly work. Of course, such instruments should be cleared out of the way so that people will have greater accessibility to the living statutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> I think it was in the time when Dr. Mansergh was Minister of State that they got rid of a capital offence, the uttering of the phrase "Crom abú", which was the war cry of the Butlers of Ormond, the traditional enemies of my own Gaelic Irish family, who had very considerable difficulties. I did not have time to see if they were reflected in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> I congratulate the Minister of State. I am sure that even though he was not expecting to be in this Chamber, he found it interesting and amusing if he had an opportunity to roll his eye over the many and various quirky, curious and antiquarian aspects of this legislation. It is very appropriate that in this House, Seanad Éireann, we should be discussing such an interesting Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LorraineHiggins" eId="spk_193">
          <from>Senator Lorraine Higgins<recordedTime time="2015-05-28T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_358">I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his very detailed and informative submission, which went through the various provisions of the Act. It is very good to hear other speakers refer to their relevance in current times, for which I thank Senators David Norris and Thomas Byrne.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> I welcome the opportunity to lead the debate on behalf of the Labour Party in the Seanad and to contribute to this important legislation. As legislators we have a tendency to add laws to the Statute Book, but rarely do we remove any. On that basis, I commend the Minister and his Department on this Bill. It is the most extensive statute law revision attempted anywhere. We can be very proud to have undertaken this course of action, as it marks us out as reformers in the true sense of the word. It is clear that a great job is being done in combing through the Statute Book for material that should no longer be there. I understand that throughout this process a number of Bills have already come through the Houses, and in total approximately 8,000 Acts have been identified for repeal. Together with these, some 40,557 Acts have automatically been repealed by the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">With the Office of the Attorney General, the Minister and his Department have outlined a purposeful project to review all legislation on our Statute Book and to repeal any legislation that is spent, obsolete and no longer of practical use. Having worked in law, I think I speak for most members of my profession in welcoming this development, because no longer will I have to worry about some ancient, archaic law coming up and biting me if I am working in a courtroom again sometime soon when trying to fight a case. More seriously, it will revoke just over 5,700 secondary instruments, which were assessed by the statute law revision project as spent or obsolete. It also amends the Statutory Instruments Act 1947 by removing the provisions that permit certain individual instruments and classes of instrument to be exempted from the publication requirements of section 3(1) of the Act of 1947, except, I understand, instruments made under specified sections of the Defence Act 1954 and the amendment Act of 1990.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> As with earlier phases and other matters brought before the Seanad relating to statute law, this Bill has been widely canvassed and accompanied by a consultation process with the various Departments, local authorities and other relevant companies, bodies and organisations. Some of these laws date back to 1542. While some are completely obsolete, they have enjoyed the full force of law up to the present, notwithstanding their age and the fact that they were designed for a very different era. One might question why these laws survived our independence from the British crown. However, by virtue of an Act passed in 1922, many ancient laws were transposed into Irish law. While we might be thankful that time has moved on in legal terms, it will not really have done so until this Bill is passed. </p>
          <p eId="para_362"> The Bill contains a comprehensive list of the secondary instruments and statutory instruments to be repealed and those to be retained. For instance, some of the laws that have been scrapped in the past relate to the removal of the 700 year old obligation for every citizen of Ireland to own a bow and arrow and to practise archery. The Act concerned with locking people into stocks so that they could be pelted with tomatoes - I know a few I could put in there - is also to be repealed, as are the private divorce Acts, which are obsolete in light of the judicial divorce Acts of 1996 and the statutes relating to conferring of citizenship on non-nationals, where Ministers have no power to confer naturalisation. This had to be done by Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> While I have outlined only some of the Acts that have been consigned to history, this Bill will also specify those secondary instruments and statutory instruments that are to remain in effect. As well shedding light on Ireland's economic, social and political life, this constant renewal of legislation saves time and money. Our Parliament passes laws to deal with current circumstances and when these circumstances no longer apply, the legislation should cease to apply immediately. It is important that we remove legal deadwood from our Statute Book to facilitate a process of regulatory reform. A modern democracy like Ireland requires us to replace outdated and outmoded legislation with laws that are passed by the democratically elected representatives of the people. Obsolete laws have survived for too long because of the belief that they were not causing any harm. This is where people are wrong, however. Many of the archaic laws have frustrated the legal and judicial system and hampered its efficient operation because of the time legal practitioners were required to spend in the Law Library to determine the legal standing of a particular point. The Bill reflects the Government's agenda for better regulation. I thank everybody who has worked on this Bill and commend it to the House.</p>

          <from>Senator Maurice Cummins<recordedTime time="2015-05-28T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_364">I think I also spoke on the previous Bill we had on statute law revision. It is a fantastic piece of work and I compliment all involved because it obviously took hours, months and years to compile all these laws and to bring them before us. It is a picture of history over centuries and it is certainly worth looking at. It deals with spent and obsolete laws, but it is a fantastic mirror of many things that happened in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> I will choose a few of them that are of historical interest. There is mention of the licence to Robert Gore to use the name and arms of Booth. We have heard a great deal of the Gore-Booths, regarding property and so on, in recent years. Another order settles the currency in Ireland and brings it to the same value as the coin in England. I am sure that could be the subject of many debates over a pint or two. There is also a proclamation in 1601 renewing the offer of a reward for the capture and death of the Earl of Tyrone, Hugh O'Neill. What kind of connotations does that have in Irish history and the historical facts we were taught in primary school? From a Waterford point of view, there is a proclamation from 1639 for glass-making, which was very prominent in my city. Another declaration orders the removal of Irish papist proprietors with their wives, children and families from Leinster, Munster and Ulster to Connacht, dating from 1654. When we look again at the plantations and so on, it is all a very significant part of Irish history. In 1679 an order was made forbidding tobacco growing in Ireland. I am sure that if Senator Crown were here, he would be suggesting that rather than growing it, we should have banned it back in 1654. Another significant part of Irish history is an order made in 1689, before the battle of the Boyne in 1690, offering payment to Schomberg's soldiers to enlist in the Jacobite army. How much a part of Irish history was that? It continues to be a very important part of Irish history, north and south. A proclamation from 1374 concerns free access to victuals in Waterford. That is going back a long way. The Minister of State himself pointed out to me a proclamation from 1607 concerning the earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell. We all know of the flight of the earls.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> There is so much entwined in this about the history of Ireland. It is a very important piece of work and I compliment everybody involved in repealing up to 6,000 statutory and secondary instruments. I compliment everyone involved and commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_367">In the time I spent listening, I had a chance to look through a few items. I agree with Senator Maurice Cummins that this gives us a chance to reflect on our geographical areas and to go through history. There is a great opportunity to get much of this information out into the schools. I acknowledge all the officials who have been working diligently on this over the years. I am sure it was a learning journey for them, too. For example, as Senator Maurice Cummins pointed out, there is a proclamation dating from 9 July 1607 repealing the statute and restraining subjects from departing out of the realm. That was two short months before the flight of the earls on 14 September 1607. This Statute Book and the removal of these obsolete pieces of legislation brings much of history to life. It is an important catalogue of our history. There are some very interesting pieces in it. For example, on 28 November 1798, there was an order "extending the prohibition of the transport coastwise of any gunpowder, saltpetre, or any sort of arms or ammunition for six months commencing on 7 December 1798", coinciding with significant dates. It brings our history to life.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> I will conclude on one interesting item. On 5 August 1714, there was a proclamation declaring Prince George the king of Great Britain, France and Ireland. There is a Prince George around at the moment, if I am not mistaken; therefore, it might be important to remove this from the Statute Book.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> I thank everyone involved, including the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, and his officials, for being diligent in their approach. I also thank Senators for their contributions.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_388">"(2A) Remanded children shall be kept separate from sentenced children where it is in the best interests of the child.",".</p>
          <p eId="para_389">I welcome the Minister back to the House. I fully support the Bill. Any amendments we have tabled are in the spirit of strengthening the Bill. I commend the Minister for bringing it forward. </p>
          <p eId="para_390"> This amendment adds a paragraph "(2A) Remanded children shall be kept separate from sentenced children where it is in the best interests of the child." In broad terms, I welcome the Bill which will provide for the amalgamation of the three children detention centres into one legal entity and underpin the legal authority of the campus manager. However, it is also vital to reiterate the principle that detention, including detention on remand, is a last resort for children and must never be used for care or welfare purposes. This is a clear requirement of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and is reflected in the Children Act 2001, as amended. Furthermore, while the children detention schools are annually inspected by HIQA, the standards and criteria for children detention schools were issued in 2004, adopted in 2008 and have not been revised since. The Irish Penal Reform Trust has repeatedly recommended that these standards be reviewed to ensure that they adhere to current best practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> Section 88(8) of the Children Act 2001, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2006, provides that remanded children shall be kept separate from sentenced children only as far as practicable and where it is in the interests of the child. Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires that juveniles be separated from adults and remand prisoners from convicted prisoners. Notably, the UN Human Rights Committee, in its concluding observations in July 2014, stated that despite the current reservation to the Article that is in place, Ireland should "establish a concrete timeframe for the achievement of complete separation of remand and sentenced prisoners, juvenile and adult prisoners and detained immigrants and sentenced prisoners. At the very least section 88(8) should be amended to provide that "Remanded children shall be kept separate from sentenced children where it is in the best interests of the child", which is what the amendment states.</p>

          <p eId="para_394">I stand in support of both amendments Nos. 15 and 19. I reiterate what I said on Second Stage about our commitment, as a Legislature, to the internationally and domestically recognised principle of detention as a last resort for children, both those committed to detention and detained on remand. As others have said, section 88(10) of the Children Act, as amended, stipulates that the court shall not retain a child in custody solely on the basis of care or protection concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> On Second Stage, I expressed my concerns about section 5 of the Bill which allows for part or all of a detention school to be designated a remand centre. I believe we are starting from a point of non-compliance with our international human rights obligations. I refer chiefly to 10(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights under which Ireland continues to maintain a reservation. The Minister will recall the concluding observations of the UN Human Rights Committee last July. It said Ireland "should establish a concrete timeline for the achievement of complete separation of remand and sentenced prisoners, juvenile and adult prisoners and detained immigrants and sentenced prisoners".</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> I fully support the recommendation of the Irish Penal Reform Trust, which others have stated and which is reflected in both amendments before us. At the very least, section 88(8), as amended, should be amended again to provide that remanded children should be kept separate from sentenced children where it is in the best interests of the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> Article 42A of the Constitution and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was ratified by Ireland in 1992, deals with the best interests of the child. It is incumbent on us, as a Legislature, in the drafting of any Bill which impacts on a child's life, to ensure the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration, the views of the child are heard when key decisions are made about their lives and to take into account the evolving capacity of the child and ensure it is facilitated. Therefore, I support the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_398">I have listened to what the Senators have said and I take the spirit of its intent. Amendment No. 15, as proposed, would result in a free-standing requirement that remanded children would be kept separate from sentenced children where it is in the best interests of the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> Section 88(8) of the existing Children Act 2001 already deals with the issue of remand children and separated children where the remand centre is located in a children detention school. The existing section 88(8) outlines the important principle that where children are remanded in a children detention school, such children shall, as far as practicable and where it is in the interests of the children, be kept separate from and not allowed to associate with children in respect of whom a period of detention is imposed. The effect of the proposed amendment would be to remove the "where practicable" clause of the existing section 88(8). It would possibly require a complete separation of remand children and committal children in all instances, irrespective of whether this is in fact possible. It should be noted that the existing children detention school in Oberstown tends to be full on most occasions, with varying numbers of children on remand or serving a sentence at different times of the year depending on the demand for detention places from the courts system.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> In line with section 88(8), every effort is made to accommodate children in custody on remand in separate residential units from children who are serving a sentence of detention. This is an issue of professional assessment of the situation of each child and the day-to-day operational management of the children detention schools. In an environment of high demand for both remand places and places where children are serving a sentence, it would not be possible to keep remand children and committal children separate on all occasions. This would require a significant increase in detention accommodation. It would also result in the new accommodation being built on the Oberstown campus being insufficient to cater for all children up to the age of 18, as is currently planned. The need to meet the requirements of the proposed amendment could also undermine the existing policy that is in place of keeping male and female children in separate residential facilities in all circumstances. I note there are also circumstances where separation of a remand child from committal children may not be in the child's best interests. In addition, I am advised there are frequently cases where a child is both remanded in custody on one set of charges and serving a sentence of detention on another set of charges. Therefore, I do not accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> In regard to amendment No. 19, section 88(8) of the Children Act provides for the following important principle. Where children are remanded to a remand centre situated in a children detention school, such children shall, as far as practicable and where it is in the interests of the children, be kept separate from and shall not be allowed to associate with children in respect of whom a period of detention is imposed. I note the purpose of the Senator's amendment is to replace the wording to state "where it is in the best interests of the child". I am broadly agreeable, in principle, with the amendment. However, I intend to consult the Office of the Attorney General on the matter in the context of the Bill.</p>

As I do not want to delay the passage of the legislation, I will not repeat the arguments in favour of the amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> I mentioned the conclusion reached by the UN Human Rights Committee which stated that Ireland "should establish a concrete timeline for the achievement of complete separation of remand and sentenced prisoners, juvenile and adult prisoners, and detained immigrants and sentenced prisoners". Perhaps the Minister would outline what moves the Government is making in that direction. Is there a timeline? He mentioned what would happen if he accepted the amendment and that it may not be possible to have complete separation because of resources. Are we moving in the direction the UN Human Rights Committee has advocated? Are we looking at a timeframe? It would be helpful to my party and the House if the Minister was in a position to give us that information.</p>

          <p eId="para_406">In response to Senator David Cullinane, I am not in a position to give him a concrete timeline at the moment but certainly that is the direction of travel.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> On the circumstances where it would not be in the child's best interests to be separated from children that have been sentenced, there is a strict policy of keeping male and female children in separate residential facilities in all cases. In recent years there have been very few female children in custody and on many occasions in the past 18 months there have been none in custody, including today. That is a welcome development. Owing to the low number in custody there is only one unit of accommodation used for females. There is no practical method of providing two units of residential accommodation for female children in such circumstances, given that the primary demand for detention places is for males.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> In addition, if two female children were in custody and one was remanded while the other served a sentence, I do not believe, and I think many people would agree with me, that it would be in their best interests, as the only females in custody, to be kept in de facto solitary confinement from one another. Other examples would include if there were two children from the same family, ethnic group, nationality or geographical area, with one on remand and one serving a sentence. In such cases it is entirely possible it would be in their interest to be accommodated together, although I hasten to add not always. In that regard, Senators can understand the exigencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> I make the following appeal, which is something that continually faces us as politicians. Let not the perfect be the enemy of the good. The Bill is very good and moves us along considerably. This is a new unit, ethos and era where no one under 18 years will find themselves in prison, rather in a detention school where the ethos is based on rehabilitation, education and preparation for life, as opposed to the penal servitude system of the prison service.</p>

          <p eId="para_411">I move amendment No. 18:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_412">In page 8, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_413">“(b) by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (7):</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_414">“(7A) Where a child is convicted of an offence and a period of detention is imposed on the child by a court, the period of detention shall not exceed the term of detention or imprisonment that the court could have imposed on a person of full age and capacity who is convicted of such an offence, and may be less. The Court shall have regard to the age, level of maturity, best interests of the child and the principle of imprisonment as a last resort in determining the nature of any penalty imposed.”,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">We note that section 8 amends section 149 of the Children Act 2001 and provides that where a child is convicted of an offence, the period of detention imposed on that child should not exceed that which the court would have imposed on an adult. While it is noted that the purpose of the section is to give consideration to the principle of equality of treatment between children in detention schools and adults in the prison system, considering the importance of the principle that detention should be a last resort for children, we recommend that this provision be amended to more closely reflect the spirit and wording of section 96 of the Children Act 2001. The amendment proposes that where a child is convicted of an offence and a period of detention is imposed on the child by a court, the period of detention shall not exceed the term of detention or imprisonment that the court could have imposed on a person of full age and capacity who is convicted of such an offence and may be less. It also proposes that the court shall have regard to the age, level of maturity, best interests of the child and the principle of imprisonment as a last resort in determining the nature of any penalty imposed. </p>
          <p eId="para_416"> Amendment No. 23 also refers to section 8 which provides that where a period of detention is greater than three years is imposed on a child, a court must give its reasons for doing so in open court. It should be noted that the original Children Act 2001 provision, before it was amended by the 2006 Act, contained an upper limit and did not permit a court to impose a sentence on a child in excess of three years. Therefore, we would suggest that the proposed provision under section 149(2) be amended. We make this submission in the light of recommendation No. 33 of the report of the strategic review group on penal policy, which was published in September 2014. The group recommended that in all cases where a custodial sentence is imposed by a court, the court shall set out its reasons in writing for so doing. The group further recommends that this requirement be incorporated in statute. As far back as February 2003, the Law Reform Commission also recommended that a District Court judge should be required to give concise written reasons for any decision to impose a custodial sentence on a child. The strategic review group considered whether this requirement would constitute a significant additional burden on the court but concluded that it would not. The obligation to provide reasons already exists and this recommendation simply requires that those reasons are recorded in writing. In cases where the liberty of a child is at stake it is even more imperative that there is clarity around the rationale for such a significant decision. Such a statutory provision would promote consistency in sentencing and bring clarity and transparency not just to the court but also to victims, offenders, legal practitioners and the public.</p>

          <p eId="para_417">I was a little confused about the placing of amendment No. 18. I contacted the Bill's Office to try to clarify the issue and will speak to the amendment as it is now. We are all agreed that detention should be a last resort for children and those involved in the juvenile justice system, including legislators, State agencies and members of the Judiciary, cannot lose sight of this fundamental principle. I support amendment No. 18 for that reason and look forward to the Minister's response to it. The amendment put forward by Sinn Féin more closely reflects the spirit and the wording of section 96(3) of the Children Act and of Article 42A in the Constitution, as approved by the Supreme Court and the internationally and domestically accepted principle of detention as a measure of last resort for children. Would Sinn Féin be willing to change the word "imprisonment" to "detention" and resubmit the amendment on Report Stage? I do not like the use of the word "imprisonment" in the context of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> On amendment No. 23, given the onus on the court to consider all non-custodial sanctions first and to impose a period of detention only as a measure of last resort, I agree that the court should have to account for its decision and its rationale in writing. Recommendation No. 33 of the strategic review group on penal policy of September last suggested that in all cases where a custodial sentence is imposed by a court, the court should set out its reasons in writing for doing so. The group further recommends that this requirement be incorporated in statute, which is what amendment No. 23 seeks to do. If this amendment is not accepted by the Minister today, I will revert with an amendment on Report Stage that will provide that the court should explain the reasons for its decision in open court in language that is appropriate to the child's age and level of understanding, which I believe is in keeping with the language referring to the remanding of children to detention in section 88(3) of the Children Act and with recognised principles of child-friendly justice such as the guidelines of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on child-friendly justice from 2010. I am very supportive of the principle behind the amendment but perhaps the wording could be re-examined.</p>

          <p eId="para_419">Amendment No. 18 proposes to insert the words "and may be less" to the substituted subsection 149(1) as provided for in section 8. The subsection already makes provision for this and the only limit being imposed by section 149(1) is that the period of detention imposed on a child by a court shall "not be more" than the period of detention or imprisonment that could be imposed on an adult. This does not mean that a lesser period of detention cannot be imposed on a child. In addition, section 96(4) of the Act, providing for the powers of the court <i>vis-à-vis </i>child offenders provides that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that which would be appropriate in the case of an adult who commits an offence of same kind and may be less. This Bill is not proposing to amend section 96(4) in any way. I do not consider that the words proposed are necessary as subsection (1) of section 149 already implicitly makes provision for a lesser period to be imposed on a child and I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> On the issue of adding the words, "The Court shall have regard to the age, level of maturity, best interests of the child and the principle of imprisonment as a last resort in determining the nature of any penalty imposed.”, these principles are already inherent in the Children Act 2001. Part 9 of the Act provides for the powers of courts <i>vis-à-vis </i>child offenders. In particular, section 96 provides for the principles relating to the exercise of criminal proceedings over children. Section 96(3) provides that a court may take into consideration as mitigating factors a child's age and level of maturity in determining the nature of any penalty imposed unless the penalty is fixed by law. Section 96(5) provides that when dealing with a child charged with an offence, a court shall have due regard to the child's best interests, the interests of the victim of the offence and the protection of society. This reflects that where criminal proceedings are at issue, the best interests of the child must be balanced with the interests of the society and the victim. Section 96(2) of the principal Act provides that a period of detention should be imposed only as a measure of last resort, which many Senators have argued, and I fully agree with that position. </p>
          <p eId="para_421"> Amendment No. 23 proposes to insert the word "any" into the substituted section 149(2) as provided for in section 8. Section 143(1) of the principal Act provides that the court shall not make an order imposing a period of detention on a child unless it is satisfied that detention is the only suitable way of dealing with the child and that a place in a children detention school is available for him or her. Section 143(2) provides that where an order is made under subsection (1) the court making the order shall give its reasons for doing so in open court. Section 143(2) is not limited to instances where the period of detention to be imposed by the court exceeds three years; it applies in all circumstances where a period of detention is imposed on a child. It should be noted that these matters, which fall under Part 9 of the Children Act, are matters within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality. We continue to have close co-operation on criminal justice matters relating to children. As the amendments proposed are already clearly provided for in the Act, I do not propose to accept them.</p>

          <p eId="para_426">This amendment is to section 155(6) of the Children Act 2001. The amendment proposes to give discretion to a director not to transfer a child who has ceased to engage in a course of education or training where the determination had been made by the director that the person might continue to be detained in a child detention school past their 18th birthday on the basis that they were engaged in a course of education or training. Section 155(5) provides that if a person is engaged in education or training or if the period of detention remaining is six months or less, the director may determine that the person can continue to be detained in the child detention school for a period not exceeding six months from the date of their 18th birthday where there is still a period of detention remaining in respect of that person after their 18th birthday.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> The purpose of the amendment is to enable the director to explore the option of a different course of education or training where a person has ceased to engage in a particular course of education or training. The amendment proposes to insert a reference to "may transfer" instead of "shall transfer" to allow the director to exercise his or her discretion where the question of a person continuing to be detained relates to their engagement in education or training. This is in the best interest of the child.</p>

In any public hearing where accusations are being levelled, whether in a court of law or a tribunal or other formal setting, an opportunity is always given to the accused to provide their side of the story. That is what we are looking for here, and I hope the Minister will accept the amendment. </p>

          <p eId="para_440">The Minister's comments are very reassuring. The penalty that is at stake here is the deprivation of liberty by loss of remission of up to 14 days. That is quite significant. It is very important that the child's voice is heard, in accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, that there be due process, and that the principles of natural justice are applied. I urge the Minister to ensure, in making the regulations, that the information given to the child is in language appropriate to his or her age and understanding. That should be explicitly stated in the regulations. Sometimes bureaucracy steps in and a child might end up getting a very formal letter. It should be clearly stipulated that any communication must be in language that is appropriate to the child's age and understanding.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_447">"(1A) Any child who breaches the rules of a children detention school may be disciplined on the instructions of the Director of the school in a way that is both reasonable, proportionate and within the prescribed limits.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_448">(1B) Without prejudice to the power of the Minister to prescribe limits for the disciplining of children detained in children detention schools, the following forms of discipline shall be prohibited—</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_452">(d) treatment that is cruel, inhuman or degrading.".</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Subsection 201(2) of the Children Act 2001 includes an important prohibition on certain forms of discipline, including corporal punishment or any form of physical violence, deprivation of food or drink, treatment that could reasonably be expected to be detrimental to physical, psychological or emotional well-being, and treatment that is cruel, inhumane or degrading. The most recent Health Information and Quality Authority report, published in February 2015, stated in regard to Oberstown: "The management of challenging behaviour was not consistently in line with best practice and single separation was used extensively and frequently for long periods of time." The report gave an example of a child who was locked in a room for 83 hours and 45 minutes over a four-day period, including sleeping hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> Given recent concerns expressed as to the management of challenging behaviour, particularly the use of single separation, it is unclear as to why this important provision, which prohibits certain treatment, has not been retained as part of the new section 201 of the 2001 Act. Section 17 of the Bill substitutes an alternative wording for section 201. While the permissible sanctions for breach of discipline continue to be set out in section 201A, as inserted by section 18 of the Bill, it would be prudent also to retain the express prohibitions on certain disciplinary sanctions in the legislation. Such matters are expressly prohibited under section 13 of the Prisons Act 2007, which relates to adults. We therefore submit that the original section 201 of the principal Act should be retained, with the addition of the word "proportionate".</p>

          <p eId="para_456">In the adult prison system, the issue of remission of sentences is linked to the system of formal discipline in place, given that remission is permitted on the basis of good behaviour. Accordingly, the introduction of a system of remission in children detention schools requires a more codified set of provisions on discipline in the schools covered by the Children Act 2001. Under the new system, the director will have discretion to inquire into an alleged breach of discipline by a child. A new section 201 to replace the existing section is proposed in the Bill. This section and the following sections, 201A, 201B, 201C and 201D, which are inserted by section 18, provide for the new disciplinary regime which is being introduced to support the introduction of a system of remission of detention in children detention schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> Section 201A(1) outlines the sanctions that will be permitted for a breach of discipline, namely, caution, reprimand, prohibition on certain recreational or other activities, forfeiture of pocket money, and forfeiture of not more than 14 days remission. I am advised that from a legal perspective, listing the sanctions that are prohibited, as in the current section 201(2) of the 2001 Act and as per the Senator's proposed amendment, could give rise to the view that any other undesirable sanction not on this list could be used in a children detention school. This would be an unintended consequence which is clearly to be avoided, as Senators will agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> While disciplinary provisions are included in the Bill, policy in this area still must have regard to the fact that children detention schools are not prisons and it is necessary to preserve the ethos of the child-focused model of detention. For this reason, a set of provisions governing the concept of good order will operate alongside a more codified system of discipline in these schools. Good order will relate to all the steps that may be undertaken by staff or management to reduce the escalation of - and, where possible, stop - instances of inappropriate behaviour by children in detention. It is preventative in nature in that the ultimate aim is to interrupt a pattern of inappropriate behaviour and prevent it from evolving into an actual breach of discipline which would result in the initiation of formal disciplinary procedures. In this sense, it relates to the concept of early intervention. It also includes the concept of promoting the learning by children of appropriate behaviour and the prevention through learning of future inappropriate behaviour. The consequences of a breach of good order by a child would include prompts from staff, informal warning, having a conversation with the child, and verbally suggesting to or instructing the child, for example, to leave a room or a place such as a sports pitch or go to a place such as the child's own room. This may be contrasted with the concept of discipline, which is more formal and will only be initiated at the discretion of a director of a children detention school.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> The system of good order will be outlined in rules to be adopted by the board of management under section 179 of the Children Act 2001 and regulations to be adopted by the Minister under section 221 of the Act. The director of a children detention school will have the discretion to initiate the proposed system of discipline in the event of repeated breach of good order rule by a child which escalates to a disciplinary matter. The proposed system of good order rules will be modelled closely on the care policies currently in place in children detention schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Taking all matters into consideration, I note the purpose of the Senator's amendment and intend to consider the matter further. I will consult the Attorney General's Office on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_468">Amendment No. 50 proposes an amendment to section 201B to take account of changes made to section 201A(1) before publication of the Bill. Prior to publication, section 201A(1) of the 2001 Act was revised to state to "the director may impose" instead of "the director shall impose", clearly offering more discretion. The existing wording of section 201B requiring a sanction to have been imposed for a child to petition the Minister is no longer appropriate. It is proposed, therefore, to amend the wording of section 201B(1) to make it consistent with a discretion of the director rather than an obligation of the director to impose a sanction in section 201A.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> Amendment No. 51 proposes an amendment to section 201B(2). In the published Bill, the existing provision refers to the Minister affirming, modifying, suspending or revoking the sanction only. I believe it should more appropriately refer to the actions that may be taken by the Minister in respect of the finding and sanction, as either of these may be the subject of a petition. The amendments proposed to section 201B(2) will provide that where the finding of the director is a subject of the petition, the Minister may affirm, modify or revoke the sanction. Where the sanction imposed by the director is the subject of the petition, the Minister may affirm, modify, suspend or revoke the sanction. The amendment to section 201B(2) would achieve what is proposed by amendment No. 52, that is, to insert "and/or finding" after "sanction". I do not propose, therefore, to accept amendment No. 52.</p>

          <p eId="para_470">I am disappointed to hear the Minister will not accept amendment No. 52. I will set out the rationale for it. I have listened to what the Minister has had to say. The new section 201B sets out a right of petition by the child to the Minister against either the finding or sanction or both. It is unclear why this petition is to the Minister rather than a child-friendly independent tribunal, for example, the Ombudsman for Children. While this is in line with the Prison Act 2007 in respect of adults, it does not take into account the potential vulnerability of children and the challenges that a formal petition process might pose for them. Given the remit of the Ombudsman for Children in respect of complaints of children in detention it seems that a right of petition to the Ombudsman for Children may be more appropriate than a right of petition to the Minister. Furthermore, it allows for the Minister to obtain additional material from the director but does not provide for any additional interaction with the child. While it allows the Minister to affirm, modify, suspend or revoke the sanction, it does not seem to allow the Minister to affirm, modify or suspend the finding. We suggest that the provision be amended by the addition of "and/or finding" in the second last line of the new section 201B.</p>

          <p eId="para_471">I support Senator David Cullinane. Consideration should be given to the remit of the Ombudsman for Children in respect of complaints for children in detention and I call on the Minister to give that consideration. It is a reasonable proposal. Moreover, I call on the Minister to give consideration to the fact that while detention schools are inspected annually by HIQA, the standards and criteria for children in detention schools have not been revised or updated since 2004. They were adopted in 2008. Given all that we are doing here, I recommend that the standards should be reviewed to ensure they adhere to models of best practice.</p>

          <p eId="para_474"> Senator David Cullinane raised a concern that the finding could be revoked as well. The advice I have is that this measure is not necessary, but perhaps I will discuss it further with the Department. I gather the Senator's contention is that not alone do we want to revoke the sanction, but also the finding because we do not believe the finding is accurate and correct. This appears to me, on the face of it, to be an issue of natural justice and I would have thought it should be included. I will discuss it with the Department and withhold our position on that issue.</p>
