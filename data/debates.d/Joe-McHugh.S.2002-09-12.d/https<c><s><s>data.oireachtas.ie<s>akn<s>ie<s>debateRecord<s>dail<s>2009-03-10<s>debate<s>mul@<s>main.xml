            <p eId="para_4">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">My Department currently has one item of legislation on the A list of the Government legislation programme — the Statute Law Revision Bill.  This is the latest element in the statute law revision project.  In preparation for the Bill, work has been completed on the analysis of local and personal Acts up to and including 1850 and private Acts up to and including 1750.  It is intended that the Bill dealing with those Acts will be published this session.</p>

            <p eId="para_6">In January, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, said she could introduce price controls on some goods if the differential was not passed on to customers.  The Taoiseach is aware that the Consumers Association of Ireland claimed the introduction of price controls would be a disaster, particularly in a recession.  It said the measure would allow all prices go to one level, usually the highest level.  Yesterday, Retail Excellence Ireland stated price controls were unworkable where so many products were involved.  The Tánaiste has commented that she may introduce price controls.  Is that a runner or is it something her Department intends to do?  Has the Tánaiste brought a proposal to Government in that regard?  Perhaps the Taoiseach would like to respond to this before I ask another question.</p>

            <p eId="para_15">Fine, no harm in trying.  In his contribution at the recent Ard-Fheis, the Taoiseach mentioned the creation of a central banking commission which would incorporate the responsibilities of the Central Bank and the supervision and regulatory functions of the Financial Regulator.  This is critical, given the extent of bad naming of our country abroad and the fact international markets have serious difficulty dealing with Ireland currently.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">Does the Taoiseach intend to bring forward this legislation quickly and does it involve the merging of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator?  Have the heads of the Bill been approved by Government yet?  In view of the critical need for this function with regard to this segment of the financial and regulatory institution system, when does the Taoiseach expect the Bill will be brought before the House?</p>

We saw further resignations from a financial institution today.  Everywhere one goes around the country, one is faced with small businesses and retailers who are unable to get lines of credit extended to them and jobs are being lost on a daily basis.  We do not have a currency of our own but are part of the eurozone and the euro.  Having examined the situation, does the Government intend to merge the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator?  Is that the essence of the proposed Bill?  Given the House will not sit next week, when does the Taoiseach expect it to come before the House?</p>

The issue is being given priority in the Department.  The idea is to set up a central banking commission that would incorporate Central Bank functions and the regulatory aspects of the Financial Regulator's work.  The consumer affairs aspect of the Financial Regulator's work would then be joined with the Office of the Financial Ombudsman.</p>

            <p eId="para_20">The question deals with the Taoiseach's legislative priorities for 2009.  Why is there so little proposed legislation from the Government, with only one piece of legislation to come from the Taoiseach's Department?  Last year we had 25 pieces of legislation enacted, the lowest number of enactments for the past decade.  We are now more than half way into the current Dáil session.  We were promised that some 18 pieces of legislation would be published this session, but only one of those, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Bill, has been published.</p>
            <p eId="para_21">Can the Taoiseach tell the House why the Government is bringing forward so little legislation?  Why are important pieces of legislation which many of us have been seeking, such as the legislation to regulate the operation of management companies which affect tens of thousands of tenants in private rented accommodation and people who have bought apartments, taking so long?  We have been seeking electronic surveillance legislation, which might assist in dealing with the crime problem.  We were promised we would have at least the heads of a civil unions Bill by this time last year.  What is delaying the legislation and why are Ministers so slow in bringing forward the legislation promised by this Government?</p>

            <p eId="para_22">Since this Government came into office on 14 June 2007, 43 Bills have been enacted.  Given that the previous Dáil brought forward a large amount of legislation, approximately 204 Bills, so there was not a large overhang of Bills on this Dáil.  To a great extent, the legislative programme of the previous Dáil was completed.  Therefore, much of the legislation coming before the House must be prepared and drafted during this Government's tenure rather than overhanging from previous Administrations.  Apart from the A list, there has been emergency legislation passed in this session by reason of necessity, including the pensions levy legislation, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act and the Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Act.  There was also non-emergency legislation which was not on the A list, such as the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  This morning we put forward the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which will be published as a result.  The legislation committee met last week and the Chief Whip is progressing much of the other legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_23">I am surprised the Taoiseach seems content with the legislative output of his Government.  By any standards it is poor.  Legislation on a number of issues is required.  It has been promised for a long time but is not coming through.  Given that there is only one, largely legalistic, piece of legislation to be dealt with by the Taoiseach's Department, I suggest he and his Department might assist with or take responsibility for bringing forward legislation where a number of Departments are involved.  One example is the legislation for dealing with management companies, which the Labour Party has been raising here for years.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">Many people purchased apartments for which the regime of management companies, responsible for the management of these areas, is a mess.  People who purchased apartments and people who are renting are in a legal limbo regarding the operation of management companies.  This is an increasing problem.  In some cases the original developer might have taken an active interest in the management of the apartment blocks but might no longer be on the scene because of the downturn in construction activity and in development work.  There is a major problem in this area.  We were told the difficulty in bringing forward that legislation is that three Departments are involved.  Where a number of Departments are involved in legislation I suggest the Taoiseach and his Department might take responsibility for bringing that legislation before the House.  Very little legislation is coming from the Government, yet there are key areas in which people are facing major problems but where the legislation to address them is not appearing.</p>

            <p eId="para_26">The legislation to which Deputy Gilmore referred specifically in his question is being drafted at present and it is hoped it will be ready for the next session.  It is very involved legislation and it has many aspects spanning many Departments which has added to its complexity.  I do not take away from the need to deal with it as urgently as possibly.  The assistant secretary of my Department has been helping to co-ordinate the matter and bring it all together in a single Bill.  The original problem was that there were so many issues to be addressed that they were being addressed by various Departments individually.  It was decided to try to pull all of this together and the Attorney General has been working on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">Apart from this, much time and activity in this session is being taken up by dealing with the economic crisis we face.  The preparation of a supplementary budget will take precedence over all other work in the coming weeks.  However, this is not to state that the legislative programme is not proceeding; it is.  A number of Bills had to be brought forward at very short notice which involved major issues and which were debated in the House.  This is by force of circumstance in terms of the issues arising from the financial crisis with which the Government must deal and contend.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">We have a voluntary system of industrial relations in this country.  Partnership has been the means by which consensus has been built up for legislation that would enhance conditions in the workplace and assist in the maintenance of orderly industrial relations that one would expect in this country, given the importance of harmony in the workplace and the wider social policy objectives set out in successive social partnership agreements.  They require us to continue advancing many issues which are raised on both sides of industry, either by management or trade unions, in an effort to regulate and meet the changes in practice and employment conditions and to try to provide better security for people in a way that need not affect our competitiveness as a country to maintain and create jobs, which is the purpose of much of the activity that goes on within social partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">Over the past 20 years, we have been able to show that a broadly balanced approach has brought benefits for both workers and owners of enterprises in a way that is now being challenged in the very difficult situation we face, due to the need to revisit these issues and think our way through them in a way that is consistent with social partnership principles.  That remains a continuing challenge.  I have earlier referred to the great difficulty that is emerging in trying to find a consensus between both sides of industry, something which the Government has been seeking to facilitate in some of this legislation.  Work is ongoing in that area.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_38">I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together.  The Government statement on transforming public services and the report of the task force on the public service were published in late November.  The statement sets out an ambitious programme of renewal for the entire public service and represents the next critical phase in the reform of our public services.  Implementation is being overseen by the Cabinet committee on transforming public services, which has met twice already.  The last meeting of the Cabinet committee took place on Wednesday, 4 March and the next meeting is scheduled to take place on Wednesday, 1 April.  The first meeting took place in early February.  The Cabinet committee will continue to meet regularly thereafter to ensure progress on the implementation of the commitments in transforming public services.</p>
            <p eId="para_39">I chair the Cabinet committee and its membership also includes the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and the Minister for Education and Science.  Other Ministers and Ministers of State will attend meetings as necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">The work of the Cabinet committee is being supported by the newly established programme office, which is based in my Department.  The programme office will support organisations across the public service in their efforts at transformation and will also support the Government in driving, co-ordinating and monitoring progress in implementation.  In addition, it will promote innovation and the piloting of new activities and identify areas for joint action by organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">The programme office has been established from within the existing financial and staff resources of my Department.  In addition, it will be supplemented by four secondees, one each from the four main sectors of the public service, namely, the local government, health, education and justice sectors.  The cost of these four individuals will be met by their parent organisations.  Its full complement of staff will be in place shortly.  No new resources will be used to implement the overall programme of change.  Instead, the resources required to implement the programme will come from within existing allocations, through reprioritising activities.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">Can the Taoiseach outline what recommendations made by the task force, arising from its consideration of the OECD report, have been implemented to date?  When is the special group on public service numbers and expenditure — commonly known as an bord snip nua or an bord slash — due to report?  How does it intend to report?  Will there be a complete or partial report and will it be published?  Is it a report solely for the Government or is it for public consumption?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_26">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_43">Regarding the second part of the question, the committee was established by the Minister for Finance to whom it reports on an ongoing basis.  It is in the process of examining areas of expenditure in various departmental Estimates and will proceed and report as it sees fit based on the work that it is progressing.  Such work is reported to the Minister for Finance who then brings matters to the attention of the Cabinet.  It is for the Cabinet to decide in what way any of the recommendations are to be implemented or what decisions are to be taken.  Such political decisions are taken by Cabinet, but the recommendations or the work of the committee on public service numbers will inform the recommendations of the Minister for Finance to Cabinet.</p>
            <p eId="para_44">I refer to the question regarding the progress made with the transforming public services programme.  The implementation structures have been established, namely, the Cabinet committee and the steering group, and the programme office has been established.  It is expected that the sectoral centres will also be up and running by the end of March.  A communication strategy has been agreed by the Cabinet committee, the implementation of which has commenced.  It includes a new website, a series of presentations and seminars and the production of sector specific and topic specific material.  The special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes is currently reviewing staff allocation on a Vote group by Vote group basis.  Thereafter, it is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">On organisational review programmes, the five organisations to be reviewed in 2009 have been identified and the process has commenced.  A public announcement on the matter will be made shortly.  On the value for money reviews, a new round of reviews was approved by Government in late 2008.  The 2009 reviews are under way.  They are due to commence in 12 Departments for completion by the end of this year.  Again, the matter is reported to the Minister for Finance in the first instance.  On shared services, groups have been established to drive forward shared services initiatives in respect of financial management, payroll, human resources, pensions, single point of contact telephone services and a common means assessment repository.  Again, this matter is to be dealt with by the Minister for Finance in the first instance.  On public procurement, the national operations unit based in the OPW has been established.  A progress report to Government on e-Government projects is also coming forward.  We have attempted to ensure the various recommendations under those headings are progressed.  We put the structures in place and we have made arrangements for work to commence and that is ongoing.</p>

A task force was then established by the Government to examine how to implement the OECD report.  The task force presented a report in November and arising from this a Cabinet committee was established to implement the task force report on implementing the OECD report.  There is also a programme office and a special group on numbers and expenditure.  All of this is about one thing.</p>

            <p eId="para_57">On the question of what progress the McCarthy committee has been making, we wanted an independent examination of staffing levels in all parts of the public service to identify those posts and activities which are not essential.  The group will consider proposals by the management of each public body to achieve the reduced payroll allocation made for this year.  Those recommendations will assist the Minister for Finance to identify economies which can be made in the immediate future.  The intention is to identify those posts and activities which are not essential and develop proposals for the redeployment of staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">The group began its work late last year and agreed its working methodology in December.  It is working on a Vote group basis and each Vote group has been asked to prepare an evaluation paper for the group in advance of meeting the group.  The relevant Vote sections are preparing material for the group's consideration.  The group has met eight Departments and is meeting the defence and foreign affairs Vote groups on Wednesday, 11 March.  It has received evaluation reports from 11 Departments as well as papers from the relevant Vote sections in the Department of Finance.The eight Departments with which it has met are the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Transport, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach.  Under its terms of reference, the committee is required to report to the Minister for Finance by the end of June and it is on course to do so.  The group is free to provide comments or reports on spending issues before that if it so wishes and these can be taken into account by the Minister for Finance and the Government as appropriate.</p>

With regard to his second question, I indicated on the day the pension levy was introduced that we were prepared to listen to proposals, but they would have to be on the basis that the €1.4 billion would still be obtained.  Unfortunately, no such proposals were forthcoming.  The levy is an imposition, obviously, but one must consider it as part of the full mandatory deductions, including PRSI, income tax, and health or income levies.  If we consider this total picture, including the imposition of the pension levy, we will see that an unmarried person on a salary of €20,000 would have total deductions of 11%, while a person on more than €100,000 would have deductions of more than 43%.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">People recognise the scale of the economic problems we face and they are willing to contribute.  The Taoiseach will understand this because he has met many people from around the country.  They are saying they will contribute their share on two conditions: first, that the contribution will actually go towards sorting out the problem; and second, that it is seen to be fair.</p>
            <p eId="para_71">Patently, the social partnership and trade unions in particular consider the pension levy to be unfair.  They have made the point that dealing with it in isolation does not bring the sense of fairness about which they speak.  As a consequence, social injustice is perceived to exist.  Clearly there are opportunities for others who are not caught in this situation to make contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_72">Does the Taoiseach believe that the pension levy passed by the Government is fair?  Does he intend to reconsider it in the context of the budget which will be announced in early April in order to deal with the perception of unfairness which exists among so many people?  Perhaps he will comment on whether the question of unfairness as a consequence of the pension levy will be addressed in his proposals to the House on the new budget.  I do not know whether ICTU members will decide to take to the streets but if the Taoiseach deals with the perception of unfairness or states his intention of doing so he might prevent a lot of activity on the streets at the end of the month.  Does he feel that the pension levy is fair and does he intend to use the budget to be announced in April to address the outrage that has arisen due to the perception that it is unfair?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_74">The question of the pension levy formed a major part of the €2 billion in necessary savings which were agreed within the framework of social partnership.  The alternatives were to consider social welfare provisions or non-pay, non-social welfare current expenditure.  We had to seek savings from non-pay, non-social welfare current expenditure of more than €300 million in addition to the €1.4 billion from the pension levy and a further €300 million in capital savings.  Everyone understood and agreed that immediate savings had to be found.  If everyone agrees that was the amount to be found, one has to make an alternative proposal on what part of the service provision or social welfare provision the Deputy considers it fairer to reduce in order to deal with what he regards as unfairness.  Every additional imposition presents a difficulty from somebody's point of view.  An attempt was made to portray this as a simple initiative taken in isolation but it is part of a wider process of adjustment which has to take place and, indeed, a requirement that is all the greater given the deterioration in the public finances since its announcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">As a public service employer, the reason we had to consider the pensions aspect and seek a larger contribution towards the availability of a public service pension after retirement is because it represents a significant asset compared to what those in the private sector now have available to them given the serious deterioration and, in some cases, the extinction of pensions for which they have paid.  The economic costs of these private sector pensions have been met in full.  It is well recognised and not disputed that the full cost of providing a public service pension would be a far greater imposition than what we have now decided upon.  This simply represents an increased contribution as distinct from seeking the full economic costs of the pension, which would be the requirement of a private pension provision.  These are important distinctions and the advantage now resides with public service workers in a way that is not available to private sector workers.  Apart from that there is a greater degree of job security for those in the public sector and that is an important aspect given the many job losses we are seeing in the private sector as a result of the change in the market place and the reduction in demand for goods and services on an ongoing basis.  It is in that context that the question of fairness must be discussed.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">One does not expect a unanimous outcome to that debate but there must be an objective analysis of the difficult choices available to Government as to where the savings could be found and who could best provide them in terms of the benefits that accrue with employment in the public service <i>vis-à-vis</i> social welfare allowances, the money that goes to providing health services and the day to day costs of providing materials, goods and services necessary for services for the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_77">If one were to look at it in that way, perhaps one would see the Government's decisions in this matter were grounded in trying to be fair in all circumstances, recognising that any extra imposition is regarded by anyone when it is not universal as being more unfair on them than on others.</p>
            <p eId="para_78">There are considerations in that area that must be articulated so that people will understand the motivation behind the necessity for this €2 billion expenditure measure and the fact that it is the first of many adjustments that will have to be made, both in terms of expenditure and taxation in the months and years ahead as we try to ensure the economic viability of the State is maintained.</p>

            <p eId="para_79">An mbeidh athruithe ar bith don cháin seo?  Will there be any amendment to this so-called public service pension levy?  I mo thuairim, ní tobhach é ach cáin ar sheirbhís phoiblí, it is not a levy but a tax on public service.  Ar éist an Rialtas leis na ceardchumainn agus na daoine eile atá i gcoinne na cánach seo?  Does the Taoiseach agree that people in the public service are willing to pay their fair share as long as the burden of taxation is fairly placed on all who can pay, and I emphasis the words "can pay"?  Mar cheist dheireanach, cé nach cáin chothrom í seo, would the Taoiseach be willing to sit down with the trade unions to find a more effective and fairer way to raise money to meet the State's current straitened economic situation?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_80">The Government made efforts to bring forward necessary measures.  For the supplementary budget, we have made it clear that we are available to take any constructive ideas from anyone, including people inside and outside this House, on how best to address the serious issues confronting us at present.  None of it will be painless and none of it will be immediately popular but it is necessary and it is the duty of Government to discharge that responsibility and I look forward to people on the other side of the House constructively contributing to that if they so wish.</p>
            <p eId="para_81">Deputy Ó Caoláin refers to the pension levy as a tax on public service.  It is not intended as a tax on public service, it is the imposition of a further contribution well short of the economic cost of a public service pension which is being sought from those who work in the public service and will have the benefit of that pension after their working life is over.  That is an asset or benefit that is not available to many hundreds of thousands of workers in other sectors of the economy, some of whom have sought to prepare for retirement by providing the full economic cost of a supplementary pension that will not now be available to them because of the serious deterioration of pension fund values, one of the main casualties of the recent crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_82">We do have a fair and progressive tax system in this country and the levy is in keeping with that principle.  Working examples concerning actual pay demonstrate that, as a rule, total deductions as a percentage of gross pay after the pension contribution are greater for those on higher rates of pay than lower ones.  For example, an executive officer on the first point of the pay scale, €32,179, who joined after 1995 will have a total deduction of 22% of gross pay; whereas an assistant principal, also on the first point of the pay scale at €69,659, who joined after 1995, will have a total deduction of 38% of gross pay, when one takes everything into account.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">The progressive trend is also observed in examples of pre-1995 civil servants.  An executive officer on the first point of scale at €30,566, will have a total deduction of 18% of gross pay; whereas an assistant principal, also on the first point of the scale at €66,179, will have a total deduction of 33% of gross pay.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">Across the Civil Service on all grades and all pay scales, from clerical officer to principal officer, the total deductions are higher as a percentage of gross pay as the pay goes higher.  That is a progressive principle.</p>

            <p eId="para_86">The amount due in respect of the insurance payment for <i>Asgard II </i>is €3.8 million.  As the Deputy will be aware, I have accepted the unanimous recommendation of the board of Coiste an Asgard not to proceed with a salvage operation.  The main reason for that decision was that I considered that the risks were too great to commit to spending a sum in the region of €2 million at this time on a salvage effort where the outcome is uncertain.  I also had to consider the cost of restoration, which cannot be accurately assessed until after the vessel is raised. </p>
            <p eId="para_87">I have also stated that I propose to replace <i>Asgard II </i>with a new steel-hulled vessel.  The cost of building such a vessel is not known at this stage.  However, arrangements are under way to provide a limited cruise programme on the <i>Creidne</i> during the summer months this year.  This vessel was used by Coiste an Asgard for sail training prior to <i>Asgard II</i>.  It is now under the control of the Naval Service.  A programme of extensive refurbishment of the <i>Creidne</i> is nearing completion and the vessel is expected to be available by May.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">Coiste an Asgard has also entered into an arrangement whereby it will arrange for a number of Irish trainees to undergo sail training on board the Norwegian sail training vessel <i>Christian Radich</i> during the tall ships race.</p>

            <p eId="para_89">Is the Minister aware of comments made by the former captain of the <i>Asgard</i>, Captain Newport?  He said he believed that the <i>Asgard</i> could be salvaged, repaired and hopefully restored as a sail training vessel.  Is the Minister also aware of similar observations by the <i>Asgard’s</i> crew?  In addition, a person who was there at the time of the last survey felt the ship was in sufficient shape to be salvaged.  Does the Minister reject the claims by Captain Newport who questioned the competency of the board of Coiste an Asgard to make such a decision?  Does the Minister agree with Captain Newport that there is an obligation on the Government to remove the vessel from French waters?</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_90">I have not spoken personally to Captain Newport but I am aware of his comments.  I want to take this opportunity to compliment him again on the wonderful job he did at the time the boat unfortunately sank in the Bay of Biscay.  I am also aware of the crew's comments.  My advice, however, is that despite those comments it was uncertain what condition the <i>Asgard</i> would be in if we salvaged it.  There is no hard evidence available to me that the vessel would be repairable or that it would not be irrevocably damaged during the course of a salvage operation.  That is the scientific and engineering advice I have received.  The people who undertook the ROV survey were in no position to give a clear yes or no on that question.  All they could tell us was the position of the <i>Asgard</i>.  They confirmed that the vessel was in an upright position, but they were not able to confirm that it would have survived a salvage operation and that it would be repairable for a reasonable cost if salvaged.  In the current economic circumstances in particular, I could not afford to take the risk of blowing €2 million of taxpayers’ money on what could be a futile operation.  </p>
            <p eId="para_91">As regards the competency of the board of Coiste an Asgard, there are many excellent people on the board.  Many of them have extensive experience in these matters and they also have advice available to them if and when they need it.  Therefore I must take seriously what they say.  The board's recommendation was unanimous — that it would be too risky to proceed with the salvage.</p>

Has it been abandoned or is it still in our ownership?  Is there anything to prevent some other country or group from salvaging the ship?  Are they free to do so now?  If the Minister has decided to abandon the <i>Asgard</i> for the reasons he outlined, does he not think he should give another group or country access in order to salvage the vessel and restore it as a sail training ship?</p>

            <p eId="para_93">The answer to Deputy Deenihan's last question is that the vessel is still owned by the Department of Defence.  As regards giving a salvage opportunity to others, I already said in my initial announcement that a number of people have been in touch with my Department and have written to newspapers to say they would be willing to make a contribution towards salvaging the <i>Asgard</i>.  I intend to put a system in place through the board of Coiste an Asgard to facilitate them should they so wish. </p>
            <p eId="para_94">It has not been communicated to me that we have any obligation to remove the vessel.  However, I am putting a system in place whereby people can make a voluntary contribution if they wish.  If the contributions are sufficiently high we could possibly top them up.

          the contingency measures that have been put in place for the protection of members of the Irish Defence Forces on duty with EUFOR in Chad and due to remain as part of the UN mission in view of the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court for the President of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, on charges of war crimes and five counts of crimes against humanity, and the resulting demonstrations in favour of Bashir amid criticism of western countries for their support of the warrant; his views on whether the risks to the safety of members of the Defence Forces on duty in neighbouring Chad have increased; if he has been in contact with other states with EUFOR soldiers in the Chad region over rising tensions there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_56" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_99">I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 47 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_100">The mandate of the European Union military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR TCHAD/RCA, established under the authority of United Nations Security Council resolution 1778 (2007), is due to expire on 15 March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">Ireland is the second largest contributor to the mission with 439 Defence Forces personnel.  The aim of the mission is to protect civilians in danger, particularly refugees and internally displaced persons or IDPs, facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and protect UN personnel and equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_102">As the humanitarian and security situation in eastern Chad will clearly continue to warrant an international presence beyond March 2009, the Security Council unanimously adopted Security Council resolution 1861 (2009) on 14 January 2009.  This resolution authorised the deployment of a military component of the United Nations mission in the Central African Republic and Chad, MINURCAT, to follow on from the EUFOR mission at the end of its mandate.</p>
            <p eId="para_103">Following consideration of a request from the United Nations on 5 March 2009, Dáil Éireann approved the transfer of command of the Irish contingent currently serving in Chad with EUFOR TCHAD/RCA to the United Nations mission in the Central African Republic and Chad, MINURCAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_104">The Defence Forces contribution will be similar in size and nature to Ireland's existing contribution to EUFOR.  The nature of the Irish battalion's duties with MINURCAT will be similar to its duties with EUFOR, which include, <i>inter alia</i>, short and long-range patrolling, situational awareness and providing an overall security and deterrent presence within its area of operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_105">As the House will be aware, the International Criminal Court, ICC, issued a warrant on 4 March 2009 for the arrest of Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir, president of Sudan, for war crimes and crimes against humanity.  This is the first warrant of arrest ever issued for a sitting Head of State by the International Criminal Court.  Since its issue, there are fears the Sudanese reaction against the international community could include giving fresh support to Chadian rebel groups.  Any such actions could have serious consequences for the large refugee population in eastern Chad, many of whom have fled from the conflict in Darfur.</p>
            <p eId="para_106">The security situation in Chad and neighbouring Sudan is kept under constant review by the Defence Forces.  Prior to the indictment of the Sudanese President, al-Bashir, by the International Criminal Court, a specific threat assessment review was conducted on the possible effects for the 99th Infantry Battalion serving in Chad.  It is assessed that the overall threat has not changed and remains at medium.  The Defence Forces are in constant contact with their EUFOR partners in the theatre of operations and with operational headquarters in Paris which all concur with the current Defence Forces' assessment.  Indication for any change to the security situation is being monitored by both the Defence Forces and EUFOR's operational headquarters.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">The detailed threat assessment and reconnaissance undertaken informs decisions regarding the configuration of the contingent and its armaments and protection.  In the case of the current EUFOR mission, the Defence Forces have deployed a full range of force protection assets, including 18 MOWAG armoured personnel carriers, four close reconnaissance vehicles and indirect fire capabilities, such as mortars.  Together, these provide the necessary armoured protection, mobility, firepower and communications.  This will also be the case when Irish personnel transfer to MINURCAT.  The MOWAG armoured personnel carriers deployed were also deployed with the Defence Forces when they served with UNMIL in Liberia and UNIFIL in Lebanon, where they performed effectively.  The Defence Forces have also deployed a suite of robust tactical communications systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">Concerning the security situation, there has been a noticeable decline in incidents of banditry in the Irish-led multinational battalion south's area of operations during January 2009, compared to December 2008.  A significant redeployment of Chadian forces in the general area has added to the security and has assisted the reduction of banditry against the local population.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">The UN follow-on force, which will take over from EUFOR on 15 March 2009, is expected to have a wider deployment in eastern Chad so as to further deter armed and criminal elements.  MINURCAT will act under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which means the force will be authorised to take all necessary measures in its capabilities and its area of operations in eastern Chad to fulfil its mandate.</p>
            <p eId="para_110">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">The UN follow-on force is the first example of a transfer of authority between the EU and the UN.  Arrangements in this regard are progressing well.  There is excellent co-operation between the UN and EUFOR and it is expected that there will be no security gap in the transition from EUFOR to MINURCAT.  Negotiations with the Government of Chad on the hand-over of EUFOR assets to the UN were very prolonged and detailed, but these had now been finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">I wish success to the Irish personnel transferring over to the new UN mission.  I know the Defence Forces will continue to acquit themselves well, and will make a vital and important contribution to the success of MINURCAT, as they have done on so many occasions in the past.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianOShea" eId="spk_57">
            <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_113">I am relieved to hear the overall threat assessment is medium.  That is an encouraging development but, as the situation needs to be kept under constant review, there may be changes to this status.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">With up to 13 NGOs having been expelled, a disastrous situation has emerged in Darfur with, for example, Médecins Sans Frontières, MSF, being forced to leave while dealing with two meningitis outbreaks.  Will many more refugees begin to cross the border from Darfur and Sudan to eastern Chad?  Is there any evidence that the Chadian rebels may be receiving new assistance from Sudan?  What impact will the approaching rainy season have on the situation, which I understand is three months away?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_58" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_115">As I indicated in my reply, it was felt that the issue of the arrest warrant against the Sudanese President, al-Bashir, would result in a renewed effort on the part of the Sudanese Government to further support the rebels attacking Chad and trying to undermine the Chadian regime.  There is no evidence that this has happened to date.  If it were to happen, it would have profound consequences, as the Deputy rightly anticipates, for the refugees.  It will mean more refugees in already overcrowded camps, which I saw myself on a recent visit to the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_116">To a certain extent, we have been the victims of our own success because the security brought about by the EUFOR force has encouraged more refugees and internally displaced persons to come to its camps which are run in a fairly disciplinarian manner.  The threat remains live.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">The initial action taken as a result of the issue of the arrest warrant was the expulsion of a large number of NGOs from Sudan.  Several Irish NGOs on the ground in Sudan, with which we have been in touch, have not been affected to date.  Their working environment, however, is becoming progressively more difficult and tense.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">Paradoxically, the rainy season, which is not due for three months, tends to minimise rebel activities.  Rebel movements across the border, operating to destabilise the Chadian regime, are severely restricted during the rainy season.  There tends to be a lull during the season with groups rearming and reorganising.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">I have not seen any evidence of further support from the Sudanese Government to the rebel groups.  Last November, however, several rebel groups came together in an unified organisation which has created tension between Sudan and Chad with the Chadian President blaming Sudan for facilitating this development.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">While it is a case of "so far, so good" and the threat has been assessed as medium, the situation is quite tense and we are keeping it under constant review.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_59">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_121">According to today's <i>The New York Times</i>, the American embassy in the Sudan is allowing a large number of its staff leave the country.  Embassies beginning to move staff out of countries is a serious development.  Of the 85 NGOs operating in the Sudan, up to 16 have been expelled by the Sudanese President with threats to the others.  If the peacekeepers were moved from Darfur, it could lead to the internal displacement and the movement of millions into Chad.  Is the Minister confident that EUFOR will have the capacity to handle such a doomsday situation if this were to happen?  If it does not have the resources, what will the Minister do to ensure it has adequate resources?  Has he contacted the other countries involved in the mission?  Initially, Lieutenant General Pat Nash was concerned about the Defence Forces’ equipment for the mission?  Does the Minister believe they are sufficiently equipped to face this highly possible doomsday scenario?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_60" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_122">I was not aware of the news concerning the American embassy in Sudan.  I must point out to the Deputy the peacekeeping force is in Chad.  I agree there is the possibility that, if the Sudan disintegrates or intensifies its support for the rebel groups, more refugees will be created.  We do not know how many and over what a timescale.  The situation is, however, being constantly monitored.</p>
            <p eId="para_123">The military component of the EUFOR mission consisted of 3,400 troops who, it is commonly agreed, did a tremendous job in providing a sense of security in the area, particularly in the refugee camps, and allowing some internally displaced people to return home.  The military element of the MINURCAT mission will be expanded to 5,200 troops with a number of police and military liaison officers.  We are anticipating a potentially worse situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_124">We are in constant contact with both the UN and our fellow members in MINURCAT about the situation on the ground.  It is reviewed on a daily basis as it evolves.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianOShea" eId="spk_61">
            <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_125">I take the point about restricted movement during the rainy season.  In the intervening three months, does the Minister envisage the withdrawal of the Irish or UN contingent from Chad?  As matters stand, such a withdrawal is not a direct possibility.  However, has a military assessment been carried out with regard to what would happen if our troops were placed at risk as a result of a serious deterioration in circumstances?  Did the Minister discuss this matter with the Chief of Staff?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_62">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_126">Are the logistics in place to move our mission in the event of a doomsday situation?  Is the Minister confident of our troops' safety in the event of a large movement of people from Darfur into Chad should what is being threatened by President al-Bashir come to pass?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_63" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_127">There are a number of aspects to this matter.  The increase in the price of oil last year enabled the Government of Chad to build up its defence assets.  In that context, it has acquired a number of substantial air assets and also appears to have improved its military capabilities.  The Government of Chad has placed troops in an area adjacent to the Sudanese border in order to prevent rebel movements across the frontier.  This has nothing to do with us, as such, but it has certainly improved the security situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">I do not envisage a United Nations withdrawal over the next three months.  I discussed the position of our troops with the Chief of Staff, and we are open to all possibilities and are examining all contingencies.  However, I spoke to representatives of local communities in Chad and the governor of Goz Beida — whom I met for a detailed briefing — in addition to our troops and commanders from other countries during my recent visit and I do not envisage a doomsday scenario arising.  The possibility of Ireland or the United Nations' force as a whole withdrawing at any time in the near future is seen as extremely remote.</p>

        <b>Minister for Defence</b>
          if work will commence in 2009 on renovating and converting C house, Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin, to single officers quarters in order to alleviate the situation of officers forced to live in steel containers at that barracks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_64" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_130">The position is unchanged since I previously addressed this issue in reply to Question No. 111 of 4 February 2009.  Some 20 containerised accommodation units have been provided for temporary accommodation for third level students at Cathal Brugha Barracks.  These units consist of en suite accommodation and are fully furnished and heated.  The military authorities advise that the units are compliant with all relevant regulations and are similar to units used for accommodating troops on some missions overseas.  The accommodation in question is currently occupied by officers of the Defence Forces who are attending college on a full-time basis in the Dublin area.  It is only used during term-time, with the relevant officers returning to their home bases during holiday periods.  These officers are not charged for this accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">The officers were previously accommodated at the Curragh and Gormanstown Camps and transported by bus by the military to college in Dublin.  They found that this arrangement did not allow them to participate fully in all college activities and asked to be accommodated closer to college.  The most immediate way of providing this accommodation was through the provision of temporary containerised accommodation units.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">The requirement for more permanent living-in accommodation at Cathal Brugha Barracks is being considered as part of overall Defence Force requirements.  A study into single living-in accommodation across all of the Defence Forces, with a view to defining the major priority areas for provision and refurbishment, is ongoing.  Given that the current requirement at Cathal Brugha Barracks arises as a result of university attendance, it may be the case that there will actually be no requirement for additional accommodation at the barracks in the long term.  This must be factored into our consideration, particularly in light of the cost of constructing permanent accommodation blocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_133">The provision of any accommodation required will be undertaken in the context of the overall Defence Force infrastructure development programme.  This will be implemented as part of the ongoing capital programme in my Department.  Projects in this programme are prioritised in respect of addressing the Defence Forces' operational requirements, taking into account the annual capital allocation for the ongoing building programme.  In light of the current set of priorities, it is unlikely that this project will commence during the current year.  Should the current allocation change, the building programme will be reviewed and projects in the programme will be prioritised on a needs basis.</p>

          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_65">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_134">I visited Cathal Brugha Barracks and saw the containers in question.  I do not agree with the Minister's assertion that they are comfortable and suitable for officers trying to study for examinations.  It is unfair to state that these are the type of containers used on foreign missions.  There is a major difference between soldiers operating on foreign missions and those at home trying to study.  What is happening is completely unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_135">On my trip to the barracks, I visited C house and was surprised to discover that extensive renovations and repairs have been carried out there.  In that context, a new roof has been put in place and new windows have been fitted.  I am convinced that the money used to pay for the containers would have been sufficient to complete the works being carried out in respect of C house and make it suitable as living quarters.  What is the cost relating to the provision of these containers?  Is the Minister in a position to provide a figure with regard to the cost of completing the renovation of C house?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_66" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_136">As already stated, the officers who are pursuing their studies and who are accommodated in these containers were originally based further afield and were being transported to college by bus.  These individuals wanted to be based closer to college and were given the choice to move to their current accommodation.  I accept that it is not an ideal situation.  Nevertheless, we must consider the overall position.  It may be the case that this is only a temporary arrangement and there may be no need for further extensive capital works at Cathal Brugha Barracks.  If there is a need for such works, they may not attract the same priority as that attaching to projects which are slated to proceed this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">I do not have the precise cost relating to the provision of the containers to hand.  However, I will communicate further with the Deputy on the matter.  I understand that completing the refurbishment of C house would cost in the region of €1.6 million.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_67">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_138">As the Minister is aware, those in the Army will do what the Minister asks of them.  In that context, if young officers such as those to whom I refer are asked to live in containers, they will do so.  The figures I possess do not indicate that €1.6 million would be required to complete the refurbishment of C house, or an adequate portion of it, to enable the officers in question to be accommodated there.  It struck me that C house could be refurbished for a considerably smaller sum of money.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">What was the exact cost of providing the containers?  It is amazing that the Minister does not have the figures in that regard to hand.  In the review of accommodation at barracks nationwide, I hope special priority will be given to removing the containers at Cathal Brugha Barracks as soon as possible.  In my view, these containers are an embarrassment to the Defence Forces.</p>

            <p eId="para_142">I will provide the Deputy with the precise figure so that there will be no confusion.  The Army did not ask anyone to occupy containers.  The officers in question decided it would be better for them to be accommodated nearer to the college at which they are studying.  They were informed that accommodation such as that available at Gormanstown or the Curragh would not be available and that they would be obliged to avail of the temporary accommodation on offer in the form of these containers.  Those in question opted to occupy the containers.  I did not ask them to do so, nor did I insist that they should do so.  The Army was prepared to continue to transport them to college by bus, if that was what they desired.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_144">I am pleased to dispel any confusion that might exist with regard to the review of the Defence Forces medical services currently being completed by PA Consulting.  The normal process for consultancy of this nature is being followed.  The consultants are formulating proposals based on an analysis of data and from their interviews and meetings with the various stakeholders.  In the normal course, the basis on which these proposals are based is validated.  As part of the quality assurance of the report, for example, a workshop was undertaken with the representative associations, PDFORRA and RACO.  This workshop identified a number of areas in the report requiring further assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_145">PA Consulting sent further elements of the report to my Department as part of this quality assurance process.  This was received on 15 December 2008 and may be the material to which the Deputy is referring in his question.  There is nothing unusual in the review and quality assurance process undertaken on the material delivered.  This is explicitly catered for in the tender document.  Any interaction between my Department and PA Consulting has centred on ensuring the report is comprehensive, meets the requirements as detailed in the contract and can stand up to robust examination of its assessments and recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_146">The delay in completion of this report may also have added to the confusion.  The report was scheduled for completion before the end of 2008.  I have been disappointed that the schedule I outlined in the House has not been met.  My officials, the Defence Forces and PA Consulting are aware of my view that this report should be completed quickly.  At the same time, a focus should be also kept on ensuring the report provides the blueprint for the sustainable provision of the medical input required by the Defence Forces.  On receipt of the report and following consideration of the recommendations, I intend to publish the report and engage with all of the key stakeholders on the way ahead.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_147">Who is at fault for the delay in finalising the report?  Is it due to issues the Department had with the report or is it due to the consultants?  As I asked in the question, and the Minister did not reply, was there a penalty clause for the report being late?  It is most important that the Defence Forces are serviced by a proper medical corps.  Both the PwC report in the 1990s and the first White Paper strongly recommended that there should be an establishment of 46 in the medical corps.  At present, there are only 23.  Missions such as the Chad mission are very demanding physically on our troops, both in terms of preparing them for the mission and when they are in the battle theatre.  There is also the issue of the general health of our military personnel and the fact that there is a very high absentee rate in the Irish Defence Forces, compared with the rate in other countries.  That is attributable to the fact that there is a deficiency in numbers in the medical corps.  This is a matter of supreme urgency.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_148">Deputy Deenihan is correct that the establishment is 46 but the number of doctors employed in the Army at present is 24.  That is not to say the Army is only getting half the medical attention it requires.  The lacuna is made up by employing private medical practitioners.  Successive Ministers have made valiant efforts over the years to ensure the medical corps reaches its establishment level.  Unfortunately, our efforts have not met with success, which is why we decided to bring in consultants to advise us on how to proceed.  We have taken various measures such as, for example, renegotiating the salaries of Army doctors, recruitment campaigns and so forth but, to date, those efforts have not borne the requisite fruit.</p>
            <p eId="para_149">In response to Deputy Deenihan's query about a penalty clause, the answer is "No"; there is no penalty clause.  Rather than discuss questions of fault I prefer to get the matter right.  The consultants were initially brought in last July.  As part of the process they had to consult a number of key stakeholders.  They found it difficult to do that during the holiday period of July and August so there was a delay.  They presented an initial report to the Department on 15 December last.  The material in that report was not directly released to the representative organisations but the basis on which the report was arrived at and some of its conclusions and recommendations were discussed with them.  Everybody decided, including the Department and the representative organisations, that the consultants would have to work again on the matter on the basis that a number of items were not referred to and there was a problem with the clarity of some of the recommendations and with the clarity of the language.  We are a little behind schedule but it is very important that we get this right.</p>

            <p eId="para_153">No, we have already examined that, as did successive Ministers.  This is a problem that has bedevilled the Army for years through successive Administrations.  None of us has managed to sort it out.  Consider the number of doctors retiring over the years and the number we can get to replace them.  Of the 24 doctors we have at present, eight of them are foreign nationals.  There is nothing wrong with that, of course, but it illustrates the difficulties we have.  We are trying to get it right.  It is important that we do that and get the most comprehensive consultants' report possible.  I expect to have that within the next few weeks.</p>

        <b>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</b>
        asked the 
        <b>Minister for Defence</b>
          the discussions he has had with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in regard to the increased number of hoax call-outs in 2008 to deal with suspect explosive devices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_78" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_156">The primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order rests with An Garda Síochána.  The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, ATCP, assist the Garda as required.  Requests for aid to the civil power are normally made by a member of An Garda Síochána not below the rank of Inspector.  The explosive ordnance disposal, EOD, team responds when a request is made by An Garda Síochána to the relevant brigade, for assistance in dealing with a suspect device or for the removal of old ordnance.</p>
            <p eId="para_157">The devices that the Defence Forces encounter in these situations include viable improvised explosive devices, IEDs, which have all the components of a bomb and are set to detonate, and elaborate hoaxes where a device is made to look as if it could explode.  The Defence Forces EOD team is required to treat all suspect devices as real until the EOD officer confirms the nature of the suspect device.  The determination as to whether a suspect device is viable or hoax can be made only following detailed inspection by the EOD officer.  When the EOD team is satisfied the suspect device has been rendered safe, the remains of the device are handed over to An Garda Síochána for forensic examination and investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_158">There are well established channels of consultation and co-operation between representatives of the Defence Forces and An Garda Síochána.  These consultations take the form of meetings, discussions, briefings and technical analysis. I have also discussed the situation on a number of occasions informally with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  EOD operations are discussed at regular meetings of the improvised explosive device, IED, working group.  The Defence Forces also liaise with An Garda Síochána in the technical analysis of evidence recovered from EOD operations.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianOShea" eId="spk_79">
            <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_159">The figures on call-outs of the EOD team are quite alarming.  The number of call-outs in 2007 was 98, while last year it was 180.  The number of hoaxes has increased by 500%, and is now one in three.  The EOD team is called out on hoax calls.  Obviously, the Army must respond to requests from the civil power but this is a large waste of resources.  Where is this increase originating?  There have been reports that ex-IRA people are assisting criminal elements in producing bombs.  Given what has happened in Northern Ireland in the past few days, with the tragic death of two soldiers, the wounding of civilians and the death of the policeman last night, are there wider security issues of which we should be cognisant?</p>
            <p eId="para_160">Up to 27 January this year there were four call-outs, one of which was a hoax.  Does the Minister have the up-to-date figure?  I feel that something is going on and it needs to be addressed.  I take the point that the Garda is responsible for law and order but my concern is that there is a wider agenda that could be going further down the road in terms of undermining the State.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_80" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_161">Not to put too fine a point on it, I agree with Deputy O'Shea that the recent trend has been quite alarming.  In 2006, there were 101 call-outs, eight of which were hoaxes.  The figures for 2007 were 98 and 11, respectively.  In 2008, there were 180 call-outs, 58 of which turned out to be hoaxes.  I have the up-to-date figures to 5 March.  There were 32 call-outs, which seems to be a repeat of the pattern last year, and the number of hoaxes was ten, which, again, at approximately one in three is a repeat of last year's pattern.  That is worrying.</p>
            <p eId="para_162">The explosives ordinance team gets the request from the Garda and it has to act on it.  There is a difference between hoax calls and calls to hoax devices.  The fire service receives hoax calls but the calls received by the explosives ordinance team are from the Garda Síochána to investigate a device.  A pattern is evident but as to who appears to be behind it or to what it is linked, that is a matter for the Garda Síochána.  We simply respond to requests from it.</p>

            <p eId="para_163">I accept what the Minister said but there needs to be more urgency and focus to deal with the situation than the Minister has indicated.  This is an unwelcome developing trend.  I accept what the Minister said that those are not hoax call-outs in the sense that it is the Garda who make the calls.  There appears to be a deliberate pattern.  On the other hand, however, the hoax devices are being planted for a particular reason.  Does the Minister have information as to whether anyone has been apprehended or sentenced by the courts that gives any indication of where all this activity is emanating from?</p>

I have spoken about the matter on a number of occasions with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and I will discuss it with him again on foot of this discussion.  I do not have the information about arrests, apprehensions and prosecutions but I will ascertain it and let Deputy O'Shea know.</p>

          the changes in the role and structures of the Defence Forces that may result should the constitutional amendment enabling the ratification of the Lisbon treaty be approved; if there is a possibility that conscription could be introduced under the Lisbon treaty; the grounds on which he reaches that conclusion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_166">The Lisbon treaty will have no impact on the organisation, structure or roles of the Defence Forces.  National security will continue to remain the sole responsibility of each member state.  In addition, the treaty will not have any impact on Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.</p>
            <p eId="para_167">Any decision by Ireland to participate in EU-led military crisis management operations will be for sovereign decision on a case-by-case basis and in line with Irish constitutional and legislative arrangements.  The triple lock provisions requiring a Government decision, Dáil approval and UN authorisation will continue to apply in regard to the overseas deployment of contingents of the Irish Defence Forces for service in peace support and crisis management operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_168">I am well aware that the issue of a European army and the possibility of conscription into such an army was an issue of great concern to many during the previous referendum debate.  I would like to provide a concrete assurance to all those who were concerned, and to everybody else, that there is absolutely no provision in the Lisbon treaty, or in any other EU treaties, which would facilitate the establishment of a European army or the introduction of conscription to any such army.  The obligation to military service is strictly a matter of policy for individual member states, which, in Ireland's case, is entirely voluntary and will remain so.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_169">I welcome the Minister's response.  I agree that in the previous referendum campaign it was a matter of major concern for mothers especially, that if they supported the Lisbon treaty their sons or daughters could be conscripted into a European army.  That argument was used extensively by the "No" campaigners and it did register with people.  I hope the Minister's clarification will resonate with all those people who had concerns about that matter and which was one of the reasons they voted against the treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_170">Does the Minister think there is a need for a protocol to be inserted in the next agreement to clarify the matter and outline clearly that if the Lisbon treaty is passed, in no way will it or could it lead to a European army to which Irish citizens could be conscripted?</p>

            <p eId="para_184">In line with the provisions of the Defence Forces Reserve review implementation plan, it is hoped that a small number of reservists will be able to undertake overseas service in late 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">The organisational changes, enhancements to clothing, equipment, training and the piloting of the integrated reserve, all delivered as part of the implementation plan, have improved the capabilities of the Defence Forces Reserve.  It was intended as part of the plan that those improvements in capability would build towards overseas service by members of the reserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_186">The military authorities have identified a small number of overseas posts requiring specific skills that may be filled by members of the reserve.  That is likely to involve deployment to the mission in Kosovo for a period of six months.  Any commitment to overseas service by members of the reserve will be on a voluntary basis.  The military authorities have sought expressions of interest from among suitably qualified reservists who have undertaken integrated training.  The military authorities are at an advanced stage in identifying reservists who may be eligible and willing to apply for a small number of specified overseas positions.  Final selection of personnel will be dependent on interested personnel completing an extensive training schedule to upskill to the requisite military standards to enable them to serve overseas.  It will also be dependent on their personal availability.</p>
            <p eId="para_187">It is intended to make regulatory provision to allow suitably qualified members of the Defence Forces Reserve to qualify for service with the Permanent Defence Forces for the express purpose of this overseas service.  Terms and conditions of service are being actively examined and the representative associations will be consulted in the near future.  I am pleased that such work is proceeding on schedule in line with plan provisions.</p>

Will the Minister confirm the report that appeared in the media that 12 reservists will be taking part, including heavy-duty mechanics, medical specialists and information technology experts?  What will be the position with regard to their pay?  I take it a number of these people will be leaving paid employment to go to Kosovo.

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_189">It is planned to send 12 people on an initial pilot scheme.  They will be recruited temporarily into the Permanent Defence Forces, PDF, to enable the deployment to take place, because the legislation provides that only members of the PDF can be sent overseas.  When we are drafting legislation to allow members of the Defence Forces Reserve to be sent overseas on a regular basis, rather than by temporary arrangement as in this case, we will consider various issues.  One of the barriers is conditions of employment and we must iron out the issue in that regard.  We will learn some lessons from the initial deployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_190">There have been 24 expressions of interest and I am informed that the people chosen will come from that group.  They will be people whose personal circumstances, whether by arrangement with their employer or because they are self-employed, allow them to make the trip for six months.</p>

            <p eId="para_193">With regard to Deputy Deenihan's question on whether we will have legislation along the lines of the UK legislation, I imagine that will be factored in when the legislation is drafted.  We must provide for something along those lines.  We are getting over the problem temporarily by recruiting people from the Defence Forces Reserve into the Permanent Defence Forces so as to keep within the legislation.  These people will leave the PDF a short time after their return.  We will have to consider something along the lines of job protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">On the first line reserve, we are still at the early stages and have made no significant progress.  We are concentrating on upping the numbers of the integrated reserve to come somewhere near the targets we set out in the White Paper.</p>

The campaign for recruitment to the reserve is now on hold, although I understand that if people volunteer, they will be recruited.  However, there will not be a recruitment campaign.

What we are doing here is allowing members of the reserve, for the first time ever, to serve overseas.  This is a significant development.  We are not short of applicants for the recruitment campaign to the Permanent Defence Forces, with approximately five applicants for every position.  The campaign is stopped temporarily, but we hope to reverse that later this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_200">There will be no dissent with the Government from this side of the House today.  On behalf of the Fine Gael Party — I am sure I speak for everybody — I would like to express our sympathy to the families, friends and connections of three men murdered in Northern Ireland in the recent past, Mark Quinsey, Patrick Azimkar and Stephen Carroll.  I am sure the Taoiseach and all Members share my sense of revulsion at these cowardly deeds, carried out by twisted minds on the basis of a return to an armed struggle, despite the fact the vast majority of people, North and South, have voted for a peace process so many people have worked so hard to put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">The persons who carried out these murders have no mandate for their actions.  They have openly defied the expressed will of the people of Ireland, North and South, to leave violence in the past and live together in peace.  In doing what they did, they attempted to subvert the democratic process.  This cannot and will not be tolerated.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_203">These are testing times for the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland.  The leaders of the parties in the Assembly are to be commended for their openness and their response to these murders.  I urge them to appeal to their supporters to co-operate fully with the police investigations now taking place, so that those responsible can be brought to justice.  I urge the Garda Síochána to provide every possible assistance to this investigation in order that this sad, tragic saga can be ended quickly and that those responsible can be brought before the jurisdiction of the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">The Fine Gael Party, as always, stands ready to support the actions of the Government in its attempts and co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland to bring the perpetrators of these murders to justice in the shortest possible time.  While many issues divide us in terms of working here, such as economic issues, on this issue there is no division nor dissent.  I offer the full support of the Fine Gael Party to the Government in its efforts in this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">Does the Taoiseach consider it would be an appropriate response from the House to set aside an hour, either this evening or tomorrow, for an all-party agreed motion condemning the murders of these three men carrying out their duties?  Does he agree we should send a clear message from Dáil Éireann of the support of all Members of the House in condemning outright these murders and to the supporters of our democratic systems that this institution will not be trampled upon by people of twisted minds and evil deeds?  When the Taoiseach travels next week to the United States, he should carry with him a strong and clear mandate in respect of our attitude towards violence and atrocities on these shores.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">My simple request is that the Taoiseach allows us an appropriate time, an hour or so tomorrow, for an agreed motion in the House condemning these murders.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">I agree with the sentiments Deputy Kenny expressed, including the need for this House to take time tomorrow, in a structured debate by way of an agreed motion, to make clear its repugnance at this attempt by self-appointed people who claim to speak on behalf of the Irish people.  They have no mandate to do so.  These are dastardly deeds, cowardly acts, the wanton murders of three individuals and the serious injury of others who will, hopefully, continue to recover.  Tomorrow we should make it very clear, both at home and abroad, that this peace process belongs to the people of Ireland, that the people's will shall not be undermined by anybody in this country who seeks to speak in their names and that we are unequivocal, as we always have been in this House, about those who seek to claim political ends through violent means.  There is no politics to this; it is murder, plain and simple.  We will work with the PSNI through our authorities, our security services and the Garda Síochána, in every way we can to ensure the subversive threat to our hard-won democracy will not be subject to such actions by people who speak for nobody.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_106">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_208">I thank the Taoiseach for that.  These shots that took away the lives of people on our island have reverberated around the world sending a message of uncertainty and confusion.  That is why it is important that this institution and its counterpart in Northern Ireland stand firm on this, that we reject those messages of confusion and uncertainty and that we stand absolutely behind the peace process so painstakingly put together by so many people and being implemented for the past ten years.  The pictures in today's newspapers of the little children looking back at the flowers are such as we have not seen anywhere on this island for quite some time, and thought we might never see again.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">In the questions we have had here over recent months we have discussed this activity of dissident republican groups and the Taoiseach is aware of the Chief Constable's decision to bring in extra expertise, as he saw it, to deal with analysis of and investigation into happenings in Northern Ireland.  Have our security forces, the Garda, specialist units or military personnel, received any information about developments from republican dissident groups, whether Continuity IRA or Real IRA?  Has the Taoiseach been briefed by his own sources on the extent of recruitment by the Continuity IRA or Real IRA that has been going on in our jurisdiction?  Has he any information on that?  Has the Taoiseach spoken to the Garda Commissioner and the Chief of Staff about making available whatever they consider necessary for our security forces to deal with that element of recruitment or activity from either of these or any other dissident republican group that might be active in plotting activities such as those that have resulted in these tragic cases?  The Independent Monitoring Commission made a number of observations on this and I wonder if the Taoiseach has been brought up to date by the security chiefs on what level of activity has been ongoing in this jurisdiction.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_107">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_210">The Garda Síochána is in very close contact with the PSNI and co-operation on pursuing those responsible and seeking to prevent any further incidents remains at the highest level.  The Garda Commissioner and Chief Constable are meeting next Thursday and the Chief Constable has publicly recognised the excellent co-operation between the two forces.  We have been very conscious of the threat posed by dissidents and that is why, despite the political progress in the North, the Garda has continued to deploy extensive resources targeting their activities.  Despite the political progress in recent years, we have retained a full legislative armoury for dealing with terrorist groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">The harsh reality is that it takes only a small group of people with limited resources to cause this kind of carnage.  They have no support in the community.  The Government remains determined that the peace process will not be jeopardised by the actions of a small minority.  I receive security briefings regularly.  Yesterday I was briefed on the latest sad developments.  The Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs and I are determined to ensure the Garda and the security services in this country will continue to work very closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland.  We will ensure the continuation of the extensive surveillance and intelligence they have built up over many years, to which we are grateful for having deterred other incidents which, had they been allowed to proceed without intervention could have meant loss of life and limb.  Many of these successes are not brought to public attention, but the vigilance is of a very high order and the professionalism of the Garda in this matter has been recognised by those who depend on that co-operation, for example the Chief Constable, Hugh Orde, and the wider community throughout the island.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_108">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_212">This is a sad day, and one which we had all hoped we would not have to revisit.  We are in the wake of two horrific murders of two young soldiers on Saturday night, the horrific murder last night of a police officer and the injuries that were inflicted on the pizza delivery people.  This was firstly an attack on human beings.  Two young men going out to collect a pizza, unarmed, were shot down.  It was a cowardly act.  The police officer murdered last night was a public servant going out to respond to an apparent call for assistance from a member of the public.  He was doing the work we would expect any police officer to do in the normal course of duty, and he walked into a trap and was shot down and murdered.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">This was an attack on democracy.  These attacks were intended to undermine the democratic institutions established in Northern Ireland.  It is important that we stand together in this House, just as the political parties stood together yesterday in the Northern Ireland Assembly, to roundly condemn this and to say we are not having it and that there will be no going back to the past.  It was an unpatriotic act.  This country, North and South, faces enormous economic difficulties.  People are losing their jobs and businesses.  We need investment in our country and jobs created.  The last thing we need is a message going out to the wider world that there is trouble in Ireland again.  Those of us who have been in contact internationally with companies, governments and political parties know that people do not distinguish between North and South.  They see there is trouble in Ireland and it will do damage all around.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">It is critically important that those responsible for the murders last night and on Saturday night are brought to justice.  The Taoiseach said the legislation is in place and I would like to hear him express confidence that they will be brought to justice.  As Deputy Kenny said, we have talked here on previous occasions during questions to the Taoiseach about the possible threats from dissident republicans.  We are discussing a small number of isolated people who do not enjoy a mandate or public support.  Now is the time to weed out this and to deal with it.  It is important this is dealt with quickly by the security forces and the police forces here and in Northern Ireland and that it is not allowed to grow and that if there is a pattern and this is the start of some kind of campaign that it is stopped effectively by the means open to the Government and to the instruments of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">I appreciate that the Taoiseach may be constrained in informing us on the public record as to the intelligence available to the Government.  However, will he brief the leaders of the Opposition parties in respect of the measures which will and can be taken to bring this to an end and to ensure we do not have a continuation of what we have seen in recent days?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_109">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_216">I agree and join with Deputy Gilmore in stating that all right-thinking people in this country and anywhere would be determined that the perpetrators of these acts would be brought to justice as quickly as possible.  Therefore, the first step in the process of bringing people to justice is to ensure the fullest possible co-operation exists between our respective police authorities on the island and this is the case.  This co-operation, as we know, is not new.  It is of very long standing and a seamless relationship has built up, particularly in recent years during the time of the peace process, which has enabled the security services and the Garda to work closely with those charged with protecting law and order in Northern Ireland to do whatever is necessary to have under surveillance and monitor these people to ensure they do not succeed.  Unfortunately, as we know, we had these two incidents in the past 72 hours.  These are the first such deeds we have seen in many years.  We are all determined that this matter will be dealt with as strenuously and comprehensively as possible and with the same degree of determination we saw in the past when such acts were even more frequent.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs are in Northern Ireland discussing this matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  They will be here tomorrow and can brief leaders and spokespersons as required with the information, consistent with the confidentiality that goes with some of these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">I share with Deputy Gilmore the view that the impact or consequences of this can be far wider than the loss of life, which is the most serious consequence of such deeds.  The peace process is resilient and has proven its ability to overcome great difficulties in the past.  The determination of the ordinary people of the island of Ireland, North and South, should never be underestimated by these people.  This resilience and commitment to peace and harmony and moving forward together has been exemplified not only by the unanimity expressed in this House this afternoon but that expressed yesterday in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  I was heartened by the united stand taken by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and by all in the Northern Ireland Assembly who are determined to ensure that these people — they do not represent anyone nor do they have a democratic mandate — will not in any way influence events in a way they would hope because everyone remains focused on the future and on ensuring that the investigations and subsequent prosecutions for these acts of murder are brought to a successful conclusion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_110">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_219">I welcome the fact that the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs are meeting the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland today.  I also welcome the fact that the Garda and the PSNI are in contact.  I hope this will help to bring the perpetrators to justice and that there will be a high level of co-operation to ensure this happens.  I agree with what the Taoiseach said regarding the resilience of the peace process and the institutions.  The legislation enacted following the Omagh bombing, which was quite severe in both jurisdictions, was aimed at identifying the Omagh bombers, bringing them to justice and ensuring there would not be a repeat.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied this legislation is sufficiently robust and extensive to deal with this situation and with any future situations which might arise?  It is hoped they will not.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">As we speak about the fallout from these horrific events, it is important to remember that ultimately, this is a human tragedy where three people have lost their lives.  All of our sympathies are with their families, friends and those close to them.  I take this opportunity to express my sympathy and that of the Labour Party with all of those who were close to the three men who lost their lives.</p>

There has been no indication from Garda authorities that there is any inadequacy in respect of the legislation which was introduced at the time to enhance the framework to which we were operating already.  If it is relevant in these circumstances it will of course be used to the full.  I join Deputies Gilmore and Kenny, and on all our behalf and on behalf of the Irish people, I offer our sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and to confirm to them that we will do all we can to see that justice is served in this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_238">At the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis on Friday night last, the Taoiseach announced a reduction in the maximum amounts that could be contributed to political parties and in the amounts which were to be declared.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government reannounced the same proposals last weekend.  There is an electoral Bill before the House that is due for debate tomorrow and Thursday.  However, the proposals for that debate are being restricted by guillotines and so on.  The Labour Party intends to submit an amendment to that Bill to give effect to the announcement that the Taoiseach made at his Ard-Fheis.  We are doing this in order to be helpful and to get the legislative process moving.  There is clearly agreement from the Government on this, so I do not see how it can be contentious.

          <p eId="para_244">I indicated last week, when the Exchequer returns were published, that we would take whatever decisions necessary this month and that we would have a budget during the first week of April.  I indicated that this was our reaction to the deterioration that had occurred.  The Minister for Finance will now come to the Cabinet.  Budget issues will be discussed tomorrow morning, as we were dealing with other matters in the Cabinet today, and the Minister for Finance will set out his timeline.  We will agree to it then and will announce it afterwards.</p>

          <p eId="para_245">A second budget in the year is not normal.  This is a serious matter.  We all accept that the public finances are in a serious state.  The timeframe is fairly short.  The options for the budget date are very limited, as it will either be on 2 April, 8 April or 9 April.  Which is it?  This is not an academic question.  Given the fact that Easter is falling around this time, there are implications for the budget date and on our debate on it.  We normally have a week's debate or more after a budget is announced.  If the budget takes place on 2 April, we presumably will have a budget debate going right up to the Easter break.  If it is left until Easter week, that raises questions about the arrangements made for a debate in the House on the budgetary measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">I do not think it would be acceptable to the public that the Government would introduce a budget a couple of days before Easter, following which the House would go into recess, with no debate on the budget.</p>

I indicated that it will be the first week of April.  The Minister for Finance will bring the proposal before the Cabinet in the normal way.  It will be adopted by the Cabinet and notification will take place accordingly.  We will obviously have a debate after the budget is announced.</p>

        <heading>Challenges facing the Health Service: Statements. </heading>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_190">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_313">I welcome the opportunity of addressing the financial challenges that confront the Health Service Executive for 2009.  Within the next three weeks or, as the Taoiseach stated, in early April, the Government will introduce a new set of financial and spending measures for 2009.  Therefore, to some extent, this debate is somewhat premature, because it would be my intention to either revert to the House or to a committee of the House to deal with the issues arising for the HSE in the context of the financial measures agreed and introduced in the House on that date.  Health expenditure for 2009 is €16.4 billion, of which 93% will be spent by the Health Service Executive and 7% by the Department of Health and Children.  The Department's budget of €531 million includes more than €100 million for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the allocation to the Health Information and Quality Authority and funding for a number of other agencies which come within the remit of the Department and are independent of the HSE.  The budget of the Minister of State with responsibility for children is €548 million, the bulk of which is spent on the early childhood payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">In total, the public health service accounts for 25% of the money spent on running the country.  This year, based on forecasts for GNP, it will account for 11% of national income.  I note the Governor of the Central Bank today forecast a contraction in GNP of approximately 6% this year.  When the €4 billion spent in the private health sector is included in the figures, health expenditure as a proportion of national income increases to 13.5%.  This figure is on a par with the highest spending countries in the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The fiscal and expenditure challenges facing the country are unprecedented.  Earlier, Deputy Bruton asked a question on forecasts for tax revenue.  While I am not an accurate forecaster, I understand we are working on the basis that in 2009 tax revenue will be between €34 billion and €35 billion, current expenditure will be approximately €50 billion and net capital expenditure will be approximately €8 billion.  One does not need to be a genius to understand that a deficit well in excess of €20 billion is not sustainable from the perspective of the public finances or as a member of the eurozone.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">In light of the financial challenges facing the country, the health service will be challenged to deliver greater efficiency for the resources allocated to it and greater flexibility in terms of how and where people work.  This year, we will spend more on health than we are forecast to collect from VAT — €13 billion — income tax — €13 billion — and food — €12 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The HSE submitted a service plan to me early this year based on its initial allocation and the figures on which we were working in December last.  The plan indicated that, notwithstanding the financial challenges it faced, the executive would operate the same level of services as it did in the previous year.  Its allocation for 2009 was between 3% and 4% higher than in 2008.  The HSE gave a commitment that it would maintain existing levels of services to patients.  This was to be done by increasing day case activity which is 12% lower than the OECD average and only 50% of the best performing countries such as Canada.  Even within Ireland, there are variations in day case activity, with some hospitals performing well and others performing not so well.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">The average length of hospital stay also need to be addressed.  The HSE has been doing amazing work in reducing the average length of stay.  Despite recent improvements, however, the average length of stays here are between 0.6 and 1.9 days longer than for similar procedures in the United Kingdom.  We also need to address the population of patients in our acute hospital system.  A survey done on bed utilisation showed that approximately 12% of patients were in hospital for IV therapy, which in many other countries is delivered in patients' homes or community based centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Additional funding of €8.1 billion has been allocated to public health since 2002.  To put this figure in context, it is twice the level of expenditure on health in 1996-97.  Of this increased expenditure, 36% has been expended on pay, 14% on drugs and 29% or almost €3 billion on new service developments in the areas of older people, services for people with disabilities, the acute hospital sector, cancer control, screening and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">The sustainability of our public finances is a challenge for all of us, not least the Government.  Countries and health ministries around the world face the same challenge.  We estimate, at this point, that the financial challenge facing the Health Service Executive for the remainder of this year amounts to €480 million.  I reiterate the point I made before Deputy Reilly entered the Chamber that the position may change when fiscal measures are introduced in the House in three weeks.  In that case, I will revert to the House or a committee thereof to address the new position.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">The €480 million figure includes an estimated €100 million shortfall in receipts from the health levy.  The substantial shortfall in January eased somewhat in February and will, we estimate, amount to €100 million over the year.  We also estimate a shortfall of between €57 million and €60 million in long-stay repayments.  This figure arises primarily from the success of some appeals.  The HSE's contingency figure may not be sufficient to meet requirements.  The estimated shortfall in the allocation for medical cards is approximately €170 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The remainder of the €480 million figure is made up of an additional €30 million for the consultants' contract which arose because more people signed up for the contract than we anticipated when the allocation was made to the HSE.  The cost of the Hickey judgment, under which retrospective payments must be made, is estimated at €35 million.  The failure to implement the judgment this year will give rise to costs of perhaps €50 million.  Under the emergency provisions introduced by the Minister for Finance, I commenced consultation with the Irish Pharmacy Union and other professional organisations in health care, including the Irish Medical Organisation, on fees and the need to ensure the distribution margin is substantially reduced.  I anticipate that this consultation will be completed by 3 April.  At that point, it will be a matter of making a determination which is in line with the outcome of the High Court proceedings.  If that occurs, we expect to achieve savings in this area for 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">The €480 million shortfall at this point presents a major challenge for the HSE.  I have asked the board of the HSE, which meets on Thursday, not to reduce levels of services to patients if this can be avoided before the Government makes its determination on expenditure and fiscal matters in the next three weeks.  As the Taoiseach stated, the Cabinet will tomorrow morning decide on the date on which the budget will be introduced in the House.  The question is whether it will be introduced on 2 April or the following week.  Once this has been done, we will be clearer on the financial implications for the health service in 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Many people would argue that as more people become unemployed, pressure increases on demand led schemes, particularly medical cards.  There will be a shortfall in the levy, for example, moneys from which are allocated to appropriation-in-aid to the Health Service Executive.  Unlike the social welfare system, where additional money is provided when unemployment increases, as is appropriate, other State services do not receive additional resources to address increased demand that had not been anticipated when services were being planned for at the end of the previous year.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">To be fair to the HSE, last year it achieved value for money savings of approximately €280 million.  At this time last year, it was predicted that the HSE would exceed its budget.  I compliment the Accounting Officer, management team, board and staff of the executive on operating within their budget, challenging as that was.  Not only must it operate within the allocated budget for 2009, it must meet the unexpected new issues which arise as a result of the economic pressures confronting the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">There has been speculation in the public domain about the new consultant contract.  I will address this issue briefly bearing in mind that I will also take questions later.  The new consultant contract was welcomed by all sides in the House when it was successfully negotiated after a prolonged and protracted period of negotiations lasting more than four years, which included the term of office of some of my predecessors.  It is not a pay increase for consultants but a new way of working.  It is fundamental to the recruitment of new consultants that they are recruited on the basis of a contract that meets the needs of the public health care system rather than one that was negotiated in the early 1980s, when relatively few people in this country had private health insurance, and did not meet the needs of the public health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The essential elements of the new contract are that each consultant will work as part of a team with a clinical director.  It will be the responsibility of that clinical director to make sure the team provides cover for the acute hospital at appropriate times.  A longer working day and working week are envisaged for consultants and there will be structured cover over the weekends.  In addition, there is one-for-all access to diagnostics, which is significant.  We all know of many cases in which access to diagnostics was a factor, not least that of the late Susie Long, who was told when she sought a colonoscopy in a public hospital that if she had private health insurance she could have one within a week or ten days but as she did not she must join a queue.  That is not acceptable in our public health system and, under the new consultant contract, this system will come to an end.  These are fundamental changes to the way in which consultants work.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Consultants must also subject themselves to clinical audits, not just of outcomes but also of performance.  The HSE has recently done some interesting work on key performance indicators.  I mentioned in the House the work done in the area of neurology services, which showed a major discrepancy between the number of new patients seen by neurologists in different parts of the country and in different hospitals.  The power of performance indicators, auditing and data in changing performance and delivering better outcomes for patients cannot be underestimated.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Under the budget, as I mentioned, 93% of the allocation for health in 2009 will go to the HSE.  That represents a quarter of all the money we will spend running the country in 2009.  As I mentioned earlier, if we accept, as the governor of the Central Bank said today, that the economy will contract by 6%, an increase of 3% or 4% for the HSE represents an actual increase of 9% or 10%.  If we add to that the amount of public money spent on health — 78% of spending on health in Ireland comes from the public purse and 22% from private sources — we can see that spending on health represents about 13.5% of our national income, which is by any standards a major investment in our health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">Among the areas in which the HSE must see change in order to deliver patient care in a way that does not adversely affect patients is that of work practices.  Between allowances and overtime alone we spend more than €1 billion.  The HSE is currently in discussions with non-consultant hospital doctors, in particular, but also with other staff.  There is a high dependence on agency nurses and a very high dependence on allowances.  We all accept that the health system does not operate on a nine-to-five basis, and people must be remunerated for the anti-social hours they work.  Notwithstanding that, the pay pressures are immense, and unless we can achieve greater flexibility for the major increase in pay we have had each year for the past number of years, the health service will not be able to provide the services we all expect, whether in the community or in the acute hospital system.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">I am happy to engage in this debate in the House, although I accept that it is premature given that there is to be a budget in three weeks' time.  In the context of that budget, nothing is off the table.  I am not ruling anything in or out.  We are in a new financial situation, and we must all play our parts in making sure we address the major deficiencies in the public finances in a way that has minimum impact on those at the very bottom in our society, particularly in terms of the provision of public health services to our population.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_332">I thank the Minister for this debate.  As she points out, although I welcome the opportunity to discuss the health service, it is premature in view of the upcoming budget.  It is important that we have a follow-up debate after the Minister has deliberated and made her determinations on what is and is not to be cut.  I will set out the areas in which cuts should not be made, in which they have been already made, and in which they could be made.  Cuts of themselves do very little; we need real reform.  The Minister mentioned a total of €1 billion in overtime in a year, which is an extraordinary sum and a poor reflection on the management of the health service and the Minister's supervision of it.  That we are spending so much money on health, as the Minister has mentioned, is worthy of query.  We know that €1.5 billion or so is spent by the VHI; from where does the rest of the €4 billion not associated with the HSE and the Department come?</p>

        <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_193">
          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_334">Has that been analysed?  It seems a lot of money.  I would have thought it was more like €500 million, but if the Minister has facts to show otherwise I would be delighted to hear them, because it makes our task in the future much easier.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">We cannot have a debate on the health service today without acknowledging that we did not just arrive here out of the blue.  The same Minister has been in place for the past number of years and we have had the same Government for the past 12 years.  Under their auspices the HSE was set up.  The service plan approved by the Minister in 2009 cannot deliver 2008 levels of services, as we now know.  On top of €500 million worth of savings initially planned for 2009, an additional €600 million will need to be saved.  In addition to the 500 hospital beds currently not in use, a further 600 are expected to be taken out of the system, which gives a total of 10% of the bed complement.  Eleven accident and emergency departments will be rationalised, front-line staff will be cut, and critical overtime will stop.  However, the reason overtime has become critical is that we do not have the manpower to allow the work to be done in ordinary time.  I encourage the Minister to correct the overtime requirement.  I do not believe it is safe for patients or doctors to work inordinate hours.  However, patients must be served and doctors must be there to serve them.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">Rather than tackling wasteful spending within the HSE and approving a redundancy programme, as mentioned by the Minister last year, to reduce management and administrative bureaucracy within the HSE, the Minster is more interested in withdrawing lifesaving HPV vaccines from young girls for a minimal saving of €9.7 million.  Although a voluntary early retirement scheme for the HSE was announced last July, the Government has yet to decide on the detail.  In fact, the Minister said in the House only a couple of weeks ago that it was now a matter for the Minister for Finance.  Reading between the lines, I can conclude that no progress has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Let us consider the existing cutbacks and mismanagement that have hurt patients and the taxpayer.  We have seen the withdrawal of the automatic entitlement to a medical card for the over 70s — the generation that paid 60% tax and educated themselves.  This caused unprecedented public outrage, and is still very much in people's minds.  The Minister was on "Questions and Answers" with me last night, and a gentleman in the audience raised the issue yet again.  When out canvassing I have been told by elderly people that when Fianna Fáil Deputies called around they would show them the medical cards they tried to take from them.  The Minister tried to take the soft option in that case.  Yet there has been no move in terms of achieving savings by using generic drugs.  The withdrawal of the automatic entitlement to a medical card, which was supposed to save €100 million, has saved only €20 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Another issue on which there is still no clear direction is that of oral nutritional supplements.  A group led by Dr. Michael Barry was to report to the Minister in this regard.  We still do not know what supplements will be included in the proposed cuts, and rumours are rife.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">In August 2008 the Minister approved the introduction of a vaccination programme against HPV, which can lead to cervical cancer.  This was due to commence in September 2009.  The programme was welcomed; HIQA recommended the vaccine and the National Immunisation Advisory Board welcomed it.  We were told the vaccine would reduce the incidence of pre-cancer by 66% and that of cervical cancer by 50%, while deaths from cervical cancer would be reduced by 45%, the equivalent of 52 lives per year. The annual cost was estimated at €10 million, although I believe it could be lower.  However, in November 2008, the Minister did a U-turn on the cervical vaccine notwithstanding a confirmation by the winner of the Nobel Prize, Dr. Harald zur Hausen, of the vaccine's efficacy.  It is a mystery why we cannot find €10 million in an overall budget of €16 billion to protect our children.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">In November 2008, the Minister announced a new private health insurance levy of €160 for each adult and €53 for each child under 18 on foot of a Supreme Court decision which found her risk equalisation to be <i>ultra vires</i>.  She claimed that insurance premiums for older people would increase substantially by up to 60% with no evidence to back this up other than the assertions of the VHI, which is the dominant player in the market.  If passed on fully, the health insurance levy will cost a family of two adults and three children almost €500 per year before whatever substantial increase in premiums is now in prospect.  This is being introduced even though the VHI posted a profit of €112 million in 2007.  Community rating continues to ensure that a person’s age does not determine the level of premium he or she pays because the law clearly prohibits an insurance company from selectively deciding that certain age groups should pay more for insurance.  This is, therefore, a revenue gathering exercise.  As health insurance becomes less affordable, families will be forced out of the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">My late arrival to the House, for which I apologise, is because I attended a meeting between the Committee on Health and Children and Age Action Ireland.  I wanted to hear that organisation's view of the new annual nursing home fee of €190 per bed.  Nursing homes with 40 to 50 beds will have to pay between €7,600 and €9,500 to HIQA.  As it appears that individuals will be paid €85,000 or more to inspect nursing homes, the money will be spent on personnel.  In fairness to HIQA, it had no part in devising this stealth tax.  I do not doubt that it will be passed to the relevant consumers, namely, elderly patients.  Costs will arise to the HSE for public nursing home beds and public patients in contracted private nursing home beds.  If the Minister is determined to impose a charge, it should be double rather than triple digits.  The maximum charge should be less than €50.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">We do not know what the impact will be on HSE nursing homes in terms of how many homes will meet the standards and the amount of capital available to make the requisite improvements.  I acknowledge that they will be permitted a six-year period to make these improvements but they are unlikely to get the funding they need.  The ensuing closure of many of our public nursing home facilities will further the agenda of driving people into private health care.  Bethany Home and St. Brigid's ward in St. Patrick's hospital, Waterford, closed because they did not meet the standards but there was no consultation or discussion locally in advance of their closure.  Having visited both facilities, I am aware that a great deal of money has been raised for St. Brigid's ward.  It meets all the health and safety regulations and the number of beds in the ward has been reduced.  All that remains to be done is to spend a few bob on fire screens in the attic.  We lack a national plan on future bed requirements.  We are closing beds in rural communities whereas people are lying on beds in Dublin long after they have been medically discharged.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">General cutbacks include a reduction of €18 million in the money promised for palliative care and a reduction of €50 million for mental health.  Moneys intended for disabilities, diabetes and older people have been diverted to meet spending deficits in other areas.  This afternoon, the Committee on Health and Children met representatives of Pavee Point, which is experiencing similar problems because the money set aside for Traveller health has been spirited away to meet day-to-day budget needs.  This is especially frightening given the life expectancy for Travellers and the health issues they face.  Budget 2009 saw a 50% increase in accident and emergency charges, a 14% increase in inpatient charges, a 20% increase in private and semi-private bed charges and a further increase in the threshold for the drugs payment scheme, which has increased by 80% since 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">Increasing charges and hurting patients is one way to stay within budget but what about addressing the waste over which the Minister has presided for the past four years?  The HSE has spent €292 million on staff transport costs since 2005.  Approximately €1 million was spent on consultants to advise on the deconstruction of the HSE.  The Minister spends €1 million on special advisers, press officers and constituency staff.  A total of 216,000 bed days were lost, which is the equivalent of Tallaght hospital remaining closed for one year.  This represents an increase of 30% in the number of people who were not discharged from hospital because no investment was made in nursing home beds in Dublin and other urban areas.  Nursing Homes Ireland has informed us that up to 300 beds in the greater Dublin area are available to be contracted in the next six months.  Why are we continuing to spend €1,400 per day on the care of a person for whom medical treatment is complete instead of €1,400 per week?  It is a nonsensical waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">Over the past couple of years, 31,000 operations were cancelled.  Money was spent on HSE bonuses and PPARs but the 320 people who are lying on trolleys today represent an increase of 25% on this time last year.  I make no apology for pointing out problems and castigating the Minister on her failure to act, but I will also offer positive alternatives.  Why are we not doing a better job of managing the hospital system to avoid lost bed days and cancelled operations?  We should make better use of existing capacity.  Community rehabilitation and diagnostics services could be improved.  We should abolish the National Treatment Purchase Fund, thereby saving €110 million per year.  A special delivery unit was established in the North of Ireland at a cost of €30 million and the waiting list there was cleared in 18 months.  Unlike the NTPF, this investment did not recur annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">Where is the promised HSE redundancy programme?  Why is the Department of Health and Children not being streamlined?  That Department has seen little reduction in its staff since the establishment of the HSE.  Why does the Department need four junior Ministers?  Their number should be halved at least.  Savings could be made through generic and better prescribing and by teaching people how to use medicine properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">Services have been withdrawn in the mid-west and the north east and cutbacks have been imposed in Portlaoise, Navan, Mercy Hospital in Cork, the orthopaedic service at Naas General Hospital and in dermatology departments.  The hospitals in Galway and Blanchardstown have had to withdraw services in order to meet break-even pressures.  A 12-bed orthopaedic unit in Letterkenny hospital closed and Mayo General Hospital's break even plans have led to the closure of a number of beds at weekends.  Half of one wing remains empty in Mullingar hospital and Tullamore hospital is also half empty.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">Following the North's example of getting rid of waiting lists will require direct action from the Minister.  She will need to take responsibility for oversight on a daily basis.  In the coming two weeks, Fine Gael will launch a new direction for health that will result in 10% efficiencies, rid us of our waiting lists and ensure fair and equitable access to health care, thus ending the long era of two-tier health care in this State.  I hope that we will have a full debate on the health service once the Minister has completed her deliberations and the intended cuts are made public.</p>

          <p eId="para_351">It is important that we have this debate today, although we will need to return to it in the context of a budget in early April.  The background to the significant health cuts is the failure of the Government to handle the economy, going rapidly from boom to bust, and giving rise to a situation where there will be severe health cuts that will cause pain and take a long time to recover from.  If the proposals in the media come to pass, we will see huge levels of distress in many communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">The Minister has rightly pointed out that we increased funding in health over a number of years but the problem is that we did not reform the sector over those years.  There will now be drastic cuts to a health service that, despite the rhetoric of the Minister, has not been reformed.  When the HSE was established, its layers of management were not removed and the HSE is now cutting across the board, which will have an undoubted impact on front line services.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">It is not a reformed service because the improvements that would have made it more lean and efficient have not happened.  The Minister has talked about it many times but she has done nothing about it.  Money is still being allocated throughout the system without being related to outcomes in any way and that is the problem.  We have models of good practice but they have not been implemented so we do not have the practices that would ensure that money is well spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">We have a relatively high percentage of total spending going on health — 25% according to the Minister, 11% of national income and up to 13.5% if we include private money.  That is what the US is spending but the outcomes are just as bad there, despite the high level of income spent on health.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">The amount of money being spent on health is not the issue, however.  The issue is spending the money well.  Deputy Reilly has suggested ways in which money could be better spent.  I also have suggestions that are preferable to slashing across the board, closing beds, cutting public services, reducing the progress planned for community services or even closing hospitals.  My colleague, Deputy Sherlock, will refer to closures but there have been suggestions that the board of the HSE has considered closing hospitals, not just reconfiguring them in the manner that has seen services in the north east drastically damaged and services in the mid-west about to be drastically damaged.  The promised cuts in the various reports will be made but none of the benefits, where increased money was supposed to be spent for services such as day care treatment and building up of central hospitals, will be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">The report for the south has not yet been published because all these things are taking place behind closed doors.  People do not know what is happening.  That is a symptom of what is going on — these drastic cuts are being made and although the Minister puts up a good front, people are terrified.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I was talking to representatives of Age Action earlier and they are receiving telephone calls from people saying there is a limit on the budget for the fair deal scheme; it is resource capped.  People are scared that care of the elderly will get much worse because even if they qualify for a place in a nursing home, the money might be gone.  All of this is taking place behind closed doors.  I strongly support the sentiments of Rebecca O'Malley, the patient advocate, who stated that any proposed cut should be transparent, we should be told what it is and the savings involved, and it should be debated.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">There have been cuts of €6 million in Crumlin Hospital, €12 million in Tallaght Hospital and St. James's Hospital and €11 million in Beaumont Hospital, with similar proposals throughout the country.  Beds will be closed and there will be longer waiting lists.  Undoubtedly, patients will be on trolleys in corridors waiting for services.  The minor progress made in the past few years will be reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">I will not stand over cutbacks in services that will hurt patients.  There must be a bottom line below which services will not go.  We must ring-fence funding for development, for projects for Travellers, such those mentioned in the presentation by Pavee Point, the mental health budget, palliative care, disability budgets and, particularly, child and adolescent mental health, which was to see service developments that have now been put on the long finger.  We must also have money spent on colon cancer screening proposals to ensure that programme is introduced in the coming years.  There is a specific commitment to establish it this year and I want the Minister to give an undertaking that it will be forthcoming.  The HPV vaccine should undoubtedly be reinstated for September 2009 because of its capacity to save lives in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">We must get our priorities right because there is still wastage in the system.  There is no reason that spare administrative staff could not be transferred to HIQA to do inspections instead of charging for them, something which is of great concern to the elderly.  There is no reason, as Deputy Quinn just said, that if there is a shortage of staff in the Department of Education and Science and too many staff in the Department of Health and Children, because numbers have only been slightly reduced since the HSE was set up with all of its bureaucracy, those staff should not be transferred to do that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I propose that the NTPF be scrapped instead of closing beds in public hospitals.  The Minister has introduced measures because she believes in privatisation and the private sector providing health care.  The Labour Party does not believe in that and the majority of the public does not believe that is how the health services should be provided.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is a middle-man for private health care to make money out of the public system.  If we still had a lot of money, we might say that it shortens waiting times for some people but if we are cutting the budget for public hospitals, we should get rid of the NTPF and save the money, around €100 million per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">The consultants should be told that the increase agreed with them is to be deferred.  The Minister is cutting funds to other health care providers through the legislation we passed last week so I do not see why consultants should not be asked to implement the new working arrangements, which I agree with, but to defer the payment.  What they get is a multiple of salaries for consultants in other European countries.  Starting salaries are three times those of British consultants and the OECD pointed out in its review of public services last year that, even before the higher wages were agreed, their incomes were 50% higher than in France and 80% higher than in Germany.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The Labour Party strongly advocates the scrapping of the co-located hospital proposal, which would save €1.3 billion over seven years.  It was supposed to produce 1,000 beds but four years later it has not produced a single bed.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">There is room for general efficiencies.  Following the publication of the 2009 service plan, €530 million must be cut before the €480 million shortfall mentioned by the Minister is even taken into account.  That is a huge challenge.  The use of information technology, however, offers the opportunity for efficiency.  I spoke recently to a man who wanted to pay by credit card in the accident and emergency department but he was told he could not because a bill had to be sent to him.  This  caused a raft of paper work when he was quite willing to pay on the spot.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The Department of Social and Family Affairs automatically gets money in times of high unemployment.  I do not know why the Department of Health and Children does not also get money concerning its loss of income because of the loss of jobs from the levy and medical cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I look forward to returning to this topic again because it is such a vital service for people.  There is much fear among the public over what is happening to health services, so we must find better ways of saving money than the ones that have already been proposed.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_197">
          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_367">I thank Deputy Jan O'Sullivan for sharing time with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">I will start with a simple question — will the Minister close Mallow General Hospital?  I want a clear "Yes" or "No" answer from her.  If it is the Minister's intention to keep the hospital open, people want to know the extent of its services in future.  We have been met with nothing but confusion and obfuscation concerning the provision of services in the HSE south region in recent months.  We have had the national service plan 2009, the reconfiguration of hospitals report for the HSE south region, which was also published this year, and we have also had the teamwork report and the Howarth report.  Now we are being told that Professor John Higgins will examine proposals on savings that will be garnered as a result of the cuts to be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The people of the HSE south region want to know what will happen by way of facts, figures and timelines.  We are sick of this culture that exists whereby the only person who will answer publicly for HSE decisions is Professor Drumm.  We want to know why people in the hospital networks office of the HSE south region, and other such high-ranking figures, are not speaking publicly and answering in proper, public fora for the decisions they are taking.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">There is a positive alternative to the scenario that is currently provided by the HSE south region.  The Minister must listen to GPs who are referring to hospitals like Mallow and Cork University Hospital.  She must listen to people working at the coalface.  If we listened more to doctors and other health professionals and less to the coterie of managerial mandarins, we would be able to effect a proper system that could guarantee health services to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">With respect to the Minister, I want to know today if she intends to close Mallow General Hospital.  On behalf of that region's taxpayers, I also want to know what future scenario she envisages for the hospital.  We can rotate far more disciplines from Cork University Hospital through to Mallow General Hospital.  In addition, we can enhance the services at Mallow and add value to them.  That case is also being made by health professionals who are operating in that catchment area.  We need proper answers without obfuscation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_198">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_372">The Health Service Executive faces a shortfall of over €1 billion in 2009.  Our already inequitable health system is now faced with even more savage cuts that will drastically affect the care of patients if the Government is allowed to continue to hide behind the HSE which will wield the knife on behalf of Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Real savings need to be made and can be made by ending all State subsidies for the private for-profit health sector, reining in those consultants who profit from both the private and public systems, cutting bills through the use of generic drugs and the establishment of a State pharmaceutical procurement and distribution company.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">The Government could also cut massive salaries and allowances at the top of the HSE, including €16,000 per month for an adviser to HSE chief, Professor Brendan Drumm.  This massive salary and allowance is disgraceful and indefensible in any circumstances.  In the current economic situation, it is criminal.  People are struggling to survive and make ends meet, yet the Government allows such salaries and allowances to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Meanwhile, the Government and the HSE are preparing to cut services for patients and the pay of front line health care workers.  If they proceed in that way, the damage to our public health services will be catastrophic and will exceed the damage caused by cuts in the 1980s.  It is now time for strategic decision-making to be taken out of the hands of the HSE and placed where it belongs — with the elected representatives of the people in this House.  There must be such political accountability.  Any revised service plan and budget for the HSE must be placed before the Dáil so that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children and their colleagues can be fully accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Equally importantly, the Government must listen to and take on board the constructive proposals of all parties.  They need to listen to those of us who have been elected to serve the needs of the people.  We all have a responsibility to those who elect us.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">In the absence of real accountability and a Government that listens to the people, especially those who use the health services we have the disgraceful decision to scrap the national carers' strategy.  The revenue saved as a result of services provided by our carers is huge.  Across the country, dedicated people are looking after family members in the home with inadequate support from the State.  In my own county of Kerry, there are almost 6,000 carers.  However, continued lack of adequate support will lead to worsening health for both carers and cared-for, resulting in much greater health care costs to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">I would also like to draw the attention of the House to the discovery by my colleague, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, that a range of health and community projects in disadvantaged areas,  including 120 announced by the Government last December, is now in jeopardy as the Department of Finance is set to block the funding.  We need answers regarding those commitments.  These are projects in disadvantaged urban and rural areas across the State, which were to be funded by the RAPID and CLÁR programmes and administered by the Health Service Executive.  The announcement of the projects was made just before Christmas by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hoctor, who said that €4.6 million would be made available for the 2008-09 scheme.  This was to allow elderly people to be able to live independent lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">All Members of the House welcomed the intended programme.  The 120 projects range from a drop-in centre in Cavan town to a meals-on-wheels service in Dublin 12, from a bus project in Cork city to the refurbishment of an Alzheimer's Society facility in Drogheda.  All of these are worthy projects and would have contributed greatly to the needs of the individual older people concerned.  In many cases also, their family members would be given some respite from constant care, particularly where people are suffering from conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, which places such a demand on carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">My own county is among those badly hit by the proposed withdrawal of funding.  Projects with a projected investment cost of €1.2 million — funded by a combination of CLÁR and HSE inputs — are under threat.  They include programmes to improve services and community support for older people based in community centres at Lixnaw, Knocknagoshel and Listry, as well as the Coomnassig centre in Sneem, Caherciveen social services centre, Portmagee social services, Duagh resource centre, Glencar care of the aged and the Glen social centre in Ballinskelligs.  All those centres in isolated rural areas require Government support.  Also at risk are plans to improve child care and family support at the Scartaglin child care association and the tele-medicine centre in Faranfore.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The overall cost of the proposed joint CLÁR and Health Service Executive programmes was to come to €8.9 million.  It was also included in the provision of day-care services development in Castleblayney, County Monaghan, and the upgrading and equipping of ten day-care centres for older people in County Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The Health Service Executive has apparently been required to re-submit all these capital projects to the Department of Finance.  There is a general expectation in the sector that the funding will be withheld.  I reiterate Deputy Ó Caoláin's appeal to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, not to axe any of these projects which are based in disadvantaged areas and are especially important in enhancing the health and quality of life of older people.  The Minster should also reflect on the fact that while withdrawing the funding may represent a small short-term saving, in the long run it will increase the demand of those concerned on the health services, their GPs, hospitals and, ultimately, represent an even greater draw on the Exchequer.  It is far better and makes more economic sense to provide those services which will improve the quality of life for the people affected, therefore improving their health and lessening their dependency on direct provision from the health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">This is only the latest in a series of blows to the health sector across the country.  It is one which will inflict more hardship on those least able to cope with it, especially older people.  The overall impact of the health cuts in Kerry has already been dramatic.  The Health Service Executive has announced planned cutbacks of €4.5 million which will devastate an already overburdened and under-funded service.  It will have a serious impact on patient care, particularly at mental health facilities in the county.  The Government's imposed cuts in staffing and beds stand in stark contrast to the private health industry continuing to enjoy massive tax breaks.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Among the proposed cuts is €1.2 million to be removed from mental health services in Kerry.  This will include bed closures and staffing reductions at the acute psychiatric unit at Kerry General Hospital.  The Health Service Executive has implemented these cutbacks without properly consulting the staff's union representatives as required by the Labour Court.  Last week, I tabled a series of parliamentary questions on this but have not yet received a reply as they have been referred to the parliamentary affairs division of the Health Service Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">There are two psychiatric wards at Kerry General Hospital which, at night, are staffed by three nurses.  It is proposed to reduce this to two, a ridiculous and ill-thought decision considering most psychiatric admissions take place late at night.  Psychiatric nurses at Kerry General Hospital have one of the most demanding jobs in the health service.  To attack them in such an underhanded way and against the spirit of the earlier Labour Court rulings requiring consultation is repulsive.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">I have also asked that a full health and safety audit be carried out in the acute unit to assess the likely impact of the cuts on both staff and patients' safety.  People are appalled that such miserable cuts are being made to front line services while the Minister for Health and Children continues to defend the tax breaks available in the private-for-profit health sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The threatened withdrawal of the promised CLÁR and Health Service Executive funding for services for the elderly comes shortly after the Government decision not to publish its long-promised national carers' strategy.  This will affect up to 160,000 family carers whose work in the home saves the State hundreds of millions of euro every year.  The decision is in direct breach of the Towards 2016 agreement.  It also reneges on the commitment in the programme for Government to "ensure a national carers strategy focusing on supporting informal family carers in the community will be developed by the end of 2007".</p>
          <p eId="para_388">It is extremely short-sighted.  Even with the current desire to save money, any scaling down of the carers' schemes will exacerbate existing problems, have economic consequences for carers and lead in the long term to greater dependency on direct provision by the State.  Instead of making real savings, the miserly cutbacks will only create a vicious circle which, in the long run if people's health disimproves and they require more direct care from the State, will add to the costs of the health service.  This is assuming that even such basic provisions survive the current onslaught on the existing services.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">This illustrates the extent to which health spending and the health services are inextricably linked to the overall state of society.  It is no mystery that those on lower incomes tend to have poorer health and, therefore, to be more dependent on the health services.  It is also true that people's lifestyles in what they eat, drink, whether they smoke, whether they use illegal or legal drugs and the extent to which they engage in physical exercise also affects their health.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">People have a responsibility for their own health and lifestyles but society must create an environment which encourages people to live in a healthier manner.  Unemployment, low incomes and poor accommodation contribute greatly to poor health.  The lack of sporting and other recreational amenities prevents people from engaging in healthy pursuits.  The current economic situation has impacted and increased these negative factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">It is all the more important that in the current economic situation the State does not make matters worse by implementing cuts that will, on the one hand, contribute to a worsening of people's health and, on the other, impost actual cuts in the health service itself.  The first contributes to an increased demand on the health service while the second further increases the difficulties of adequately addressing those problems when they do arise.</p>

        <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_199">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
          <p eId="para_392">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this timely debate which anticipates what will happen in the next several weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Child protection services, provided by the Health Service Executive, are sometimes forgotten and considered a poor relation in these debates.  They only seem to arise in debates on a crisis, not allowing for calm and rational debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">According to the 2008 Euro Health Consumer Index, Ireland has moved from a position in 2006 of 25th to 15th out of 26 countries.  This is a dramatic improvement with Ireland being the highest mover in the two years.  The reason given by the index for this dramatic change was that the creation of the Health Service Executive had been a much-needed reform.  It also acknowledged this new position may be an underestimation of Ireland's position.  For example, one indicator used by the index is the number of cataract operations per 100,000 of a country's population.  It is a rather crude indicator, putting countries with young populations at a disadvantage.  Ireland has one of the youngest populations in the EU which would have a much lesser need for cataract operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">It is not just the formation of the Health Service Executive which has made these improvements.  The Euro Health Consumer Index commented that recognition of patients' organisations and legislation supporting patient welfare have also contributed to Ireland's improved placement.  Several years ago the type of issues dominating the health debate in this Chamber, and elsewhere, mainly concerned primary care, cancer care, hospital waiting lists and consultants' contracts.  From an honest analysis, it would be fair to say substantial progress has been made under each of these headings.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">There has never been a time when health has not been a contentious issue, nor has there been a time when it has not given rise to, in some instances, properly emotive debate.  There will probably never be a time when health does not give rise to serious and interesting debate in the House.  It will always be a matter of great public concern.  We must, therefore, reflect on the substantial improvements that have been made.  In that context, we must consider the number of primary care teams already in place, and the further such teams will be put in place this year, and the benefits to which these teams give rise.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">We must also examine the position regarding day or ambulatory care, the cornerstone of HSE reform and what Professor Drumm is trying to achieve.  There has been a 40% increase in the level of ambulatory care.  The knock-on effect of this increase is obvious, namely, that fewer people are lying in our hospitals, that there is a much greater volume of operations and procedures and that there are better outcomes for patients.  Everyone says that once one enters the health system, the care provided is first class.  We are all aware of the problems that exist with regard to getting into the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Reference has been made to the spirit of the age and the fact that we must begin to talk up what we do in this country.  There is no doubt that real progress has been made.  For example, the level of MRSA in hospitals has decreased by 25%.  A major debate took place a number of years ago regarding hospital-acquired infections and substantial progress has been made in respect of combating these infections.  However, not enough is said with regard to such progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">The National Treatment Purchase Fund has delivered procedures for 140,000 people who would otherwise have been obliged to wait for such procedures.  As the Minister stated earlier, there has been a huge take-up in respect of the consultant contract.  I accept that the contract is not perfect.  However, that fact should not — as was often the case in the past — be used as an excuse to do nothing.  People should not wait for everything to be perfect before serious and radical reforms become the norm, not the exception, and before vested interests are faced down.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The improvements to which I refer have been made and should be recognised.  It is clear that the HSE faces challenges with regard to the delivery of services.  To its credit, the HSE balanced its budget in 2008.  I am confident that in the difficult months ahead it will do the same within the new parameters set down for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">As Members are aware, the problems and difficulties to which I refer are not exclusive to Ireland.  We must acknowledge that issues arise, in an international context, with regard to the cost of health care services.  Dr. Michael Barry has provided information in respect of drug use and we must face the challenge in this regard as strongly and honestly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I have responsibility for child protection services.  Such services are delivered by the HSE through various local health offices.  As with so many health services, a legacy issue arises as a result of the changeover from the former health boards to the HSE.  Again, however, I am of the view that substantial progress is being made in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">As stated at the outset, the services provided by the HSE are often considered to be exclusively geared towards medical needs.  We must reflect, however, on the vital nature of the child protection services it provides.  A child who is damaged by way of abuse or neglect will carry a psychological scar throughout his or her life.  Medical problems can often be resolved without there being any undue legacy for the child or patient.  Child protection should, therefore, always be one of the most important services and should always be at the forefront of the debates in which we engage with regard to the HSE.  Let us be honest.  The debate on this issue has been ongoing for an hour and no one previously referred to child protection.  I am of the view that it should always be central to debates of this nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">We want to move forward in the context of standardising the business processes that obtain within the HSE.  In certain instances to date, performance has been patchy with regard to the way in which waiting lists are calculated and referrals to social work services are assessed.  We cannot, therefore, truly compare the delivery of child protection services throughout the country in a contemporaneous way.  As a result, the process must be standardised.  We have made substantial progress in this regard and I met representatives of the HSE earlier today in order to discuss the nature of that progress.  Cases such as that which arose in Roscommon underline the absolute importance of delivering a first-class, standardised HSE service.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The HSE is also responsible for the delivery of social services.  The services provided by social workers are too often denigrated.  In my view, social workers must deal with incredible challenges.  For example, they must decide whether to leave children with their families or remove them.  Such decisions can affect children for the remainder of their lives.  We must support social workers and talk up the work they do.  Morale is crucial to the delivery of good social services and we have an extremely important role to play in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I hope that in the coming months — if it can be agreed among those responsible for delivering the relevant services — we will be in a position to place in the public domain the information relating to some of the progress we have made.  By European standards rather than any subjective analysis, the HSE has made substantial progress.  We must remember the crucial and central role to be played by those charged with delivering child protection services and social workers in the overall area of health service delivery.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_200">
          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_407">I wish to refer to a matter of concern that arose last week, namely, a cut of 12.5% in the funding provided to the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  The voluntary organisations which work in this area and which receive funding from that office will be affected by this cut.  In addition, it will give rise to a diminution in the work carried out by the office.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I wish to comment on the approach adopted by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, in respect of the stresses caused by the downturn in the economy.  Levels of suicide and psychiatric illness, particularly depression, increase during recessionary periods.  In addition, during such times the level of suicide among those who are unemployed is higher than that among those who are in employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">It is my intention to contrast the decision of the HSE to reduce funding to the National Office for Suicide Prevention with the approach of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, who allocated an additional €11 million in order to deal with the new stresses that are having an impact on family life.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs recently stated that there is now, more than ever, a need to ensure that quality services are available in order to help families which may be experiencing new pressures and stresses in their lives.  In that context, we must recall that people are coming under psychological and emotional pressure and that there has been an increase in the incidence of suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Rather than emulating the approach taken by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE have decided to reduce the funding available to the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  The former Minister also stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_411">The difficult economic situation being experienced throughout the country is filtering into the lives and homes of families throughout Ireland.  Where a person loses their job or has their working hours cut back, this financial strain can lead to pressures in relationships.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">The Minister for Health and Children must recognise that pressure also comes to bear on the mental health and well-being of people affected by the downturn.  Why is this area of pressure being ignored?  In fact, there is a reduction in funding in this regard.  Another Minister, Deputy Hanafin, recognises the pressures that arise within a family.  She spoke about having a network of support services available throughout the country to provide marriage and relationship counselling services, which is the core part of helping families to cope with the problems with which they are confronted.  In her press release she identified up to 20 organisations for which she had significantly increased the Department's contribution.  However, the Minister for Health and Children has cut funding for suicide prevention by 12.5%.</p>

          <p eId="para_414">The Minister has cut it to all organisations.  An instruction was given to the National Office for Suicide Prevention, and it appeared in the press last week.  I have researched the matter and I am informed that this is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Research into suicide since the 1890s shows there is an increase in suicide rates and mental illness during times of economic recession.  Instead of cutting the level of funding to the National Office for Suicide Prevention, the Minister should emulate the action of the Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, and increase the funding by €10 million to allow the office to respond to the need that inevitably exists due to the recession and the increase in unemployment.  Economic strain and personal financial crisis have been well documented as precipitating events in individual deaths by suicide.  Research has been conducted in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe on this.  Stressful life events, financial and otherwise, have a significant impact on those who are vulnerable to suicide where typical coping mechanisms are compromised by the effects of mental disorder, substance abuse, acute psychiatric symptoms and the other risk factors associated with suicide.  There have already been several suicides that can be attributed to the difficulties and pressures arising from the current economic changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Increasing unemployment leads to an increase in suicide rates.  Unemployment has a profound effect on the person, especially on the young and middle aged.  Irish society still awards status and prestige according to a person's position and contribution to work.  Correspondingly, unemployment is associated with loss of face and of prestige.  This is compounded by the fact that we are emerging from a period when people had an expectation of high levels of income and high standards of living.  Many professional people, along with people from other socio-economic groups, are losing employment and their expectations for their futures are destroyed.  The level of pressure on them is accentuated due to the level of income and economic activity they experienced during the years of the Celtic tiger economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The unemployed are six times more likely to suffer from a psychiatric disorder than people in employment.  Studies show that those who die of suicide are significantly more likely to have experienced unemployment, job instability or occupational problems.  The Kelleher-Daly study conducted in Cork during the economic recession in the 1980s showed that of the male deaths by suicide analysed, two thirds involved men who were out of work at the time of their deaths.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">The high rate of home foreclosures is of particular concern.  There have been studies conducted in the United States with regard to suicide levels and their relationship to home foreclosures.  For most Irish people, their homes are their primary investment and the locus of their identities and social support systems.  When combined with loss of employment, home loss or the threat of home loss has been found to be one of the most common economic strains associated with suicide.  While there is a moratorium on foreclosures on the part of some of the banks, newspapers reported today that the courts yesterday approved nine home foreclosures.  The Minister has decided banks should not move to foreclose for a period of time, but the threat of what will happen their homes after 12 months will have a serious effect on the psychological well-being of people in those circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The Minister must immediately respond to the psychological, emotional and psychiatric difficulties affecting people as a result of the changed economic times.  In doing so, she must recognise the need to enable the National Office for Suicide Prevention to respond adequately to the inevitable growing demand for its services.  Dr. John Connolly, secretary of the Irish Association of Suicidology, stated recently in a newspaper interview that despite the shrinking public finances, it is vital that the Government invests more in suicide prevention and mental health services to reduce the number of deaths.  He said: "We must be aware of the fact that research reaching back to that of Emile Durkheim in the 1890s shows that in times of recession, suicide rates inevitably increase."  He told a meeting of the Oireachtas sub-committee on the high level of suicide in Ireland: "Unfortunately, this will happen in the coming months and years unless we ensure that funding for the implementation of the national suicide prevention strategy and other services is guaranteed."</p>
          <p eId="para_420">I ask the Minister to respond to that point.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Martin Mansergh)</from>
          <p eId="para_421">I wish to share time with Deputy Timmy Dooley.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I will start by doing something that is probably unheard of in this House, which is to praise the HSE.  I had the pleasure of opening a new facility owned by the Irish Wheelchair Association in Tipperary and both the association and those running the facility could not have been stronger in their praise of the co-operation they received from the HSE.  It underlined the fact that much good work is done each day by the people who work in and administer the health services, yet there is almost a blanket media and political negativity about the HSE.  It must make it more difficult and demoralising for people to do their job, and it is mostly a very good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">I take this opportunity to express my admiration for and confidence in the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  She took on a very difficult job some years ago and, despite the difficult financial situation, she is continuing to develop the health services and has managed to keep real cutbacks to a minimum in all circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I wish to put on record a few observations on the reconfiguration of hospital services in the south east.  There has been a great deal of investment in the South Tipperary General Hospital in Clonmel which, after decades, was chosen to be the principal site of services.  The choice was between it and Cashel.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">There has been much discussion and some speculation that may have been motivated with an eye to forthcoming elections.  There is no reason that a hospital such as South Tipperary General Hospital should not keep its maternity services.  There are no health reasons for concentrating maternity services in regional centres and centres of excellence.  I notice that in the reconfiguration of the Dublin hospital scene it has been suggested that stand-alone maternity hospitals should gradually cease to function and join with more general hospitals.  That situation exists in south Tipperary where there is no evidence of maternal or infant health problems, nor is there any suggestion that the hospital's performance is any less than in hospitals with an even larger throughput.  I make a strong plea that maternity services are maintained at South Tipperary General Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">I gather that when it comes to accident and emergency services there is a rule of thumb to the effect that people should not be more than one hour from a hospital.  However, by the time an ambulance gets to somebody, very often much of that hour will have already gone.  Even if an ambulance were to arrive instantaneously, there are many parts of south Tipperary that are more than an hour away from Kilkenny, Cork, Waterford or Limerick.  There has been much investment in South Tipperary General Hospital and I hope its character as a general hospital will be maintained.  I believe there is every reason that it should but I wish to put it on the record of the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_204">
          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_427">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  We have had an opportunity to discuss the issue on a number of occasions recently and it is always important that we continue to discuss the various changes that are taking place.  Health is an extremely emotive issue.  As a result, the notion of change within the system as it is delivered generates a considerable amount of fear.  Some of that fear is clearly well founded but more of it is unnecessary.  The difficulty is who decides what is well founded and what is not.  Therefore, it is important that people set out their views and proposals clearly on the delivery of health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I am reminded of an issue that developed in the area with which I am most familiar, namely, the mid-west, and the changes that were brought about to Shannondoc some time ago, which allowed GPs to facilitate their normal existence by putting in place a centralised out-of-hours service.  At that time people in rural and isolated areas had real concerns and fears that a doctor would no longer be available on-call.  Their fears were proven to be largely unfounded when the centralised service took up office and the necessary facilities were put in place.  The GP who is on-call is provided with a base, a driver and nursing backup.  That assisted to a considerable degree in allaying people's concerns out of hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I am somewhat concerned that, in their desire to have that service rolled out, GPs are now seeking to involve themselves in a debate that is largely to do with hospital consultants.  That is not to take from the work GPs will have to do to provide an ongoing out-of-hours service that will be affected by the reconfiguration proposals.  However, I appeal to GPs, the HSE and hospital consultants to come together to begin a dialogue for the sake of patients and the people who are perhaps unnecessarily concerned.  Given that there is a level of discord among all those involved, it is not clear to patients that there has been joined-up thinking.  I would welcome those three parties coming together to put in place the necessary solution to the problem.  There are always solutions to the kinds of problems that arise.  I hope the Minister might be able to facilitate that.  Clearly, there are industrial relations issues and financial implications for any agreement that might be reached.  However, I believe a resolution can be found.  Some GPs to whom I have spoken believe a solution exists to the concerns that have been expressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Particular concern has been expressed about accident and emergency services in Ennis General Hospital.  Much of it is unfair and unnecessary as a result of a number of cases that were highlighted.  Those cases have occurred in all smaller hospitals and it is unfair that the focus has been unnecessarily visited upon Ennis hospital.  We have to move beyond that because there is a fantastic team of very well qualified people there who have worked very hard in difficult circumstances to deliver a very good level of patient care over the years.  I hope that can continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Notwithstanding that, we must be open to change.  The system has let down many people.  I do not refer to the mid-west.  People have been let down from a patient safety point of view and from the perspective of outcomes throughout the country.  It is incumbent on all of us to listen to the advice of senior clinicians who have put forward a different model and methodology to deliver a service that will save lives.  It is easy to get tied up to some extent in the political debate and point scoring and to rely on what I believe is an outdated principle, the notion of the "golden hour", because the advent of advanced paramedics has enabled that to be overcome in terms of stabilisation on the roadside or other site.  For that reason we must listen to the people who are putting forward a better level of service.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">I appeal to the Minister to continue with the transformation she has started and to back it up, as she has indicated she will, with a level of investment.  Regarding the reconfiguration of the mid-west, there is a requirement for a considerable amount of funding to upgrade the ambulance service and the facilities at Ennis General Hospital.  Based on the various discussions I have had with the Minister, I know she is committed to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">This is a political Chamber and we have political debate in it.  People on the other side have put forward various different points of view.  They have asked pertinent questions.  I wish to pose some questions to the other side through the Acting Chairman, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</p>

The Minister of State is very concerned about the time it takes to get to Clonmel hospital from parts of Tipperary while Deputy Dooley said the "golden hour" makes no difference whatsoever.

          <p eId="para_439">Obviously, €480 million is a significant shortfall to have to make up.  We met the Minister for Health and Children recently and it is evident that things have changed rapidly in the meantime.  She indicated in regard to funding that she is ruling nothing in or out tomorrow morning and for the budget.  Does that mean the promises made at the meeting attended by the mayor of Clare and councillors have gone out the window and that there are changes to what the Minister outlined?  She indicated to me that there are no plans to close the hospital or acute hospitals but at the same time she said the situation regarding funding will be kept under review.  There is much uncertainty currently.  People are fearful about what will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The Minister indicated she would implement the Teamwork report.  Given the serious funding problem, what will happen to the required upgrading of the ambulance service and to the funding required to upgrade Limerick Regional Hospital?  Will the Minister put the Teamwork report on hold?  That issue is also very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">Deputy Dooley inquired whether Fine Gael Members would resign if we were in the same circumstances.  I remind him that not one cent has been spent on Ennis General Hospital in recent years.  We have received promises from Minister after Minister and we still do not know what will happen to the hospital.  Perhaps we can get some answers from the Minister for Health and Children in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_445">I understood the VHI spend was €1.5 billion and when I asked the Minister where the rest of the money came from, she informed me that it came from the private sector.  I hope she will be able to share her sources with the House to back that up.  How many new consultant posts, rather than new consultants, will there be?  I am not interested in hearing about how many consultants will retire or how many new ones will take their place, but in how many new consultant posts there will be outside of the cancer strategy.  She could also inform us how many new consultant posts there will be including the cancer strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">I am in no doubt about where cuts should take place and where they should not.  We must protect patients and patient services, stop the huge amount of waste and reform the service.  This has not happened and the Minister has not outlined a clear plan or strategy for reform, which must be an integral part of what she is attempting to do through budgetary restraint.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">Will the Minister comment on the difference between the comments of Deputy Dooley and the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, on the "golden hour"?  Does the Minister think the "golden hour" is important?  I would like to follow up on a question asked by my colleague, Deputy Sherlock.  Is the report correct and is the Minister considering closing Ennis, Bantry, Mallow and Monaghan hospitals?  Is that one of the issues being considered by the HSE and has it informed the Minister of that?  If it is, what is the Minister's view on it?</p>
          <p eId="para_448">Must the Minister approve the HSE cutbacks?  The HSE has already made a cutback of €530 million, identified after the agreement of the 2009 service plan.  Now there is an extra €480 million shortfall, which brings the total shortfall to over €1 billion.  Will the Minister approve the cutbacks or will the HSE be free to make cuts without approval?  In other words, is there political control over them?</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Both Deputy Neville and I pointed out that the number of extra people needing medical cards because they lost their jobs would lead to a predicted shortfall of €170 million and that we would also have a €100 million shortfall in the health levy because people had lost their jobs.  The Minister stated it was appropriate that the Department of Social and Family Affairs should get extra money in order to provide unemployment benefit and assistance to people who lose their jobs.  Is it not appropriate that the Department of Health and Children should also get extra money?  The Minister should fight for her Department to get the estimated shortfall of €270 million following the loss of the levy and the increased number of medical cards.  Professor Drumm has estimated a slightly higher shortfall.  Should this loss not be spread out over all Departments and spending rather than have to be covered by the health budget?</p>

I submitted a question previously to the Department on the issue of a related Labour Court decision and it has been referred to the HSE.  The decision was that a consultation process would take place between the staff, a union representative and the HSE before the cuts were made.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_455">The recruitment process will take place this year.  As the Deputy is aware, it sometimes takes a while to carry that out.  Recruitment for some posts has been taking place, but it is intended to recruit the consultants.  The cost of new consultant posts must come from a reduction in the amount of money we spend on non-consultant hospital doctors, of whom we have 4,900.  Deputy Reilly made the point earlier that doctors should not work such long hours.  I mention in passing that the overtime bill was €347 million and the allowances negotiated in various negotiations amounted to €700 million.  The total for both is €1 billion.  Clearly, people cannot be paid more for working fewer hours than they were paid for working longer hours and that is the issue currently being negotiated through the industrial relations machinery of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I will get the information the Deputy requires on the €4 billion.  Some 78% of the money spent on health in Ireland is from the public purse, at €16.2 billion, while 22% is private.  That includes, in addition to the VHI, the other insurers — the Garda, the ESB, Hibernian and Quinn.  It also includes people who pay fees to their general practitioner, money paid for drugs and a host of other things, such as outpatient charges, etc.  However, I will get the data for the Deputy on the matter.  I do not have it to hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">With regard to Deputy O'Sullivan's question and the reconfiguration of hospitals, even if there was no extra money available, this must happen.  It is a patient safety issue and a priority.  The manner in which we organise the delivery of acute hospital services does not deliver safe care to patients.  Approximately two weeks ago, I said in the House that we are moving to a scenario, on foot of the recommendations from the patient safety commission, where all health providers, beginning with the acute hospital sector, will require licensing not just for the hospital, but also for the activities within it.  We know that no licensing system would licence many of the activities in our hospitals because we are not in a position to deliver quality care given the configuration of our acute hospital services.  Therefore, we are moving to a scenario where hospitals will be networked together with a specialist hospital at the centre and the less acute activity happening in the smaller hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">This is the model of care that will be replicated around the country.  It is the only model of care that can deliver safe care.  It is happening very successfully with breast cancer, where 60% of the transition has now occurred.  The rest will occur this year.  This has been highly successful and great credit is due to Professor Keane.  As he said to the Cabinet sub-committee, which I mentioned publicly last night, when that happens, it will put Ireland in the top three countries worldwide as far as the organisation of breast screening and breast cancer services are concerned.  We must emulate that with lung and prostate services and move on to colon and colorectal screening and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">With regard to Mallow, the HSE must submit a revised service plan to me for that hospital.  I wrote to the chairman of the HSE in the past week in response to his letter and asked for a response.  However, in advance of the Government's determination, in the context of the forthcoming measures to be brought to the House in early April, clearly they are not in a position to finalise the changes that might take place until we see the actual scenario.  As I said at the outset of my comments earlier, we are premature to the extent that there will be budgetary changes on spending and taxation brought before the House in three weeks time.  Clearly, health, given it accounts for 25% of budgetary spending, will be affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The effects of the growing level of unemployment on both the levy on the appropriation side and the medical cards on the cost side will be considered by the Government, but in advance of any Government determination, which has not happened, I am not in a position to deal with that issue here.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">We are not discussing the closure of hospitals but the reconfiguration of hospital services around the patient safety agenda.</p>

          <p eId="para_470">The service plan and any adjustment of it must be approved by the Minister and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is in the 2004 Act and will be complied with.  We are making radical changes in what happens in the hospitals with terrific clinical leadership, which has emerged for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Deputy Ferris asked about an audit.  I do not know who is supposed to carry out the audit.  We have had health and safety reports and fire reports on some of the long-term facilities and people do not seem to be very happy to accept them.  Experts on safety from either a health and safety or fire point of view are often challenged in this House when recommendations are being implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Deputy Ferris asked a similar question on hospitals to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  There is no plan to close any hospital in the country.  Major reform is taking place in the north east, particularly regarding what happens between Monaghan and Cavan where there is a single hospital on two sites.  There is reconfiguration on what happens in each site.  The more acute services happen in Cavan and many of the day procedures happen in Monaghan.  That is well documented.  Deputy Ferris's colleague recently attended a meeting with me and all the Oireachtas Members for Cavan-Monaghan with the chief executive officer of the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">I do not have details on the disadvantaged area projects the Deputy mentioned.  If he submits them to my office, I will seek to get a response for him.</p>

          <p eId="para_474">On the day the Teamwork report was published, there were patients on trolleys for up to three days in the north east and the hospital had to close for a time.Is the Minister familiar with the highlands and islands of Scotland model of health caredelivery?  Is she familiar with the models used in Cornwall and in the Downe hospital in Downpatrick, which provides health care to a peninsula, which is similar to County Clare?  It is essential that we maintain and work within the "golden hour", the standard international maximum time limit to treat anybody who has suffered a stroke or heart attack or who has been involved in an accident.  I want to know if the Minister is familiar with those models of health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">I appeal to the Minister to walk away from the Teamwork report.  Great concern and anger has been expressed by the people of County Clare.  Along with other Deputies, I have attended public demonstrations and meetings where GPs, nurses and ambulance personnel have expressed deep fears and concerns about patient safety if accident and emergency services are removed from Ennis General Hospital.  I ask the Minister to step back from this, examine it and listen to the people on the ground, the GPs, nurses and ambulance personnel who have major concerns about this.  I ask the Minister to take those concerns on board and walk away from the Teamwork report.</p>

Patients will not be any safer sitting on trolleys for hours on end waiting for attention in the accident and emergency in Limerick than they will be in the smaller hospitals.

We have 600 voluntary organisations in the disability sector in Ireland.  Last year, they had to take a 1% cut in their administrative budgets and this year there will be a second 1% cut in that administrative budget.

          <p eId="para_494">I am aware that going into an accident and emergency department where the doctors treating one have no specialist training is unsafe and is not recognised by anybody.  Earlier this afternoon, I had a meeting with Professor Tanner of the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, an accident and emergency unit consultant from Beaumont Hospital and others on trauma and the importance of auditing.  In the course of this meeting, we discussed the importance of getting victims of trauma experiences such as road traffic accidents to a specialist centre as quickly as possible after paramedics get to the scene of the accident.  Mortality outcomes are improved by 25% when this happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The "golden hour" is not about taking one to a place called "hospital" and once one is there, suddenly one will be saved.  It is about getting one as quickly as possible to specialist care.  This brings me to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's question.  Mr. Burke has been given clinical leadership responsibility in the mid-west.  He will press the green button on when accident and emergency services transfer.  My understanding is, and the intention is, that it will happen in April, which is next month.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The two vehicles for the advanced paramedics have been purchased and are ready.  They are in place.  Some capacity issues have been dealt with in the hospital in Limerick.  The critical care unit is a longer-term project and it will not happen prior to the summer.  It is not a necessity for the transfer of seven patients on average per night from Nenagh, six of whom should have been with their GP, and the nine patients from Ennis, many of whom should have been seen by their GP also.  This transfer does not need the critical care unit to be in place in advance.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_558">Last October, the Labour Party tabled a Private Members' motion calling for action on tackling the jobs crisis.  Back then the problem was obvious.  We had an extra 100,000 people on the dole in the previous 12 months.  The solution was obvious.  We needed an urgent response from the Government, such as a jobs plan, a training plan, an income plan, and a completely new approach to the needs of the unemployed.  The truth is we did not get any plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">The budget, the smart economy document, social partnership talks, the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis and the Green Party national conference have all come and gone and still there is no announcement of a jobs plan.  The October budget focussed on cutting back supports for the unemployed rather than reinforcing them.  The draft framework for a pact for stabilisation, social solidarity and economic renewal, stated, "We will convene a jobs and skills summit in March 2009 to devise innovative approaches to the maintenance of employment, the creation of new employment and early and active engagement with those losing their jobs."  Where is that?  It has not happened.  Crazy as it is, it is still the policy of the Government that one must be long-term unemployed before one is eligible for key supports.  How can a welfare system that promotes dependency ever hope to succeed?</p>
          <p eId="para_560">In the meantime, the dole queues have grown longer.  A total of 44 social welfare offices have recorded a doubling of their live register number in the past 12 months.  The numbers signing on at a dozen welfare offices have trebled since the last general election.  The processing times for jobseeker claims have also grown longer.  The average wait per social welfare office for jobseeker's allowance claims is now six weeks, while 17 social welfare offices have a waiting time of two months or longer.  The waiting times for self-employed people are particularly long.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Pressure of numbers has led to the awful sight of long queues of newly unemployed people stretching down the main streets of our towns in the cold and rain.  There are very practical steps that could be taken on this specific issue.  One step is to schedule appointments so that queuing time is minimised.  Another is to have sufficient indoor waiting accommodation either in the social welfare office itself or closeby.  People are entitled to be treated with dignity by the State.  Another practical step is to provide better supports and to insist on better returns from the social welfare branch offices.  At branch offices, which are run on a contract basis by private individuals, the local branch manager determines staffing levels.  Therefore, while there have been some extra personnel processing claims in local offices, it is not clear how many, if any, extra staff have been employed by branch managers.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">In 2008, branch managers were allocated €9 million between them to deal with claims on behalf of the Department and we are entitled to ask where is that money going when the processing times are so dreadful.  Of the 17 social welfare offices that have processing times of more than two months, 15 of these are branch offices.  Either the Minister is not supporting branch offices enough, or the branch managers are not employing enough staff.  There has to be a serious question mark over whether this system is working and whether there is sufficient flexibility at times of high demand.  Wherever the fault lies, it is the responsibility of the Minister to ensure every jobseeker can expect to have his or her claim dealt with speedily at his or her local office, no matter who is running it.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">This motion is about urging the Government to get up off its backside and confront this problem.  There are several areas where urgent action is needed.  For a start, it is time to reform the back-to-work supports, such as the back to education allowance and the back-to-work enterprise allowance.  These supports were established to tackle long-term unemployment, which consists of people who have been out of work for a year or more.  In the case of the back to education allowance, the usual waiting period for an applicant applying for a third level course is one year, although it can be even longer depending on when a course begins. For the back-to-work enterprise allowance, the usual waiting period is two years.  These rules need to be changed.  The welfare system should be about preventing long-term unemployment rather than promoting it.  It should be possible for those who have been made unemployed to avail of these schemes within three or four months of losing their jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">People who have received statutory redundancy are already permitted to avail of these schemes immediately.  Therefore, the principle is already accepted.  However, we know that many people do not receive statutory redundancy in this day and age.  What is the argument for precluding those people from access to these allowances?  The enterprise allowance would be revenue neutral if the business lasted five years and would pay itself back sooner than that, if the business resulted in the recruitment of additional staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Last year, the Labour Party brought forward its idea of an earn-and-learn scheme.  The idea is that where a person is on a short-term working contract, he or she would be enabled to take up a training or education place for the days in which he or she was not employed.  Job retention schemes along similar lines are operating successfully in the Netherlands, and we could adopt those as a model.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">In addition, it can be difficult for people who want to keep occupied while unemployed to conform to the current eligibility rules for jobseeker's benefit.  One employer contacted me last week to complain that a former employee, a jobseeker who he let go because of falling revenue, contacted him asking if he could work for free for two hours, three days a week.  He was still available for other work and actively seeking it.  He just did not want to be idle.  When they inquired with the local social welfare office about this, they were laughed at.  Obviously, we could not have a scenario in which a job was being replaced, but at the same time, our welfare system should place a value on people keeping occupied while they are looking for work.  Very soon we could have 400,000 people doing nothing, because that is what the current rules require them to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">The suggestion that appeared in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent </i> to recruit teacher apprentices is worth considering for unemployed graduates.  Graduates gain work experience in their own field and are paid €20,000, which is the cost of each job that is lost to the economy.  It is an idea that could work across all sections of the Government and with all professions.  For example, it could be applied to accountants taken on by the Revenue Commissioners, architects and planners in local authorities, occupational therapists and other therapists in day centres and many grades in the health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Another pro-jobs initiative would promote the use of career breaks and flexible working arrangements.  Not since 1980 have we had such a surge in births.  There have been 72,300 births in the 12 months to last April, while 165,000 have joined the dole queues in the past year.  That presents a scenario in which many people do not have enough work, while many others have too much.  Career breaks are rarely offered to employees outside the public service.  A scheme should be introduced that provides incentives to employers to offer career breaks or flexible working arrangements, while providing employees with a legal entitlement to their jobs back and security on other issues when that leave ends.  For example, employees do not qualify for social insurance credits if they take career breaks, and that could be tackled.  In recent months some employers have chosen this option, most notably the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">The choice to take time out, that many young parents and other carers would like to make, is not an option for many and has little legal protection for those who have that choice.  Promoting and delivering on such a scheme would make more room in the workforce, reduce unemployment and provide flexibility to families and carers when they need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The Government should also reform community employment.  There is a great opportunity to match several sets of needs by expanding the number of community employment places.  One in three of those on the live register is a former construction worker or from that general sector.  Within that cohort, there are several thousand workers who are over 50 years of age and have general trade and handyman skills.  There is a significant demand among this group to find fulfilling employment in the social economy sector.  At the same time, there is no State scheme of assistance for senior citizens who cannot manage minor repair jobs to their homes.  Not everyone can rely on family members.  Very often these jobs are funded by a community welfare officer and the additional cost to the State of expanding community employment is not substantial.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">The needs of early school leavers must also be addressed.  In particular, we should not allow the situation where the first act of a school leaver is to sign on the dole.  There should be an entitlement for every school leaver to a place in employment or training.  Financial support should be contingent on meaningful participation in such courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">As part of any such measure, the Government must lift the cap on post leaving certificate courses using a portion of the funds set aside for the 51,000 training places for newly unemployed people.  At present there is a total cap of 30,000 on post leaving certificate course numbers.  The City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee stated that there is a significant demand for places with 3,000 students enrolled over and above the numbers of places for which there is funding.  The cost of providing extra places is marginal as most of the infrastructure and services already exist.  Similarly, the cap of 5,000 on the vocational training opportunities scheme should be lifted.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">There are many other areas that deserve Government attention.  The national development plan must be dissected again, audited for the number of jobs it can create, and re-prioritised on that basis.  The Government should ensure that local employment services are extended throughout the country as I still hear of people turned away for financial assistance on the basis of their address.  Every unemployed person should also be guaranteed access to the services of a career coach with appropriate human resource training.  The Government must also review the criteria it uses to judge projects it funds through public procurement procedures.  We must give the greatest weighting possible to recruiting unemployed people and local labour.  Finally, start-up grants for new business are not sufficiently geared towards modern businesses and should be reformed accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The point of the motion is that there is more to Government than simply balancing the books.  The Government has been obsessed with balancing the books in recent months and has completely neglected the jobs crisis affecting tens of thousands of citizens.  The 200,000 people that have joined the live register since the last general election are stuck in a system that was designed for a different era and it is time to change that system.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">If the Government is serious about taking up ideas from the Opposition and dealing with our problems in a non-partisan way, it will listen tonight.  It is not possible to solve the budgetary crisis without solving the jobs crisis.  The Government should give us a national plan now and let us get on with getting people back to work.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_291">
          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_576">The current unemployment crisis is the worst in the history of the State and there is no prospect that the haemorrhage of jobs will stop in the near future, unless the Government gets its act together.  It must do so now in an unequivocal fashion.  We need innovative ideas and new initiatives.  The old solutions are packaged in a way which will not suffice in the current economic climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Some commentators have suggested that the current crisis is not as bad as that with which we had to cope in the 1980s.  However, that is incorrect, because in the 1980s there was a halt to the modest economic growth of the 1970s and most people had not experienced prosperity.  It was also possible for the unemployed to emigrate, and many of our families did so, as the UK and the USA were growing rapidly.  I remember it was said at the time that there was not room enough for everyone to live on this small island.  However, we may soon find out that we can all live on this island if unemployment continues to rise and the unemployed see no prospect of finding work at home or abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">In its current state of panic, the Government is trying to blame the global recession for all our problems.  However, most people understand that the policies pursued by Fianna Fáil-led Governments in the past decade have left us ill prepared for the current crisis.  I do not wish to bore the House with economic theory, but every first year student of economics learns that in managing the economy, Government policy should be counter-cyclical.  This means in a boom period the Government dampens the boom by controlling spending and, if necessary, increases taxation to pay for essential services.  Since the days of the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, the policy of "If I have it, I spend it" resulted in the Government fuelling the boom and now that it is over, the cupboard is almost bare and the few bones in it must be used to prop up the banks which were responsible for criminally irresponsible lending that has contributed such a great deal to the current crisis.  At a time when banks should be lending to support existing and new businesses, they are unwilling to do so, because they are hoarding capital in order to deal with the crisis caused by irresponsible lending.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Let us consider the situation of the Small Firms Association.  Many of its members have had various experiences dealing with the banks and many are now on the brink of failure because of the lack of credit, which is the lifeblood of business.  Small and medium sized enterprises are the engine room of the economy.  Credit is not being made available to these firms.  Worse still, some of the banks are refusing to pass on the reductions in interest rates.  We now have the worst of all options.  Overdrafts are being reviewed very critically and some are, perhaps, subject to reductions.  It is difficult for new loan facilities to be approved which would pump in money and get new ideas off the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">The question small businesses are putting to me and my colleagues is: Whither the benefits of the €7 billion recapitalisation plan?  Who is benefiting from it?  It is not filtering down to the small businesses which are crucial to the economic well-being of the country and to many places especially throughout rural Ireland.  The three, four and five jobs that such firms provide are of paramount importance to ensuring the sustainability and viability of a great many families in the country.  Entrepreneurs with innovative ideas do not get a chance to launch their ideas.  Deputy Shortall is correct to say we must change the ideas.  Let us consider start-up grants and cut out the nonsense.  Some of the grant schemes are as old as Methusela and have not been amended to reflect the new challenging economic environment in which we find ourselves.  They were fine when the boom was under way and when everything was floating but they are no good now.  We must change the situation in order that the small businesses which create five or six jobs mean something.  Whether it is the manufacturing, technology, science, food or retail sectors, such businesses are soundly based.  Many are family owned and operated.  They will fight to the very end to survive.  No red carpets are rolled out for such people.  Such businesses started from nothing and very often their success was the result of hard work generated by husbands and wives or partners.  We must help such people, because these are the people who will get us out of this recession.  They will save this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Given the crisis in the public finances we cannot engage in the stimulation measures that other small, open economies could use to help weather the current crisis.  The measures to be introduced in the mini-budget may worsen unemployment by reducing disposable income and the demand for labour.  We must contrast this with the UK and Northern Ireland where the Government is in a position to reduce taxes and stimulate the economy.  We are all aware of the substantial rise in cross-Border shopping which is causing a further loss to tax revenue and jobs here.  I am aware that the Government must give priority to the fiscal crisis.  However, it seems that apart from warning of the increase in unemployment there is no strategy to deal with it.  Hundreds of jobs are being lost every week in the construction industry.  However, the school building programme for which money is already allocated is incredibly slow and some 45,000 pupils languish in prefabs.  It takes the Department of Education and Science years to approve a new school, never mind build it.  This is the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">We have proposed several ideas.  It is a significant and traumatic experience for anyone to be told his or her services are no longer required, in other words, that one is being made redundant.  Behind all the statistics, especially the 353,000 unemployed, there are human beings, their families and dependants.  Losing one's job is most sickening.  I recall when my father became unemployed in the 1960s.  We were young children, aged between 12 and 14 years at the time and we had some understanding of the situation.  However, the younger ones did not realise.  It is an awful trauma to be visited on anyone.  Jobs are disappearing at the rate of greater than 1,000 per week.  At present, 353,000 people find themselves standing in dole queues, queueing up in inclement weather outside doles office which cannot accommodate them.  Some 200,000 people have lost jobs since the last general election representing a cost of €4 billion.  The Government is seeking €4.5 billion.  We have the statistics.  Some 200,000 people cost the State €4 billion, which is a very significant sum of money in terms of social welfare benefits and income tax foregone.  That calculation is made without consideration of the cost of secondary benefits and the loss of spending power in the economy.  The loss of spending power is being experienced in every retail outlet and is forcing many small, family run businesses to shed employment.  As many as 250,000 such businesses provide up to 750,000 jobs.  We must help this sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The Labour Party has made a number of proposals.  As noted in the 2007 Forfás report, Towards Developing an Entrepreneurship Policy for Ireland, there is a major problem in the area of entrepreneurship policy.  While I cannot deny that the Government is investing in programmes which aim to develop and encourage small businesses and entrepreneurship, too many agencies, bodies and Departments are involved in this area.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment supports entrepreneurs and start-up businesses through a range of bodies, including city and county enterprise boards.  The Department of Education and Science is responsible for the delivery of entrepreneurship education and training in the education system.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is responsible for Udarás na Gaeltachta, the Leader programme and area partnerships.  The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is responsible, through Fáilte Ireland, for the development of tourism enterprises.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is responsible for regulating residence and work visas for third country citizens and issuing business permissions to such individuals.  The Department of Finance is responsible for overseeing the fiscal incentives for enterprise establishment and equity investment such as the seed capital and business expansion schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">Let us get our act together.  Ireland lacks an explicit and articulated entrepreneurship policy directed at ministerial level.  All the responsibilities I have cited should come within the remit of the Minister.  One Department must run the show and perform all the activities currently carried out by a variety of Departments.  There is no overarching forum and policy is all over the shop.  One should not have to run from Billy to Jack, Joan or Mary to secure information.  Policy and initiatives must be driven in a coherent manner, as recommended in the Forfás report in 2007.  Nothing has been delivered in the meantime.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">A number of Departments are responsible for delivering various initiatives which impact on entrepreneurs and the environment in which they operate.  The policy is fragmented across Departments and agencies and should be pulled together.  We must meet the challenge in these difficult times.  My proposal is not an airy-fairy suggestion but a positive proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">I have further proposals.  The Minister should remove the eligibility conditions attached to the back-to-education and back-to-work allowances and the vocational training opportunities scheme.  Education is the way forward.  We need to get people into the institutes of technology, as has been proposed in the case of apprentices in SR Technics.  The theory element of the apprenticeship should be brought forward and the apprentices allowed to attend the institutes of technology for nine months, by which time we will, I hope, have turned the corner and work will be available in the aviation sector.  Deputies Broughan, Costello and others from the northside of Dublin have articulated this argument very well.  Let us give these young people an opportunity to complete their apprenticeship.  We need aeronautics technicians and engineers.  We might as well pay the €300,000 it would cost to allow them to transfer to the Dublin Institute of Technology which is ready and willing to facilitate them.  I know the Minister is on top of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">On social welfare payments, why not allow employers to top the unemployment benefit or jobseeker's allowance of individuals to bring their income above the minimum wage?  Such persons could then be engaged in meaningful activities.  Let us be innovative and flexible in the new circumstances we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">It is not possible to supply a service for less than €37,500, which is the threshold at which companies must pay VAT.  The figure must be increased to €60,000 or €65,000, while the VAT threshold for those supplying goods should be increased from €70,000 to €120,000.  The Government will strangle companies with regulation.  The complexities of VAT would require a small company to employ a bookkeeper for half a day each week, costing another €80.  I know from personal experience that the steps I advocate will work.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The Minister should also expand community employment and job initiative schemes.  The role of the county enterprise boards, which are involved in job creation measures affecting fewer than ten people, an area not covered by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, should also be expanded.  A wider range of start-up grants is also required and greater discretion should be allowed in this area which is excessively restrictive and governed by too many eligibility criteria.  These grants must be changed to reflect the current circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">We spend too much time examining issues when we must translate ideas into action.  It is often argued that the Labour Party does not have ideas.  We have many positive ideas and are making them now.  Let us act on them to get people back to work.</p>

          <p eId="para_591">I thank Deputies Shortall and Penrose for tabling the motion.  They have articulated a number of ideas which would allow the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to address the current crisis.  I hope she has been listening to their contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The unemployment figure increased from 327,000 in January to 350,000 at the end of last month.  It has increased by 200,000 in two years and the rate of increase is accelerating.  The average increase in unemployment of 12,000 per month has almost doubled in the past two months and unemployment will almost certainly reach 450,000 by the end of the year, the figure cited by the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">We would not be going down the road of introducing a mini-budget next month to plug a hole of €4 billion in the Exchequer figures if the number of unemployed had not increased so substantially.  The cost of 200,000 unemployed people in tax foregone, social welfare payments and secondary benefits roughly equates to the €4 billion being sought in the forthcoming budget.  Clearly, therefore, job creation, retention and support are key in the economy and it is in these areas that the hole must be plugged and initiatives taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">As Deputy Shortall noted, the Government does not have a coherent national jobs plan.  This is outrageous given how long the crisis has lasted.  The priority must be to prevent job losses.  I will not repeat the many suggestions made in this regard, except to add one proposal, namely, the need to adopt "flexicurity", a new concept which forms a major part of the European Union's Lisbon strategy.  Flexicurity is a flexible approach to work practices, which includes options that are family friendly while also providing security.  The European Union provides supports for such initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">The initiative I propose to emphasise most also emanates from the European Union.  This is the need to ensure cashflow for small and medium enterprises.  As the Tánaiste will be aware, at their summit in October 2008, EU Heads of State and Government put together a €30 billion fund which member states could access to inject funds into small and medium enterprises.  As far as we can gather, however, the Irish financial institutions have not called down one cent of this fund.  Six months after the event, we are informed they will establish structures for this purpose.  Why are we starving these enterprises of cashflow, which is, as Deputy Penrose noted, the lifeblood of employment?  Without cashflow, how will companies continue to function?</p>
          <p eId="para_596">We have guaranteed the banks and invested large sums in recapitalisation but are unable to put a penny into cashflow.  Perhaps the recently nationalised Anglo Irish Bank could be used as a vehicle for calling down this money and injecting it in the economy where it is much needed by small and medium enterprises.  Something must be done in this regard.  Given that money is available, the Minister must grab it and use it to try to ensure jobs are not lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">A survey of all businesses, large and small, should be carried out and the State should have a database to enable intervention to take place where and when it is needed to prevent companies such as SR Technics and Waterford Crystal from going to the wall, leaving the State to carry the can.  Given that many other companies are threatened, it is important to have information well in advance.  We need to know what supports such companies need and what intervention mechanisms are necessary to try to keep them going in this time of crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">I am aware my time is running out.  I heard on the radio today that the National College of Ireland is providing 300 places for the unemployed.  I do not think many people in this House know that the NCI's capacity is capped at 8,500.  The Government will not allow it to accept more students and it recruits largely from the local area.  This would be ideal.  Deputy Penrose mentioned DIT, whose colleges and faculties are out there waiting to be used if the Minister wishes to use them.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Jervis Street training centre, which is in my constituency, along with the centre in D'Olier Street, provides 30% of all employment services in this country, yet the Minister is closing down the Jervis Street centre.  There will be no new training services because of a row with the landlord.  The landlord has made an offer to the Department with very good terms, but it is not prepared to accept it.  Why can the Minister not work on this and make sure there are adequate employment and training services?</p>

        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_293">
          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_600">I thank the Labour Party for sharing time with me.  I and my party support this motion in the name of Deputy Róisín Shortall.  The news last week that more than 350,000 people are now unemployed, and the prospect of up to 600,000 people on the dole by the end of the year, is simply frightening.  We are looking at an economic catastrophe and if the Government does not change its direction and focus on job creation, future generations of Irish workers, and indeed the Irish people, will pay a terrible price.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">The announcement of closures from Dell in Limerick to SR Technics in Dublin is like a horror story.  Every day more and more workers are being told they will no longer have a job.  Behind all these figures lie real human stories.  Thousands of families are coping with unemployment, which is very demoralising, leaves them in difficult financial circumstances and causes much strain on family relations.   As our mortgages and rents are among the highest in Europe, families in Ireland are paying a far more terrible price than any of our European neighbours.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The Government built its reputation on job creation.  Despite the clear problems in our services, Ministers from the Cabinet said that, if nothing else, the Government had created jobs.  They patted themselves on the back.  However, we have now seen that our economic policy of short-term jobs for short-term gain is a complete failure.  Real job creation can only be achieved when it is based on sustainable policies.  The Government did not listen to us when we warned that our economy was disproportionately reliant on the property market.  It is now obvious to everyone — economists, trade unionists and employers — that the Government is incapable of learning from its mistakes.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The most disappointing aspect of the Government's performance over the past six months is that it seems to be behind the curve on almost everything.  It is almost as if the recession was something that came out of the blue — something unexpected, like a car crash.  However, when we look at the figures it is obvious that the writing was on the wall since December 2007.  In our pre-budget submission in September or October of 2006, we pointed out that there was a massive bubble in the property market and in consumption.  However, from the end of 2007 onwards there was a sharp increase in unemployment.  The figures went up and up, while job creation fizzled out.  This was something that was clear for all to see, yet the Government made no contingency plans to deal with it.  Instead of planning for the economic crisis, the Government acted as though we were entering a new era of prosperity.  Our former Taoiseach spent his last month of office going from one wine reception to another, patting himself on the back and telling everyone what a great contribution he had made to the economy, while our current Taoiseach paraded around County Offaly on the top of a bus.  While the Government was engaged in typical Fianna Fáil triumphalism, the economy began to fall off a cliff, and it has not stopped falling since.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">During the summer months and towards Christmas 2008, those bearing the brunt of our economic downturn were labourers and tradespeople in the construction industry, workers in manufacturing, architects and estate agents.  However, this tsunami of unemployment has now spread to those in other professions, including solicitors, accountants and bank employees.  The director general of the Law Society said recently that hundreds of solicitors were out of work, while major accountancy firms such as KPMG have announced 10% reductions in staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">Despite the Government's claims that the global downturn is responsible for the problems in our economy — although I accept this is a major factor — the fact is that it promoted a complete over-reliance on the property market while effectively ignoring other critical sectors such as manufacturing and SMEs.  This has led to the mass unemployment that has caused suffering to thousands of families.  Many of these job losses are unquestionably linked to the collapse of the property market.  Solicitors' firms became reliant on conveyancing, while our banking institutions engaged in more and more reckless lending to fuel property speculation.  This came about because of Government policy, which sought to make property speculation and development the foundation of our economic policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">These professionals and tradespeople who are now unemployed will not find any work in their areas of expertise.  The Government must make a choice; either it will provide — very rapidly — other areas in which these people can use their skills, or it will force them to emigrate, leading to a brain drain which will perpetuate our economic woes.  For those who have been let go but still have their qualifications, the situation is bad, but for those who were made redundant in the middle of their training it is far worse.  In response to a parliamentary question I submitted to the Minister recently, I was told that 3,078 apprentices were made redundant in 2008.  Already in 2009, hundreds more apprentices have been let go, which will probably shortly include the 60 apprentices at SR Technics.  The number of solicitor apprentices and trainee accountants has massively increased.  FÁS has not been equipped to handle the volumes of apprentices who need to complete their training or be directed into further training.  If we do not invest properly in retraining these young people, they will be left in a very vulnerable position.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">There is an overall lack of focus on the needs of young people.  More than 14,500 young people have been on the dole for more than six months.  Despite the Government mantra of encouraging retraining, this is simply not happening, and there is insufficient investment in getting our younger people back to work.  One way in which the needs of younger people can be addressed is by lifting the cap on enrolments in third level courses, as called for in this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Due to the Government's inaction, our social welfare offices are being overrun by construction workers, retail sector workers, professionals and young apprentices.  The Government has not equipped them properly to deal with this wave of unemployment and by the admission of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, the waiting time for processing applications for social welfare benefits has increased massively.  In welfare offices in Maynooth and Bandon it is taking ten and 13 weeks, respectively, to process allowance claims.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs has accepted that the additional staff taken on to deal with the upsurge in claims have no proper training.  If there is no training it is difficult to see how we can bring down waiting times.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">It is questionable whether enough human resources are being put in place.  Perhaps if members of the Government released some of the 90 civil servants doing their constituency work for them——</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_611">——we would not have this major problem dealing with our welfare claims.  It is unacceptable for the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, and others to have six civil servants doing their constituency work.  The Minister, Deputy O'Dea, also has two full-time drivers.  Using civil servants on varying pay scales to carry out Ministers' constituency work is, in effect, a raiding of the public purse by Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Minister, Deputy Harney, in an effort to enhance their chances of re-election.  Nobody would object to any Minister having a single civil servant to do his or her work, but I do not think they are worth six each.  That is going beyond the norm.  The five additional civil servants are the equivalent of five nurses, midwives or gardaí, or any of the other front line public servants that are urgently needed.  I enthusiastically support the Labour Party motion.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_640">There is no doubting the seriousness of the current economic environment.  Regrettably, significant unemployment is again an issue at the top of our national agenda.  The numbers on the live register represent the human reality of these difficult economic times.  Families who never contemplated having to base their weekly budgets around jobseekers' benefits and other social supports are now having to do so.  It is a dramatic change for these families, and indeed for our wider expectations as a people, in a short period of time.  It is a challenge this Government is working hard to overcome and we are conscious that people across the country want to know that we are taking the action necessary to ensure Ireland is best positioned when this period of economic turmoil comes to an end.  I assure them that we are taking such action and that my priority as Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is simply jobs, jobs, jobs.  My objectives are protecting those jobs currently in our economy, creating and attracting new jobs, putting in place a clear vision of where the jobs of the future are to come from and equipping people with the skills necessary for those jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">The current global economic storm has been exacerbated by credit constraints and prolonged by a decline in consumer and investor confidence.  The Government is responding to these issues in a context of worsening public finances.  The decline of confidence and credit has very significantly reduced property and construction activity.  As a result, the jobs and incomes to individuals and the State associated with that activity have diminished.  The downturn is now impacting on all sectors of the wider economy and presenting us with difficult decisions and consequences.  It is unlikely that we will see a return to growth in the short term.  This makes the series of measures we have introduced to increase training places, enhance job search services and speed up jobseeker payments all the more important.  I will speak about each of these measures presently but it is important that the Opposition and everyone else is crystal clear as to the challenging environment in which all of this is being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">Short-term action will help those losing their jobs but we must also stabilise the public finances.  We must meet our commitment to a 9.5% GDP deficit limit.  This will ensure the stabilisation and sustainability of the public finances, which is an essential prerequisite for economic renewal.  We must protect our international reputation for borrowing and attracting foreign direct investment while continuing to support those hurt by the downturn and investing in the research, training and infrastructure that will drive economic and employment growth as Ireland recovers.  The supplementary budget which we will present to this House in April will address these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">To respond to the present economic situation and in particular the increasing numbers of people on the live register, I am working closely with my colleagues, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, to ensure that appropriate responses are developed and put in place to meet the upskilling needs of those who are losing their jobs or facing uncertain employment prospects.  In particular, we are identifying opportunities for increased collaboration between FÁS, the institutes of technology and the VECs with a view to ensuring that we secure the optimal return from the expenditure of scarce resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">While my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, will outline some of the measures she is taking to deal with the increasing numbers of unemployed, I wish to speak about the measures I am taking in my own Department to support those who find themselves without work.  We are responding to the rising live register numbers through a variety of measures.  FÁS's employment services, together with local employment services, have been working to provide greater job search assistance to the increasing numbers of unemployed.  The implementation of these measures will nearly double the monthly capacity of job search services from 6,500 to 12,250 persons per month.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">Furthermore, FÁS and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are currently operating a pilot initiative in two locations, Letterkenny and Clondalkin.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_647">This initiative involves the immediate referral of clients aged 18 and 19 to FÁS employment services.  The pilot is due to conclude in late April after which its effectiveness will be reviewed.  Deputy Shortall has raised this matter.  Having met with the participants, I consider it a very worthwhile initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">In a difficult employment climate such as that which we are currently facing the importance of training and education to maximising reskilling and upskilling opportunities is vital for the entire workforce.  The impact of such training opportunities on those who are out of work and seeking to rejoin the labour market cannot be overstated.  The training and education programmes funded by the Government through my Department and the Department of Education and Science are designed to increase the skills and competencies of participants and thereby increase their employability and hopefully enable them to secure alternative employment at the earliest opportunity.  In addition to the economic benefits associated with participating in upskilling and reskilling programmes, they provide a valuable social service by ensuring that individuals remain active and continue to learn so as to be ready to take up employment when job growth returns.  In light of the obvious importance of training, I have already announced that an additional 51,000 training places are to be delivered by FÁS this year.  These places are specifically tailored for individuals who are recently unemployed and who wish to add to their existing skills in order to improve their prospects of securing employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">This new initiative enhances FÁS's existing portfolio of traditional course offerings and will be delivered through three core training initiatives, namely, ten-week courses, night courses, and on-line courses.  The night courses offer a flexible alternative to those whose circumstances may not allow them to attend during the day and the on-line courses provide a good option for those who need a fast and flexible intervention and who prefer a self-directed e-learning and blended learning environment.  My announcement last month means that FÁS is providing a total of 78,000 training places under this initiative.  This is almost a three fold increase in the provision of these types of training places.  It is an important development in terms of responding to the number of people now on the live register.  However, the Government is fully aware this is only one measure.  We are continuing to actively explore other initiatives to further increase the number of training and education places available to people seeking employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">FÁS and other State agencies have formed an early response team to deal with significant redundancies.  The nature of the response is to conduct interviews on a voluntary basis with those who wish to explore employment and retraining options.  Such interviews would normally be conducted on site with the co-operation of the employer and would take place in advance of any planned lay-offs.  Training interventions and other supports would then be provided as required.  FÁS services in this area include one-to-one occupational guidance and priority access to appropriate vocational training; job club referral options; individual assessment and guidance; group and individual training options; upskilling for specific targeted alternative employment; in-house dedicated employment services facilities; and organisation of jobs fairs in conjunction with other employers and agencies in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Particular support is also being provided to redundant construction workers.  Since the beginning of last year we have witnessed a dramatic reduction in construction related activity.  This has resulted in a significant fall in the numbers employed in the sector since 2007.  The Government is committed to providing assistance to these individuals to increase their skill levels and in some cases develop new skill sets which can take advantage of the opportunities in new emerging growth areas within the construction sector.  These include the installation of energy efficient and renewable technologies and compliance and regulatory work.  Since November 2008, FÁS training centres have provided training to approximately 880 trainees in these emerging areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">In addition to the usual supports that it provides to redundant workers, FÁS has established a training fund to provide a timely response to identified training needs for low skilled and redundant craft workers from the construction sector.  The agency is also assisting Irish construction workers who wish to continue working in the industry to obtain employment abroad in other EU member states.  Discussions are ongoing with agencies in Canada and Australia to support the recruitment of crafts persons from Ireland.  In the delivery of these services, FÁS liaises with the other relevant agencies including Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the city and county enterprise boards and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The significant reduction in the number of people employed in the construction sector has led to a rising number of apprentices being made redundant.  The Government is determined to provide support and assistance to these individuals so they are given every opportunity to complete their apprenticeships.   To date a number of innovative measures have been initiated to assist them, including allowing redundant apprentices to progress to their next off-the-job phase of training without completing the relevant on-the-job phase.  It is expected during 2009 that in excess of 1,200 redundant apprentices will receive off-the-job training.  At present, 539 redundant apprentices are attending an off-the-job phase.  The employer based redundant apprentice rotation scheme aims to provide redundant apprentices with the on-the-job experience they require to complete their apprenticeships.  This scheme will provide assistance for up to 500 redundant apprentices.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">ESB Networks has agreed a programme with FÁS to provide 400 redundant electrical apprentices with on the job training opportunities at phases 5 and 7 over an 18 month period.  Léargas has provided part funding under the EU's Leonardo da Vinci programme to support the placement of 26 redundant apprentices with overseas employers to complete their phase 7 on the job training, and FÁS has submitted a further proposal to Léargas for up to 60 additional redundant apprentices to complete their on the job training in Finland and Germany.  As a result of these measures, almost 2,200 apprentices who have been made redundant should be able to progress their apprenticeships.  The Department will, of course, continue to consider further initiatives to assist redundant apprentices in completing their apprenticeships.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">The Government is also committed to assisting the most vulnerable in our society, including those who for various reasons have over time become distanced from the labour market and are seeking to re-enter it.  The community employment scheme is an active labour market programme which is currently helping 22,469 long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a normal work routine.  The programme assists them to enhance and develop both their technical and personal skills which can be then used in the workplace.  The programme is sponsored by groups wishing to benefit the local community, voluntary organisations and public bodies involved in not-for-profit activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">FÁS continues to develop the content of the CE programme.  The new approach involves the introduction of an individual learner planning process which focuses on meeting the learning needs of participants.  The individual learner plan provides for the planning, organising and recording of the work experience, training and development that each participant receives while working on CE.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">Job initiative is a programme that provides full-time employment for 1,431 people who are 35 years of age or over who have been unemployed for five years or more and in receipt of social welfare payments over that period.  The main purpose of the programme is to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities.  The programme achieves this by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities.  The programme is sponsored by groups wishing to benefit the local community, namely voluntary organisations, public bodies and those involved in not-for-profit activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">This Government will continue to support the positive role of FÁS employment schemes in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  I am keeping the operation of the schemes under constant review in the context of the current difficult unemployment situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">This Government has always believed in the benefits of investing significantly in our education system.  We increased investment in higher education to €2,000 million in 2008, an increase of 135% since 1997 that supports participation by more than 170,000 learners.  We have also increased our investment in the further education sector to €414 million last year, an increase of more than 400% since 1997.  As a result of this Government's substantial investment, 145,000 learners had access to learning opportunities last year, an increase of 95,000 over the equivalent 1997 figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">A key priority for the education system is to continue to respond to the needs of learners and of course the wider needs of society and the economy.  Since 1997, we have introduced a variety of measures across all sectors of the education sector to increase the learning opportunities and enhance the access all individuals have to education in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">In the further education sector, we introduced the back to education initiative, which provides flexible part-time options across further education and is aimed at adults with less than upper second level education, including unemployed adults.  It aims to give adults who wish to return to education an opportunity to combine their return to learning with family, work and other responsibilities.  To facilitate access and participation, programmes are offered on a part-time basis or at weekends.  Under this initiative any adult with less than an upper second level education is entitled to free tuition.  This year 9,000 individuals will benefit from participating in this initiative.</p>

          <p eId="para_663">In addition, the vocational training opportunities scheme is a second chance education initiative designed specifically for the unemployed.  Unemployed persons who are at least 21 years of age and in receipt of specified social welfare payments for at least six months are eligible to participate.  It aims to give participants' education and training opportunities, which will develop and prepare them to go into paid employment or on to further education opportunities leading to paid employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">As a result of the downturn in the economy, it is anticipated that the intake to higher education institutions will be much higher in 2009 as other options for school leavers diminish.  As jobs continue to be lost across the economy, it is critical that the capacity of the higher education sector to provide for fundamental upskilling of the workforce is enhanced and developed.  There is no cap on places in higher education generally and this is in line with the Government's policy objectives of increasing participation in higher education from both a social policy and economic development perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">The institutes of technology are taking steps to utilise all available capacity to provide upskilling for those who have become unemployed or are facing uncertain employment prospects, including the provision of preparatory courses for those who may be a long time out of the formal education system.  Colleges will expand provision from September 2009 in course areas where employment opportunities are likely to develop and will provide enhanced opportunities for progression to other higher education programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The introduction of the multi-annual strategic innovation fund for higher education has been a major catalyst in introducing more flexible and innovative approaches to the delivery of programmes responsive to the needs of industry and to an increasingly diverse group of learners.  Under the fund, the institutes are also examining the scope for more flexible delivery of provision, including the possibility of alternate start dates and accelerated programmes in order to utilise capacity that may develop due to attrition.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Despite the current global turbulence, the Government remains determined to further develop the country's economy and create the right conditions for fostering growth in the business sector.  In recent years, economic growth in Ireland has been driven by domestic demand and not by international competitiveness.  As domestic demand has weakened we must look to exports for a sustained economic recovery.  Indigenous exporters are and will continue to be critical in the achievement of future economic stability and job maintenance and growth in the Irish market.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">Our principal focus, therefore, is on supporting the growth of a cohort of Irish companies with the ambition, leadership and innovation necessary to achieve global scale.  To support industry and the economy as a whole, a targeted focus must be placed on sustaining and creating exports.  In directing this focus, the development agency, Enterprise Ireland, has a dedicated task force which is actively working to respond to the changed economic environment.  This will ensure the supports offered to companies are the most relevant and effective in addressing the current realities facing businesses across the manufacturing and internationally traded sectors throughout Ireland.  It is critical that we continue to invest in the companies upon which our economic recovery depends.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">To that end, I have already put in place an enterprise stabilisation fund, which was announced by the Taoiseach just over a week ago, to allow meaningful additional assistance to be provided to basically sound internationally traded companies that would otherwise struggle to survive the global downturn.  The fund will operate in conjunction with the banks and will supply direct financial support to eligible internationally trading enterprises which are undertaking development expenditure to reduce costs and gain sales in recession hit overseas markets.  The fund will complement the banks' commitment to SMEs under the recapitalisation scheme and should facilitate much of the restructuring that is needed for viable companies selling on the home market.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">County enterprise boards also have an excellent track record, working with local entrepreneurs to give focus and to develop sustainable, growth-orientated local enterprises which can deliver high quality job creation without displacement or dead weight.  They provide valuable assistance and I am confident they will continue to be to the fore in developing and supporting our economy through these challenging times.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">While assisting Irish companies to expand their international footing and their domestic performances, we also attract new investment to these shores through the Industrial Development Agency.  We have attracted many of the leading companies, mainly in information communications technology, life sciences and globally traded business and financial services.  It is because of our targeted approach, our flexibility, our human capital and our support within the taxation system that we heard the announcement today of 500 jobs in Leixlip, with an opportunity to increase that by a further 500.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">Good ideas have been put forward by Members of the Opposition and, with the scarce resources available, we are examining how to keep people in employment.  We are looking at ways to support employers to keep those who may lose their jobs at work two or three days a week.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, the Minister for Education and Science and I are looking at targeted and focused ways to be innovative.  I have taken on board the discussions that took place on the European model, which has something similar to support people in employment.  At the Competitiveness Council last week, I raised with Commissioner Verheugen the absolute necessity to set aside some of our EU legislative frameworks in order to be more flexible and innovative in supporting people in employment, as well as creating new opportunities for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">I have taken into account the Deputies's contributions.  All new initiatives and ideas are certainly worth examining.</p>

          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_674">Tá áthas orm an deis seo a ghlacadh chun labhairt ar an ábhar seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">I appreciate the fact that the Labour Party has tabled this motion recognising the difficulties people are experiencing.  This time last year none of us would have imagined the current scale of unemployment, nor the terrible atrocities that have happened in Northern Ireland.  It has happened so quickly that the whole environment has changed for our country.  I wish to assure the House, however, that we fully appreciate the difficulties for people who are losing their jobs.  People who have worked all their lives never anticipated that they would ever have to sign on.  That in itself is a stress for them before they ever get to a social welfare office.  Naturally, we are trying to ensure not only that the right financial supports are available, but also that people can get them as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">Due to the numbers signing on we have had to ensure that our staff are working to full capacity.  I have to say that they certainly are working extremely hard to deal with the increased number of claims, and productivity increased by 74% between the last quarter of 2007 and the final quarter of 2008.  The numbers on the live register are undoubtedly very stark.  There would of course be others who have been making claims also.  When one sees an increase of 165,000 — a rise of 87% — between February 2008 and last month it puts particular pressure on those affected as well as on their families.  In addition, the increased numbers put pressure on staff in social welfare offices and the difficulties of the financial situation generally have placed pressure on the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">Social welfare staff have made their best efforts to try to meet all those needs.  Some 246 additional staff have been allocated since last May to help minimise delays in claim processing.  They are not extra staff coming into the public service, but come from other Departments.  Some 190 of them have been allocated to local social welfare offices around the country.  However, many local offices have reached, or are close to reaching, capacity in terms of the number of staff that can be accommodated.  While the Office of Public Works has been tasked with finding new accommodation for local offices in some areas, we are also setting up a number of central decision units around the country to ease the burden on those offices that are under pressure.  Four such units are being set up initially — with ten staff each — while it is expected that more will be established in the coming months.  These are just processing the applications and making decisions, so they will release the burden from some local offices back into these central units.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_304">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_678">What about the branch offices?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_305" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_679">Some 16 social welfare inspectors are also being assigned to various locations throughout the country to undertake means testing and other work associated with processing claims for the jobseeker's allowance.  This is important at the initial stage of making claims — particularly the jobseeker's allowance where means testing is done as quickly as possible — but also as a control measure to combat fraud.  Those inspectors are urgently needed, given the current numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">We recognise that providing additional staff is only one element in dealing with the increased volume of claims and therefore a number of measures have been taken, to date, to improve claim processing procedures.  These include the introduction of a streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous two years; the testing of an improved procedure for claimants moving from jobseeker's benefit to jobseeker's allowance, which we plan to extend to all offices later this month; on-line availability of application forms for the jobseeker schemes; and the use of an appointment system for taking claims in some offices which we intend to roll out to other areas over the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">By introducing these initiatives, I am trying to ensure that the process is as easy as it possibly can be.  I know that processing times in some areas are still too long but we are taking the necessary steps to reduce them.  While every effort is made to ensure that applications are processed as quickly as possible, Deputies will be aware that anyone who is under financial pressure while awaiting a decision on a claim for a jobseeker's payment can apply for supplementary welfare allowance, which is also subject to a means test and other qualifying conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">Apart from providing income supports, the Department of Social and Family Affairs also has an important role to play in helping people back to work.  The Tánaiste has outlined some of the measures that are being taken in this regard.  My Department works closely with FÁS in providing opportunities for people on social welfare to access the range of training and employment services offered by that organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The national employment action plan is the main welfare to work measure.  Under this plan, all persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching three months on the live register are identified by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and referred to FÁS for interview with a view to assisting them to enter or re-enter the labour market.  This process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the live register.  It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services offered by FÁS.  Based on the latest information available, a total of 60,260 people were referred to FÁS in the period January to December 2008.  Of these, more than 33,900 had left the live register by the end of January 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">In addition to the services offered by FÁS, the number of facilitators in the Department of Social and Family Affairs has also been increased from 40 to 60, while a further ten are due to be appointed.  Facilitators work closely at local level with those on the live register to determine their needs and arrange appropriate training and developmental programmes for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">A key aspect of the enhanced facilitation service is co-operation between the Department and other agencies, such as FÁS, the VECs and the HSE.  The vision is of a single, transparent system with a primary focus on the customer and a route map starting at the first point of engagement with the Department.  The facilitator programme is designed as a targeted approach, involving active case management and the development of an individualised progression plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">A number of specific initiatives have been developed with a focus on young people who are signing on the live register.  In summer 2008, the Department conducted a targeted programme to encourage young people between 18 and 25 years of age who were signing on the live register for more than six months, to gain additional skills and qualifications under the back-to-education scheme.  Facilitators arranged meetings with clients under the age of 25 years in an attempt to raise awareness of the education opportunities and supports available, and to encourage them to take up courses in the autumn that would be appropriate to their needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">A further initiative being developed at present involves the immediate referral of 18 and 19 year olds who sign on the live register to FÁS to undertake specific targeted short courses, rather than awarding welfare payments.  This is currently being tested in two locations.  I am anxious to ensure that initiative is spread throughout the rest of the country as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">In addition to the general activation programmes, the Department of Social and Family Affairs also has two key schemes aimed at long-term unemployed persons: the back-to-education allowance and the back-to-work allowance.  The back-to-education allowance is designed to encourage people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, consequently, their prospects of returning to the active work force.  It enables qualified people who have been getting a social welfare payment to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">In general, to qualify for participation an applicant must be at least 21 years of age and must also have been in receipt of a social welfare payment immediately prior to commencing an approved course of study for at least six months for a second-level course and 12 months for a third-level course.  The 12-month requirement is reduced to nine months for people participating in the national employment action plan.  People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided their entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">The objective in setting up the scheme was to help unemployed social welfare recipients, by way of education and training, to improve their prospects of acquiring sustainable employment.  A waiting period is considered essential to confer entitlement to income support for an indefinite period and is considered necessary in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need it most.  I am currently examining this particular scheme to see if it is targeting such people.  I am also anxious to ensure that people who plan to go to college anyway should not try to organise their affairs to qualify under this scheme.  It should be noted that the number of participants increased by 46%, between January 2008 and January 2009, to more than 11,500 people.  Expenditure this year will be €88 million, but I will continue to keep it under review.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">The back-to-work scheme was introduced to assist long-term unemployed people, lone parents and sickness-related welfare recipients to return to active employment.  There are two strands to the scheme: the back-to-work allowance for persons who take up employment; and the back-to-work enterprise allowance for those who become self-employed.  There has not been a great take-up of the back-to-work allowance because we have not had that number of people unemployed for such a long time.  There is scope under the back-to-work enterprise allowance to facilitate more people, to which I am open.  I heard Deputy Shortall's views on this and I look forward to hearing others'.  There are 17,613 on the two strands and the amount of moneys allocated this year is €80 million.  We are determined not only to ensure financial support is available, but also to help them improve their future job prospects through education and training.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">As the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment said, the Cabinet's economic sub-committee is working closely with the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment on this.  We recognise the severe difficulties faced by people.  The pace of change has caused problems in social welfare offices but I know the staff are doing the best they can to facilitate people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_695">I welcome this motion and commend Deputies Shortall and Penrose for putting it before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">I do not need to advise the House of the extent of the unemployment catastrophe facing us.  This month, the standardised unemployment rate is 10.4%.  Even though there is an international financial crisis, unemployment in Ireland is the fourth highest in the EU.  Few countries outside the EU have such high unemployment levels.  Ireland has gone from a country of low unemployment to one of high unemployment.  Despite other countries facing recession, not one has leapt from the bottom of the unemployment league table to near the top.  Ireland is ahead of France, Germany, Italy and numerous countries we would have perceived to have failed economic policies and systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">It will certainly get much worse with up to half a million people out of work by Christmas.  I fear there may be many more next year.  When we arrive at that stage, it will not be possible for the Government to finance itself, pay the social welfare bill or public service salaries, leaving us in a position the State has not faced since the late 1920s or early 1930s.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">The Government will bring forward a mini-budget, or potentially a maxi one, in the next several months which will mainly focus on cuts in spending and increases in taxation.  Both measures are necessary.  It is important tax increases come with the broadening of the tax base and do not fall for the easy options of higher income tax and more taxes on business.  There needs to be more to the Government's policy than just a catalogue of spending cuts and tax increases.  What we need, and what has been missing, is an economic plan to support business and sustain jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">Some of the proposals put forward in the Labour Party's motion are good in that regard.  I agree with the proposal for an earn-and-learn scheme for those on three-day weeks participating in training on the other days and the increase in community employment places.  While evidence shows the latter is not particularly useful in getting people back into employment, it does perform an important social role.  At a time of rising unemployment, and the potential return to long-term unemployment, it is important to get people back into an occupation in some way.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">The proposals for career breaks and sabbaticals in the public service would be useful not just in creating jobs, but achieving the cost savings Ministers are seeking.  There might be many public servants, particularly those approaching retirement, prepared to go part-time or take a career break and they should be facilitated to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The Government's approach to training has been disappointing.  While 51,000 additional FÁS training places have been created, they are not for real.  They involve one-week and two-week courses with a few night courses and mainly on-line ones.  A whole new approach to training is required.  The €1 billion FÁS budget should be liberated into a system of individual training accounts or vouchers that would allow people to chose the training they want.  That will be particularly relevant to the new middle-class unemployed, those with degrees and professions, for whom there is no real training option with FÁS.  If they were given €4,000 they could attend an institute of technology or university to study for a Master's degree or get the training they want.  The Teachers Union of Ireland recently put forward a good document, which I endorse, on how much of FÁS's budget could be directed towards vocational education committees and institutes of technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">There is also a case for having a public works scheme for those who have lost their jobs in the construction industry.  Moneys from the national development plan could be used to create public works schemes for housing and schools, particularly in disadvantaged areas, involving unemployed construction workers and apprentices.  This would be done much cheaper than at the market rate.  Obviously, however, it would have to be done on a limited scale as it could distort the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">The national development plan needs to be refocused towards smaller labour intensive projects, such as small roads, schools and primary care centre schemes, coming in under €20 million in costs.  The funding cannot be directed at large projects which will go to large companies from other countries.  We all understand the capital budget will be cut in the forthcoming budget but there are other ways.  Moneys from the National Pensions Reserve Fund could be invested on a commercial basis in, say, a toll road scheme from which it would receive its return.  People may hate to pay tolls but if they knew they were going into their pension fund they might feel a bit better.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">I am becoming very concerned at the number of people under 25 years on the dole.  In the Dublin West constituency, it stands at 2,000 when it was almost nil two years ago.  Many of these people are falling into long-term unemployment.  For this age group, there should be a flexicurity system whereby they are required to participate in training or employment to receive their benefits.  We cannot allow a situation whereby those who went into the construction industry at 19 years of age and earned €80,000 a year are writing themselves off, claiming there is no job that can even deliver half that wage for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">Business needs to be supported, measures for which have been missing from the Government's plans to date.  Energy prices are too high.  While I accept they have been reduced recently by 10%, there is no reason that Ireland's energy prices should still be higher than the European average.  The energy regulatory regime in place needs to be gotten rid of and energy prices reduced to the European average in two years with a detailed schedule on how this will be achieved.  If the ESB were to go bankrupt as a result, so what?  Energy prices need to come down and the ESB needs to cut its costs if needs be.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">We need to use the opportunity of this recession to develop a new system of local authority funding and remove rates from businesses.  We must stop expecting businesses to carry the entire costs of local government.  Certainty is needed with the minimum wage.  I suggest it is frozen for two years so that employers and employees have certainty about costs and incomes.  The existing joint labour committee rules, employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements need to be reviewed, as well as the national pay agreement which has gone out the window anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">The reduction of red tape is also important.  Inserting clauses in leasing contracts which do not allow rents to be reviewed downwards must be made illegal as the practice hits businesses badly.  There must be a proper public procurement system that gives small and medium-sized enterprises an opportunity to win government contracts which they are currently finding difficult.  The work permit system needs to be reviewed as to whether they should be given for certain jobs when there are people in the country who can take them up.  Employers' PRSI contributions must be suspended for those companies taking on new employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">I understand an announcement is imminent that Skillnets will be cut back by a further 25% this year.  That is a big mistake.  Skillnets provides training through 100 different companies across the country, doing a good job with enterprise-focused and led high-quality training.  There are no empires in operation within Skillnets.  It is not like FÁS; it works very well.  It is a mistake to reduce the Skillnets budget from €26 million to €21 million — a decrease of 25%.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">There is no real evidence of the Government's willingness to reduce the budget of FÁS, which spends €140 million on administration and corporate affairs and a further €140 million on services to business.  The latter is, in the main, handed over to the social partners for them to spend as they please.  The Government should be bringing about its cuts in respect of these budget lines within FÁS and not in respect of CE schemes, apprenticeships or Skillnets.  As already stated, Skillnets works very well and, if anything, its budget should be increased and it should be asked to assume responsibility for training some of those who are newly unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">I welcome the motion.  The situation we face is serious but not hopeless.  The Government's policies, as outlined in the amendment, are hugely disappointing.  For the Government, it is a question of managing rather than reducing dole queues.  We want to reduce those queues and an economic plan — as opposed to a mere fiscal plan — will be required in that regard in order to support business and get people back to work.</p>

          <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
          <p eId="para_711">I commend the Labour Party on tabling the motion, which contains several interesting and innovative proposals for the support of those who find themselves in the awful situation of being unemployed.  Many of the proposals to which I refer focus on retraining, upskilling and allowing people to avail of the opportunity of moving into different types of employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Emphasis should also be placed on protecting existing jobs.  We are in a recession and we should consider the path we wish to take in the future.  We must lay the foundations now in order that we might attract investment and develop new opportunities when we begin to emerge from this difficult period.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">I agree with the proposal regarding the need to refocus the national development plan, particularly in the context of placing an emphasis on labour-intensive projects and activities that will keep small, local economies in existence.  Earlier this evening I attended a briefing provided by the Construction Industry Federation at which representatives outlined the dire nature of the situation faced by those within that industry.  In any downturn, the construction industry is always the first to suffer and provides the initial indication that things are about to take a nose-dive.  When matters improve, however, this industry is also the first to benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">Everyone is aware that the level of unemployment among those in the construction sector is high.  However, there are ways of dealing with this.  For example, why is it not possible to accelerate the school building programme, which would give rise to labour-intensive activity, and create employment locally?  Planning applications could be fast-tracked and standardised designs could be adopted in order to get things moving.  In the long term, accelerating the programme would be cheaper than having people claiming jobseeker's benefit or allowance.  In addition, the construction of community health centres could be carried out on a PPP basis and this would also contribute to local economies.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The position with regard to the VAT rate should be examined.  The high level of VAT is giving rise to difficulties in areas situated adjacent to the Border.  Retailers and traders in these areas are feeling the effects of the VAT differential.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">There are many, including Members, representatives of the construction industry and others, who state that small businesses cannot obtain funding.  For the want of a small amount of money which the banks could provide, these businesses are making people redundant or going to the wall.  The banks have been provided with a great deal of support by taxpayers and they should, in turn, facilitate small businesses that provide employment.  What is happening at present does not make sense.  This is a matter on which the Government should focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">I am sure the House will, at a later date, have an opportunity to discuss the report published yesterday by the National Competitiveness Council on education.  Investment in education has always been the cornerstone of our economy.  However, the report to which I refer indicates that there has been a serious deterioration in the number of students taking science and technology subjects, engineering and computing.  The HEA has indicated that the numbers relating to mathematics, science and computing dropped by 13% last year.  This will prove to be a serious disadvantage for Ireland.  We must consider putting in place a strategy in respect of the provision of information and communications technology in schools, we must examine why there is such a disincentive for students with regard to taking up mathematics and we must ensure that students are attracted to disciplines relating to mathematics, science, engineering and technology.  As the Government outlined in Building Ireland's Smart Economy, the future of this country lies in promoting development in the areas to which I refer.  If we do not have suitably educated and trained personnel available and if we do not address the skills shortage that exists, we will be at a disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">This motion relates to an extremely important matter.  I am sure it will continue to dominate discussions in this House for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_719">I commend the Labour Party on tabling the motion.  As a Deputy who represents a Border constituency, I am aware that many businesses in the region are experiencing severe economic difficulties, particularly in the context of the recent increase in VAT.  In light of the possible increases in excise duties on petrol and diesel, it appears that, for many people, the more things change the more they stay the same.  Business people in Border counties are of the view that they are suffering as a result of their geographical position.  This matter must be taken into consideration in the forthcoming budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">As the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, who is present, is aware, there is a need to deal with the psychological stress and fatigue caused by the recession.  The psychological effects of the recession are having a massive and traumatic impact on families whose children are attending secondary school or college.  These psychological effects are also impacting on people's health and are giving rise to an increase in crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">An interdepartmental report in respect of the north west was launched by the then Minister, Deputy Martin, a number of years ago.  This report contains a number of good suggestions and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise and Employment should examine it.  What is required is a synergy aimed at facilitating incisive educational courses for those to whom Deputy Varadkar referred, namely, those who are under 25 years of age, who possess university degrees and who want to avail of retraining opportunities.  We must consider the proposals in the report to which I refer in respect of entrepreneurship, resilience in personal development, innovation and creativity and capability training.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">At present, departmental service providers are working in isolation.  The HSE, FÁS, the VECs and various education providers offer great education delivery and other programmes.  However, we lack the fusion required to create the type of synergy to which I refer and to encourage participation on the part of the private sector.  In my constituency, Marine Harvest, which is a local indigenous company operating in the area of aquaculture, possesses the type of resilience, experience and expertise into which we are not tapping.  This company is willing to expand its operations.  The people who train and work with the company are not being retained in Ireland.  Instead, they export their skills to countries such as Chile.  Opportunities exist in the north west and there is a coastal community there in which people are pursuing their right to work, be it in the fishing industry or elsewhere, in order to put food on their tables.  We live on an island that has massive potential which is not being harnessed.  Ordinary men and women are seeking delivery in terms of breaking down bureaucracy and getting rid of red tape.  They have ideas for marine coastal development through marine tourism, marine alternative indigenous industry and aquaculture.  We can create jobs along the coast.  For every job at sea we can create seven jobs down the line.  Allow us, for starters, to create ten jobs at sea and we will deliver 70 jobs for the Government.  The Government is looking for ideas from this side of the House.  If it creates ten jobs at sea, we will deliver 70 more.  I leave the Minister with that suggestion.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_723">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue, the imminent closure of the SR Technics facility in north County Dublin and the knock-on effects the loss of 1,100 jobs will have on north and west Dublin and the adjoining areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">I am appalled at the treatment SR Technics has meted out to its employees both in its refusal to honour its commitments in the pension fund and in the paltry redundancy offer it has made.  It is clear SR Technics has an agenda relating to Dublin Airport which involves closing down a potentially viable operation, if necessary changes were made, and shifting its business to the Middle East and Far East.  My party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, and a number of our spokespersons have visited the facility.  I have been impressed by the positive role of the workers and unions in SR Technics.  It has been interesting to see how that union in the public sector refuses to accept even modest reforms and cuts while the same union in the private sector has been so proactive in trying to save jobs and an industry by putting forward a cost saving plan, offering to take pay cuts and redundancies and offering to change work practices.  It behoves the Government and the Minister to do everything they can to sustain this industry and save as many of the jobs as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_725">I understand a number of companies have expressed an interest in taking over SR Technics but we have yet to hear any detail about it from the Government.  I hope to hear such detail tonight, in particular about what measures the Government will put in place to support a new buyer or management buy-out if that is possible.  Obviously, the Government should not put itself in a position where it is obliged to bail out every industry in the State, iconic or otherwise, but where supports can be offered, they should be offered.  Furthermore, where supports would be offered to a foreign direct investor, there is no reason that similar supports could not be offered to a management buy-out team or a similar investor who might be in a position to save this industry and these jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_726">This is not the type of industry that will bounce back after a recession.  If we lose this aviation maintenance industry in north County Dublin, it will not return when the economy recovers in a few years.  I wish to impress on the Government the urgency of the situation and the importance that it does everything it can to save this industry and as many jobs in SR Technics as possible.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_727">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The Government very much regrets the announcement by SR Technics of its intention to close its operation at Dublin Airport.  The Tánaiste recently met with a delegation representing the trade union interests in the Dublin operation, who outlined their concerns about the proposed closure.  Similar concerns have been relayed to the Tánaiste in the many approaches from and meetings with public representatives and other interested groups about this sad issue for the workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">The Government is anxious that as many jobs as possible are secured at Dublin Airport.  We would like the SR Technics group to do what it can to facilitate this, such as helping to promote the capabilities and skills available at the Dublin facility, agreeing to an orderly wind-down of the facility to give IDA Ireland an opportunity to promote the location to interested parties and maintaining assets and equipment at the site for at least six months.  There are a number of expressions of interest from different parties in possibly all or part of the business and time is needed to assess these proposals.  The Government is anxious that the facility and the workers will maintain their IAA approval status while the alternative proposals are being progressed.  The Tánaiste has conveyed these points, and the widespread concern in Ireland that every effort be made to maintain the maximum number of jobs at the facility at Dublin Airport, to SR Technics at group level, as a follow-on to her meeting with the company in February.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">A number of meetings have taken place between the State, its agencies and the company in the past year.  The company explained that it had been exploring all options for its Dublin operations, including sale to another party, but had not found it possible to proceed with any of these.  The company outlined the deterioration that had taken place in its global business since mid-2008, with contracts moving to eastern Europe, Jordan, Turkey and Malta.  It confirmed that it was putting in place a five year restructuring plan and that it had already reduced its worldwide workforce by 500 in the last year.  The company stated that the recent loss of major contracts, its current business and economic forecasts, as well as its high cost base and over-capacity at Dublin airport, had made it impossible to continue a sustainable business in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">SR Technics provides line maintenance for the Aer Lingus fleet at its Dublin base.  This is a long-term contract awarded by Aer Lingus in 2008 following a competitive procurement process.  The company had indicated that it hoped to assign this and other smaller operations to another operator, offering the potential of saving up to 200 jobs.  IDA Ireland has had an ongoing relationship with the company over many years and approved a significant training grant package for the company in 2006 to assist it in maximising efficiencies and improving competitiveness.  The IDA also had discussions with the company about its business plan and further opportunities to assist the company with additional financial incentives such as research and development and information support with the emphasis on innovation and process development.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">In the light of the announced closure of the Dublin plant, FÁS has been to the forefront in providing intervention and support to employees facing redundancy.  It is currently in contact with SR Technics management to discuss the services available from FÁS and the potential needs of the employees.  Each response will be tailored on a case-by-case basis.  The FÁS services to business unit will also be involved in these consultations.  It is important to establish how best FÁS can assist the workers.  Following this initial contact, a judgment will be made on the level of FÁS intervention required.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">It is important to reiterate that there are a number of expressions of interest from different parties in acquiring all or part of the business, and both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are actively exploring options with interested parties.  Actual involvement by IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland in providing financial or other supports will be dependent on a company or companies submitting proposals for consideration and seeking approval for State support in the normal way.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">As regards the level of redundancy payments, anything above the statutory requirements is a matter for the parties concerned, although I obviously wish to see the workers benefiting to the maximum extent.  The full services of the Labour Relations Commission are available to the parties.  This issue has been raised on a number of occasions by Deputies in the House.  Every Member of the House fully understands the concerns of the workers not only about the job losses but also about the redundancy payments.  We hope the company will try to maximise any redundancy payments.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_734">In February I asked the Minister for Health and Children if she could confirm that children from the Health Service Executive south area must travel to Dublin or Limerick for orthopaedic surgery, the reason this was necessary and if she would make a statement on the matter.  Cutting through the usual fillers that accompany HSE responses to parliamentary questions, the reply showed that 210 children, including infants born with birth defects, had to travel to Dublin last year and the year before for orthopaedic surgery as no relevant physician was available in Cork or Kerry.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">Why is it that infants and young children in the south of the country in need of specialised orthopaedic surgery continue to have to travel to the capital for treatment since the sudden retirement of the only suitable surgeon in the region in 2007?  The surgeon, who retired in April 2007 on health grounds, was the only surgeon in the region with the skills to operate on babies and children with congenital dislocation of the hip or with clubfoot.  At that time, HSE south entered into what was described as a "temporary" arrangement with Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin, whereby four of its orthopaedic paediatric surgeons would travel to Cork to treat children who would otherwise have been seen by the retired surgeon.  That temporary arrangement involving regular visits to Cork by the four surgeons has been in place since 2007 to cover the absence of that surgeon.  Those consultants hold just four clinics a month on an outpatient basis.  The consultants are treating in excess of 100 children each per month, from newborn up to the age of 15.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">In an article in tonight's <i>Evening Echo</i> by Edel O’Connell, Mr. David Moore, an orthopaedic surgeon at Crumlin hospital, is quoted as saying there was a serious dearth of paediatric orthopaedic consultants in the country.  He stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_737">I travel to Cork and provide two clinics every second month.  Last week I saw 77 kids in Cork.  There is a huge workload in the southern region and it badly needs its own centre.  The HSE need[s] to provide assurances that if people train in paediatric orthopaedics jobs will be created for them.  No matter what happens it will be at least two years before we would even have people trained to take up paediatric posts.  The posts that are being advertised for Cork are not paediatric orthopaedic consultants.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">It appears that the positions the HSE has indicated it will fill are not appropriately trained ones.  It is completely unacceptable that young children have to travel to Dublin for surgery which could be provided in Cork given that theatres, step-down beds, nurses and anaesthetists are all in place.  All that is missing is a surgeon and one has not been in place for two years.  It is unacceptable that the service in Cork which collapsed in 2007 is still not up and running.  The issue does not relate to a cutback or a service that we were promised.  The service was working two years ago but the HSE failed to project manage it adequately.  We now have a deficit of provision in the southern region because of mismanagement rather than financial constraints.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">The current situation where children have to travel to Dublin for orthopaedic surgery cannot be allowed to continue.  Does the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, envisage it continuing?  I call on the HSE to put in place the necessary measures to rectify the situation.  According to the HSE's response to my parliamentary question, posts are currently being considered. It indicated: "Every effort will be made to ensure that one of the appointments made will have a special interest in paediatric orthopaedic surgery."  The fact of the matter is that there is no paediatric surgeon in this country trained in paediatrics.  If this post is advertised tomorrow morning, it will take two years to train someone.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">Will the Minister indicate when the posts will be filled and when training will commence for the orthopaedic surgeons that are appointed?  Is it acceptable to her that 210 children are travelling from Cork to Dublin because a service is not in place?  Moreover, the service did not run out of money nor was it cut for budgetary reasons; it was simply mismanaged.  As a result, 210 children per year are still travelling from Cork to Dublin for necessary surgery.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Máire Hoctor)</from>
            <p eId="para_741">I will reply to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">Orthopaedic services for the Cork area are provided from the Cork University Hospital group.  The division of trauma and orthopaedics is made up of the orthopaedic department at Cork University Hospital and St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital.  Cork University Hospital provides the only orthopaedic trauma service in Cork city and referrals are generally from the emergency departments of the city and county hospitals, as well as specialist referrals from other locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">A number of vacancies currently exist for permanent consultant orthopaedic surgeons within the Cork University Hospital group.  That is a consequence of retirements and resignations of former permanent post holders.  To date, the HSE has recruited three locum consultants to assist with the delivery of the trauma service in Cork University Hospital and two temporary consultant orthopaedic surgeons to assist with the current backlog in the elective service in St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_744">The Public Appointments Service held interviews for the posts of permanent consultant orthopaedic surgeon on 19 December 2008 and I understand that two applicants have been offered posts through this process and one of the successful candidates took up his post this month.  The HSE has placed a further advertisement for permanent posts and Cork University Hospital expects to fill a minimum of two further posts from this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">There is no consultant paediatric orthopaedic surgeon in the division of trauma and orthopaedics on the staff of Cork University Hospital or St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital at present.  That is as a consequence of the retirement of the consultant orthopaedic surgeon with a special interest in paediatric orthopaedic surgery.  The HSE is anxious to make such an appointment as soon as possible.  In the meantime, arrangements have been made whereby the current service at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital is provided by visiting paediatric consultant surgeons from Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, who provide a total of four clinics per month.  Approximately 15% to 20% of children seen at this clinic are referred on for surgery, which is undertaken in Crumlin.  In 2008, a total of 210 patients were referred to Crumlin for surgery from those clinics.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">As part of the process to recruit a number of permanent consultant orthopaedic posts for Cork University Hospital and St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, the southern hospitals group of the HSE is seeking to ensure that one of the appointments made will have a special interest in paediatric orthopaedic surgery.  In the event of such an appointment being made, the need for the arrangements which I have described, involving consultants from Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, will be reviewed.</p>

          <heading>Suicide Prevention.</heading>
          <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_315">
            <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
            <p eId="para_747">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to raise the important issue of the level of suicide during recessionary periods.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">A report appeared last week in the press about a reduction of 12.5% in the allocation by the National Office for Suicide Prevention to the voluntary organisations involved in suicide prevention and suicide bereavement.  We understand there was also a cut in funding to the National Office for Suicide Prevention that will affect its work on the implementation of the recommendations of Reach Out, the recommendations of the expert group on suicide prevention and suicide issues and other reports, including A Vision for Change and the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Suicide Prevention.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">Research into suicide since the 1890s shows there is an increase in suicide rates and mental illness during times of economic recession.  The Minister for Health and Children should recognise and accept this and ensure that adequate resources are available to respond to the needs that exist.  We suggest that an additional €10 million should be allocated to the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  It received €4.5 million in 2008 and given the cuts that are being made, it will receive less than that this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_750">There is a precedent for this approach.  In November 2008, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs allocated approximately €11 million in additional funding to provide for a range of marriage, child and bereavement counselling services and supports to help families to cope through the difficult times they face as a result of the recession.  I have a list of the 29 organisations that received substantial support from that allocation.  We urge the Minister for Health and Children to respond in a similar fashion to the challenges arising for mental health and suicide prevention services.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">Economic strain and personal financial crises have been well documented as precipitating events in individual deaths by suicide.  Stressful life events, financial and otherwise, have a significant impact on those vulnerable to suicide where typical coping mechanisms are compromised by the effects of mental disorder, substance abuse, acute psychiatric symptoms and the other risk factors associated with suicide.  We have already seen several suicides that can be attributed to the difficulties and pressures arising from economic changes.  Increasing unemployment leads to an increase in the suicide rate.  Unemployment has a profound effect on a person, especially the young and those in middle age.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">Irish society awards status and prestige according to a person's position and contribution to work.  Correspondingly, unemployment is associated with loss of face and prestige, a lack of self-esteem and confusion and concern about the future for individuals and their families.  The unemployed are six times more likely to suffer from a psychiatric disorder than those in employment.  Studies show that those who die of suicide are significantly more likely to have experienced unemployment, job instability or occupational problems.  The Kelleher-Daly study in Cork, conducted during the economic recession of the 1980s, showed that of the male deaths by suicide analysed in that study, two-thirds involved men who were out of work at the time of their deaths.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">The high rate and threat of home foreclosure is of particular concern.  For most Irish people, our homes are our primary investment and the focus of our identity.  When combined with loss of employment, home loss or the threat of it, has been found to be one of the most common economic strains associated with suicides.  I urge the Minister to respond immediately to the psychological, emotional and psychiatric difficulties affecting people as a result of the changed economic times.</p>
            <p eId="para_754">Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the situation.  I raised this matter earlier with the Minister for Health and Children and she denied there were any cuts to the national suicide prevention office.  She stated there was in excess of €2 million extra funding for suicide issues in 2009.  We need clarification in that regard because there is confusion about what is available to the office.  The message we have got is that there is a cut of 12.5%, but the message from the Minister is there is an increase of €2 million.</p>

          <speech by="#MarieHoctorFF" eId="spk_316" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Máire Hoctor</from>
            <p eId="para_755">I am taking this Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for equality, disability and mental health, Deputy John Moloney.  I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">The Government acknowledges that suicide is a serious issue for this country and we must, as an entire community, continue to strive to prevent the further tragic loss of lives.  No doubt the economic crisis is putting greater stress on many people and families.  However, these financial difficulties do not in any way dilute the Government's commitment in the area of mental health.  We know that tackling suicide is not just about increased levels of funding.  Reducing suicide rates requires a collective, concerted effort from all groups in society.  It also involves creating a culture and society where people in distress are not afraid to seek help.  Thankfully, we are making progress in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_757">The simple fact is that mental health affects us all.  The World Health Organisation estimates that about one in four people will experience some mental health problems in his or her lifetime.  Many factors can affect our mental health and there is a wide variation in how people deal with stress.  In his role as Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, meets many individuals and representatives of various groups every day and acknowledges that some have expressed concerns and fears about the impact the recession is having on their lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_758">The Government has a clear role in addressing those fears.  Deputies will be aware of the greatly increased funding base for mental health services that has been built up over recent years.  Overall spending on mental health services in 2007 and 2008 amounted to an estimated €1 billion annually.  It is also important to bear in mind that some 90% of mental health problems are dealt with in primary care, but expenditure on these primary care services is not captured in the figure mentioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">We are certainly operating in straitened times, but nonetheless in 2009 the Government allocated additional funding of €2.8 million for the recruitment of 35 therapy posts for the child and adolescent mental health service, including clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and social workers for new and existing multi-disciplinary teams.  An additional €l million was also allocated on a once-off basis for suicide prevention initiatives.  This brings the total funding for suicide prevention to €8 million this year.  Some of this money will be invested in youth-based suicide prevention and awareness campaigns.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">The budget for the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, is set by the Health Service Executive, specifically, within the population health area.  The HSE advised the office that its core funding, or annual budget, is to be reduced by 12.5%, even as it receives additional once-off funding of €1 million.  Accordingly, the office's budget for 2009 amounts to €3.3 million, as core funding, plus the once-off amount of €1 million, a total of €4.3 million this year.  Last year's national office budget was €4.5 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">It is the responsibility of the national office to allocate its funding effectively within the office itself and to organisations it funds.  I emphasise that the national office has met with all of the organisations involved to ensure that existing levels of service will be maintained.  This is critical.  All organisations have agreed to introduce the required reductions and have agreed that cuts in expenditure will be restricted to non-pay and non-service related costs, for example, training and travel etc.  It is worth recalling that, in 2008, the national office made no reduction in funding to any of the voluntary bodies it supports, even though other parts of the HSE reduced funding to voluntary bodies.  A further €0.75 million was provided to the HSE for mental health projects supporting service users and carers.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">Many of our young people have grown up in an era of unprecedented prosperity and the wide availability of work and opportunities.  As our economy adjusts to the impact of the global economic crisis, it is important to acknowledge the strains many younger people and young adults may be experiencing for the first time in coping with a very difficult economic environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">In 2008, the HSE prioritised the development of child and adolescent mental health services.  By the end of March 2009, the total inpatient bed complement for child and adolescent mental health services will have increased from 12 beds in 2006 to 30 beds, an increase of 18 beds.  There are currently 50 child and adolescent teams and a further eight will be in place by the end of the first quarter of this year.  Construction of two 20-bed units for children and adolescents in Cork and Galway has commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">Financial investment in mental health is important, but it is also vital that we utilise the existing resources within mental health.  The development of mental health services as outlined in "A Vision for Change", the report of the expert group on mental health policy, requires substantial change in the organisation and delivery of mental health services.  To implement this, current resources require to be reallocated and remodelled to fund the new structure.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">However, it is more important, in the context of today's debate, to establish what we can all do to ensure that the potential impact of the economic downturn is minimised.  Mental health promotion is a key ally in a quest to minimise the consequences of a recession.  Promoting well-being and addressing the needs of those at risk of mental health difficulties requires a multifaceted approach.  The Minister of State sees it as a key task of the health services not just to treat mental illness but more important, using the principles of health promotion to try to improve the mental health of the population at large.  What is needed is a concerted effort, managed in a pragmatic and rational manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_766">Mental health promotion works on three levels, strengthening individuals, strengthening communities and reducing structural barriers to mental health through initiatives to reduce discrimination and inequalities.  One of the Government's main priorities is to eliminate social exclusion and discrimination of the mentally ill and create a culture and environment where people in distress feel they can seek help from family, friends and when appropriate, health professionals.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">To conclude, I assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to the development of a high quality mental health service.  The Deputy will acknowledge my time ran out before I could conclude the Minister of State's response.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
            <p eId="para_770">I thank the Chair for facilitating me in raising this important issue.  I am a regular visitor to Ennis CBS and visited it again last Friday morning with my colleague, Deputy Carey.  I commend Brother de Róiste on the work he, his staff and the board of management do in trying to operate under difficult circumstances.  The school was built in 1930 and is totally unsuitable for the diversity of students, 570 in all, now attending it.  The children must climb old stairs with deep steps and 28.5% of the children must go to prefabs or converted small rooms for resource and support learning.  Some 26.1% of the children are taught in prefabs.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">Ten years ago, a feasibility study was carried out for the school by the Department on Ennis CBS, Ennis national school and Scoil Chríost Rí in Cloughleigh, which recommended that three new schools should be built in the town of Ennis.  Ennis national school was given the green light recently to proceed to architectural stage and I welcome that.  Unfortunately, the other two schools have been left out in the cold.  I have highlighted the need for a new school building at Ennis CBS national school with the Minister for Education and Science on several occasions, including with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Mary Hanafin.  Unfortunately, I have received the same reply to parliamentary questions, namely, that the Department does not have any timescale for progression of the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">That is not good enough.  I am sick and tired of these old excuses.  The teachers, board of management and the parents are frustrated.  They have been very patient.  Ten years is a long time to put up with the conditions in the school.  Last week the Bishop of Killaloe, Bishop Willie Walsh, described the conditions at the school and the other two schools in Ennis as "unacceptable".  He is right.  While schools like Ennis CBS sit and wait, the Department continues to waste taxpayers' money on renting prefabricated buildings for schools all over County Clare, including Ennis CBS.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">It costs €885,590 annually to rent prefabs, an average of €11,210 per prefab.  This is disgraceful.  Instead of spending money on temporary accommodation the Minister should invest in permanent classrooms which will save taxpayers' money in the long run.  Ennis CBS has a site ready to go.  Kick-starting the school building programme would be a major boost for the construction sector in County Clare, which is very badly needed.  I urge the Minister to give the green light to Ennis CBS national school.  He would be doing a favour for the people of Clare, particularly the school children who have to be taught in such poor conditions.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_320">
            <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_774">Ennis CBS primary school is the standard bearer primary school in Ennis and has provided education for generations of families in County Clare.  The school educates 569 pupils and that figure is set to grow to more than 590 students next September.  Last Friday Deputy Breen and I visited Ennis CBS and met the principal and representatives of the board of management and parents' council.  In an Ireland of 2009 it is indefensible that the Minister for Education and Science has turned a blind eye to the fact that over 40% of the pupils of this school are being educated in a building that dates back to the 1930s.  Are we saying the 21st century student should be educated in early 20th century conditions?  It is a further scandal that another 30% of the population is being educated in temporary prefabs.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">The principal, board of management and parents' association have been very patient.  They have worked with Department of Education and Science officials on this project since initial talks dating back a decade to 1998.  Understandably that patience has turned to frustration and anger.  There is frustration at the delay in progressing the project to the tender and construction phase and anger at the Department's complete failure to treat this school as a priority, given the number of students attending it.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">It has been 20 years since the school, built to cater for 400 students, received a major upgrade.  It is worth pointing out what that means for staff and students.  The staff room has to double up as a part-time resource teaching room.  Parts of corridors have been converted into classrooms.  Cloakrooms have been converted into extra toilets and resource teaching space.  We are discussing an opportunity for the next generation of children.  We are discussing children having to cross the playground in all kinds of weather to access toilets.  If this were in a developing country we would be discussing it as a human rights issue.  That must stop.  I invite the Minister to Ennis CBS to see first hand the problems there.  It is appalling.  This school must go ahead in the very near future.</p>

          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_321" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
            <p eId="para_777">I am replying to this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  I acknowledge the intra-party support for this project, which is very worthy.  I thank the two Deputies for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the strategy for capital investment in education projects and the current position on Ennis CBS in particular.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">The allocation of funding for school buildings in 2009 is €653 million.  This represents a significant investment in the schools building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is a sign of the Government's commitment to investing in school infrastructure and will permit the continuation of progress in the overall improvement of school accommodation.  Under the recovery plan announced recently by the Taoiseach, an additional €75 million was allocated to the schools building programme for 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">Ennis CBS, County Clare has applied to the Department of Education and Science for large scale capital funding for an extension project.  In common with all such applications, an assessment of the application was carried out in the Department's planning and building unit.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of existing buildings and site capacity, etc., leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  A proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it and as they are ready to proceed.  There are four band ratings in all, of which band 1 is the highest and band 4 the lowest.  Band 1 projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exist but there is a high demand for school places, while a band 4 project makes provision for desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities.  Each band rating has a number of sub-categories which more specifically describes the type of works needed and the urgency attaching to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">Ennis CBS is a fully vertical co-educational primary school with an enrolment of 528 pupils.  The staffing level is a principal, 21 mainstream assistants, three learning support-resource teachers, one special class teacher, one resource teacher for Travellers, four temporary language support teachers and one permanent resource teacher.  Consistent with the approach which I have already outlined, following an assessment of the school's application for capital funding, the proposed building project has been assigned a band 2.1 rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  The long-term staffing figure, on which accommodation needs will be based, has been determined.  It has been agreed that accommodation should be provided to cater for a long-term projected staffing of a principal, 24 mainstream assistants and appropriate ancillary accommodation.  The next step for the project is the appointment of a design team.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">The Deputies will understand that it is not possible to progress all projects at the same time.  However, the Minister for Education and Science would like to give the assurance that he is committed to providing suitable high quality accommodation for Ennis CBS at the earliest possible date.  With competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the further progression of this project.</p>

           his proposals to amend the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990, in order to allow PDFORA to have a limited membership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_787">The position is that under the terms of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990 the Defence Forces Representative Associations are prohibited from being associated with or affiliated to any trade unions or any other body without the consent of the Minister.  Accordingly, the Representative Associations, RACO and PDFORRA cannot be affiliated to ICTU at present.  A similar arrangement applies to the Garda Siochana Representative Associations.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">The basis for the prohibition is that it would be inappropriate to apply the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to members of the Defence Forces.  The taking of any form of industrial action is felt to be irreconcilable with military service.  As has been done in the past, the Defence Forces may be called on to contribute to maintaining vital services in times of industrial action.  The potential for serious difficulties could arise in these circumstances if the Associations were affiliated with ICTU.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">A number of mechanisms have been put in place through the Defence Forces Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme to compensate for the prohibition on affiliation to ICTU.  These provide the Representative Associations with structures and processes which enable them to make representations and negotiate on behalf of their members.  In addition a framework exists which facilitates the Associations engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between the Social Partners at National level.  This parallel process was operated in respect of the discussion at National level on the Framework for a Pact for Stabilisation, Social Solidarity and Economic Renewal over the recent past.</p>

            <p eId="para_794">I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 365 to 367, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">Ireland has offered, through the UN Standby Arrangements System (UNSAS), to provide up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time. This figure equates to some 10% of Ireland's standing Army (excluding Reserves) and demonstrates Ireland's commitment to the cause of international peace. This is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas peacekeeping operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">Ireland is currently contributing 788 Defence Forces personnel to 14 different missions throughout the world. Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement. While personnel from all services are liable for and do serve overseas, as a matter of policy Air Corps and Naval assets are not deployed overseas.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">The deployment of members of An Garda Siochána overseas is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed, are the UN Mandated EU multi-national mission to Chad and the Central African Republic — EUFOR TCHAD/RCA — with 439 personnel, the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 234 personnel and the EU-led operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, ALTHEA, with 45 personnel. Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations, the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the UN, EU, OSCE and NATO.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">Recently, the UN requested Ireland to consider putting the Irish troops, currently deployed with EUFOR TCHAD/RCA, under the command of the United Nations after 15 March 2009, when EUFOR's mandate expires.  On 5 March 2009, Dáil Éireann approved the transfer of command of the Irish contingent currently serving in Chad with EUFOR TCHAD/RCA to the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT). The Defence Forces contribution will be similar in size and nature to Ireland's existing contribution to EUFOR.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">With regard to other future deployments, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a long-term solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_801">Apart from the UN request to transfer Irish personnel currently deployed with EUFOR TCHAD/CAR under the authority of MINURCAT, no other deployments are planned or envisaged at this time.</p>

        <b>Deputy Richard Bruton</b>

           the changes in the rules of engagement applied to Irish soldiers participating in peace support operations compared to previous types of operations participated in by the Irish Defence Forces; the training that is provided to members of the Permanent Defence Forces in preparation for participation in PSOs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_891">Rules of Engagement (ROEs) for peace support missions are based on the United Nations Security Council Resolution for the mission, the Concept of Operations and the Operation Plan. Accordingly, each peace support mission has ROEs specific to that mission. In general, the nature of the ROEs will depend on whether the mission is a UN Chapter VI type mission (peacekeeping), or a UN Chapter VII type mission (peace enforcement).</p>
            <p eId="para_892">Members of the Irish Defence Forces have served on missions under Chapter VI and Chapter VII of the UN Charter.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">Peacekeeping operations mounted under Chapter VI are of the traditional type such as when we were deployed in UNIFIL, where the UN acts as a monitoring, patrolling and observing force after peace has been established.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">Under Chapter VII the UN Security Council is mandated to take whatever action "as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security". Peacekeeping operations mounted under this Chapter are commonly known as peace enforcement operations where the consent of the parties is not required.  In recent years in response to the requirement for a more robust mandate, there has been a significant increase in the deployment of peacekeeping troops under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. EUFOR TCHAD/RCA, UNMIL, KFOR, EUFOR/BiH and ISAF are recent examples.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">The Defence Forces receive ongoing training to enable them to participate fully in UN, EU and other missions overseas. Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training, designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection. Pre-deployment training is provided to members of the Permanent Defence Force and is updated on an ongoing basis in the light of any changes in the threat assessment or mission requirements. I am satisfied that Defence Forces personnel serving overseas will continue to receive the necessary training to enable them to carry out their duties in a professional manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_898">I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 354 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">As part of the reply is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose to include that part in the Official Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">The Air Corps helicopter fleet comprises two light utility EC135 helicopters and six utility AW139 helicopters. The Alouette helicopters were withdrawn from Air Corps service in September 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">The helicopters are operated by the Air Corps in a general purpose military operational and training role. Primary taskings include security, aid to the civil power, military exercises, infantry interoperability training and limited troop transport. They are also used to perform air ambulance, non-maritime Search and Rescue, aid to the civil authorities, community support and Ministerial and VIP air transport tasks.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">Helicopters are used from time to time for ministerial air transport in situations where, for operational reasons, fixed wing aircraft may not be available, the point of destination may not be close to an airport and in circumstances where there is a requirement for greater flexibility than can be delivered by fixed wing aircraft. In 2008, Ministerial transport represented approximately 5% of total helicopter flying hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">The tables, previously referred to, set out the details of all Ministerial use of Air Corps helicopters from 1st January 2005 to the 2nd March 2009 including the date of each trip, the helicopter type tasked, the Ministerial time on board, the route and the requesting Minister. Each trip was in the conduct of official engagements and had the prior approval of An Taoiseach. Operational matters such as points of collection and points of set down are settled directly between the office of the Minister in question and the Department of Defence or Air Corps.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">The Department of Defence follows the normal practice in the aviation business of costing aircraft by reference to the cost per flying hour under either of two headings: The direct cost, i.e. the costs which are additional to those associated with having the aircraft and which only arise when the aircraft is flown including maintenance, fuel and support services; and The total cost, i.e. the direct cost plus the costs associated with having the aircraft, i.e. depreciation and personnel costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">The current rates per hour used to establish these costs in relation to helicopters are also set out in the tabular statements. The costs are an approximation to actual costs.</p>

           when the drafting of his Department’s and the Defence Forces Strategy Statement 2008 to 2010 was completed; if the document was amended to take into account recent economic developments; if so, the changes that were made; if not, if he will assure Dáil Éireann that all of the commitments and provisions contained in the strategy statement 2008 to 2010 will be fulfilled and will not be negatively impacted on by reductions in expenditure due to the current economic and budgetary crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1258">Clearly, the economic environment has deteriorated dramatically in the period since the Strategy Statement was published.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">As with the public service generally, the Defence organisation is required to operate with reduced funding.    The Strategy Statement sets out the intended direction for the Defence organisation over the period 2008 — 2010. The careful management of resources is ensuring that we are making progress and moving forward. The Strategy Statement will continue to provide the overarching direction for the Defence organisation and available resources will continue to be targeted on the effective delivery of the tasks assigned by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">The Defence organisation has a proven track record of effectively managing resources and the significant investment and modernisation over the past decade has ensured that the current organisation is strong and well positioned to face the challenges ahead.</p>

Recruitment was suspended in late 2008 pending consideration of the best means by which to achieve this reduction. My officials and the military authorities are keeping the situation under close review on an ongoing basis.  The review and any subsequent recruitment in 2009 will prioritise the operational requirements of the Defence Forces.   A decision on a Cadet intake for 2009 will be made shortly.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_332">
            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_1272">I propose to take Questions Nos 59, 71, 77, 79, 81, 86 and 89 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1273">The mandate of the European Union military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR TCHAD/RCA, established under the authority of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1778 (2007), is due to expire on 15 March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">Ireland is the second largest contributor to the mission with 439 Defence Forces personnel. The aim of the mission is to protect civilians in danger, particularly refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, and protect UN personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1275">As the humanitarian and security situation in eastern Chad will clearly continue to warrant an international presence beyond March 2009, the Security Council unanimously adopted Security Council Resolution 1861 (2009) on 14 January 2009. This resolution authorised the deployment of a military component of the UN Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT) to follow on from the EUFOR mission at the end of its mandate, which expires on 15 March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1276">Following consideration of a request from the United Nations, on 5 March 2009, Dáil Éireann approved the transfer of command of the Irish contingent currently serving in Chad with EUFOR TCHAD/RCA to the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT).</p>
            <p eId="para_1277">Ireland's commitment to MINURCAT will be for an initial period of 1 year.  Subject to the renewal of the mandate, a satisfactory review of the mission and available resources, I would propose, subject to Government approval, to extend the Defence Forces participation on a year to year basis thereafter.  I  consider that Defence Forces involvement in MINURCAT should not exceed a maximum of two to three years in duration and I propose to advise the UN accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1278">The Defence Forces contribution will be similar in size and nature to Ireland's existing contribution to EUFOR. The nature of the Irish Battalion duties with MINURCAT will be similar to its duties with EUFOR, which include, inter alia, short and long range patrolling, situational awareness and providing an overall security and deterrent presence within its area of operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1279">The required logistical support and sustainment of Irish Troops currently deployed as part of the Eufor Mission to Chad/CAR is being delivered efficiently and in accordance with national standards. All required enablers are operating effectively to underpin the support/sustain part of the logistical operational process in Chad. The full spectrum of logistical support will be maintained at the required level of service going forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">As the House will be aware, the International Criminal Court (ICC), issued a warrant on 4 March 2009 for the arrest of Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, President of Sudan, for war crimes and crimes against humanity. This is the first warrant of arrest ever issued for a sitting Head of State by the ICC. Since the issue of the arrest warrant, I understand that there are fears that the Sudanese reaction against the international community could include giving fresh support to Chadian rebel groups. Any such actions could have serious consequences for the large refugee population in eastern Chad, many of whom have fled from the conflict in Darfur.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">The security situation in Chad and neighbouring Sudan is kept under constant review by the Defence Forces. Just prior to the indictment of President al-Bashir by the ICC a specific Threat Assessment review was conducted on the possible effects for the 99th Infantry battalion serving in Chad. It is assessed that the overall threat has not changed and remains at MEDIUM. The Defence Forces have constant contact with their EUFOR partners in the theatre of operations and with the Operational Headquarters in Paris and they all concur with the current Defence Forces assessment. Indication for any change to the security situation is being continuously monitored by both the Defence Forces and EUFOR's Operational Headquarters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">The detailed threat assessment and reconnaissance undertaken informs decisions regarding the configuration of the contingent and its armaments and protection. In the case of the current EUFOR mission, the Defence Forces have deployed a full range of force protection assets, including 18 MOWAG APCs and 4 Close Reconnaissance Vehicles and indirect fire capabilities (mortars).  Together, these provide the necessary armoured protection, mobility, firepower and communications. This will also be the case when Irish personnel transfer to MINURCAT. The MOWAG APCs deployed were also deployed with the Defence Forces when they served with UNMIL in Liberia and UNIFIL in Lebanon, where they performed very effectively. The Defence Forces have also deployed a suite of robust tactical communications systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">In relation to the security situation, there has been a noticeable decline in incidents of banditry in Irish-led Multinational Battalion South's area of operations during January 2009 compared to December 2008. A significant redeployment of Chadian forces in the general area, has added to the security in the area, and has assisted the reduction of banditry against the local population.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">The UN follow-on force, which will take over from EUFOR on 15 March 2009, is expected to have a wider deployment in eastern Chad so as to further deter armed and criminal elements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1285">MINURCAT will act under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which means that the force is authorised to take all necessary measures within its capabilities and its area of operations in eastern Chad to fulfil its mandate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1286">I visited Chad from 24 –26 February 2009 to see at first hand the work of the Irish Defence Forces Personnel serving with EUFOR. On arrival in N'Djamena, I travelled to Camp Europa (EUFOR's Rear HQ) where I was briefed by the Deputy Force Commander.</p>
            <p eId="para_1287">On 25 February 2009, I visited Camp Ciara, which is the headquarters of the Irish-led multinational battalion. After a series of briefings and lunch with the troops, I addressed them and congratulated them on the tremendous job they are doing under extremely difficult conditions and terrain. I conveyed to them the best wishes of the Government and the Irish people in the work they are undertaking. I also had the opportunity to visit a patrol base at Koukou Angarana and a refugee camp.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288">The Irish personnel are making a significant difference on the ground and are enhancing Ireland's international reputation as neutral, impartial and professional peacekeepers. I was very impressed by the motivation being shown by our troops in the performance of their duties in difficult circumstances, their energy and the good atmosphere in the camp generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">The UN Follow-On Force is the first example of a Transfer of Authority (TOA) between the EU and the UN. Arrangements in this regard are progressing well. There is excellent cooperation between the UN and EUFOR and it is expected that there will be no security gap in the transition from EUFOR to MINURCAT.  Negotiations with the Government of Chad in relation to the handover of EUFOR assets to the UN were very prolonged and detailed, but these had now been finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1307">As the Deputy will be aware, I have accepted the unanimous recommendation of the board of Coiste an Asgard not to proceed with the salvage of <i>Asgard II</i>. The main reason for that decision was that I considered that the risks were too great to commit to spending a sum in the region of €2 million at this time on a salvage effort where the outcome is uncertain. I also had to consider the cost of restoration, which cannot be accurately assessed until after the vessel is raised. Obviously, the greater the damage caused to the vessel, the higher the cost of restoration. The decision not to proceed with a salvage operation was taken after very thorough consideration of all relevant factors and I regret that I am not in a position to reconsider that decision. </p>
            <p eId="para_1308">However, as I have already stated, while I cannot commit public monies to a salvage operation, I will consider any realistic and funded proposals from private individuals or groups with regard to the future of <i>Asgard II</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_1312">In the 2000 White Paper on Defence, the Government decided that the Naval Service would be based on an 8-ship flotilla and committed to a modernisation and replacement strategy to maximise the operational capacity of those 8 vessels consistent with the roles assigned to the Naval Service. The White Paper specifically provides that "New vessels will be brought on stream to replace older ones as these fall due for replacement".  Naval Service Vessels are replaced when they have come to the end of their useful life, which is normally around 30 years.  The following are the ages of the eight ships in the current flotilla.</p>

            <p eId="para_1329">Following a detailed examination of the needs of the Naval Service within my Department, a vessel replacement strategy for the Naval Service was put in place to cover the period up to 2012.  The strategy combined with a continuous process of refurbishment will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a satisfactory level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">Following Government approval in July 2007, notice of a tender competition for the purchase of replacement vessels for the Naval Service was sent to the Official Journal of the European Union on 24 August 2007.  The competition was for the purchase of two Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV's) with an option of a third and one Extended Patrol Vessel (EPV) with an option on a second.  The options provide an effective value for money opportunity, at locked in prices, to provide replacements for Naval Service vessels, which will reach the end of their service life in the years immediately following the current replacement programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">Following Stage 1 of the tender competition for the OPVs, Stage 2 of the competition commenced on the 12th September 2008 with the issue of an Invitation to Tender to the shipbuilders who had been short-listed as part of the Stage 1 process.  This document included a very detailed ship specification.  The detailed tender responses were returned to the Department by the shipbuilders on the 11 November last.  Tender evaluation commenced immediately and is almost completed. Subject to Government approval on funding, it is intended to award a contract for the OPVs to the preferred bidder in the first half of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">The decision to proceed with the final award of contract to purchase the vessels will be subject to Government approval and agreement on funding, the full requirement for which will not be known until the tender competition has concluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1333">Subject to Government approval on funding, it is expected that the new vessels will be delivered for acceptance by the Naval Service on a phased basis between 2011 and 2013.  It is expected that the delivery date for the first OPV will be 30 months after the date of signing of the contract whilst the specified delivery date for the second OPV will be 37 months after the date of signing of the contract.  If the Department exercises its option of purchasing a third OPV, a mutually agreeable delivery date shall be negotiated.  The timelines are indicative and shall not prejudice the right of the Department to adjust or alter the delivery schedule at the contract stage.  At the evaluation stage, marks will be awarded on the basis of the indicative timeline provided by the tenderer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1334">In the current difficult economic environment, it will be important that we look to the efficiencies which all parts of the public sector can make so as to continue to deliver high quality public services within a more constrained financial resource envelope.  However, it is also important that we continue to invest in public services so as we can maintain service levels into the future.  Within the resources available to us, to maintain capacity, we need to continue the process of modernisation and reinvestment in the Defence Forces generally, into the future. The Naval Service Ships Programme is part of this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1335">The acquisition of these modern new vessels will ensure that the Naval Service will be fully equipped to carry out its day to day roles in enforcing the states sovereign rights over our waters and our fisheries and meeting Ireland's obligations in the area of maritime safety and security and fisheries protection.</p>

            <p eId="para_1342">On 11 May 2005, I signed a formal agreement with the Irish Bankers Federation, which provides that the banks pay the total actual costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of cash escorts.

            <p eId="para_1350">I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 362 to 364, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1351">The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements. The Naval Service operates eight general purpose patrol ships. All eight ships are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1352">The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union. However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels are deployed to other duties such as aid to the civil power and drug interdiction operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1353">The current Exclusive Fishery Limits extend to 200 miles offshore and cover an area of 132,000 nautical square miles. The Naval Service currently patrols the entire 200 mile limit and periodically patrols beyond these limits to protect specific fisheries. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. The number of Patrol Vessels on patrol in Irish waters at any one time varies between three and eight. The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time. All vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on patrol.</p>
            <p eId="para_1354">Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps. The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of territorial waters using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.</p>
            <p eId="para_1355">Responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking rests primarily with the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners. Responsibility for the prevention of crime, including people trafficking, rests primarily with An Garda Siochána. However, the White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work. Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda Síochána, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking. The Air Corps provide air support and, on occasion, carry the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking and other illegal activities. There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and the Naval Service and the Air Corps in discharging this important mission.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_1369">The European Defence Agency was established by a Joint Action of the Council during Ireland's Presidency of the Union in 2004.  The Agency was established "to support member States and the Council in their efforts to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as it stands now and develops in the future".</p>
            <p eId="para_1370">Ireland has participated actively in the framework of the Agency since it was established, focussing the activity of the Agency on those issues which are important to Ireland and to the development of Defence Force capabilities in support of the Petersberg Tasks and in support of international peacekeeping and crisis management.  In this regard, Ireland participates in the Joint Investment Programme on Force Protection which is a key issue in relation to any deployment of the Defence Forces on Peace Support Operations.  Ireland also participates in the Code of Conduct on Defence Procurement and other initiatives designed to improve competition and efficiency in the acquisition of defence equipment and capabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1371">The work undertaken by the Agency in the area of capability development is a critical element in the ongoing development and modernisation of Defence Force capabilities and to the development of its interoperability with other forces engaged in international peacekeeping operations.  Ireland benefits significantly from the strategic information and research conducted by the Agency, research which the Defence Forces could not access or develop on their own, given their size and the resources available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1372">Participation in the Agency imposes no obligations on Ireland in relation to increased expenditure of Defence or on the development or enhancement of Defence Force capabilities.  All decisions regarding the nature and scale of resources invested in Defence and the nature of Defence capabilities are entirely a matter for each individual Member State of the Union.  In addition, there is no obligation or commitment as a participating member State to participate in any particular project undertaken by the Agency.  Any decision to participate in any particular project is a matter for each Member State to decide in accordance with its national decision making procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1373">The specific provision in the Lisbon Treaty pertaining to the Agency confirms the existing arrangements regarding the establishment and management of the Agency.  The provisions in the Treaty, if implemented, will not alter the sovereign right of Ireland, as of each other Member State, to decide whether to participate in any particular activity or project.  Moreover, all decisions in relation to expenditure on defence or the development of defence capabilities will continue to remain exclusively within the domain of the national decision making procedures of each member state.</p>
            <p eId="para_1374">The EDA is a key element within the overall institutional framework which guides and advances the development of European Security and Defence Policy.  In my view, Ireland and, in particular, the Defence Forces, benefit from participation in the framework of the Agency.  This participation gives Ireland a seat at the table on the Agency Steering Board, where important issues in the area of Defence capabilities and ESDP are decided.  Participation in the Agency is fully in accordance with Ireland's policy of military neutrality and with the principles and values which guide Ireland's international security and defence policy.  Through our participation we can influence and direct the evolution of the Agency and ensure that it develops in a manner which respects Ireland's principles and values in the area of defence and that ESDP continues to develop in support of international crisis management in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1388">The White Paper on Defence (2000) covers the potential benefits of civilianisation and contracting out of certain military posts. It recognises that civilianisation could "..release personnel for operational duties for which they are specifically trained". It could release them "from essentially administrative and other tasks which can more appropriately be undertaken by civilians."</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">The Review of Implementation of the White Paper on Defence was published in April 2007. The Review emphasised that the primary objective of civilianisation centres on releasing soldiers for operational duties and increasing the operational capacity of the Defence Forces. The Review recommended further civil/military exploration of options for civilianisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">Civilianisation is incorporated into the "Pay Agreement and Modernisation Agenda" agreed with the Defence Forces Representative Associations in the context of the Towards 2016 Partnership Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1391">In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government 2007 — 2012, my Department has engaged with the Military Authorities to identify military posts that may be suitable for contracting out and civilianisation. As I have previously outlined, this work requires careful consideration of the costs and benefits arising from the civilianisation of any identified posts and assessing the feasibility of any such proposals, with particular reference to resource constraints.</p>
            <p eId="para_1392">In light of the Government decision requiring pay savings across all elements of the Defence organisation, further action on civilianisation has been deferred for the present.  This matter will be kept under review and progressed when circumstances permit.</p>

            <p eId="para_1404">In so far as I am concerned, the question as to whether or not <i> Asgard II</i> could be raised is not an issue. The main factors that have to be considered are the likely cost of a salvage operation, the condition of the vessel after salvage and, if the vessel is capable of being restored, the cost of restoration. As the Deputy is aware, the board of An Coiste unanimously recommended to me that a salvage operation should not be undertaken, and I accepted that recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">During the period from the sinking of the vessel on 11 September 2008 up to the end of November, the initial underwater survey was carried out and a preferred salvage contractor was identified as a result of a tender process conducted by the insurer of the vessel, Allianz Plc.  That initial survey revealed that the vessel was lying upright in some 80m of water and appeared to be largely intact other than some visible damage to one of the hull planks. Apart from that, the survey did not reveal anything about the extent of damage to the vessel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">Following consideration of the outcome of the tender process, the board of An Coiste decided in early December that a further underwater survey should be carried out as soon as possible. However, it did not prove possible to arrange that survey until 28 January 2009. In the event, it was not possible to complete the survey due to adverse weather conditions. However, a sonar image of the vessel was obtained which appeared to show it to be still in an upright position.</p>
            <p eId="para_1407">As I have already indicated, I am open to considering any realistic and funded proposals from private individuals or groups as to the future of the vessel.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_1410">I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 85 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1411">The Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces was established under the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004.  On the 19th September 2005, Ms. Paulyn Marrinan-Quinn SC was appointed by the President, upon the recommendation of the Government, as the first Ombudsman for the Defence Forces. She was re-appointed in September 2008 for a further period of three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1412">The function of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is to act as the ultimate point of appeal for, and administrative investigation into, complaints made by members (and former members) of the Defence Forces against another member (or former member) of the Defence Forces, or against a civil servant of the Department of Defence. The Ombudsman for the Defence Forces may investigate a complaint in respect of an action or decision, which may have adversely affected the complainant personally. The action or decision complained of must have occurred on or after the 1st December 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1413">To date, the office of the Ombudsman has sent me some eighty-three Final Reports (83) reports.  I have either responded to, or am in the process of responding to the Ombudsman in respect of each of the Final Reports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1414">The Ombudsman's recommendations in these reports cover issues specific to the case in question including proposals for redress where the Ombudsman has found that a person has been wronged.  The reports may also include systemic matters that the Ombudsman has identified in her investigation of the case.  In arriving at my determination on each case I take careful account of all of the Ombudsman's recommendations. I also take into account the specific and unique requirements of the Defence Forces organisation.  I refer recommendations of a systemic nature to the appropriate Branches of my Department and to the Defence Forces for consideration in their ongoing development of best practice human resource management.</p>
            <p eId="para_1415">The input of the Ombudsman has assisted the Defence Forces in the revision of a number of HR procedures including the selection processes for career courses and overseas service. The recommendations in the Ombudsman's reports to me have also informed the revision of selection processes for promotion, a new version of which is currently being progressed with the representative associations through the conciliation and arbitration scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">The Office of the Ombudsman is currently located in Hatch Street, Dublin 2. While the provision of accommodation for the Ombudsman is primarily a matter for the OPW, I am anxious to ensure that her Office is provided with adequate and appropriate facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">The Ombudsman has sought alternative accommodation and I have supported her request to the Office of Public Works.  I am advised that, in July last, the OPW identified potentially suitable premises that were then inspected by officials from the Ombudsman's office.  When the Ombudsman advised me that this particular premises was found not to meet the requirements of her office I wrote to the OPW, again supporting the Ombudsman's request. The Minister for State at the OPW has recently written to me advising that the OPW is continuing to review its Dublin property portfolio with a view to identifying premises that would meet the operational needs of the Ombudsman's Office. In the meantime, remedial work is planned on the current office. I am advised that this work will be carried out over weekends so as to minimize disruption to the work of the Ombudsman's office.</p>

            <p eId="para_1419">Yes, I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy, which was brought to the attention of my Department in 2003. I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that a passport application was received by the Passport Office in respect of the person in question on 25 November 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">However, the documents provided by the applicant's mother as evidence of entitlement to citizenship which purported to establish the identity of the applicant's father as a former member of the Permanent Defence Force now deceased, were insufficient to confirm that the individual named by the applicant's mother is the father of the applicant. The matter has been the subject of correspondence between the applicant's mother and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, dealt comprehensively with this case in reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 145 and 146 on 5 March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1421">The Department of Foreign Affairs has at all times sought to be of assistance to the applicant and her mother, within the constraints of its legal obligations, and will gladly issue a passport to the applicant if citizenship can be established.</p>

            <p eId="para_1456">I can confirm that neither I nor my Department have had discussions with PDFORRA regarding a role that members of the Defence Forces may be asked to play in the event of industrial action. In this regard I would like to advise the Deputy that the deployment of military personnel is specifically excluded from the scope of representation in the Defence Forces, as enacted. The question of discussion or consultation with the Defence Forces Representative Associations on such issues does not therefore arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">I would emphasise that the Defence Forces Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme provides the Representative Associations with structures and processes which enable them to make representations and negotiate on behalf of their members. In addition a framework exists which facilitates the Associations engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between the Social Partners at National level. I am satisfied that there are sufficient and robust measures in place that allow the Representative Associations to raise and discuss any issues that do come within the scope of representation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">Amongst the roles assigned to the Defence Forces by the Government are to aid the civil power and to aid the civil authority. As the Deputy is aware the Defence Forces have in the past either provided assistance or have been put on standby to assist in the maintenance of essential services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1459">The level of assistance that can be provided will be subject to the resources at the disposal of the Defence Forces at the time of any particular request.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460">The Chief of Staff has assured me that if called upon the Defence Forces will be in a position to respond to any request within available resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_1462">A contract for the supply of twenty- seven (27) Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles to the Defence Forces was awarded to BAE Systems based in South Africa in December 2008. The contract followed from a detailed tender competition, which was initiated in May 2008, and which concluded in November 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">The tender competition has allowed for the option to acquire up to another twenty-seven vehicles over the next few years to meet any further requirements, depending on the threat faced by the Defence Forces in operational deployments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464">The intention is that the LTAV will complement the Mowag Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) in the conduct of conventional and Peace Support Operations and will fill a gap that exists between soft-skinned vehicles and the Mowag APCs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">The contract for the supply of the 27 RG32M vehicles will run over a period of three years and has a value of €19.6m, inclusive of VAT. The cost of the programme will be covered over a number of years from the Defence budget, taking into account the current economic conditions. Deliveries of the vehicles will be sixteen in 2009 and eleven in 2010.  It is expected the first vehicle to be delivered will be in the last quarter of 2009 with the remaining fifteen following before year end.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466">The acquisition of the Light Tactical Vehicles is a top priority for the Defence Forces, given the extensive nature of their roles on overseas Peace Support Missions, the threat from improvised explosive devices and the potential for hostile fire in certain threat environments. Force protection remains a key issue in overseas peace support operations and it is very important that vehicles such as these are available to our personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1467">The purchase of the vehicles is in line with the commitment given in the Programme for Government to continue investment in modern equipment for Defence Forces personnel and the obligations of the State to provide appropriate support and force protection assets to deployed personnel.</p>

            <p eId="para_1730">Since the Insolvency Payments Scheme came into operation under  the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984 the matter of covering cases involving companies that have ceased to trade has been examined in depth.  Extension of the Scheme to cover such cases would involve many complex issues and processes extending into questions of insolvency, company and bankruptcy law, resulting in administrative and financial constraints. Any extension of the definition of an employer's insolvency could not be implemented solely for the purposes of payments due to employees under the 1984 Act. An employer could not be deemed to be insolvent for one limited purpose only without reference to wider implications.</p>

            <p eId="para_1733">IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions. The marketing of individual areas for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency. While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Industrial Development Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or issues of the nature raised here.</p>
            <p eId="para_1734">I am informed by IDA Ireland that it actively promotes Fermoy Business &amp; Technology Park as part of a bid to secure valuable investment for the North Cork area.  IDA strives to attract companies to North Cork across the full range of IDA targeted sectors, such as Pharmaceuticals, Medical Technologies, Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) and Internationally Traded Services via its network of overseas offices and project divisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1735">Fermoy's attractiveness as a location for inward investment has been greatly enhanced by the opening of the bypass, which has improved accessibility to Cork city and its airport.  IDA Ireland has approximately 6 hectares available on the Park.  Works have been carried out to progress the development of the park.  IDA has carried out master planning of the park, landscaped the entrance area and submitted and received planning permission for an advanced technology unit.  This would thereby potentially facilitate a smooth planning application by a client interested in locating in the park.  A site in the park has been acquired by an Enterprise Ireland client, whose intention it is to establish Headquarters in the park.</p>

For that reason the estimated yields to the Exchequer provided in respect of these contributions are extremely tentative.</p>

            <p eId="para_1772">In February 2004, Eurostat published guidelines regarding the accounting treatment of PPP projects for the purpose of calculating the General Government Balance (GGB).  In general, the position in this regard is that the assets of privately financed PPP projects will be off balance sheet in the National Accounts and therefore the construction costs will not affect the GGB upfront over the construction period, provided that the private sector partner carries the Construction risk and carries either the Demand or the Availability risk.  The unitary payments which are made under the PPP contract will count as GGB expenditure in the years in which they are incurred over the life of the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">Projects whose capital cost will impact on the GGB over the construction period include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">Design, Build, Operate, Finance (DBOF) projects where the public sector partner carries the majority of the risk in relation to a project.  This includes cases where the public sector carries the construction risk or carries both the availability and demand risk.</p>

The great bulk of these figures relate to the remuneration of hospital consultants.  The final uptake of the various contract types among hospital consultants can only be estimated at this stage.  The figures do not take into account the voluntary deductions made by some public servants and the pension-related deduction applying to all remuneration.  Any such savings would, of course, be offset to an extent by consequential tax revenue forgone.  There would also be savings on the pensions bill from the capping of remuneration as any reduction in pay would have a knock-on reduction on pensions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1812">2057I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that based on personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers for the year 2007, the estimated amount of tax foregone by allowing a deduction for interest on borrowings to be offset against rents assessable under Case V, Schedule D is of the order of €877 million.  This estimate is based on assuming that tax relief was allowed at the top income tax rate of 41% and the figure provided could therefore be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost in respect of those taxpayers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">The nominal yield of €877 million to the Exchequer from abolition of the relief may not be immediate depending on whether there is sufficient taxable rental income in the year of abolition to absorb it. Some increased taxable rental income arising from the abolition of interest relief may be offset by capital allowances and losses brought forward from prior years.  The current downturn in the property market is also likely to have had a negative impact on rental activity since 2007 and a consequent negative impact  on the nominal yield from abolition of the relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_1814">It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return form 12 is not captured in the Revenue computer system. However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than €3,174 is required to complete an income tax return form 11.  This return is the source of the figures provided in this reply.

            <p eId="para_1822">I assume that the Deputy is referring to individual pension contributions, the tax relief on which is allowed at the taxpayer's marginal tax rate, that is, at the standard or higher rate of income tax as appropriate in each case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1823">A breakdown of the cost of tax relief on employee contributions to occupational pension schemes is not available by income tax rate, as tax returns by employers to the Revenue Commissioners of employee contributions to such schemes are aggregated at employer level.  An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans — Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) — by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers.  The latest full historical data available in this regard is in respect of the tax year 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">There is, therefore, no statistical basis for providing definitive figures.  However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, it is estimated that the full year yield to the Exchequer from confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be about €500 million.  The full year yield from abolishing the tax relief is estimated at over €1 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">As highlighted in the "Green Paper on Pensions", where tax relief arrangements are of such significance, as in this instance, the removal of the reliefs would represent a fundamental adjustment to the current balance of the tax system and would have very significant implications in terms, among other things, of the economic and behavioural impacts which would ensue.  These impacts would be difficult to model in advance.  For these reasons, the real informational content of these costings of tax reliefs is limited and should be treated with some caution.</p>

            <p eId="para_1884">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that all goods imported into the European Union are subject to VAT at the same rate as similar goods sold within the Member State into which the goods are imported.  In Ireland the VAT is charged by the Revenue Commissioners at the point of import.  There is no provision for a refund of this VAT to persons who are not registered for VAT.  However, there are provisions in place to deal with this difficulty.  A VAT-registered business is entitled to a credit for all VAT incurred on purchases for business purposes, subject to certain statutory restrictions.  Moreover, a VAT-registered business, which derives 75% or more of annual turnover from zero-rated intra-Community supplies of goods or from exports of goods to third countries, may apply to have most goods and services received by it, and intra-Community acquisitions and imports made by it, zero-rated for VAT purposes.  This allows the goods and services to be received free of VAT by the business.  If a business is engaged in the supply, including export, of taxable goods and its turnover exceeds or is likely to exceed €75,000 in any period of 12 months it is taxable and is obliged to register for VAT.  A business whose turnover from the supply of taxable goods is below €75,000 may nonetheless elect to register for VAT.  Finally, customs duty is normally payable on imports into Ireland from outside the EU.  However there are a number of customs regimes (such as warehousing or inward processing) that provide for suspension of the customs duty where the goods are intended for subsequent re-export from the Community.</p>

            <p eId="para_1906">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not in a position to state definitively the number of overseas landlords who rent out dwellings within the State to tenants.  Where the taxpayer, or tenant, indicates to the Revenue Commissioners that the landlord is non-resident, a reduction in tax credits is automatically created to collect the tax that has or should have been withheld by the tenant.  The Revenue Commissioners are advised of the non-resident status of landlords in a number of ways — on the Form R185, on Form 12 (PAYE Tax Return), a Form 11 (Income Tax Return), a Rent 1 Tax Credit claim form, and through the "PAYE Anytime" on-line facility.  The R185 form may be used to advise the Revenue Commissioners of tax deducted in a number of situations, for example on foot of a deed of covenant, an annual payment or a rent agreement.  The Revenue Commissioners do not record the number of such forms submitted to them but they record the facts by way of a marker on the computer file.</p>
            <p eId="para_1907">In 2008, some 379 taxpayers notified the Revenue Commissioners through the various options that they had paid rent to a non-resident landlord.  However, landlords resident outside the State may have rents managed by an Irish agent.  In such cases, there is no reporting requirement on the tenant and Revenue have no information on the number of such cases.  Finally, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not in a position to provide an answer, within the timeframe for preparation of this reply, in relation to the amount of moneys received in 2008 from tenants who had withheld rent from their overseas landlords in accordance with law.  Accordingly, they will communicate directly with the Deputy on this issue at a later date.</p>

            <p eId="para_1909">Having visited the Shannon callows last year and met those affected by flooding in the area, I am conscious of the serious impact of the flooding on farming and on the environment in the area.  Due to exceptionally heavy rainfall, the problem in 2008 was more severe than the normal summer flooding in the callows.  The extremely flat gradient of the river, together with the environmentally protected status of the location, makes it difficult to devise a cost-effective solution.  The Office of Public Works has cleared some vegetation in the area.  Although it was not sufficient to prevent the flooding last year, it is generally acknowledged to have improved the situation.  This work was carried out with the agreement of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and in consultation with other stakeholders.  The OPW has agreed to remove silt from the Shannon cut to test the impact of this measure on the situation, as long as it would be possible to do so in a cost-effective and environmentally acceptable manner.  The OPW has serious reservations about how effective this proposal would be.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service raised a number of conditions in respect of this proposal, which would impact significantly on its timescale and cost.  The OPW is continuing to seek an acceptable solution to these issues, in conjunction with the various stakeholders involved.  The long-term management of the summer flooding of the callows will need to have regard to the availability of resources, in addition to environmental constraints.  These issues will be considered in the course of the development of a flood risk management plan for the Shannon river basin, which will be prepared in accordance with the EU floods directive.</p>

            <p eId="para_1915">In matters relating to the VAT rating of goods and services, I am constrained by the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  In relation to the VAT rate that applies to defibrillators, the position is that under the VAT Directive, member states may retain the zero rates on goods and services that was in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services.  The zero VAT rate cannot therefore be applied to defibrillators which are subject to the standard rate.  In addition, member states may only apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under Annex III of the VAT directive.  While Annex III does include the supply of medical equipment for the exclusive personal use of a disabled person, it does not include defibrillators for general use. The reduced rate cannot therefore be applied to the supply of defibrillators.  Consequently, the only rate of VAT that can apply to the supply of defibrillators is the standard VAT rate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1925">In the case of second-hand cars a special scheme is in place in Ireland, following strong representations from the motor industry, rather than the margin scheme that is operated in most other member states.  The special scheme allows motor dealers to claim credit for residual input VAT at the time of purchase which is considered to be included in the cost of acquiring a car from a customer.  When the car is subsequently resold, the VAT is chargeable on the full sale price of the car or on the original purchase price paid by the dealer, whichever is the higher, because the dealer has already been granted a credit in relation to the residual input VAT incurred.  The special scheme allows dealers the maximum benefit by allowing an immediate deduction of residual VAT at the point of purchase.  The VAT credit already allowed on second-hand cars must, despite the industry's view, be seen for what it is — money advanced to dealers by the Exchequer which they are only repaying when they resell the cars.</p>
            <p eId="para_1926">Although with the changing economic circumstances dealers have found themselves selling traded-in second hand cars at a loss, which is increasingly giving rise to clawbacks of VAT situations for dealers, it is not possible to write off the VAT credit already allowed to the garages on second-hand cars.  In this context, the Revenue Commissioners have granted concessionary treatment which allows dealers to postpone payment in respect of the clawbacks over the past number of months until 19 May 2009.  I am not opposed to the introduction of a margin scheme for second-hand cars, but not on the basis proposed by the motor industry, which is that the outstanding VAT credit already provided to dealers in relation to their existing stock of second-hand cars would be written off in full.</p>

            <p eId="para_2232">I have no function in setting interest rates. My function is to provide an appropriate legislative framework for regulation of the financial services sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2233">The choice of mortgage product ultimately rests with consumers in light of their assessment of the terms and conditions that their lending institution offers. The decision of borrowers is influenced by a range of factors such as their personal preferences and their own assessment of the relative merits of fixed and variable rate mortgages.</p>
            <p eId="para_2234">Generally mortgages are for long periods. To some consumers a fixed interest rate on a mortgage offers peace of mind in that the borrower benefits from certainty regarding the cost of their mortgage, does not need to be concerned with changes in mortgage interest rates and accordingly he or she can budget more confidently.</p>
            <p eId="para_2235">Where a bank offers a fixed rate over a certain period it incurs additional costs in obtaining fixed or other funding in respect of the loan over the period. The additional costs will reflect both the market view in relation to future trends in interest rates for the period and the fact that longer term deposits generally attract higher interest rates than short term. In addition, if a borrower wishes to break a fixed interest rate contract prior to the end of the agreed term in order to change to a variable interest rate contract, it will generally result in funding costs for the lender concerned.  The lender in turn will seek to recoup these costs from the borrower. These funding costs do not require the Financial Regulator's approval. However, the Financial Regulator's approval must be obtained for any additional administrative type charges imposed on borrowers for breaking fixed rate contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2236">I have not discussed this issue with any representatives of the banks and I have no plans to seek to impose this requirement on any credit institution.</p>

            <p eId="para_2241">In terms of ensuring that people can continue to afford their mortgages the Government provides support for payment of mortgages under the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme. This scheme is administered by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. It provides assistance where the mortgage relates to a person's principal private residence.</p>

         if contractors based in Northern Ireland that are awarded building, electrical and civil engineering contracts here are liable for VAT in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2244">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the place of supply of goods and services for VAT purposes is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Under the EU VAT Directive the supply of construction works or civil engineering works are treated as being made where the immovable goods or the associated lands are situated.</p>
            <p eId="para_2245">Thus, services such as those outlined by the Deputy are supplied where the land is situated, irrespective of the place of belonging of the supplier or the recipient of the supply.  Accordingly, if contractors based in Northern Ireland are awarded building, electrical or civil engineering contracts in the State, then liability to VAT arises in the State in all cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2246">Finally, I would add that under what is known as the reverse charge mechanism, where a sub-contractor, whether or nor established in the State, supplies construction services in the State to a principal contractor, it is the principal contractor who must account for the VAT due in respect of the supply of such services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2247">It is a particular priority of the Government to ensure as much as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession. Home repossession should be, and generally is, the last resort for the lender and the preferred method of dealing with arrears cases should be early intervention.</p>
            <p eId="para_2248">The finalised recapitalisation scheme announced on 11th February 2009 includes a new code of conduct for Mortgage Arrears, based on the Irish Banking Federation Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears which has been issued by the Financial Regulator and came into force on the 27 February 2009. The new Code applies to mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal private residence in the State and is mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Financial Regulator. Under the mortgage arrears code where a borrower is in difficulty the lender shall make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule i.e. consideration should be given on a case-by-case basis to alternatives such as deferral of payments, extending the term of the mortgage, changing type of mortgage, or capitalising arrears and interest. In any case, lenders will not commence legal action for repossession until after six months from the time arrears first arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2249">In addition as part of their recapitalisation scheme, the two banks concerned, A.I.B. and Bank of Ireland, will not commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence until after 12 months of arrears appearing where the customer continues to co-operate with the banks.</p>

            <p eId="para_2251">Regulations will be introduced under Section 3 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 for the purpose of the calculation, making, collection, disposal and recovery of the deductions.  The deductions will be made on what is known as a "week-1 basis".  This means that each payroll pension related deduction is calculated without reference to the previous pay period.  The objective is to keep deductions similar throughout the year, assuming that remuneration remains at a similar level.  Of course, if there were a big increase in one's remuneration in a particular payroll, there would also be a rise in the pension related deduction for the individual.  At year-end the precise amount due is determined, and repayment or recoupment of the over- or under-payment will be carried out for each affected individual.  In general, for persons earning more than €20,000 p.a., no end-of-year adjustment will be required.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_2264">I propose to take Questions Nos. 182, 186, 188, 189, 201 and 228 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2265">The Adoption Bill 2009, which will give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, was published on Friday 23rd January.</p>
            <p eId="para_2266">Under the new legislation, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries which have also ratified the Hague Convention, and countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement which meets Hague standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_2267">While it is true to say that our current Agreement with Vietnam is based on Hague principles, as part of the preparations for our new legislation we need to ensure that our Agreement reflects the Hague Convention as comprehensively as possible. A new Agreement allows the opportunity to elaborate and strengthen some existing provisions to meet the standards which will it is anticipated will be set in draft legislation. There have been considerable developments in intercountry adoption in Vietnam since the Agreement was signed 5 years ago. This progress also needs to be reflected in any new Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2268">In December 2008, the Irish Government issued a formal request to the Vietnamese Authorities stating that we wish to enter into discussions immediately for the purpose of negotiating a new Agreement to follow on from the existing Agreement which will expire on 1 May 2009. The Vietnamese Authorities have responded positively to Ireland's request.</p>
            <p eId="para_2269">Ireland offered to provide the Vietnamese Authorities with the text of a draft agreement as a basis for negotiations. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a draft bilateral agreement for intercountry adoption was delivered on 6 March, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, to the Vietnamese Authorities for their consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2270">I would like to again reiterate my personal commitment and the commitment of the Government to conclude an agreement with Vietnam and, in this regard, a letter accompanying the draft agreement advised the Vietnamese Government of our willingness to travel to discuss the draft at the earliest opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2271">As the Deputy will be aware, it is important to recognise that Ireland has a long and positive relationship with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and to also emphasise the need to respect the authority of that jurisdiction, having regard to the sensitive nature of discussions regarding intercountry adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_2272">The work to prepare for and advise the Government on this issue and the implementation of Government's decisions is being given the highest priority.  These are complex matters which require careful consideration. At all times, the Minister and the Government, and officials advising them, are guided by the need to respect and protect the best interests and rights of the child.</p>

            <p eId="para_2282">I propose to take Questions Nos. 184, 185, 187, 211, 221, 230 and 234 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2283">The Adoption Bill, 2009, which will give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, was published on 23rd January, 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2284">A core principle of the Hague Convention is that intercountry adoption should be child centred, that is, in all stages of the process the child's interests must be paramount. Legislating for intercountry adoption is essential to give protection to children in the process of adoption. The Hague Convention has put in place the equivalent of a contract between states to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction. It is an additional safeguard for a receiving country like Ireland regarding the standards that are being applied in the sending country, over which we have no jurisdiction. As a receiving country it is especially important to have some confidence in the process of consent to the adoption, the status of the child as adoptable and a guarantee of no improper financial gain from the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2285">I firmly believe that legislation and specifically the regime of the Hague Convention provides an assurance for individual children, their families, and the State, that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was affected in the best interests of the child. As such, it is our intention that intercountry adoptions will now meet the standards of the Hague Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_2286">Under the proposed new legislative regime, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries which have ratified the Hague Convention, and from those countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement based on Hague standards. As part of the preparations for the likely passage and entry into force of these new legislative arrangements, my Office has been liaising with the Department of Foreign Affairs to identify and negotiate with countries who continue to seek homes abroad for children in need of alternative care which cannot be provided domestically. We are working actively to assess the possibilities of entering into bilateral agreements with a small number of countries, including the Russian Federation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2287">As regards the Russian Federation, my Office is undertaking preparatory work to consider the contents of such an agreement, including anticipating the likely requirements of the Russian Federation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2288">While every effort will be made to conclude a bilateral agreement in advance of any of the proposed changes in Irish law taking effect, it must be acknowledged that these matters will be determined to a considerable degree by the Government of the Russian Federation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2289">However, at this point in time, it is my priority to endeavour to ensure that an international bi-lateral agreement with Vietnam is put in place as soon as possible, to maintain the continuity of arrangements between Ireland and Vietnam in relation to intercountry adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_2290">In this regard, I am pleased to confirm that a draft bilateral agreement for intercountry adoption was, on March 6th, delivered through the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Vietnamese Authorities for their consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2291">Furthermore, in a letter accompanying the draft agreement, the Vietnamese Government has been advised of our willingness to travel to discuss the draft at the earliest opportunity.</p>

            <p eId="para_2303">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) 2006-2010, under which the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_2304">Services participating in the CCSS receive annual funding on the basis of the number of qualifying parents recorded as using the service in a particular reference week, generally set in late September of each year.  Services may apply mid-year to have their funding reviewed, where they believe they would benefit from additional funding as a result of having additional numbers of qualifying parents.  In 2009, services have been advised that they should request a review by 13 March and that the reference week will be that ending on 3 April.  Where a review results in an increased level of funding, this will be calculated with effect from 1 April.</p>
            <p eId="para_2305">As the funding is paid on the basis of the number of qualifying parents using a service at a particular point in time, the increase in funding will  apply from that date and cannot be applied retrospectively.  It is also noted that the facility for a mid-year review is optional and services with lesser numbers of qualifying parents are not required to seek a reduction in their grant level.  I am satisfied that the arrangements in place are satisfactory and provide for much greater flexibility than was the case under the previous support scheme, the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP), which allocated funding for period of 3 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2306">I understand that services participating in the CCSS have been provided with detailed guidelines regarding the scheme, by the Childcare Directorate of my Office.  If a service has not received details of its funding allocation in 2009, I would ask that they contact the Childcare Directorate of my Office who will be able to assist them in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_2317">Following the recommendations of the Report on the Task Force on Violence against Women in 1997, Regional Planning Committees (RPCs) were established in each of the eight former health board regions to draw together the services available to women in each of these regions in order to consolidate an approach to the treatment of victims of violence.</p>

An adjusted remit and structure for the regional committees was agreed with the HSE following consultation with the committees and Cosc.  The HSE are now implementing these structures which will include representation for each committee on the National Steering Committee on Violence against Women (NSC).  The adjusted remit of the new regional committees and their representation on the NSC is intended to strengthen the capacity for a flow of information between the national and regional level and to improve inter-regional coordination and regional inter-agency working.</p>

            <p eId="para_2341">The project was included in the 2007 Capital Plan up to pre-tender stage.  More recently, approval was granted in May 2008 by the Health Service Executive to the National Rehabilitation Hospital to progress the project to tender stage.  I am advised that tenders from selected contractors have since been received by the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_2342">Clearly, development proposals such as this need to be considered within the context of an overall policy for the delivery of the relevant service.  In the case of rehabilitation, there is an increasing demand, not just in Dublin but across the country, for new services and a growing requirement to enhance existing services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2343">Against that background, in July 2008, the Department of Health and Children and the Heath Service Executive established a Working Group to develop a policy for the provision of rehabilitation services.  Its terms of reference include the development of an appropriate policy framework for rehabilitation and a preferred model of care for the provision of rehabilitation services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2344">The Deputy will appreciate the need to ensure that the proposed development at the National Rehabilitation Hospital is in keeping with any future policy direction determined by the Minister in the light of the work of this Group.  The Group is due to report later this year.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the pace at which this project can progress depends upon the overall capital budget for health and other competing health projects.  The Health Service Executive's Capital Plan for 2009, which reflects its revised capital allocation, is currently being considered within the Department of Health and Children and will be submitted to the Minister in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2345">The proposed development at the National Rehabilitation Hospital will be considered further in the light of the findings and recommendations of the Working Group on the Provision of Rehabilitation Services, available health capital funding and other competing investment priorities.</p>

          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_457">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_2349">In relation to the safety and security of children in the care of the State, I would like to give the Deputy a brief overview of the legislative, regulatory, policy and good practice measures that are currently in place in the child welfare and protection services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2350">The Child Care Act, 1991 places a legal obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  The HSE has, therefore, statutory responsibility for the provision of health and child welfare and protection services.  In implementing the Act, the HSE provides a range of services including family support services, foster care services and residential care services.  A child is taken into the care of the State only as a last resort where alternative care and welfare services cannot adequately meet the needs of the child and his/her family.</p>
            <p eId="para_2351">The Child Care Act, 1991 allows for a child at risk to be taken into care on a voluntary basis or pursuant to a court order.  Provisions have also been included in the Act for emergency situations where there is an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of the child.  Children who are taken into the care of the HSE can be placed in residential care, foster care or relative care in accordance with the Child Care Regulations, 1995.  The regulations cover, inter alia, the operation and inspection of residential centres, care planning, supervision, visiting and review of all cases of children placed in care.  Of approximately 5,000 children in care in Ireland about 4,500 are in foster care.  Almost all of the remaining children are placed in residential units which are operated by, or on behalf of the HSE.  These residential services range from mainstream residential homes and high support units to intensive care placements in special care units.</p>
            <p eId="para_2352">The HSE has recently established a taskforce to bring both standardisation and improvement to a whole range of child protection practices across the country and this taskforce is due to complete its work in May of this year.  Care plans, the care planning process and establishing an assessment framework will be included in the work programme of this taskforce.  This work is a key element of ensuring that children at risk in our society are afforded the protection they need when they need it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2353">The Social Services Inspectorate (SSI) was established in April 1999.  The main function of the SSI is to improve standards in child welfare and protection services by advising the Department of Health and Children on the formulation of standards and then monitoring those quality standards across the sector.  The SSI currently inspects children's residential homes and foster care services operated by the HSE in accordance with and against the Child Care Regulations, 1995 and a number of national standards.  The SSI has played a key and important role in the setting of standards, inspecting and ensuring quality services in the area of children's welfare services.  The role of the SSI is key in ensuring and monitoring the safety of children in the care of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2354">Where units are run on behalf of the HSE, they are currently subject to registration and inspection by the HSE.  Regular meetings take place between the SSI Inspectors and the HSE Inspectors in order to work towards equity in the inspection process.  The SSI also receives HSE inspection reports of the voluntary residential children's centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_2355">The establishment of the SSI on a statutory basis was provided for in the Health Act, 2007 which is currently being commenced.  Section 6 and Section 40 of the Health Act, 2007 which provide for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services were commenced on the 15th May 2007.  The Act provides for a new system of inspection and registration for ‘designated centres' under the Act i.e. residential centres for children (both statutory and non-statutory), residential centres for people with disabilities and residential centres for older people, including private nursing homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2356">HIQA has wide ranging functions under the Health Act 2007 including the setting of standards on safety and quality in relation to services provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and service providers providing services on behalf of the Executive.  These include services provided in accordance with the Child Care Act 1991 and the Children Act 2001.  HIQA also has responsibility for monitoring compliance with standards set.  In addition, HIQA may undertake investigations as to the safety, quality and standards of services where there is a serious risk to the health or welfare of a person receiving those services and the risk may be the result of any act, failure to act or negligence on the part of the HSE or a service provider etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2357">The legislation, regulations, standards, inspection and monitoring systems and other initiatives set out above aim to ensure that the children cared for by the State are safe, protected and secure and I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work in consultation with HIQA and the HSE to ensure that these protections continue to be enhanced.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2364">The HSE reconfiguration plans for the HSE Mid West region are informed by the recently published Teamwork Report.  The Report highlighted the need for changes to be made in the provision and organisation of acute hospital services across the region as it found services are too fragmented, carry increased risks for patients and staff and are not sustainable in their present form.  The HSE has been engaged in a consultation process with key stakeholders as it formulates detailed plans in relation to emergency care, critical care and surgical services in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_2365">The HSE has identified the enhancement of emergency ambulance services as an essential element of the new service delivery arrangements for the Mid West. Protocols are already in place to ensure that all trauma cases will be brought directly to the major tertiary centre rather than the local hospital.  Appropriate protocols in relation to paediatric and obstetric emergencies are being finalised at present.  Plans are underway to introduce a 24-hour Advanced Paramedic service in Clare and North Tipperary and to enhance the level of ambulance cover in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2366">I am satisfied that the measures being taken by the HSE are necessary and appropriate in order to ensure the provision of safe and effective health services to the people of the Mid West region.  My Department has asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the detailed operational issue that she has raised.</p>

In a small number of cases where very specialised surgery is required, it may not always be possible to arrange treatment through an alternative provider. I would hope that surgery can be provided through the public system as soon as possible in this case and I have asked the HSE to consider the matter and reply directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2397">Any savings and similar investments up to €36,000 (single)/€72,000 (couple) will be disregarded when assessing means and only interest from savings or similar investments above these figures will be considered as income.  The relevant portion of savings and similar investments will be assessed on the income calculated at a notional interest rate (currently 5%), based on the prevailing interest rates at the time of application.  The Health Service Executive's (HSE) Central Application Unit will review the notional rate on a quarterly basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2398">Alternatively, where an applicant wishes to have the actual interest from savings/investments considered, then the HSE will apply this approach and use the most beneficial option in favour of the applicant, subject to submission of the appropriate certificates from the relevant institutions.  In the case of "longer term" investment accounts, where the interest is only applied at the end of a fixed period, if the applicant so wishes, the HSE will only take account of the interest earned on the date the investment matures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2399">If a person's circumstances have changed since making a declaration to the HSE, the person should re-apply to the HSE for a medical card based on their new circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_2534">There is a wide range of factors to be taken into account. These include the depth of the water, the amount of clothing, the weight of the victim, the level of consumption of food and alcohol, water temperature, the nature of the seabed and other factors.  These are considered in managing a Coast Guard operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2535">As a very general indication, Coast Guard units would regard searches between 9 and 14 days after an incident in shallow water over the summer as having some potential to result in recovery.</p>

She did present for registration on 17/2/2009 at her local immigration office when her current permission to reside here expired. That office is currently awaiting her registration fee before the registration process can be completed. The Fee for immigration registration is €150. This fee for immigration registration certificates was introduced in the Immigration Act 2004 (Registration Certificate Fee) Regulations 2006, which came into effect on 27 May 2006. The introduction of such a fee had been flagged both in the Immigration Act 2004, and in the discussion document containing the outline policy proposals for an Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill.</p>

However, the policing of border areas, as well as other areas of Donegal Division, is constantly monitored and reviewed in terms of policing requirements and resource allocation, having regard to the regularly updated threat assessment.

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2640">I share the widespread concerns about land ownership policies pursued by the Israeli authorities in occupied East Jerusalem and nearby areas of the West Bank, under which the issues of the eviction of Palestinians and the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements are intimately linked.  Many Palestinians in East Jerusalem are unable to demonstrate legal title to their homes, because of the historical vicissitudes of the administration of the city.  It is in practice almost impossible for them to regularise their position with the Israeli authorities or to obtain simple planning permission for new homes, businesses, extensions to existing homes etc.  Unlike Israelis in similar circumstances, Palestinians found to be in breach of planning rules often find that their entire property is ordered to be demolished, and the inhabitants evicted, in some cases from homes they lived in long before Israel occupied the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2641">In 2008, 89 houses were demolished in East Jerusalem, and some 404 persons evicted, half of them children.  At present, the Israeli authorities have served eviction notices in respect of 88 houses in the Silwan area, which they intend to turn into an archaeological park, and other homes are threatened to make way for settler housing or related infrastructure.  At the same time, illegal Israeli settlements continue to flourish with little or no official interference, and indeed benefit from the provision of substantial infrastructure to support them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2642">These linked policies leave Palestinians in East Jerusalem and its environs in a state of great insecurity.  There is great concern, which I share, that the intended effect of these policies is to alter the demographic character of parts of occupied East Jerusalem, and to cut the area as a whole off from the rest of the West Bank.  Such a policy is not only manifestly unjust and illegal under international law, but presents a serious and growing obstacle to the achievement of a final overall peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinian people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2643">Ireland has been among the EU Member States most active in ensuring that the EU conveys its serious concerns about settlement expansion to the Israeli Government at every opportunity.  The EU has made it clear to Israel that settlement construction in the Occupied Territories, including East Jerusalem, is illegal under international law.  Most recently, the Presidency made a demarche to the Israeli Foreign Ministry in this regard on 11 February last, and issued a public Declaration on the issue on behalf of the EU on 20 February.  Ireland gives substantial financial support to Israeli and other NGOs which defend the rights of Palestinian residents threatened by eviction.  This support is part of our comprehensive programme of assistance to the Palestinian people which amounted to some €8.6 million last year, Irish Aid also contributed €100,000 in 2008 in core funding to the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which is very actively engaged on this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_2645">The Government attaches the highest importance to resolving the plight of our undocumented citizens in the United States and has actively engaged with senior US political figures on their behalf over recent years.  As the Deputy will be aware, we have actively pursued a bilateral approach aimed at reforming our overall immigration arrangements with the United States and facilitating greater legal migration between the two countries.  The approach has had three core objectives; a reciprocal Working Holiday Agreement; new bilateral arrangements to provide reciprocal long term working visas (known as E3s); and a solution for our undocumented.</p>
            <p eId="para_2646">The first of these objectives has already been delivered and the new J1 visas are now being issued to Irish citizens.  The second objective, the provision of long term working visas similar to the E3 visas available to Australian citizens, has formed the basis for detailed discussions with senior Members of Congress over the past twelve months.  We are also in ongoing contact with US lawmakers on the issue of wider immigration reform, including a solution for the undocumented Irish.  Recently, I wrote to Senator Charles Schumer, congratulating him on his appointment as chair of the Senate's Sub Committee on Immigration, and reiterating the Government's commitment to addressing the plight of the undocumented.  Senator Schumer has indicated that he wishes to be helpful, as have several other senior political figures, including Senator John McCain.</p>
            <p eId="para_2647">As the Deputy will appreciate, however, and as our contacts in Congress advise, immigration remains a politically sensitive issue in the US and making progress presents real challenges.  The Taoiseach and I will use the particular opportunity afforded by the St. Patrick's Day celebrations in the US to engage the new Administration at the very highest level on this issue and to build on the progress we have already made in reforming our overall visa and immigration arrangements with the US.</p>

I fully share the families' concern at the lengthy procedure which the US authorities use for the deportation of foreign citizens in such cases. Our Embassy and Consulates in the United States provide consular assistance to Irish nationals who have been detained and who are awaiting deportation. They seek to minimise the detention period by assuring the US authorities that documentation can be provided without delay to enable departure.  They have also succeeded in expediting the deportation process in some cases involving particular medical or other humanitarian issues.  Our Ambassador in Washington has raised with the US authorities the issue of the detention of Irish citizens prior to deportation and has requested that their particular circumstances be taken into account.</p>

            <p eId="para_2681">Ireland, in common with all of our European Union (EU) partners, voted against a resolution on "Combating Defamation of Religion" which was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 18 December 2008 by a vote of 86 in favour, 53 against with 42 abstentions. The resolution was tabled by Egypt on behalf of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. The EU has repeatedly expressed its concerns regarding the general approach, conceptual framework and terminology of such resolutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2682">We believe that the concept of defamation of religion is not consistent with the promotion and protection of human rights. It can be used to justify arbitrary limitations on, or the denial of, freedom of expression. Indeed, Ireland considers that freedom of expression is a key and inherent element in the manifestation of freedom of thought and conscience and as such is complementary to freedom of religion or belief.</p>
            <p eId="para_2683">However, we believe that a clear distinction should be made between the right freely to criticise religions or beliefs on the one hand, and discrimination based on religion or belief, or incitement to religious hatred, on the other. Ireland supported a resolution on the "Elimination of all forms of intolerance and of discrimination based on religion or belief", which was adopted by consensus by the UN General Assembly on 18 December 2008.</p>

As matters stand there is currently provision for  €5.30m in 2009 for the Programme of Grants for Locally based Community and Voluntary Organisations.  The Programme has been heavily subscribed since it was launched last year and at the end of February, some 480 applications were received.  Given this strong level of demand and in the interests of seeking to fund valid applications on hand at end February I have considered it prudent to suspend the programme.  The matter will be kept under review in the light of emerging economic circumstances.</p>

Both Minister Campbell and myself also acknowledged the inherent complexities in compiling, auditing and consolidating these annual reports and accounts and the efforts of both agencies to progress this work.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_2737">As the Deputy will be aware, the list of public bodies covered by the Statutory Instrument to which he refers — the Official Languages Act 2003 (Section 9) Regulations 2008 — is set out in the first schedule to the Official Language Act 2003, subject to the additions and deletions contained in the Official Languages Act 2003 (Public Bodies) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 150 of 2006).  Before making this regulation it was debated twice in draft at the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs at which there was cross party support for the proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2738">Contrary to the impression conveyed by the Deputy's Question, these Regulations have been drafted to allow a phased approach to ensuring compliance and to minimise costs.  For example, the Regulations provide that existing stocks of stationery that do not comply with the requirements may nonetheless be used up over a period of years.  It is not clear, therefore, that any additional costs should arise in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2739">In relation to signage, the Regulations take immediate effect only in the case of new signage.  Existing signs that are not in compliance may nonetheless remain in situ for varying periods of years, up to 1 January 2026.  These provisions are intended to ensure that any costs arising in updating signage are minimal and — if any such costs indeed arise — they can be spread over a number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2740">I might also mention that the consultation process with other Departments and public bodies in relation to these Regulations commenced in 2004.  This allowed a considerable lead-in time for public bodies to prepare themselves for the introduction of the Regulations well in advance of their commencement date.  It also allowed a support service to public bodies to be put in place.  For example, Foras na Gaeilge has developed a database of Irish and English versions of standard signage terms, which is available on-line at www.gaeilge.ie. This is particularly relevant to the needs of public bodies in meeting their obligations under the Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2741">The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that the provision of public services, whether in English, in Irish, or bilingually, requires commitment of time and effort, as well as financial resources, by public bodies.  I take it that the Deputy is not in any way suggesting that it is acceptable to allocate resources to provide such services in English, but not to meet the needs of Irish speakers or recognise their existence in our society.  In replying to this Question, I am continuing to adhere to my policy, based on respect for Members of the House, to reply to Questions in the official language in which they are put down.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2781">I propose to take Questions Nos. 321 and 333 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2782">Rent supplement is administered on behalf of the department by the Health Service Executive as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2783">Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution of €18, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  Many recipients pay more than €18 because recipients are also required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their accommodation costs.  Social welfare legislation provides that all income in cash is assessable for supplementary welfare allowance purposes with the exception of some specific disregards of income.</p>
            <p eId="para_2784">A person who claims a One-Parent Family Payment is required to seek maintenance from her/his spouse or the other parent of the child.  These maintenance payments are assessed as means for the purpose of determining entitlement to a one-parent family payment.  However, vouched housing costs of up to €95.23 per week (rent or mortgage) are disregarded in establishing the rate of one-parent family payment due.</p>
            <p eId="para_2785">Given that up to €95.23 per week of maintenance payments are disregarded in the means test for the one-parent family payment to allow for housing costs, this amount of €95.23 in maintenance payments is regarded as a contribution towards rent.  The total amount of rent supplement payable is calculated taking account of the net amount of income, above the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to her family circumstances, that the claimant has available to contribute towards rent.</p>
            <p eId="para_2786">The Executive has advised that the person concerned was awarded rent supplement in May 2008.  She was awarded maintenance of €150 per week by the Family Law Court in September 2008 but did not notify the Health Service Executive that she was receiving maintenance payments.  The Executive became aware that maintenance payments were being made in February 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2787">The Executive has further advised that her entitlement to rent supplement has been recalculated following an assessment of her current weekly income from one-parent family payment of €188.80 and maintenance of €150.  The combined income of €338.80 is €82.50 in excess of the appropriate rate of supplementary welfare allowance of €256.30.  She is therefore required to contribute €82.50 towards her rent plus the minimum contribution of €18 a week, a total of €100.50. As a result, she is entitled to a reduced rate of rent supplement of €176.40 a week.  The Executive has also advised that an overpayment of rent supplement of €1,455 has been assessed against the person concerned backdated to September 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2788">It is open to the person concerned to appeal against this decision to the Executive's designated Appeals Office.</p>

            <p eId="para_2848">An unemployed person may qualify for Jobseekers Benefit or Jobseekers Allowance.

            <p eId="para_2849">However, a person who engages in voluntary work within the State may continue to be entitled to jobseekers benefit or allowance provided that, in engaging in the voluntary work, the customer continues to satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work.

            <p eId="para_2850">The groups involved may be nationally organised groups or local voluntary or community groups.  The aim of the Voluntary Work Option is twofold, namely, to encourage voluntary organisations to involve jobseekers to the greatest extent possible in their existing activities by creating new opportunities for voluntary work and to inform jobseekers of their freedom to involve themselves in voluntary work and to encourage them to do so.  In addition, the existing Community Employment Scheme, operated by FÁS, offers the opportunity to unemployed persons to participate in paid employment in the social economy.</p>

Alternatively the conversion rate applicable to the next succeeding quarter is used if it is more beneficial to the customer.  When reviewing customers who are in receipt of British pensions the exchange rate used to convert Sterling is the rate applicable to the second quarter (i.e. the quarter in which the British pension increase occurred) or the third quarter if that is more beneficial.  The exchange rate for Sterling to Euro currently being applied by the Department is £1= €1.27116.</p>

            <p eId="para_2857">In assessing the means of a person under 25 years who is living with a parent or step-parent in the family home, account is taken of the value of the benefit and privilege enjoyed by that person by virtue of the fact that they have free board and lodgings.  Board and lodging are taken into account because a person living at home with parents does not have the same expenses as a person who does not live with parents and who has to provide his/her own accommodation, meals etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2858">The value of the free board and lodging is determined by reference to the parental income.  Parents' income from all sources is taken into consideration for this purpose and certain Social Welfare and Health Service Executive payments.  However, there are very significant disregards applied.  Disregards are applied in respect of tax, PRSI, health insurance contributions, superannuation, PRSAs and union dues and rent or mortgage repayments.  A further disregard of €600 a week is applied for a two parent family and €470.00 a week for a one parent family.  An additional disregard of €30.00 applies for each child under age 18 who is not getting a Social Welfare/Health Service Executive payment in their own right and for any child over age 18 in full-time education.  The balance of income is assessed at 34%.  This means that, if a person under 25 is living at home with parents and there are no other siblings, the parents can have weekly income of €600 without it affecting the jobseeker's payment.  The income may be higher if there are other non-earners in the family.  I am satisfied that the current arrangements for assessing parental income in the case of a person under age 25 are fair and do  not force young people to leave home.</p>

            <p eId="para_2860">I appreciate that there are delays in processing claims in some areas and that this is causing difficulties for some people.  However, the average processing time for jobseekers benefit claims processed in February was 3 weeks. This is the national average and there are differences from office to office.  The Department is continuously reviewing its processes in order to deal with claims in a shorter period of time. Additional resources have been allocated to offices and we are in the process of setting up central units that will concentrate on clearing backlogs for offices with the highest amount of arrears.</p>
            <p eId="para_2861">I should also point out that a person who refuses an offer of employment unreasonably, even if it is just a short-term contract, runs the risk of being disqualified for receiving a jobseekers payment on the grounds that he or she is not genuinely seeking work.

            <p eId="para_2863">A self-employed person is not required to cease trading before they can qualify for jobseekers allowance.  A self-employed person can apply for this scheme if their business ceases or if their income falls as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  Jobseekers allowance is a means-tested payment and any person who satisfies the means test and the other conditions of entitlement  will qualify for a payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2864">Legislation provides for the assessment of all income in cash and any non-cash benefits which the person or his or her spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year. The means assessment guidelines state that where the income in the coming 12 months is not ascertainable otherwise, the income for the last 12 months should be taken as a guide, allowing for any factors which it is known will vary.</p>
            <p eId="para_2865">The means of a self-employed person are taken as any net profit that they will earn in the coming 12 months. While their income from the previous twelve months is used as an indication in estimating their likely future earnings, it is not simply assumed that the previous year's earnings will be received in the coming year.  Instead, account is taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.  For example, if a self-employed person lost a contract and was unlikely to find a substitute contract in the coming year, this would be factored into the assessment of future income. It is recognised that the present downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons, particularly those in the construction industry, and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels would be reflected in any assessment of their means.</p>
            <p eId="para_2866">If a self-employed person's situation changes after they have made an initial claim for Jobseeker's Allowance, they can apply to have their means reviewed in the light of their changed circumstances.  In addition it is open to the individual if he or she is dissatisfied with the means assessed to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>

            <p eId="para_2874">During 2008, an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work, including a public consultation process, to develop a National Carers' Strategy. While a number of drafts were produced covering the areas outlined in the terms of reference, a final text was not completed by the working group.  Faced with the current economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time lines which could be achieved. In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy at this time.  I appreciate that it is disappointing for carers and the people for whom they care. I met with some of their representatives last week to inform them of this difficult decision taken by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2875">The Government is acutely aware of the sacrifices made by carers and has sought to make many improvements in services and supports for carers.  Over the past decade, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit, half-rate carer's allowance and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</p>
            <p eId="para_2876">In relation to income supports, in Budget 2009, I increased the rate of carer's allowance for those aged 66 or over by €7 to €239 per week and for those aged under 66 by €6.50 to €220.50 per week.  These increases took effect from January 2009.  Recipients of carer's allowance are also eligible for household benefits and free travel and the respite care grant.  It is estimated that the combined expenditure on carer's allowance, carer's benefit, the respite care grant and half-rate carer's allowance will be €650 million in 2009.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs is committed to continuing to work with the carer representative groups to deliver services in the most effective way and to support the carer groups in the valuable work they do in helping carers.</p>

            <p eId="para_2878">Rental income, net of any deduction due under Section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, is subject to PRSI deduction.  Section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that eligible individuals (individuals over 40 years of age or individuals who are permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from carrying on a farming trade) can claim a deduction against the aggregate of the leasing income from the farm and any other rental income received.</p>
            <p eId="para_2879">The amount of the deduction depends on the duration of the lease. In respect of leases made on or after 1 January 2007, I understand that the amounts concerned are as follows: €12,000 where the lease is for a term of at least 5 years; €15,000 where the lease is for a term of at least 7 years; and €20,000 where the lease is for a term of at least 10 years. These deductions do not apply in the case of leases between family members or other close relatives.</p>

            <p eId="para_3045">In common with other areas of the public service a reduction of 3% in payroll costs has been applied to the Defence Forces. Recruitment was suspended in late 2008 pending consideration of the best means by which to achieve this reduction. My officials and the military authorities are keeping the situation under close review on an ongoing basis to ensure that the key commitments of the Defence Forces both at home and abroad are being met.  The review and any subsequent recruitment in 2009 will prioritise the operational requirements of the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_3046">I am advised that the freeze on recruitment will not have any immediate effect on the capacity of the Defence Forces to do their job abroad. However, that may change, although I cannot project too far into the future. I do not anticipate that the situation will have changed by this time next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3047">The Defence Forces continued to serve on overseas missions throughout 2008. On average, there were 690 personnel involved in UN-led and UN mandated missions throughout last year. Troops on overseas missions serve a six or four month tour of duty. There are no plans to alter this rotation policy in the foreseeable future.</p>

            <p eId="para_3056">The White Paper on Defence sets out the blueprint for a new Reserve Defence Force. This blueprint outlines a new Reserve with a clearly defined role, an enhanced relationship with the PDF, better equipment and training and opportunities for reservists to serve on overseas peace support missions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3057">An Implementation Plan has been developed that will ensure the realisation of the White Paper vision.  The Plan is being rolled out over the period to the end of 2009.  The Agreed Programme for Government contains the commitment to fully execute the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) Implementation Plan by the end of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3058">There has been significant progress to date in implementing the detailed recommendations of the Plan e.g. new organisation structure implemented, major improvements in clothing, equipment, training and resourcing.  In addition, the Reserve is now organised along similar lines to the PDF.  All of these changes are enhancing the capabilities of the Reserve as well as improving interoperability with the PDF.</p>
            <p eId="para_3059">These factors are significant enablers in facilitating future participation by suitably qualified RDF personnel in overseas missions and it is hoped that a small number of Reservists will be able to undertake overseas service in late 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3060">As specified in the Plan, any such participation by members of the Reserve on overseas service is likely to be in specialised areas such as medical, transport, engineering and communications and information services.  This will also be subject to personnel having suitable qualifications, their personal availability and appropriate advance training. Any commitment to overseas service by members of the Reserve will be on a voluntary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3061">The military authorities have sought expressions of interest from suitably qualified Reservists who have undertaken integrated training and are at an advanced stage in identifying Reservists who may be eligible and willing to apply for a small number of specified overseas positions. A final decision regarding their deployment is dependent on the selected personnel completing an extensive training schedule to up-skill to the requisite military standards to enable them to serve overseas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3062">Work on the necessary regulatory changes has progressed, terms and conditions of service are being examined and the Representative Associations will be consulted in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_3063">I am pleased that such work is proceeding on schedule in line with plan provisions.</p>

            <p eId="para_3077">The EU operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina — Operation "Althea" — was established in December 2004, under the authority of UN Security Council Resolution 1575 of 22 November 2004, to replace the NATO-led Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (SFOR). Ireland has participated in EUFOR since December 2004, having previously been a participant in SFOR since 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_3078">The resolution authorised the establishment of a multinational stabilisation force (EUFOR), for an initial period of 12 months, as a legal successor to SFOR. On 20 November 2008, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1845 (2008) renewing EUFOR's mandate for a further period of 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_3079">The EU Defence Ministers General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) meeting held in Brussels in November 2008, which I attended, focused on the future of Operation ALTHEA.  At this meeting, Defence Ministers discussed four possible options in relation to the future of the Operation. However, there was a particular focus on progressing the preferred option of Member States, the transition to a support and training operation — advisory role only and it was agreed that this option should be explored in more detail. This mission will involve some 200 personnel, mainly military specialists.</p>
            <p eId="para_3080">It is expected that the EUFOR mission will commence transition in March with the phased drawdown of EUFOR.  This process should be completed by June, 2009.  With the closure of EUFOR, the Defence Forces contingent will be withdrawn.  Should the decision to transition be deferred for any reason, I will obviously have to look at the issue again in the context of the outlook for the mission and the resources available to Defence.  There are no plans for the Defence Forces to participate in the follow-on mission.</p>

            <p eId="para_3089">As previously advised, the facility in question is provided for in the Dublin regional waste management plan for which the four Dublin local authorities have statutory responsibility under the Waste Management Acts. Section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996 precludes the Minister from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance in particular circumstances by a local authority of a function conferred on it under the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_3090">In view of the project's status as a prospective public private partnership, my Department was involved in certifying that the procurement was conducted in accordance with public policy on the procurement of infrastructure in this way. The Department by letter dated 14 September 2005 advised Dublin City Council, which acts as lead authority for the project, that having considered the submissions received in respect of the procurement process there was no objection to Dublin City Council proceeding to enter into contractual arrangements with the selected private partner. My Department and the National Development Finance Agency had representation on the project board established to manage the procurement process. The project board did not have a role in regard to the contractual arrangements subsequently entered into by Dublin City Council.  Accordingly, my Department has not had sight of, nor is it a party to, this contract.  The project board had its final meeting on 14 May, 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3091">In line with national policy the Exchequer does not fund new heavy waste infrastructure, landfills or waste to energy (incineration) plants. These are to be provided as purely private sector commercial initiatives or by way of public private partnerships with local authorities and accordingly the capital costs of this project will not fall to be met by the Exchequer.  My Department has not provided any guarantee to Dublin City Council in respect of this project.</p>
            <p eId="para_3092">Enforcement of statutory planning and environmental conditions is a matter for the appropriate regulatory authorities and the Minister has no function in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_3122">In a judgment in July 2008, the European Court of Justice ruled that the retention permission system as it applies in Irish law with regard to projects that require or may require an environmental impact assessment (EIA) under the EIA Directives does not comply with the Directives and needs to be amended.

            <p eId="para_3123">In the meantime, in respect of applications for permission for the retention of unauthorised development where such development should have been subject to prior EIA, planning authorities have been advised to return the application as invalid, on the basis that there is no jurisdiction to grant retention planning permission in those circumstances.

            <p eId="para_3128">I understand the question to refer to contracts in respect of residential tenancies, as my Department has no function in relation to the general law governing the operation of contracts.  Private residential tenancies, with limited exceptions, are governed by the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and the main provisions in respect of rent and rent reviews are set out in Part III of that Act. Under section 19 of the Act, it is prohibited to set the rent under a tenancy at a rate above the market rent at either the beginning of the tenancy or at any subsequent rent review. Both tenants and landlords have the right to a review of rent, even where there is no provision to that effect in the tenancy agreement. Such a review may not take place more frequently than once in each period of 12 months nor in the first 12 months of the tenancy.  I have no plans to introduce further legislation in this area at this time; however, I will keep the matter under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_3129">With regard to local authority housing, local authorities set rents for social housing tenants based on their Differential Rents Schemes.  While it is a matter for each authority to determine an individual's rent, the principle of the scheme is that a household is charged a rent based on a proportion of their income. It would be very prohibitive if a tenant's rent could not be reviewed downwards, as a tenant's circumstances could change many times throughout the lifetime of their tenancy.</p>

Local authorities are best positioned to make judgments in this regard based on local circumstances.  Local authorities may also consider the scope to re-negotiate Part V agreements, having regard to the nature of contracts entered into by them with developers.</p>

While there is no statutory deadline by which decisions on boundary extensions must be made, the practicality of making boundary changes in proximity to the date of local elections is a matter which must be considered.  Prior to receipt of Navan Town Council's application for a boundary alteration, I received a submission from the Town Council which requested that I meet with a delegation of Councillors.   My Department has also corresponded with, and met with officials from, Meath County and Navan Town Councils in relation to the Town Council's application.

            <p eId="para_3181">Where local authorities propose to provide water services treatment plants by way of Public Private Partnership procurement — typically by way of a Design, Build and Operate (DBO) contract — they are required to prepare a Public Sector Benchmark (PSB) Report.  The PSB consists of a comprehensive, detailed risk adjusted costing of the project elements over the whole life of the project on the basis of conventional procurement and enables a comparison to be made on a like for like basis between traditional and PPP procurement. PPP tenders are then evaluated by reference to the PSB to determine whether the PPP approach will deliver better value for money compared to traditional procurement.  In all PSB reports to date, the PPP route has been shown to provide better value for money than conventional procurement, of up to 15%-20 % in the case of capital costs and 10-15% in the case of operating costs, depending on scale.</p>

            <p eId="para_3201">Dublin City Council continues to liaise closely with my Department on the progress relating to its housing-related public private partnership programme.  At present, the City Council is reviewing the project at St. Teresa's Gardens in the context of the current market environment and the requirements of the community at that site, to determine the next steps in the procurement process.  The project at Dolphin House is at the very early stages in the process, with initial consultations between the City Council and the community, and procurement has therefore not yet begun.  The Council is closely engaged with the developer at the Cherry Orchard site to find a resolution to some planning difficulties that have arisen with the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_3202">Following the failure to reach agreement with the developer at St. Michael's Estate, O'Devaney Gardens, and Dominick Street last summer, the City Council has proactively examined its options to ensure the regeneration at these sites takes place.  The Council established a multi-disciplinary Special Housing Taskforce to develop plans for the regeneration of these estates and presented its report to the Council in December 2008.  The prioritisation of these projects is, however, a matter for the City Council in the context of its existing commitments and future plans.  To date, my Department has received one project proposal, in respect of St. Michael's Estate, and this is currently being considered by the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_3204">Under the Fisheries Acts, primary responsibility for the management, conservation, protection and development of the inland fisheries resource, including the issue of fishing licences is the responsibility of the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards.  I have no function in the matter.  I have been advised, however, by the Northern Regional Fisheries Board that the applicant identified by the Deputy, who applied for an eel fishing licence in 2009, has been informed that a decision on his application has been deferred until the May meeting of the Northern Regional Fisheries Board.  Over the coming months, Ireland's draft Eel Management Plan, which was forwarded to the Commission on 9 January 2009, will be evaluated by the European Commission as to its adequacy in delivering the objectives of the EC Regulation.  We await the outcome of that assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3205">I have previously advised this House that scientific advice by the International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) recommends that all exploitation and other anthropogenic impacts on production and escapement of eels should be reduced to as close to zero as possible until stock recovery is achieved.  Ireland's draft Eel Management Plan relies upon a number of management measures, including cessation of the fishery, in order to address the critical status of stocks and to achieve the targets set in the EC regulation.  In the circumstances, for the regional fisheries board to issue a fishing licence for a year in which no fishing may be permissible, would be inappropriate until the adjudication from the European Commission is obtained.</p>

            <p eId="para_3209">I propose to take Questions Nos. 414, 415 and 434 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3210">The Home Energy Saving Scheme provides grant assistance to homeowners for attic and wall insulation, efficient boilers and heating controls.  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) advised on the measures for inclusion in the scheme.  SEI has built up a considerable expertise on residential energy efficiency matters as part of their statutory remit and in the course of their oversight of the pilot phase of the scheme in 2008.  The measures selected currently are deemed to be those most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners at the least cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_3211">There are other measures not currently included in the scheme that may also improve the energy performance of a home.  My Department and SEI will be keeping the scheme under review and if there is a strong cost-benefit case for adding other measures to the scheme, it will be given every consideration.  Homeowners will be able to formally apply under the Scheme from later this month.  In the meantime, they can register their interest with SEI on 1850 927000 or at hes@sei.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_3212">Homeowners may arrange to have a building energy rating carried out immediately, if they wish.  While a grant of €200 is available for this, it is not a requirement for participation in the scheme.  To qualify for the grant, the house must be assessed by a registered Building Energy Rating (BER) assessor before and after works are carried out.  SEI will pay the grant for the BER after eligible works are completed and the appropriate documentation is submitted.  While they can proceed with the BER assessment now, homeowners should not undertake any works until they have received formal grant approval from SEI, as work underway or recently completed will not be considered for grant assistance.  As of 6 March, 1,086 contractors had applied to SEI to register for the Scheme.  The list of registered contractors will be continually updated by SEI as applications are received from contractors.</p>

            <p eId="para_3214">The Government has set a target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020, which will represent up to 250,000 cars on Irish roads over the next 12 years.  This scale of deployment of electric vehicles will have a very positive impact in terms of reducing carbon emissions and Ireland's reliance on imported fossil fuels in the transport sector.  Key initiatives to advance this policy objective have already been put in place.  The Minister for Finance has provided a new tax incentive for businesses to purchase electric vehicles in the 2009 Finance Act.  This enables businesses to write off 100% of the cost of purchase against tax under the Accelerated Capital Allowance Scheme.  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) is also developing a €1 million project on alternative transport technologies including electric vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_3215">I have established an inter-departmental agency taskforce to progress the framework for deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  The first meeting of the taskforce, which is chaired by my Department, was held in October 2008 and it is meeting regularly.  All relevant Departments, including the Department of Transport, are members of the taskforce.  SEI, ESB, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, and other stakeholders and agencies are also represented on the taskforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_3216">The task force is assessing the infrastructure options for the national roll-out of electric vehicles.  The Government is sending out the message that Ireland is open for business in this area and we will also take account of global developments as the technologies mature.  The taskforce will report its initial findings and advise on next steps in the next few months.</p>

            <p eId="para_3218">Salmon fishing licences are public licences issued on foot of applications received annually.  The Control of Fishing for Salmon Order establishes the priority to be afforded by regional fisheries boards to applications for commercial licences.  The current provisions of the Order were fully endorsed by the National Fisheries Management Executive and the National Salmon Commission following detailed consideration in 2005.  The provisions in the existing Order, which allow a nominee to apply for a licence in his or her own right, are widely regarded as sufficient for the equitable management of the commercial fishery and do not require amendment.  I can advise the Deputy that I am in the process of reviewing the existing Order in advance of the 2009 fishing season.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Seán Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_3263">I propose to take Questions Nos. 421 and 422 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3264">As the Deputy may be aware, the publication of the Geothermal Resource Map of Ireland by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) in July 2004 highlighted the potential of deep geothermal energy.  The potential for a good geothermal energy resource in the South Dublin region was also identified in the study.  The report recommended that support be given for a medium-depth pilot borehole, for example on the Blackrock–Rathcoole Fault in an area with many potential users.  SEI funded a study, in conjunction with University College Dublin and Conodate, to examine the economic and technical potential of deep geothermal energy sources along the fault line running beneath the University's Belfield campus.</p>
            <p eId="para_3265">Following on these studies I understand that a private company, in conjunction with SEI, is developing proposals in relation to geothermal energy at Newcastle, County Dublin.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on these proposals at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_3266">Surface geothermal energy is currently viewed as a commercially viable heating option for consumers and Government support for this technology is being supported through the Greener Homes and REHeat grant schemes operated by SEI.</p>
            <p eId="para_3267">Deep geothermal energy projects tend to be larger in scale and are usually associated with the development of a local district heating system to supply customers.  Given the limited rock temperature and porosity data available in urban regions at the relevant depths, developers will also face technical risks at the start of the project.  Therefore in order to encourage investors to develop deep geothermal energy projects, a clear understanding of the regulatory and legal risks must be available together with appropriate measures to protect an investors project interests.</p>
            <p eId="para_3268">As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 393 of 24th February 2009, a Geothermal Working Group was established by the Department in 2008 to set out the options for the development of a proportionate and realistic regulatory regime for geothermal energy utilisation in Ireland.  As part of this process, a public consultation was held between June and August 2008.  Over 30 submissions were received, mainly from people and organisations closely associated with geothermal energy development in Ireland.  The results of the consultation exercise are currently being analysed.  I expect the Working Group to report to me shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_3269">The Working Group will report on effective regulatory and other measures that could be taken to increase the contribution of geothermal energy to meeting Ireland's targets for use of alternative energy.  The legal aspects of a regulatory framework are among the issues under examination.  Complex legal issues arise and consideration of these will impact on the timing of the Working Group's report.  I will decide on the need for legislation after I have considered that report.</p>

Section 14 of the 2007 Act amends section 28(8) of the 2001 Act to allow RTÉ to use public funds drawn from television licence fee income for the purposes of providing the new television service.

            <p eId="para_3277">In September 2008 my Department was informed by RTÉ that, due to the rapidly worsening economic conditions and falling advertising revenue, they would need to postpone the launch of the RTÉ International television service by a year.

            <p eId="para_3402">My Department has entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  3 is currently planning the construction and rollout of the required infrastructure for the purposes of the provision of the service.  Challenging roll out targets are contained in the contract with 3.  Services will begin to be rolled out in April 2009 and the entire NBS area must be covered by September 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3403">While the electoral divisions detailed hereunder will be covered by the NBS, 3 is not in a position, at this juncture, to predict the progression of site rollout in advance of obtaining the necessary planning permissions.  One month prior to the NBS being launched in any given area, 3 will implement a marketing campaign to announce the forthcoming service availability.  This campaign will include, inter alia, local press and outdoor advertising.</p>

            <p eId="para_3487">The purpose of AHCS1 forms is to permit testing practitioners to manually submit amendments to test reports that have already been submitted electronically.  The acceptance of such forms is at the discretion of the Superintending Veterinary Inspector (SVI) in my Department's local District Veterinary Office (DVO).  These forms can be rejected for a variety of reasons.   In cases where the AHCS1 form has been rejected by the DVO, the original is kept on file and the testing practitioner is notified that the change requested has not been accepted. When such a rejected AHCS1 form relates to a testing practitioner wishing to add an animal to a test report, the current procedure is that he is notified by the DVO that a further individual test on the animal in question will be required.</p>
            <p eId="para_3488">My Department does not maintain a register of copies of AHCS1 forms that are returned to practitioners. I am not aware on any instances where an SVI has been involved in any irregular practice relating to AHCS1 forms or indeed test certification.  The inference in the question that a Department official ‘covers up false certification' is a most serious charge and, if the Deputy has any evidence of such illegal practices, he should provide the specific information to my Department and the matter will be fully investigated.</p>

            <p eId="para_3591">New rules restricting fishing vessels' days at sea in the Irish Sea and the waters to the northwest of Ireland and Scotland have been introduced as part of the EU's revised Cod Recovery Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_3592">The plan has introduced a new system of effort management that sets effort ceilings (expressed in kilowatt-days) for groups of vessels or fleet segments.  The management of these ceilings has been devolved to the national level.  Member States have received annual allocations of fishing effort for the areas covered by the Plan, which include the Irish Sea (ICES area VIIa) and the waters to the northwest of Ireland and Scotland (ICES area VIa).  The effort allocation levels were established by the EU Fisheries Council on the basis of an EU Commission proposal.  They were calculated by averaging the fishing activity levels of each Member State in the areas during a reference period of 2004-2006 or 2005-2007 and then reducing that effort by 25%.  This methodology means there is now limited fishing effort available for all Community vessels, including Irish vessels, fishing in the designated areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3593">Under the plan, each Member State is required to introduce a licensing regime to manage its effort allocations.  Any vessel longer than 10 metres overall must have an authorisation from its Member State in order to operate in one of the designated areas using the fishing gears covered by the plan.  Member States can decide on the method of allocating their national pools of fishing effort, which are broken down by fishing gear type.  Following consultations with representatives of the Irish fishing industry, a pilot system of authorisations and allocations of fishing effort was introduced for the period from 1 February to 30 April 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3594">The pilot scheme used the following approach to allocate fishing effort in areas VIa and VIIa to Irish vessels for the pilot management period of 1 February to 30 April 2009:</p>

Each vessel's "best year" of fishing days in the areas during the reference period was used to establish its track record.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3596">Distribution bands were established for each of the specified gear types to facilitate the allocation of days-at-sea to vessels based on their track records with those gears.

Overall, my Department received 271 applications to plant 1,850 hectares of miscanthus and 360 hectares of willow. My Department has issued ‘approvals' in respect of the 900 hectares of miscanthus and is preparing ‘approvals' for the 360 hectares of willow. The question of re-allocating unused funding from the allocation under the Bioenergy Scheme for willow planting to accommodate additional miscanthus planting in 2009 is currently being considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_3660">Council Regulation 2371/2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy requires Member States to put in place measures to adjust the fishing capacity of their fleets in order to achieve a stable and enduring balance between such fishing capacity and their fishing opportunities.  Commission Regulation 1438/2003 of 12 August 2003, laying down implementing rules on the Community Fleet Policy as defined in the Council Regulation, specifies the Reference Levels (effectively fleet capacity limits) expressed in terms of gross tonnes (GTs) and engine power (expressed in kilowatts — kW) for the total fishing capacity of fishing vessels flying the flag of each Member State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3661">Member States are required to ensure that these Reference Levels are not exceeded and to manage entries into the fleet and exits from the fleet in such a way that, from 1 January 2003, the entry of new capacity into the fleet without public aid is compensated by the previous withdrawal without public aid of at least the same amount of capacity.  The Regulation also sets out provisions relating to the maintenance by Member States of fishing fleet registers as well as the Community fleet register, containing information supplied by Member States on vessel characteristics and activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_3662">In Ireland, the fleet reference level and entry/exit regime is managed at operational level by the Licensing Authority for Sea Fishing Boats, as part of the sea fishing boat licensing and registration process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3663">Under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, the functions of sea-fishing boat licensing were transferred from the Minister to the Licensing Authority for Sea-Fishing Boats, which operates on an independent basis subject to criteria set out in that Act and Ministerial Policy Directives.  All applications for sea-fishing boat licences are considered by the Licensing Authority.  The head of the Licensing Authority is the Registrar General of Fishing Boats who is a senior official in the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3664">The Registrar General of Fishing Boats has advised me that the Licensing Authority for Sea Fishing Boats requires documentary evidence of the Gross Tonnage, (GT) and Engine Power in Kilowatts, (KW) for each vessel as part of the sea-fishing boat licensing and registration process.  The Marine Survey Office of the Department of Transport provide technical expertise in relation to aspects of licensing and registration of fishing vessels.</p>

            <p eId="para_3675">The food and drinks sector exhibits a wide regional spread.  This is seen prominently in data for the Border region (Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal) where 111 food and beverages manufacturing units are situated (10 more than the Dublin region).  As such, approximately 17% of food and drink units are located in the Border region.  The most recent county breakdowns available from the CSO Census of Industrial Production (2005) show that there were 14 food and drink units in Cavan employing 1,460 people and 17 units in Monaghan employing 1,963 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_3676">My Department has supported farm and food enterprises along the food supply chain in accordance with the Agri-Vision 2015 strategy and Action Plan.  This includes grant aid to support capital investment to improve competitiveness.  Over €11 million in grant aid has been awarded under the Dairy Investment Fund to support capital investment in Cavan.  In the period 2004 to 2006 almost €2.4 million in grant aid was awarded to egg packing and horticulture companies in Monaghan under my Department's Marketing and Processing Scheme.  In December last a further €0.4 million was awarded to two small meat enterprises and a horticulture enterprise in Monaghan.</p>
            <p eId="para_3677">The rapid depreciation of sterling has presented a huge challenge for the food sector and highlights the importance of diversifying more of our exports.  Bord Bia has accordingly developed promotional programmes and services to assist Irish food and drink companies to build business in Euro zone markets and Bord Bia research has prioritised target markets for prepared foods and identified opportunities for cheese and dairy ingredients.  During 2009 Bord Bia will implement a comprehensive set of promotional programmes and services, which have been developed in consultation with industry bearing in mind the impact of the sterling differential on competitiveness.  They include:  Food Ingredients/Nutraceuticals (Europe), which will provide industry with detailed market requirements particularly for dairy ingredients. Participation in Trade Fairs in Paris, Madrid, Portugal and Amsterdam, mentoring on supplying Continental supermarket groups and provision of market insights.   Private Label seminar (Scandinavia, Germany &amp; Holland) with company specific mentoring and Private Label Manufacturers Association trade fair in Amsterdam.  The establishment of a full-time Bord Bia presence in Shanghai is also significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_3678">As regards the dairy price situation, I have made clear to EU Commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel my continued concern on the current state of the market and pressed for the immediate activation of market support measures to get the sector through this very difficult period.  While the early introduction of Private Storage Aid for butter, the commitments regarding intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder and the reinstatement of export refunds in recent weeks have been helpful, I have emphasised that we need measures such as competitive refunds that lead to the permanent disposal of product and attractive intervention tendering arrangements as well as consideration of supports for the use of dairy products to help restore order to the sector.  I will be discussing this matter further with the Commissioner later this week.</p>

            <p eId="para_3680">The pier at Brandon is the property of Kerry County Council and responsibility for its repair and upkeep rests with the Local Authority in the first instance.  Each year my Department invites proposals from all Local Authorities for inclusion in the annual Fishery Harbours and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme. No application was made by Kerry County Council in respect of the above mentioned location under the 2009 Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3681">However, any future application made by Kerry County Council will be considered based on available Exchequer funding and overall national priorities.  The Department of Community, Rural &amp; Gaeltacht Affairs administers the Coastal Development Scheme under the CLÁR programme.  This programme runs in conjunction with my Department's Fishery Harbours and Coastal Infrastructure Development Programme.  Under the programme, projects approved under my Department's programme can be co-funded by Department of Community, Rural &amp; Gaeltacht Affairs at a rate of either 37.5% or 12.5%, depending on the size of the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_3682">Qualifying projects up to a cost of €200,000 can be funded 37.5% by my Department and 37.5% by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs with the Local Authority contributing 25%.  Qualifying projects costing in excess of €200,000 can potentially receive up to 75% of funding from my Department with the remaining 25% shared equally between the Local Authority and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>

            <p eId="para_3708">I propose to take Questions Nos. 486 to 489, inclusive, 538, 542 and 567 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3709">I wish to clarify for the Deputies that there will be no pupil with a special educational need who will be without access to a special needs teacher as a result of my Department's decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment and retention of teachers to special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_3710">The Deputies will be aware that all primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources to enable them support pupils with high incidence special educational needs including mild general learning disability (MGLD). All primary schools were given these additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model of learning support/resource teaching introduced in 2005. Schools can decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils. Most pupils with a MGLD are included in ordinary classes with their peers and are supported by their class teacher. The curriculum is flexible so that teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3711">The Deputies will be aware that allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment. In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1. My Department however allows for a small reduction in this number and permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class. In the case of 128 classes in 119 schools, the number of pupils dropped below this minimum. These schools therefore are no longer entitled to the teaching posts in these classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3712">There are currently 534 pupils enrolled in these classes. It is not possible to give a precise cost of the posts concerned due to the varying salary costs of the teachers in question. However, it is estimated to be in the region of €6.8m.  I will arrange for a list of the schools concerned to be sent to Deputy Ó Caoláin.</p>
            <p eId="para_3713">In 2005 when the General Allocation Model was introduced, schools with additional teachers in classes for MGLD were allowed to retain the teachers for these classes. Effectively, these schools received a double allocation. The number of these special classes has decreased over the years and schools have integrated the children into age-appropriate mainstream classes.  All of the other primary schools in the country who do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation Model.</p>
            <p eId="para_3714">I am open to listening to proposals from schools where they can demonstrate that it is educationally more beneficial for the pupils involved to be in a special class of their own rather than to be integrated with their peers and supported by the mainstream classroom teacher and the learning resource teacher.</p>

The overall policy goal is to ensure the highest standard of permanent accommodation for all schools. However, in the context of a rapidly increasing school population, the necessity to put additional accommodation in place in a short time frame, and competing pressure on the capital budget available to my Department, it is necessary to make use of temporary accommodation in order to meet accommodation needs in some circumstances.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_4844">I propose to take Questions Nos. 492, 548 and 555 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4845">The costs in school transport, a service delivered by Bus Éireann on behalf of my Department, have been increasing arising from a range of issues such as:</p>
            <p eId="para_4846">In ensuring a comfortable and safe transport service for over 135,000 children daily travelling to and from school (breakdown by county not readily available), measures to ensure the highest standards including the phasing out of the 3 for 2 seating arrangement on both primary and post-primary services, providing all children with an adult seat each;</p>
            <p eId="para_4847">The addition of a considerable number of vehicles to address capacity shortfalls arising from the decision to provide each child with an individual seat and the equipping of all dedicated school buses with safety belts;</p>
            <p eId="para_4848">Increased demands to meet the needs of special needs children;</p>
            <p eId="para_4849">Parental choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_4850">In order to minimise the overall impact of these charges on families:</p>
            <p eId="para_4851">the increases will apply to the 55,000 eligible post primary pupils and children availing of concessionary transport;</p>
            <p eId="para_4852">Primary school transport remains free of charge for over 54,500 children;</p>
            <p eId="para_4853">Parents will be offered the option to spread the amount due over two payments payable in July and December;</p>
            <p eId="para_4854">A maximum family payment of €650 will apply;</p>
            <p eId="para_4855">Charges continue to be waived in the case of eligible post-primary children where the family is in possession of a valid medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_4856">The overall spend on school transport in 2009 is now estimated to be €194m — a reduction of €2m in the revised allocations as a result of efficiencies. This represents a significant increase of over €84m (over 77%) since 2004, up from €109.8m.</p>
            <p eId="para_4857">Taking into all the factors outlined, it is not envisaged that there will be a reduction in the annual charge system, the estimated expenditure or the level of charges.  My Department has also commenced a Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme which is to be completed before the end of the year.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_4862">I propose to take Questions Nos. 493, 499, 515 and 575 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4863">I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared. The various impacts at  school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4864">The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes. In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_4865">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009 including the schools referred to by the Deputies.  As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4866">The above allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position. The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes. The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist. The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board including any appeals submitted by the schools referred to by the Deputies will have been considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_4867">It is open to any primary school Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to the independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0002/2009, available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_4868">The Appeal Board meets in May, July and October each year to consider cases submitted. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Allocations Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available on my Department's website. Closing dates for  receipt of staffing appeals in the current year are 29 April, 29 May and 9 October 2009.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p>

            <p eId="para_4870">As part of the primary school curriculum Irish is a compulsory subject.  Department Circular 12/96 applies to primary schools funded by my Department and sets out the conditions under which exemption from the study of Irish may be granted to primary pupils. In relation to one criteria, an exemption can be granted for pupils with a specific or general learning difficulty on foot of a report furnished by a qualified psychologist.</p>
            <p eId="para_4871">The same criteria apply to granting of exemptions at post-primary level, under Departmental Circular M10/94. Under the terms of this Circular, delegated authority to grant exemptions from Irish, within the conditions laid down, is vested in the school management. Exemptions granted within the stated criteria to a student in a State funded primary school will be carried forward to their post-primary school.</p>
            <p eId="para_4872">As my Department has no function in relation to the funding of private primary schools any exemptions granted by private schools, while not automatically carried forward to post-primary schools, are reviewed by post-primary schools on a case by case basis. I understand that the school in question in relation to this case, is reviewing the student's details prior to their entry to the post-primary school next September.</p>

            <p eId="para_4899">The position generally regarding the planning process for school building projects is that schools must comply with the requirements of the Local Government Planning and Development Acts.  However there has been some recent changes to the legislation which has provided certain exemptions for temporary schools.  (These are prescribed in Statutory Instrument 235 of 2008).</p>
            <p eId="para_4900">Also in relation to the wider matters of school provision and the planning  process, on 1 August 2008, together with Mr. John Gormley, T.D., Minister for  the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. Michael Finneran, T.D.,  Minister of State with responsibility for Housing, Urban Renewal and Developing Areas, announced the  publication of a Code of Practice on the Provision of Schools and the Planning  System.</p>
            <p eId="para_4901">The Code of Practice which was agreed between the two Departments, in  conjunction with the City and County Managers' Association, sets out the roles,  responsibilities and specific actions to be taken in relation to forecasting  future demand for school places and planning for schools provision through the  development plan, local area plan and development management processes.  The Code of Practice, which is issued as statutory guidelines under section 28 of  the Planning and Development Act 2000, is part of a wider package of  initiatives designed to facilitate the provision of schools and schools-related  infrastructure within the planning system.</p>
            <p eId="para_4902">The Code of Practice will help to ensure best practice approaches are followed  by planning authorities in facilitating the timely and cost-effective roll-out  of school facilities by the Department of Education and Science.  The Code of  Practice builds on guidance provided in the Department's June 2007 Development Plan Guidelines and outlines the principles and scope for integrating schools provision with the development plan process and, in particular, in linking anticipated levels of demand for school places with housing strategies and the provision of large-scale residential developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_4903">One of the Code of Practice's core objectives is that the provision of any new  schools should be driven by and emerge from an integrated approach between the planning functions of planning authorities and the Department of Education and Science, and that planning authorities will co-operate and co-ordinate with the Department of Education and Science in ensuring the timely delivery of schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4904">My Department consults regularly with the Department of the Environment,  Heritage and Local Government, on planning matters so as to ensure the  smoothing of any issues that might arise during the planning application  stage.

            <p eId="para_4908">I propose to take Questions Nos. 505 to 507, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4909">My Department is at the forefront of design with respect to energy efficiency  in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National  and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design  and Specification and, recently, by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education  and Science during a presentation on energy efficiency in school buildings by  officials from my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4910">The Department's Technical Guidance Documents, which set the benchmark for low energy design in schools, are clearly focused on energy efficiency and are  based on solid energy research projects. All new schools must achieve a BER  rating of A3.</p>
            <p eId="para_4911">It has been demonstrated that all Primary Schools designed and built in line  with the above policy and the technical guidance documents can have an energy  performance that is 2.3 times more efficient than International best practice  and nearly five times more efficient than schools built in the late '80s.</p>
            <p eId="para_4912">My Department's policy is supported by a strong research programme with over  thirty five research projects at various stages currently in hand.</p>
            <p eId="para_4913">A hybrid approach is taken with respect to low energy design in schools based  on maximising natural resources and energy efficient technologies. New schools  are positioned to maximise gain from the sun during the day for passive solar  heating and natural daylight. Passive solar design saves 20% of early morning  heating period and adequate natural daylight when combined with automated  lighting systems in the classrooms can eliminate the need for electrical light  for up to 80% of the schools teaching hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_4914">Energy efficient boilers and individual room temperature controls combined with  a strong emphasis on air tight testing and high insulation levels minimise heat  requirements. Water usage is minimised through automatic shut off taps and dual  flush toilets, while local water blending valves are provided to prevent  scalding and rain water recovery is provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_4915">One of the above projects is to evaluate and test the suitable application,  performance and compatibility of Photovoltaic for electrical generation in  schools with school electrical requirements in terms of demand characteristics,  controls, reliability, maintenance and operation. This project now  includes, as part of its review, the recent Government decision to allow  micro-generators to sell into the national grid as announced on 26 February  2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4916">As with the application of any new technology in schools, decisions on the  national roll out and procurement options will only be taken after the  technology is tested appropriately in the school environment.</p>

An examination of the overall operational, governance and resourcing framework are important elements of the strategy review. The government is investing unprecedented levels of public funding in higher education and it is appropriate to look at the effectiveness of use of current resources, identify any potential for rationalisation or change to maximise the use of those resources and identify how any additional resource requirements can be met having particular regard to the difficult budgetary and economic climate that is in prospect in the medium term.   The Comptroller and Auditor General has signalled his intention to carry out a programme of work in the higher education area that will assist in informing the review of the effectiveness of use of current resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_4947">Voluntary secondary schools have also benefited from an increase in the school services support grant by €8 per pupil since January 2009.

            <p eId="para_4949">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long term. In this respect my Department, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be entirely spared, and I acknowledge the impact of funding restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level. However, these are the inevitable result of the challenging economic environment and the need to manage Exchequer resources prudently. These decisions included the withdrawal of teaching posts which have been historically provided under previous disadvantage schemes to non-DEIS schools and the increasing of the pupil teacher ratio across all second-level schools from 18:1 to 19:1. In the case of fee-charging post-primary schools, there will be an additional one-point adjustment to 20:1.</p>
            <p eId="para_4950">Teacher allocations to all VEC schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules each VEC is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The deployment of teaching staff, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the VECs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4951">In accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e. curricular concessions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4952">This concession is available as a short-term support to enable essential curricular provision to continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_4953">The allocation processes also include appellate mechanisms under which VECs can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The CEO of a VEC can submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established specifically to adjudicate on appeals on staffing allocations in post-primary schools. This Board operates independently of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4954">Discrete allocations are also made to VEC schools to cater for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with Language difficulties for example.</p>
            <p eId="para_4955">The main focus of Social Inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools. There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_4962">I propose to take Questions Nos. 520 and 543 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4963">My Department is aware of the correspondence referred to by the Deputies and has been in touch with the school concerned.  I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4964">In light of the Budget 2009 decision a new circular will be published shortly setting out how the new arrangements will operate for the allocation of language support teachers. The budget measures will mean that the level of language support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007. However, there will be some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment. Language support posts are allocated during the Spring/Summer period on a provisional basis initially and are confirmed following receipt from the schools in September 2009 of actual enrolments of pupils requiring language support.</p>
            <p eId="para_4965">We still envisage having over 1,400 language support teaching posts in our primary and post-primary schools in September 2009 and up to about 500 other teachers in part-time posts. By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.</p>

            <p eId="para_4967">Following a survey of over 900 schools across the country my Department has set up a database giving details regarding their use of prefabricated accommodation. The Deputy will be aware that demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002. The overall policy goal is to ensure the highest standard of permanent accommodation for all schools. However, in the context of a rapidly increasing school population, the necessity to put additional accommodation in place in a short time frame, and competing pressure on the capital budget available to my Department, it is necessary to make use of temporary accommodation in order to meet accommodation needs in some circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_4968">Details of the schools in County Kerry renting prefabricated units are given in the following tabular statement. The information sought by the Deputy regarding the cost of these rentals prior to 2008 is not readily available.  However, I can say that the total amount spent on rentals in Co. Kerry for 2008 was €459,347.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_5130">As I indicated in my reply on 26 February 2009, FÁS in addition to their own delivery of courses, already contract with other bodies for provision of relevant courses.  VECs and Institutes of Technology can bid for the provision of appropriate courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_5131">As the Deputy is aware, FÁS operates under the aegis of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and her Department.  The Department of Education and Science liaises with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with a view to improving the co-ordination of our efforts and facilitating better co-operation and collaboration at local and regional level among the relevant education and training providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5132">In particular, the Department of Education and Science participates in the Upskilling Co-Ordination Group, which comprises representatives from this Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and key training providers including FÁS, Skillnets, Engineers Ireland, the County Enterprise Boards, the VECs, the Institutes of Technology and the Higher Education Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_5133">The purpose of this group is to discuss any issues concerning the provision of training that arise amongst the State's key training providers. It aims to improve interagency cooperation, facilitate the exchange of information on operational and policy aspects and the avoidance of duplication. It also aims to ensure that the impact realised from the State's investment in education and training is maximized.</p>
            <p eId="para_5134">All of these organisations are working together at both national and local level to ensure that both the education and training sectors respond in an optimal way to the situation we are currently facing.  I consider that the present arrangements are the best way to address the provision of relevant courses for recently unemployed workers.</p>

            <p eId="para_5136">As I stated in my reply to the Deputy on 26 February 2009, secretaries and caretakers in primary and post-primary schools who are not members of a public service pension scheme are not subject to the public service pension-related deduction.</p>
            <p eId="para_5137">There are some secretaries and caretakers who are members of a public service pension scheme, for example in community and comprehensive schools. In such cases, the schools have been advised by my Department of the arrangements they need to implement to give effect to the pension-related deduction.</p>

            <p eId="para_5139">My Department provides grant aid towards the provision of temporary school accommodation to the management authorities of education providers where it is established that a need for such temporary accommodation exists. Generally, where schools require temporary accommodation, the Board of Management is responsible for acquiring such temporary accommodation and the rental contract is between the Board of Management and the supplying contractor.</p>
            <p eId="para_5140">A review of rental policy is ongoing which will, inter alia, cover an examination of the contract terms to incorporate buy out, buy back, rental costs and relocation options if local circumstances require it. The review will involve an investigation of all existing rental contracts between schools and suppliers with a view to identifying action to reduce overall rental costs for the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5141">In the meantime, schools proposing to rent temporary accommodation must seek competitive quotes from suppliers which should allow them to take advantage of changing market prices.</p>

It is also open to the school to apply to the Planning and Building Unit of my Department for emergency works funding for capital works of an urgent nature.</p>

            <p eId="para_5350">I wish to advise the Deputy that, in relation to cases taken against my  Department by persons who were abused whilst pupils in day schools, the State's position is that it should not have been sued because the Minister for  Education &amp; Science has no direct involvement in the daily running of a school.  The manager of a school is directly responsible for the day-to-day operation and governance of a school.  This position has been clearly conveyed to all such parties engaging in legal proceedings against my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5351">In relation to the case raised by the Deputy, the matter is being handled by the State Claims Agency on behalf of the State.  Judgement has been reserved on the issue of costs which was heard on Monday 23rd February.  It was necessary to have such a hearing as the person in question was seeking her costs against the State.  The State had to make a case for its costs given that the State was not found liable by either the High Court or the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_5352">The Supreme Court was told by counsel for the State that, while an award of costs against the Plaintiff was being sought, the matter of enforcement would be treated with great sensitivity.  Our desire is to find a fair balance between the need to protect the taxpayer against costs incurred in defending cases where the Courts have decided that the State has no liability and to treat people humanely at the same time.  As I have already publicly stated, there is no question of the State seeking to take this person's house.</p>
            <p eId="para_5353">However, any person who pursues a legal action against another party should be appropriately advised and fully aware in advance that failure to win the action will most likely result in full costs being awarded against them.  My Department cannot sustain a position whereby persons can take cases against the State on the basis that, win or lose, they would get their costs.  This is not a financially sustainable position and would be grossly unfair to the taxpayers of this country.</p>

         if, notwithstanding the energy saving benefits of proper insulation in schools and orientation of classrooms, his attention has been drawn to the potential to cut energy costs at schools and raise much needed revenue at the same time through the on-site installation of modern noise-minimised wind turbines in view of the fact that this would produce large amounts of electricity particularly during the winter months and schools would then be able to sell back energy produced after school hours and during holiday periods to the grid; if he will amend his policy regarding the installation of such turbines in new school builds given the considerably shorter payback required; if he will expedite pilot programmes in view of the need for such substantive money saving initiatives in the current economic climate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5356">I propose to take Questions Nos. 531 and 532 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5357">My Department has a strong record in developing low energy educational buildings. For the past eight years my Department has been using a process called the DART approach to develop sustainable and energy efficiency in educational buildings. This acronym focuses on four key areas, namely; Design, Awareness, Research, and Technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_5358">The performance of my Department in the area of low energy design has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification and by the Taoiseach's Public Service Excellence Awards in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_5359">Rather than develop a unique focus on energy design the Department have taken a more holistic approach and have developed our technical guidance on energy efficiency in school designs as an integral part of the suite of technical guidance documents.  These guidelines encourage the design team to take a complete design team approach from project conception. There is particular emphasis on elimination of over design, improved thermal envelope design and improved passive solar design, natural ventilation and day lighting along with advanced heating and lighting controls.</p>
            <p eId="para_5360">It has been demonstrated that all Primary Schools designed and built in line with the above policy and the technical guidance documents can have an energy performance that is 2.3 times more efficient than International best practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_5361">The application of wind energy schemes in schools has been explored by my  Department and the results indicate that given the scale of application to match demand and capacity in a meaningful way schools are better placed to connect to one of the main wind energy electrical suppliers to maximise the potential of green electricity. This is kept under review given improvements in technology and the market place, with this in mind and given the Government's policy decision to allow micro-generators to sell into the national grid as announced on 26 February 2009, my Department are currently reviewing the above.</p>
            <p eId="para_5362">It must be remembered that a sustainable solution involves the matching of a sustainable resource with the end users needs and not just the application of the resource.</p>
            <p eId="para_5363">As with the application of any new technology in schools, decisions on the national roll out and procurement options will only be taken after the technology is tested appropriately in the school environment.</p>

            <p eId="para_5393">I wish to clarify, for the Deputy's information, that my Department has not made any announcement in relation to cutbacks in the number of SNAs.  There has been no change in the criteria governing the appointment of SNAs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5394">As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special needs.  SNAs are recruited specifically to assist in the care of pupils with disabilities in an educational context.  Applications for an SNA may be considered where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their behaviour is such that they are a danger to themselves or to other pupils.  A pupil's level of care may diminish over time as the child matures.  Pupils may move to a different school or on to post-primary school.  In such situations, the NCSE will review and adjust the SNA support required in the school.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p>
            <p eId="para_5395">Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie.  </i>I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p>

The Deputy will appreciate that this information is not recorded in my Department on a Constituency basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5409">The Deputy will be aware that demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002.  The overall policy goal is to ensure the highest standard of permanent accommodation for all schools.  However, in the context of a rapidly increasing school population, the  necessity to put additional accommodation in place in a short time frame, and competing pressure on the capital budget available to my Department, it is necessary to make use of temporary accommodation in order to meet accommodation needs in some circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_5422">Dublin Institute of Technology is an autonomous statutory body established under the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006. Under the terms of these Acts, the governance and day-to-day management of the Institute, including its organisational structures, are matters for which the Governing Body and the management authorities of the Institute are responsible. I understand that over the last academic year wide-ranging consultation has taken place within the  Institute regarding proposals aimed at improving organisational effectiveness  in all areas of provision. I am informed that the proposals under consideration  by the Institute emphasise the importance of responding to economic and  societal needs, and in particular to supporting industry sectors where DIT has  particular strengths such as tourism and food. It is my understanding that  there are no proposals to discontinue programmes in tourism and food. Neither I  nor any of my officials have received any representations in relation to the  matter.</p>

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_751">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_5444">I wish to advise the Deputy that there has been no change in the criteria governing the allocation of teaching and/or care resources to pupils with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5445">The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all pupils,  including those with special educational needs, can have access to an education  appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary  and post-primary school network.  There are now over 19,000 staff in our schools working solely with children  with special needs. This includes over 10,000 Special Needs Assistants —  compared with just 300 in 1997. There are also over 8,000 resource and learning  support teachers — compared with about 2,000 in 1998. More than 1,100 other  teachers support children in our special schools, while hundreds more work in  special classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5446">As well as this significant increase in the numbers of additional teachers and  SNAs directly providing appropriate education and care supports for children  with special educational needs, much investment has taken place in the  provision of transport, specialist school accommodation, home tuition,  assistive technology and equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5447">Additional teaching and SNA supports are allocated as necessary by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in line with my Department's policy to support children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5448">The Deputy will also be aware that additional funding has been allocated to my  Department in 2009 to provide for an expansion of the National Educational  Psychological service so that all schools in the country will be covered by the  service. The additional funding available to NEPS, which represents a 33%  increase over the 2008 allocation, will facilitate the recruitment of up to 50  further psychologists. It is envisaged that this will bring the number of NEPS  psychologists by the end of 2009 above the proposed 200 incorporated in the  Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_5449">This investment will significantly enhance the capacity of our educational  psychologists to directly support schools in the development and delivery of  appropriate interventions for children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5450">Additional funding is also being provided to the National Council for Special  Education in 2009 to increase the Council's capacity in the move towards the  full implementation of EPSEN. The additional funding will enable the Council to  continue to improve, plan and co-ordinate the delivery of services for children  with special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5451">I have also provided for further investment in teacher training in this area.  This will ensure that teachers are provided with opportunities to access  continuing professional development so that the learning and teaching  needs of all pupils with Special Educational Needs continue to be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_5452">The Deputy will be aware of the decision taken at the time of the Budget that  the remedial/resource grant would no longer be payable as a separate grant but  the available funding was included as part of the enhanced levels of capitation  funding to schools.  This approach will give schools more flexibility and  discretion on how to target funding to the school's own priorities based on its  knowledge of the needs of the students it serves.</p>
            <p eId="para_5453">I wish to assure the Deputy that the provision of appropriate educational  intervention and supports for children with special educational needs continues  to be a key Government priority.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_5456">The two post primary schools to which the Deputy refers are among a number of schools that were judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs from 2005 to 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5457">Following the introduction of DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools), a commitment was given, as a concessionary measure, to Non DEIS schools in receipt of resources under pre-existing schemes, including the Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) service, that they would retain a level of support in line with their size and disadvantage levels for the duration of the  DEIS Initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_5458">Given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult choices had to be made in order to contain public sector spending.  One of these decisions is the withdrawal of the HSCL services from all Non DEIS schools with effect from September 2009.  The two post primary schools mentioned by the Deputy will lose their HSCL services at the end of the current school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5459">The main focus of Social Inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools.  There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5460">It has been necessary to re-cluster some DEIS schools that previously shared HSCL posts with non DEIS schools.  The two primary schools, which were clustered with the post primary schools now losing HSCL services, will receive additional HSCL services as they have been re-clustered with another primary school in the town.  The three schools will have the services of 2 HSCL coordinators for the 2009/10 school year.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6280">Secondary — 12.89%</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6281">Community and Comprehensive — 28.57%</p>

            <p eId="para_6283">A more detailed breakdown on a county basis is not readily available and will be sent separately to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_6284">DEIS provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  It is designed to ensure that schools serving the most disadvantaged communities benefit from the maximum level of support available.  As a result of the identification and review processes, 203 second level schools have been included in the SSP under DEIS.  The plan is being rolled out on a phased basis from 2006 to 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_6285">The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and was supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_6286">A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.  In advance of the DEIS action plan, the findings of research carried out by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) showed strong evidence for the proposition that the disadvantage associated with poverty and social exclusion assumes a multiplier effect when large numbers of pupils in a school are from a similar disadvantaged background.  Schools identified for inclusion in DEIS were adjudged by the independent identification process to warrant inclusion based on their level of disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_6287">The national figures provided in the table above show that 50.2% of VECs, 28.57% of Community &amp; Comprehensive and 12.89% of Secondary Schools are included in the DEIS programme.  The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs until 2010.  There will not be an opportunity before this for existing schools to be included in the current DEIS programme of supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_6288">The Department has commissioned the ERC to conduct an independent evaluation of DEIS over the period of the action plan to 2010.  This evaluation will aim to monitor the effectiveness of the programme and assess its impact on students, families, schools, and communities at primary and post-primary levels.  The thrust of the evaluation is systemic in the sense that it is designed to inform policy making on the role that initiatives like DEIS can play in improving educational attainment, promoting social inclusion and identifying models of good practice in the application of resources and supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_6289">The next identification process for disadvantaged schools is due to take place in 2010.  A Steering group has already been established and has commenced work in examining the socio-economic and other variables that collectively best  predict achievement.  Wider consultation with education stakeholders and other partners will form an important part of the identification process.</p>

            <p eId="para_6295">As a result of changes in Budget 2009, the book grant is now available only to schools within the DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) scheme.  By limiting the school book grant to schools within the DEIS scheme, savings of  €7.5m will be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_6296">DEIS is the action plan for educational inclusion and focuses on addressing the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities.  Approximately €7 million was made available in 2008 to DEIS schools at primary and post-primary level for the school book grant scheme; this fund of €7 million will be made available for distribution to schools in the DEIS programme in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6297">My Department continues to urge schools to implement book rental schemes as a measure to minimise the cost of school books to all parents.  This was the recommendation of a consultancy report, submitted to my Department in 1993, which dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school text books.  The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a Code of Good Practice for successful operation of book rental schemes. My Department fully endorses the report's recommendations.</p>

            <p eId="para_6299">Whole-school evaluations (WSE) were conducted in the schools referred to by the Deputy during 2008 and the evaluation reports have been published and can be accessed by the public on my Department's website www.education.ie.  While the effectiveness of Home School Community Liaison that have operated in the schools has been acknowledged in the published WSE reports, the two post primary schools are among a number of schools that were judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs from 2005 to 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_6300">A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.  The review was concluded and the results were notified to schools in August 2006.  The post primary schools in question appealed their non inclusion in DEIS.  Both their appeals were unsuccessful.</p>
            <p eId="para_6301">Following the introduction of DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools), a commitment was given, as a concessionary measure, to Non DEIS schools in receipt of resources under pre-existing schemes, including the Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) service, that they would retain a level of support in line with their size and disadvantage levels for the duration of the DEIS Initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_6302">Given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult choices had to be made in order to contain public sector spending.  One of these decisions is the withdrawal of the HSCL services from all Non DEIS schools with effect from September 2009.  The two post primary schools mentioned by the Deputy will lose their HSCL services at the end of the current school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6303">The main focus of Social Inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools.  There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_6308">My Department provides grant aid towards the provision of temporary school accommodation to the management authorities of education providers where it is established that a need for such temporary accommodation exists.  Generally, where schools require temporary accommodation, the Board of Management is responsible for acquiring such temporary accommodation and the rental contract is between the Board of Management and the supplying contractor.  In between 1% and 2% of cases my Department may rent directly from providers, this generally arises in relation to developing areas where a new school is being established.</p>
            <p eId="para_6309">A review of rental policy is ongoing which will, inter alia, cover an examination of the contract terms to incorporate buy out, buy back, rental costs and relocation options if local circumstances require it.  The review will involve an investigation of all existing rental contracts between schools and suppliers with a view to identifying action to reduce overall rental costs for the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6310">In the meantime, schools proposing to rent temporary accommodation must seek competitive quotes from suppliers which should allow them to take advantage of changing market prices.</p>

        <b>Deputy Brian Hayes</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         the way he proposes to expect to meet the demand for further education and PLC places, in view of the cap imposed by him, and the likelihood that teachers will adhere to letters of agreement, <i>vis-à-vis</i> class size agreements entered into between teachers organisations and his Department some years ago, which effectively agree to a ratio of not more than 24:1 for practical classes and 30:1 for theory classes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_6314">The number of approved PLC places is set at its current level of 30,188 in recognition of the need to plan and control numbers and to carefully manage expenditure within the context of overall educational policy and provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_6315">In terms of meeting the demand for further education, my Department, in conjunction with the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Social and Family Affairs and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, is working as a matter of urgency to identify innovative and creative ways to maximise provision and enhance effectiveness.  My Department is also working closely with  all the stakeholders and providers in the further and adult education sector in order to address the retraining and upskilling needs of the workforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_6316">As part of our efforts in this regard my Department and representatives of the Irish Vocational Education Association and Institutes of Technology Ireland participate in the Upskilling Co-Ordination Group chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  My Department is also liaising with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with a view to improving the  co-ordination of our efforts and facilitating better co-operation and collaboration at local and regional level among the relevant education and training providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_6317">The increase in unemployment brings with it many challenges, including that of retraining and upskilling. In order to address these challenges in this difficult financial situation we must continue to target and prioritise our resources to maximum effect across the education sector.  I am confident that by working closely with other Departments and agencies we can maximise the impact of our collective endeavours in meeting the challenges presented by the current economic situation.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         the reason he refused to enter into an agreement between the further education sector and his Department in July 2008, on the basis of the establishment of the formal recognition of the further education sector, and effectively recognising that FE students are not second level students, and consequently need specific recognition within education policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_6319">In December 2006, my Department began negotiations with management and unions in relation to Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) provision in the further education sector, as envisaged under the Social Partnership Agreement "Towards 2016".  "Towards 2016" also acknowledged that the level of resources for the PLC sector would be determined in the light of resources generally and the implications for other areas of education.</p>
            <p eId="para_6320">A draft agreement, concluded with management and the TUI, provides a basis for the future development of the PLC sector. Implementation will have to be considered in the context of current and future budgetary provisions for my Department and will have to take account of the present and prospective economic and budgetary context and related financial constraints.</p>

         if he will ensure that a school (details supplied) in County Sligo will be provided with €50,000 funding to complete essential works on construction of a resource room in view of the fact that the work was commissioned by the contractor for €175,000 but the school only received €120,000 funding; if he will reverse the decision to cut the teaching numbers at the school by one in view of the fact that this will result in class sizes of 34 and more students, and the detrimental impact that this will have on the pupils educational needs and school resources; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_6327">The school referred to by the Deputy was approved funding of €120,000 for the provision of an additional classroom.  The management sought an increased grant toward the provision of additional accommodation over and above that approved.</p>
            <p eId="para_6328">The school were advised that in the context of the funding available and the number of applications for that funding, their application was not successful.  An appeal from the school management is under consideration and a decision will  be conveyed in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_6329">I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6330">The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6331">In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by  which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_6332">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009.  As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts.  It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6333">The above allocations are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position.  The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist. The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>
