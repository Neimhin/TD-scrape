            <from>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Brendan Howlin)  (Deputy Brendan Howlin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3">I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 47 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4">Latest figures from across the public service, excluding the health sector, indicate that approximately 4,000 are expected to retire in the first two months of 2012.  In the health sector the data are based on the period September to February, with approximately 3,500 expected to retire in that timeframe.  These figures are based on data reported by all public service employers about the numbers of retirement applications received.  In some instances, staff will withdraw their application to retire owing to personal circumstances.  There are also cases in which individuals who wish to retire have not given the full three months notice requested by the employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">In the first instance, responsibility for operational planning in the context of reducing resources rests with the relevant public service body and its parent Department.  Public service organisations must fully use all mechanisms set out in the public service reform plan for discharging work, including reorganisation and redeployment of staff.  Only after this will the issue of recruitment for current or emerging business needs arise.  Should a Department identify a potential exception to the moratorium on recruitment the sanction of my Department must then be sought.  Exceptions to the moratorium may be granted on the following basis: where statutory posts must be filled for legal reasons; where failure to fill posts would result in a breach of EU or international regulations and impact upon exports, etc.; in safety-related posts where a failure to fill the post could leave the State open to potential legal liabilities or for security reasons; specialist and technical posts that ensure a continuity of operations such as legal officers, laboratory staff, maritime safety staff, etc.; and where continuity of front-line services must be ensured.  In the case of the education and health sectors, a number of grades are exempt from the moratorium in order to ensure vital services are maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">Each sector in the public service has been establishing its own strategic workforce planning group to ensure sectoral employers develop plans to deal with the operational and strategic consequences arising from staffing reductions in the coming years.  The sectoral groups are liaising with the central strategic workforce planning forum under my Department.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
            <p eId="para_7">That is the script the Minister brought to the Chamber approximately three months ago.  No new information has been given today.  That, in itself, is disappointing because the purpose of this last oral question session with the Minister before 29 February is to elicit information on what will happen when we know thousands will leave front-line services.  The Minister has given no indications and has read out the list of statutory posts and the various obligations required to be met.  He read it out <i>ad nauseam</i> during the course of last year.  It would have been helpful if he had provided information relevant to what would happen in January and February.  We are in a new year and expect new information.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">I want to ask the Minister about front-line services.  Essentially, I will concentrate on the nursing grade which was not referred to in the document.  The Minister referred to grades in the health and education sectors but not nurses.  I listened on the car radio today to a consultant from the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick who said that if nurses were not replaced, it might lead to fatalities in the maternity ward in the hospital.  What further notice does the Minister require than a consultant saying this about a hospital?</p>
            <p eId="para_9">The Minister referred to safety issues.  What does he consider to be a safety issue?  If HIQA was indicate to the HSE that it must have so many nursing staff in a particular ward, would that be considered to be a safety issue and thus allow one to breach the embargo forthwith?</p>
            <p eId="para_10">The Minister set up the strategic workforce planning group and there is a planning forum under his Department, but he has not given any outcomes of what is happening in regard to these bodies.  He has indicated today and previously that people were asked to give three months notice.  He, everyone in the public service and I know that the majority are not required to give three months notice.  All a public servant is required to do is to give one month's notice.  People will give notice up to next week.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_3" as="#Minister_for__Public_Expenditure_and_Reform__Deputy_Brendan_Howlin">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
            <p eId="para_11">That is true.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
            <p eId="para_12">The figures outlined by the Minister are not correct.  I accept some of those who indicated they would retire will not do so, but more may give notice next week.  What will the Minister do, especially with nurses in front-line services?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_5" as="#Minister_for__Public_Expenditure_and_Reform__Deputy_Brendan_Howlin">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
            <p eId="para_13">I wish to be as helpful to the Deputy and the House as I possibly can.  I will take the last question first.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">The Deputy is correct.  People may not have given notice yet because, by virtue of their contractual arrangements, they are only required to give four weeks notice.  I asked, as I repeatedly said in the House last year, for three months notice in order that we could make advance plans.  Most public servants do not want the situation to worsen as they leave and the vast majority with an intention of leaving have already given notice.  I wish to be as helpful as I can such in giving a breakdown of the data available to date.  However, the Deputy is correct; some people who have not yet given notice will apply to leave and I dare say there are many on the list who will withdraw their application.  The figures, therefore, are tentative and the Deputy is correct to that extent.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">I understand that in the education sector approximately 2,000 have indicated an interest in leaving, of whom 1,500 are teachers.  In the Civil Service the number is approximately 794; in local authorities, 730; the Defence Forces, 192; and the Garda Síochána, 297, giving a total of 4,014.  Between September and the end of February in the health service, the indicated number so far is in the order of 3,500.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">I have indicated that I will be flexible in seeking to ensure that front line services are protected.  I informed the committee when the Deputy was present last year that, although the full year retirements might amount to 9,000, we would indicate that up to 3,000 people could be recruited into the public service.  We want to do that in a focused way that meets the criteria we have set and I would be happy to discuss the matter with the committee.  We have strategic planning groups in each sector to ensure that front line services are protected as far as possible.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_6">
            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
            <p eId="para_17">Despite the fact that the head count reduction is the Minister's main achievement, as he sees it, in public sector reform, it is a disorganised and potentially damaging approach towards reducing the gross pay bill.  The Minister is on the record as saying that the full reduction he envisages will reduce the gross pay bill by €2.5 billion from 2008 levels.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_7" as="#Minister_for__Public_Expenditure_and_Reform__Deputy_Brendan_Howlin">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
            <p eId="para_18">Some €3.5 billion if one counts the levy.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_8">
            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
            <p eId="para_19">Will the Minister square this assertion with the fact that, in the next breath, he conceded that, while 9,000 individuals may exit the service, recruiting 3,000 more might be necessary?  How has the Minister calculated the level of savings?  Will he clarify whether he has taken account of the cost of pensions for those leaving the service in his global figure?</p>
            <p eId="para_20">On the face of it, the Minister seems confident - I am unsure why - that none of this will have an adverse impact on front line services.  Anyone working in the public service knows full well that haemorrhaging of this scale will have a negative consequence.  The Minister stated that he was prepared to lift the moratorium and sanction appointments.  Only his Department can do that.  What will be the sanction process?  The payments made to Ministers' advisers come to mind.  We were told that breaches of the pay ceiling needed to be sanctioned by his Department, but he was quite liberal and sanctioned 14 such breaches.  Will he assure us that he will be equally accommodating in the protection of front line service provision?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_9" as="#Minister_for__Public_Expenditure_and_Reform__Deputy_Brendan_Howlin">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
            <p eId="para_21">I do not expect any acknowledgment or praise from the Deputy opposite and I am never disappointed.  The head count reduction is a strategic part of the Government's plan to reduce numbers, given that it constitutes a permanent reduction in pay.  If one merely reduces pay, a choice that some Deputies on both sides of the House have indicated their preference for, it could develop back.  Reducing in quantum terms the total number working in the public service is a permanent reduction.  It is necessary, as we will borrow €1.5 billion per month during 2012 to pay for these services.  We want to do this in a strategic way.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">We have managed to make radical reforms in a range of areas.  I am disappointed that there is no acknowledgment of the significant, ground-breaking reform programme that I presented to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Committee of Public Accounts last year.  It entailed 200 individual actions and 70 programmes.  I have set up a reform office in my Department and recruited an external director to drive reform.  We can bring about radical change while protecting front line services.  Unlike in many other European jurisdictions, Ireland has no national strikes, working to rule, and so on.  We are getting on with the job while making changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">Unfortunately, I have not been able to answer all of the list of questions.  We have quantified the amount of money involved.  The cost of pensions would be a real cost in any event.  These people have worked up to 40 years and the planning for their pensions have been under way for those 40 years.  It is not a new cost that was previously unaccounted for or unknown.  It would have to be paid in any event, perhaps in one year or two, because the full complement of contributions has been made by these public servants.  The strategy on which the Government has embarked, its reform agenda, is comprehensive, ground-breaking and different.  I expect it to bear great fruit in the coming years.</p>

            <p eId="para_24">In regard to the additional staff to be recruited in the course of the year, it is my understanding that the majority will be teachers filling the vacancies that arise in schools throughout the State.  Will the Minister give a commitment that where there are problems in front line services due to reduced numbers of nurses in the health sector, he will consider allowing additional recruitment?  I know he will not say "Yes", but I hope, on behalf of the people, that he will give it favourable consideration.  It would set people's minds somewhat at ease.</p>

It is important that we put people's minds at ease in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">The troika views asset disposal as a structural reform measure, intended to improve efficiency and competition in the economy while offering the prospect of reducing overall debt levels.  The Government, views asset disposal as offering the potential to release value from State assets for use in employment generating initiatives in the economy, as set out clearly in the programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_33">In our most recent discussions, which concluded last week, the troika signalled that in the context of Government pursuing an ambitious programme of asset disposal, it would be prepared to agree to the retention of a sizeable amount of proceeds from such disposal for investment in job creation initiatives in the economy.  This remains the policy of the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_34">When colleagues from the Technical Group and I asked representatives of the troika during our recent meeting about the proceeds of sales of State assets, we were told that, as per the bailout programme, the initial plan was that the moneys would go towards repaying the State's debts.  However, they further indicated that if there is potential for the creation of "real" jobs - I am not sure what they meant by this - they may consider some of the money being allocated for that purpose.  In principle, there is not much benefit in selling assets at this time given that there is no market for them.  The troika said it was not interested in fire sales - which suggests this is more ideologically driven than anything else - and is looking not alone for money but value.  Also, it appears to be of the view that the private sector does things better than the public sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_39">There were a number of questions and assertions in Deputy Wallace's contribution.  A programme for Government was negotiated by the two parties in Government, namely, Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  People will be aware that both parties have different perspectives in regard to the sale of State assets.  However, we entered government in unprecedented economic times.  We are in an incredible hole.  The unified view of this Government is that we need to grow ourselves out of this terrible mess we inherited from our predecessor government and we need to create jobs.  However, we need resources to create jobs and do not domestically have those resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">NewERA, put forward during the last general election by Fine Gael, looks at what happened in the early years of this State when capital was not available for job creation and public capital was used to create the ESB, Bord na Móna, Aer Lingus and so on.  We need to have capital for the next generation.  The NewERA entity has been established, as has the strategic investment fund.  We need to have access to funds to resource these entities to create jobs, which is what we are doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">The previous Government accepted the troika's view that money had to be used to retire debt <i>simpliciter</i>.  We have said “no” to that.  It has taken a number of goes at it but we have moved the troika considerably.  The word I have used in the response to this parliamentary question is an agreed word with the troika, namely, “sizeable” amounts of money from the sale of State assets can be deployed.  Those discussions are ongoing.  I can assure the Deputy that there will be no fire sale.  We will do what is in the best interests of the economy and jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_60">The implementation body for the Croke Park agreement published its first annual progress report in June 2011.  The report examined the savings and reforms delivered in the first year of the agreement and found that sustainable pay bill savings in the order of €289 million had been achieved during the review period.  It also reported that solid and measurable progress had been made on implementing the action plans for reform in each sector, while pointing to certain issues that needed to be accelerated.  The interim report published by the body in November provided further evidence of progress on the delivery of change and reform right across the public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">The second annual review of the agreement is scheduled to take place after Easter 2012 and will assess the savings achieved in the second year of the agreement.  As before, it also will scrutinise the level of progress being made on implementing the reform programmes in each sector, and I look forward to the outcome of that review.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">The Government has indicated that the public service agreement represents a key enabler in meeting its fiscal targets under the obligations arising from the EU-IMF joint programme of assistance.  The quarterly returns made to date by the Government under the programme on public service numbers and the pay bill have indicated that the numbers of public servants are falling and are on track to meet the targets set by the Government.  As I announced in my Dáil speech, the Government has set a target of €400 million in payroll savings this year.  As I have stated, the Government aims to reduce the overall cost of paying public servants to deliver public services by €3.5 billion or approximately 20% in the seven-year period to 2015.  This will be achieved through substantially reduced numbers as well as through the pay cuts that were applied in 2010 and through ongoing pension related deductions.  The Croke Park agreement enables these ongoing reductions in pay bills to be delivered on a planned basis in an environment of industrial peace.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">The Government reaffirms its commitments under the Croke Park agreement on pay rates and job security for serving public servants.  I have stated repeatedly that these commitments are contingent on delivery of the necessary flexibilities and reforms that will be required.  Paragraph 1.28 of the Croke Park agreement states: "The implementation of this Agreement is subject to no currently unforeseen budgetary deterioration."  While I do not wish to speculate about what might happen into the future, I have no proposals to invoke that clause.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">I thank the Minister.  A few minutes ago, the Minister referred to the Darby O'Gill school of economics, of which he is the best exponent present on this matter.  The Minister has stated his target for payroll savings under the Croke Park deal for 2012, as announced by him on budget day, is €400 million.  However, he omitted to mention the cost of €600 million in lump sums to be paid this year.  Although he lectured Members a moment ago about balancing books, I repeat my main criticism of the Minister, which is he only ever gives half the picture.  He mentions the savings but does not mention the cost of achieving those savings.  This year, he will spend the guts of €1 billion to achieve these savings.  Pensions must be paid to those who will retire from 1 March, as they no longer will be in employment, and there will be lump sum payments.  Consequently, it will cost approximately €1 billion to bring about the aforementioned staff reductions at the end of February.</p>

I would like to be informed as to what the Croke Park agreement is preventing from happening.  If people are seeking a straightforward pay cut across the entire public service, let them spell this out.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">I provided all the figures when I appeared before the relevant committee and made sure to disaggregate everything.  The reality is that these are costs which will have to be met.  The people in question have, by and large, worked for up to 40 years in the public service.  They have made their pension contributions in the expectation of obtaining both a lump sum and a pension at the end of their careers.  This aspect is always factored in when costings are being made.  I accept that some of the cost has been brought forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_71">The target of the Government - this represents a fundamental alteration of the policy which obtained for the previous ten years - is to downsize the public service by a further 27,500 between now and 2015.  The downsizing to which I refer will be permanent.  We are going to do things differently and, as a result, greater productivity and flexibility will be required.  We have established a programme to achieve this.  I have laid before the committee of which the Deputy is a member all the information on the implementation plans we are pursuing in order to develop a more productive, cost-efficient, efficient and less wasteful public service of which we can be proud.  The Deputy knows this full well.</p>
            <p eId="para_72">I agree with the Deputy that the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.  In that context, we will be obliged to ensure the various things to which I refer will be implemented.  We are facing into a very difficult couple of months, when the quantum of people in question will leave the public service.  This will test the level of flexibility we will achieve under the Croke Park agreement in order to ensure front-line services will be maintained in the absence of additional costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_73">I have only one point to make on this matter.  The Minister continually provides information on the gross savings to be made from the point of view of payroll.  We know that people are entitled to their lump sums and pensions.  All I ask is that the Minister provide the net figure for savings to the taxpayer.  He continually refers to the savings to be made in one little sub-silo in his Department, namely, public sector pay; however, he has not mentioned the additional costs that will accrue from the payment of lump sums.  When he speaks on this matter, he should indicate what will be the net figure for savings to the taxpayer, not that which relates to sub-silo to which I refer.</p>

            <p eId="para_74">I have been extremely transparent in the figures I have provided.  However, I do not believe in double accounting.  I will discuss the matter of the overall cost of pensions in detail following the February deadline in order that everyone will be aware of the exact position.  The lump sum payments will be a once-off cost but the payroll saving will be permanent.  I am not thinking in terms of 2012 alone; I am also considering what will be required for recovery and beyond.  I am interested in developing a much more efficient, restructured and revitalised public service which will be managed differently.  The Department and the relevant office are driving the process in this regard.  As we unveil new initiatives relating to shared management, better procurement which is the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes and so on, I will come before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss them.  We are going to make matters better.</p>

            <p eId="para_75">50<b>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</b> asked the <b>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</b> his views on the fairness and sustainability of higher-end public sector wages in the context of recent reports showing them to be significantly above their European equivalents and reports that the perception that Irish higher-end public sector workers are significantly higher paid than their counterparts in other EU countries is an impediment to advancing negotiations with the Troika.

            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
            <p eId="para_76">As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I am extremely conscious of the fiscal crisis facing Ireland and the loss of economic sovereignty which has resulted from the economic mismanagement of the country in previous years.  We continue to work in consultation and partnership with the troika in implementing the EU-IMF programme which provides an agreed but difficult fiscal path for the Government and the people.  The public service pay bill is an important constituent element of the programme on which a substantial part of the burden of adjustment must fall.</p>
            <p eId="para_77">While comparisons of public service pay rates across countries are not widespread, it is the case that the best available figures, those published by the OECD as part of its Government at a Glance 2010 report, do not show Irish public service pay rates to be significantly out of line with those in other OECD countries across a broad range of disciplines on a purchasing power parity basis.  Furthermore, the statistics on which the OECD based its report predate the pay reductions applied to all public servants, on a progressive basis, under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2010.  The pay reductions applied to higher paid public servants under that legislation were based on the recommendations of the review group on higher remuneration in the public sector which conducted a cross-country comparative exercise on pay rates for certain senior grades.  On foot of this, the then Government cut the pay of the highest paid public servants by between 8% and 20%.  A further reduction of 10% was applied to the pay rates of new recruits at entry level across the entire public service from 1 January last year.  Furthermore, to help ensure pay expectations for higher paid public servants are set appropriately and having regard to the resources available to the State, the Government has accepted my proposal to apply a pay ceiling in respect of new appointments at the highest levels in the public service and new appointments at CEO level in the commercial semi-State sector.  This will bring the pay levels of senior public servants into line with those which the Government has accepted for itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_78">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_79">The Government aims to reduce the overall cost of paying public servants to deliver public services by €3.5 billion by 2015, or some 20% over the seven year period from the peak in 2008.  That will be achieved through substantially reduced numbers, as well as through the pay cuts applied in 2010 and the ongoing pension-related deduction.  The reductions in the public service pay bill remain on target and have not proved an impediment to our discussions or negotiations with the troika, a fact acknowledged by it last week on the completion of its review.</p>
            <p eId="para_80">I welcome debate on these important matters but such debate should be honest and transparent.  For those questioning public service pay policy, this requires them to put forward their policy alternatives for consideration.  These alternatives must have regard to those working within the public service who are called upon to deliver more services, in difficult circumstances, in an environment in which resources have never been so stretched and who are themselves taxpayers, mortgage holders and participants in the wider economy.</p>

            <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</from>
            <p eId="para_83">Does he believe it is an impediment to debt restructuring?  His answer said that they are not paid more, because the OECD report states that they are not paid more in some areas.  The OECD report very clearly states that at the higher end - the Minister should read the report he is quoting - they are paid more.  The ECB report, which came out just a few weeks ago, stated that the per hour public sector premium is 42%.  The ESRI came out with a report a few months ago which showed that when pensions are included, the premium is 25%.  All of the data clearly and unambiguously states that at the higher end, our public sector workers are paid significantly more.  To give an example from an area in which I have worked, our medical consultants are paid about twice what they are paid in the UK, twice what they are paid in Germany, and more than twice what they are paid in France.  Higher public servants are paid significantly more, so the Minister's assertion that they are not is simply not true.  In fairness, I think he knows that.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">I asked the second part of the question about this being an impediment to debt restructuring for two reasons.  First, I heard an anecdote from one of our own MEPs who stated that senior French civil servants were incredulous that we were sending out officials to negotiate debt write downs who were paid twice what they are paid to run a country which is a fraction the size of one of their provinces.  When the Technical Group met the troika last week, they stated repeatedly that it was very interesting that we are quite rightly looking for debt write downs, yet many of those looking for them are some of the best paid civil servants in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_85">I would like the Minister to address the two issues.  I ask him please not to restate that they are not paid more.  All of the data shows that they are paid more.  My question is this.  Is it fair that they are paid more?  On the basis of his involvement in the troika negotiations, does the Minister believe it is an impediment to us getting a debt write down, as the troika has suggested?</p>

            <p eId="para_89">I have given the Deputy the data as I have it in front of me.  When we went into Government, I believed that the highest levels of the public service were paid too much.  That is why in our first act, we set a new pay ceiling for the Taoiseach, for Ministers and for Ministers of State, which was significantly lower than the remuneration of our predecessors.  We then set that ceiling across the public service.  A couple of years ago, a Secretary General in My Department would have been earning €285,000.  He is now earning €200,000.  The €85,000 cut is an extraordinary reduction, and we have applied that across the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">I am as anxious as anybody in this House to deal with this.  We cannot take the ground from under people and tell them that their income will be halved overnight, given that they have contractual arrangements.  The Deputy knows that we have constitutional property rights in this State.  We have done it in a remarkably efficient way over the past 12 months.  The Deputy is right that we have more to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">As a former health Minister, I have looked at the issue of medical consultants' pay.  We are finding great difficulty in recruiting medical consultants in Ireland.   If our pay rates were so generous in comparison to the UK, there would be a queue out the door, but there is not.  We have not been able to recruit medical consultants, particularly outside the major urban centres.  I agree with the Deputy that they are paid too much.  We need more transparency in respect of their public and private pay.  All of this is a work in progress, and if the Deputy looks objectively at what we have achieved in 12 months, he will see that we have radically transformed the platform in which more progress can be made.</p>

            <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</from>
            <p eId="para_92">I accept that the Government has made progress.  My concern is with the Croke Park agreement.  We have heard much back and forth on this.  The Government has taken a position which is that in order to reduce the pay bill significantly, we are going to fire, retire or down-size.  Regardless of the mechanism used, we will have fewer workers.  What we will not do is pay less.  At a time when we are trying to keep people off the live register it seems to be a strange absolutist commitment not to touch wages.  The only way the wage bill will be reduced is through having fewer workers.  This does not seem to be very sensible.</p>
            <p eId="para_93">During the troika negotiations has the Minister come across, as the Technical Group did last week, higher end public sector pay - accepting the changes and progress being made - being an impediment to write-downs?</p>

            <p eId="para_94">I will answer the last question first because it is very important and the answer to which is no.  I have dealt with the troika on the issue of public pay policy and its members have no difficulty with the policy of the Government as long as we achieve the extra payroll savings set out, with which they are in agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_95">I have dealt with the issue of top level pay.  Let us consider what has happened.  There has been a pay reduction of 9% at clerical officer level; a teacher has experienced a reduction of 12%; a staff nurse, 10.5%; and a garda, 11%; while a middle ranking civil servant has had a pay cut of 12.5%.  These reductions are on top of the levies paid and everything else.  One should not dismiss the pain the public sector has endured.</p>

On a voluntary basis, one senior public servant who has asked not to be named has taken a cut of more than 50% to meet the pay norms set because some of the pay norms set in advance of our entering government were unacceptable.  We have moved remarkably, but we cannot look on public servants as an amorphous group to be squeezed to solve all of our problems.  We have an agreement, namely, the Croke Park agreement, under which we are bringing about objectively significant and radical reforms.  It will take time for them to be bedded down.  If we want them to be embraced and not resisted by working to rule and strikes, we need a two-sided agreement.  For the Government's part, we have stated that for as long as there is full engagement with the radical reform agenda, redeployment and the other measures we want to take, we will not cut pay further.  This is the two-sided agreement which will serve the interests of the State.</p>

This issue is all the more relevant having heard over the weekend about the case of an advocate for persons availing of mental health services who had made public comments and found herself out of a job.  I was happy to hear on the radio on the way here that she had been reinstated.  This shows there is still an attitudinal problem among senior management in many public sector offices.  Had she praised the service offered on Christmas Day to those clients, what happened to her would not have happened, but she spoke the unvarnished truth.  I, therefore, encourage the Minister to act on this matter as soon as possible.  When the legislation is being changed, I ask him to put in place measures to seek to change attitudes in the system.  That is equally important.</p>

He is aware that I have more than a passing interest in the issue of whistleblowing, having had to traipse to the High Court and the Supreme Court to protect the rights of individuals to give information to Members of the House on allegations of wrongdoing.  I know how stressful this can be.  At one stage I was on the hazard for €500,000 in legal fees.  Thankfully, I was indemnified by my party, although I do not know how it could have afforded to pay.  I am in a privileged position in this House but no ordinary citizen should ever be in that position.  We will advance legislative provision as quickly as I can, although there will be resistance from some areas.  I produced whistle-blowing legislation, as did the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, in opposition.  We want joined up, comprehensive legislation that goes into areas that are all-encompassing.  We will have a robust model.  We have examined carefully the New Zealand model, the United Kingdom model and the South African model, which I believe was the progenitor of all of them from 2000, and the Dáil will have an opportunity to add its views on having that in the first half of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_108">The context of the Deputy's question is the Memorandum of Understanding, MOU, governing the EU-IMF Funding Programme for Ireland, which commits the Government to considering options for the ambitious programme of asset disposal, based on the programme for Government and the report of the review group on state assets and liabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">In our discussions, the troika emphasised that it views asset disposal as a structural reform measure intended to improve efficiency and competition in the economy, while offering the prospect of reducing overall debt levels.  While it is anxious that the Government's programme of asset disposal should be ambitious, it has not imposed any particular target for proceeds from the sale of State assets on us.</p>

            <p eId="para_111">I am glad the Government has clarified that any choices to privatise will be Government choices and are not being foisted upon it by the troika.  The Minister said from the get-go that the sale of semi-State assets would refer to those that are non-strategic but he has failed consistently to offer a definition as to what differentiates a non-strategic from a strategic asset.  We know he intends to sell off a stake in the ESB, and the speculation around the likes of Bord Gáis leads me to wonder whether the Government has given any meaningful consideration to or has any understanding of what are strategic assets for the State.  Those assets, as the Minister is aware, are self-financing and return dividends consistently.  The Minister states that the troika views an ambitious privatisation programme as a structural reform to improve efficiency but the decisions taken by his own Government fly in the face of that analysis.  How does the Minister propose to deal with the issue of water infrastructure?  He is dealing with it wrongly in my view in respect of charges but structurally he has opted for a commercial semi-State structure.  He is doing that because he knows from past experience that approach works.  ESB and Bord Gáis have delivered first class infrastructure.  The Minister has never given any rational explanation as to how, from his viewpoint, the part privatisation of these assets gives us any kind of medium or long-term advantage.  Also, the Minister used the term "a sizeable amount of proceeds".  What is a sizeable amount of proceeds?</p>

            <p eId="para_112">The Deputy has asked a number of questions and made a number of assertions again.  She fundamentally misunderstands, maybe deliberately or maybe not, the Government intention in this regard.  We negotiated the programme for Government against the backdrop, as I indicated to Deputy Wallace, of the incredible shortage of capital for investment in new jobs in this economy.  We debated how we could have access to it, and the NewERA concept from Fine Gael was to look at what they did in the early years of the State.  The originator of that idea came from the ICTU, at least that is what they told us when we met them in advance.  That was their concept.  It was to see how we could use resources by amalgamating the resources of the semi-State companies.  The NewERA entity is a progression on that.  I do not suggest that ICTU would support it but the idea would be to examine how we could hand over some of the current semi-State organisations and use the capital asset value derived from that to invest in the next generation of State jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">It is not a contradiction to seek resources, for example, to invest in the new Irish water company, Water Ireland because, we hope it will be the next Bord na Móna in terms of being a job creator to provide sustainable water, ensure communities can thrive and so on.  Many good ideas will be presented when we have access to money.  There will not be a fire sale.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">The Deputy opposite in particular loves announcing the bad news such that we were not going to be able to reduce the interest on our borrowings or maintain the minimum wage and that we would not be able to do anything, but we have done all these things.  When the time is right we will sell non-strategic assets and use the proceeds derived to grow the next generation of jobs.  That is the ambition we have.</p>

            <p eId="para_129">The Deputy will be aware that the rates for new appointments as Secretary General in respect of all Departments were reduced following my review of salary rates for public servants in June of last year.  Following my review the Government accepted my proposal to establish a pay ceiling of €200,000 for appointments to the most senior positions in the public service.  The annual rate of €200,000 established for the Secretary General in the Department of Finance reflects the key role and responsibilities that post holds in the public service and represents an appropriate balance between the need identified following my review to moderate salaries in senior public service posts while maintaining remuneration rates that will attract and fairly remunerate the necessary skills and experience to support the restoration of our economic sovereignty.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
            <p eId="para_130">Above all else what has astonished me most about the Minister, as a Minister with responsibility for reform, is the dogged manner in which he has defended very high pay rates in the public sector.  The ESRI, the OECD and others were quoted earlier by Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  The Minister will probably also be aware of a 2011 document published by the IPA.  Not alone does it reflect that we have run away rates for those in the upper echelons but it also reflects that the pay gap between the higher levels and the lower levels within the public sector are enormous and much greater than within the EU-15.  I do not believe the Minister is serious about tackling very high pay.  A Secretary General should not earn €200,000 at a time when the State is insolvent, we are all in crisis and we are told that we are all in this together.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">I am glad the Minister has confirmed that in this instance he will not breach the pay ceiling, albeit hugely high, in respect of the replacement in the Department of Finance.  The Minister will have to forgive me because my confidence in his commitment to this issue was shattered by the fact that we discovered, courtesy of the Freedom of Information Act, that in respect of his own adviser, the Minister had sought to break the pay ceiling he proposed be established.  He has come into this House to defend very high pay levels.  He has repeatedly quoted that the salaries of Secretaries General have fallen from €285,000 to €200,000, while not reflecting the scandal that they were on €285,000 to begin with.  He has told us that he is all in favour of dealing with runaway pay rates for those in the upper echelons, yet he by his own actions has defied that.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">When the issue of pay in the public service is raised, I want to it to be clear that I and others do not refer to clerical officers or young teachers.  The Minister knows precisely to whom we refer.</p>

            <p eId="para_133">The Deputy obviously believes there is political capital in touting out the notion of I somehow defend top level pay when the truth by any objective criterion, it that nobody has reduced top level pay more than I have in one year.  No Minister with responsibility for the public service has ever reduced top level pay across the public service more than I have.  The Deputy knows she is talking poppycock in relation to that.</p>
            <p eId="para_134">Unlike the Deputy opposite, I am a passionate supporter of the public service.  The Deputy wants public service pay rates to be reduced to some low average so that we do not actually attract the expertise we need.  That flies in the face of all the expert analysis of failure that has occurred.   If the Deputy reads any of the objective analysis of the Department of Finance by Nyberg or anybody else, she will see that they state that there was a critical lack of experts and expertise.  People say we need more economists, lawyers and legal experts within the public service but she would have all of those driven out of the public service to allow us, I suppose, buy them in from the private sector because that is the only way we could do it, and thereby dumb down the public service.  I will not do that.  That is not the view of this Government, but we will moderate all salaries, and we have taken a significant step towards starting that in a way that has not happened ever before.  There is no thinking about that.  That is a fact.  We have reduced the top level of pay, maintained public services and not had strikes in a way that has not been done previously.  There is more work to be done in this area, as I indicated in my reply to Deputy Donnelly, but Deputy McDonald might be slightly gracious occasionally in acknowledging the work done to date in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_141">Given the overarching requirement to put the public finances on a sustainable footing, it is inevitable that savings must be identified across every area of public spending.  This involves difficult decisions on how to allocate and prioritise the more limited resources that are now available.  However, in making these decisions, the Government has endeavoured in so far as possible to implement adjustments on a fair and equitable basis, protecting and preserving the core front-line public services with due regard to the relative impacts on pay costs and services.  The comprehensive review of expenditure conducted over the course of 2011 has assisted the Government in identifying broad-based savings measures consistent with budgetary objectives, and the results of this exercise are set out in detail in the comprehensive expenditure report published on 5 December last.</p>
            <p eId="para_142">The report notes the vital role the reductions in numbers and the pay bill have had in terms of fiscal consolidation to date.  It also notes that while public service staffing levels have been reduced by 6%, the net pay bill has been reduced by 14%.  The greater reduction is due to the pay cuts applied in 2010 and the ongoing pension related deduction allied with other measures to reduce the overall public pay bill.  As a consequence, the overall cost of paying public servants will have fallen by 20% by 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_143">I have also announced further Government initiatives to reduce the cost of allowances, overtime and premium payments in the public service in 2012, with further savings identified in future years.  Initiatives to address annual leave allowances and excess sick leave absences will also boost productivity.</p>
            <p eId="para_144">The Government has reaffirmed the key commitments made in the public service agreement on pay rates and job security for public servants.  However, these commitments are contingent on delivery of the necessary non-pay flexibility and public service reforms required under the agreement.</p>

            <p eId="para_147">I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 88 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_148">The Government is committed to a programme of public service reform and improvement.  As part of the work in this area, we are looking at classifications and listings of State agencies in order to produce more coherent and focused directories of services for citizens and the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_149">Deputies will be aware of the Government's plans to reduce the number of State agencies.  This radical streamlining is a key deliverable of the Government's reform programme and will lead to a more transparent, accountable and efficient public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">The Government has also decided to introduce sunset clauses when new bodies are created which will ensure a new body will cease to exist after a predetermined date unless its mandate is specifically renewed; ensure Departments regularly review the continuing business case for all significant State bodies; and require that robust service level agreements are put in place as a matter of urgency by each Department with each of its State bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">This work is ongoing and will lead to a more consistent and straightforward classification of State bodies, with greater democratic oversight by the various Oireachtas committees within whose remit they fall.  In the meantime, each Department will have details of each of the bodies and agencies within its remit.  In the case of my own Department there are a number of types of bodies under its aegis but none of these come strictly within the meaning of "non-commercial semi-State agency".</p>

            <p eId="para_152">The Minister will know that a number of months ago I requested from his Department a list of State agencies.  After much toing and froing, I received a list of 150 bodies.  However, that list was incomplete.  When I queried it, I was referred to the Institute of Public Administration which lists 250 agencies.  A number of weeks ago I raised the matter with the Minister at a committee meeting and he assured me that there was a comprehensive list of State agencies, but he did not send it to me.  Weeks later I wrote to the reform and delivery programme director who wrote back to confirm that there was no such list.  If the Minister is going to streamline State agencies, I suggest a first step would be to have a full list.  It is astonishing that the Minister with responsibility for public sector reform who tells us he is going to smash quangos and streamline State agencies does not have a list of those very agencies.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin</from>
            <p eId="para_153">For once, I largely agree with the Deputy.  Since we started the dialogue I have been anxious to obtain a comprehensive list.  There are some listed agencies which no longer function and have not done so for years.  I have asked every line Department for its list.  Some bodies operate as a subset of another State agency.  We will draw all of them together.  That work is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">I never said I wanted to smash quangos.  I have never used such language.  I want to streamline State agencies.  In the programme I published last November I laid out the 48 bodies which would be rationalised this year.  We will conclude the review of a further 46 bodies by the middle of this year and determine their future.</p>
            <p eId="para_155">Some bodies on the Deputy's list of 250 have not met for years.  I brought a report to the Government this morning, for example, of a committee which comes into being when a senior civil servant who is leaving the public service applies to work in a related area and needs permission to do so.  That group, although it is categorised as an agency or a quango, meets once in a blue moon.  When we talk about quangos or agencies and not having comprehensive lists, we need to understand some of them are very tiny which meet to perform specific functions under legislation, some dating back decades, while others are very important.  We know all the important agencies which we need to rationalise.  We need to have a comprehensive list and we are working on it.  I will get it to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</p>

The rates of expenses paid to State board members are a matter in the first instance for State boards to determine, having regard to the equivalent rates paid in the civil service.

            <p eId="para_164">Ireland is committed under the EU-IMF programme to reducing the overall size and costs of the public service.  It remains a matter for local agency and parent Department management to decide on operational priorities within the framework of Government policy and resources allocated.  All Departments and agencies have to deliver better value to the public in order to reduce the deficit and protect front-line services.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">In recent years enhanced numbers monitoring systems and multi-annual employment frameworks have been put in place, as Deputies will know.  These arrangements will be strengthened to ensure effect is given to Government decisions on public service numbers and will aid public bodies in planning future staffing and budget levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_166">It is part of the day-to-day function of the boards and management of all public bodies to assess, budget and plan for current and ongoing staffing and financial requirements.  Public service organisations must fully use all mechanisms set out in the public service reform plan for discharging work, including reorganisation and redeployment of staff.  Only after this will the issue of recruitment for current or emerging business needs arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_167">Each sector of the public service has established its own strategic workforce planning group to ensure sectoral employers are developing plans to deal with the operational and strategic consequences of staffing reductions.  The sectoral groups are feeding into a central strategic workforce planning forum, for which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible.  Factors such as the emerging demographic gaps in management will also be considered.  It is hoped measures such as the recently advertised graduate recruitment competition will address such gaps.  I have indicated that the sanction of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform must be sought if a Department identifies a potential exception to the moratorium on recruitment.  As I have listed the circumstances in which an exception to the moratorium may be granted, I will not do so again.  I have mentioned that a number of grades in the education and health sectors are exempt from the moratorium.</p>

As I have told the House in response to previous questions, this will be done over time, when market conditions are right and in a manner that allows time to implement necessary regulatory reforms and ensure value is secured and fire sales are avoided.  The Government has no intention of engaging in fire sales in this area.  As I have indicated, good progress was made in discussions during the troika's recent mission.  However, the Government has yet to agree the overall scale and composition of the programme to be pursued.  In making its decision it will take account of any necessary regulatory, policy, legislative or financial considerations.

            <p eId="para_172">There will be no fire sales and regulatory matters are to be examined.  Obviously, the European Union has a big role to play in that regard.  It sounds as if the Government jumped the fence very quickly.  The Minister agreed with his Fine Gael colleagues that the Labour Party should be bullied into selling off the ESB, Coillte and several other semi-State bodies.  I am delighted that the brake has been put on all parties in government by the EU regulatory frameworks in the energy sector, etc.  That is very good and important.  A figure of €2 billion was mentioned in the programme for Government with regard to the sale of State assets.  Some of the Minister's colleagues said in this House that the troika was looking for €5 billion.  However, the troika has made it clear that it does not have a particular view on the issue.  Certain Ministers have engaged in serious bluffing about the demands of the troika which they said wanted the Government to achieve a certain figure from the sale of State assets.  It now transpires that was not the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_175">It included no figure, but it stated the then Government would examine the sale of State assets on foot of the then unpublished McCarthy report.  During our initial discussions with the troika it was pushing the issue of the sale of State assets.  As I have indicated, it wanted the entire proceeds of any such sale to be used to retire debt.  Under the programme for Government negotiated by the two parties in government, we came to an agreement that we would sell State assets to a value of €2 billion.  We said we would seek to use the resources accruing to the State from these sales for the purposes of job creation.  We also said we intended to use the vehicles we had designed for that purpose, including the NewERA concept, which we have now put in place, and the strategic investment fund.  We further said we would have regard to the utilisation of residual funds from the National Pensions Reserve Fund for the purposes of job creation if there were robust proposals for doing this.  That remains the position.  Nobody has resiled from anything.  We have done what we said we would do.  We have taken great care to ensure any decisions we have made are in the national interest and represent value for money.  There will be no fire sale.  We will get value for the taxpayer.  We will not damage the strategic interests of the State.  I notice the Deputy sitting beside Deputy Sean Fleming is nodding.  The strategic interests of the State were not to the fore when Eircom was sold some years ago.  We have no intention of repeating that disastrous mistake.  We need to have access to resources and funds for job creation and are determined to grow the economy.  We will take the fiscal decisions necessary to ensure the 3% deficit target is reached by 2015.</p>

I would like to build on the questions we asked the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, about the potential sale of State assets.  I understand Ministers were briefed on the New ERA report last week.  Has the Economic Management Council considered the report?  A newspaper reported over the weekend that a minority share in the ESB would not now be sold.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that there is no intention to sell a minority share in an integrated ESB?  Will he confirm that consideration has been given to Bord Gáis and Coillte and indicate what decisions have been made in that regard?  We know Fine Gael has been in favour of the sale of State assets for a long time and that the Labour Party is not so keen.  It believes the proceeds of the sale of State assets should be invested in job creation.  We all agree with job creation.  Will the Taoiseach tell us whether the troika is willing to accept the decision to commit the proceeds of the possible sale of State assets to job creation?  Has it agreed to allow a percentage of the proceeds to be used for that purpose?  Are water, gas and electricity utilities being looked at when consideration is being given to State assets?  Will the Taoiseach confirm that despite what the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, said before Christmas in response to a parliamentary question, there will be no sale in 2012 of State assets of significance - particularly the ESB - which is what the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform seemed to indicate?</p>

          <p eId="para_183">The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has just been answering questions on the matter raised by Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív.  Deputy Ó Cuív will be aware that the programme for Government states that the Government intends to realise €2 billion in respect of the sale of State assets at an appropriate time, and not as a fire sale but based on the Government's decisions in this regard.  Clearly, the troika in its first number of analyses of Irish performance was of the view that all of the proceeds from any sales of State assets should be used for debt reduction.  As Deputy Ó Cuív is aware, the Government has had a number of negotiations with the troika which has resulted in changes in the memorandum of understanding in a number of areas.  The Government also made a formal decision in respect of the ESB.  The Government is now in negotiations with the troika and concluded some discussions last week for an extended process of possible State assets.  The conclusion is that the troika has quite clearly stated it would be prepared to consider a sizeable proportion of any assets realised as investment for job creation.  These discussions are continuing.  The Ministers made progress in that area with the troika last week.</p>

          <p eId="para_184">I thank the Taoiseach for the words of commiseration with my colleague, Deputy Micheál Martin, which are deeply appreciated.  We fully appreciate that the Taoiseach suffered a similar loss recently and I thank him for his kind words.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">I welcome the Taoiseach's reference to a sizeable proportion, although I think we would all agree that all of the money should be used for job creation and investment for work.  At the end of the day, the only resolution of the financial problems is to grow the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">Is the Taoiseach saying the Government is still committed to selling a minority stake in the whole of the ESB, including the critical, strategic infrastructure of the networks of both transmission and distribution?  Will he not agree there could be long-term economic consequences if part of the basic strategic infrastructure, such as the ESB, gas or water networks, is privatised?  Does the Taoiseach agree with his colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who seems to believe and with whom I would not necessarily argue on the point that the sale of the strategic infrastructure of Eircom, even though it achieved a very high price at the time and which would not be possible now, might not have been altogether wise, despite the price?  At the moment, a significant price will not be achieved because the economy is depressed.  Will the Taoiseach agree that no sales should proceed in the foreseeable future considering the state of the economy?  Will he confirm whether the Government is still open to selling shares in the basic infrastructure of this country which could result in a very negative long-term effect on job creation?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_187">I remind Deputy Ó Cuív that when his own Government considered this matter in the first instance, there was no inclusion for the possibility of investment for job creation out of the potential or possible sale of any State assets.  The Government has no intention of selling the Irish taxpayer short.  In fact, the troika in its discussions with both Ministers last week was not insisting that assets be sold by a particular date simply because of the changed economic circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">Despite the overall situation in the country, a great deal of interest is being expressed in the potential of a number of assets.  The State will not short-change the taxpayer.  There is no intention of selling transmission lines or gas pipes which are a part of the strategic infrastructure which is vital to our economy.  There is a difference between the sale of non-strategic assets and strategic assets.  The expert review group will make recommendations.  I assure Deputy Ó Cuív that the Government will make its decisions in light of the best interests of the taxpayer and the country and in compliance with the programme for Government which sets out to realise €2 billion over the period of the programme.  The extant decision stands in respect of the ESB.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">Following the discussions last week there is interest in having an extended list of possible or potential assets that might be sold.  I repeat there was no pressure from the troika to deal with these by a particular date because the Government is fully intent on not selling strategic assets but instead is intent on achieving the best possible result for the taxpayer.  The conclusion of the negotiations was a significant change from the original concept, in that the Government will now, with the agreement and co-operation of the troika, be able to invest a substantial proportion of the proceeds of the sale of assets into job creation and investment for work.</p>

          <p eId="para_192">I welcome today's meeting between the Minister for Finance and the head of the ECB.  It is always gratifying to know that sometimes the Taoiseach listens to Sinn Féin.  Although we have been waiting too long, unfortunately, for this meeting to have taken place, if the Taoiseach wishes to continue to take good advice, I suggest that what Deputy Noonan tells the head of the ECB is crucial.  He should tell him that this State cannot afford the promissory note put in place by Fianna Fáil, no more than we can afford to pay the €1.25 billion which the Taoiseach will pay tomorrow to unguaranteed, unsecured bondholders.  This amount is more than all the additional taxes that his Government inflicted on citizens.  It is more than the household charge, the increase in VAT and the increases in motor taxation.  We punish our people and tomorrow we give €1.25 billion to these unguaranteed, anonymous, unsecured bondholders.  It is also remarkable to recollect that before the election, the Labour Party's slogans referred to Labour's way or Frankfurt's way.  The Minister has now done a complete U-turn given that he told us that not another red cent will be paid to these persons.</p>

Believe me, I have no intention of defaulting on Ireland's position and ending up with difficulties similar to those currently being experienced by the citizens of Greece, where 100,000 public servants have been let go, pay rates have been decimated and services are under serious pressure.  Is that the kind of Ireland that the ceannaire of the Sinn Féin Party stands for?  I do not believe so.  The Deputy should speak about reality and a little bit of truth while leaving his hypocrisy outside the door in saying he will tell the troika to go home and take its money with it.  The Deputy should explain how he expects the services of Ireland to be provided in the absence of that kind of money.</p>

This is the rub; the Taoiseach is bringing savage austerity policies on the backs of already suffering citizens, and at the same time he is giving away tomorrow.  That will not be the action of Fianna Fáil, the last Government, Bertie or Brian.

Even in his private party rooms, the Deputy is probably hoping that progress is made in that regard because it would be good for our citizens all over the country.  That issue will be emphasised.  We will not have "defaulter" written on our foreheads.  We will pay our way.

Does the Taoiseach accept that the vast majority of the Irish people do not support this action, particularly the ending of the policy of independent neutrality as we are following Cameron, Sarkozy, Merkel and the US in sabre rattling?  Does the Taoiseach not think it a bit rich-----</p>

          <p eId="para_217">Deputy McGrath was always a strong supporter of human rights and he has rightly raised questions here about the implications of activities by the Taliban, al-Qaeda and other groups.  This regards EU support for sanctions against Iran because of the scale of its activities with regard to nuclear power.  It is for that reason that the European Union, with the Tánaiste acting on behalf of the Irish Government, supports the sanctions being imposed on Iran in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Reports from this morning - I have not heard reports from the last hour or so - indicated there was not much of a reaction because of the protection that exists in respect of the Strait of Hormuz by an American fleet and others.  If this sanction regime continued for an extended period, with a drop in oil supplies, prices would rise not just in Ireland but everywhere else.  This is a serious matter of an expansion in a nuclear programme by Iran, and sanctions have been extended against that country as a result.  The European Union strongly supports that.  I hope there will not be any catastrophic consequences in that region, and oil is important to the economies in western Europe and other countries.  For that reason there is a belief that there is sufficient capacity to ensure that the straits are kept opened for traffic to countries in the West, including this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_219">I thank the Taoiseach for his response.  The Government does not really see the downside of the oil sanction.  One loses the moral argument when there is silence from the Government and the Labour Party on other nuclear powers that exist in the world.  The Government seems to be targeting one country above others.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_255">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 24, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_256">All of the questions relate to the European Council or the Heads of Government meeting.  I attended the European Council in Brussels on 8 and 9 December.  As I have already made a statement to the House on these meetings, I will confine myself to some brief remarks on their proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_257">Important steps were taken at the European Council on budgetary discipline within the euro area and firewalls, both of which are issues of importance to Ireland, and progress was made towards taking Europe beyond the current crisis.  In particular, leaders agreed to strengthen economic policy co-ordination further within the euro area by way of an intergovernmental agreement to construct a new fiscal compact.  Intensive negotiations are under way on a draft treaty to give legal effect to this agreement.  Leaders will aim to finalise work at an informal meeting of the European Council scheduled to take place in Brussels on 30 January.  Once agreement is reached, the text will then be prepared for signature and subsequent ratification by each of the participants according to their respective constitutional requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_258">The December European Council also took stock of what needs to be done to lift Europe out of the current crisis situation.  The need to continue structural reform and fiscal consolidation as a means to secure a return to sustainable growth was agreed.  The European Council highlighted the need to adopt swiftly measures with most potential to boost growth and jobs across Europe.  There is a real recognition at European level that addressing the need for sustainable jobs and growth is critical.  This will also be a focus for discussions at the informal meeting next week, and I will support efforts in this regard strongly.  There will be no real recovery in Europe without growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_259">The European Council also tracked progress under the euro plus pact and followed up on the issue of energy.  In addition, enlargement issues featured, and the signature of the Croatian accession treaty took place in the margins of the meeting.  The European Council also agreed conclusions on Iran, Syria and Afghanistan.</p>
            <p eId="para_260">Ahead of last month's European Council, my strong view was that the meeting had to address two key issues: the need for strengthened firewalls and the need to strengthen governance structures.  The outcome of the meeting represents positive progress in both regards.  There is always scope to do more and I look forward to participating actively in discussions in the period ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_261">In advance of the meeting, I wrote to President Van Rompuy and I also had a telephone conversation with him on the eve of the meeting.  I set out for him the uniquely onerous burden being carried by the Irish people as a result of the steps we have taken to recapitalise our banks.  I said that I believed Ireland should be able to access new instruments available at EU level - for example, new flexibilities within the EFSF - which were not available at the time and which would make the burden more manageable.  As the House will be aware, work is being taken forward on this matter by the Minister for Finance and his officials.</p>
            <p eId="para_262">Looking forward, I will attend the informal meeting of EU Heads of State and Government in Brussels on Monday, 30 January.  As I will make a statement to the House on this meeting later this afternoon, I will again confine myself to some brief remarks on this meeting.  While there is no formal agenda, there will be two key issues on the table: the new treaty and the vitally important question of jobs and growth.  On the treaty, our primary objective is to ensure an outcome that strengthens the stability of the euro area and that protects Irish interests.  We have sought to build support and understanding for our positions and to cultivate alliances with partners across a range of specific issues which matter to us, including the need to reflect Ireland's status as a programme country; the need for an appropriate basis for incorporating a debt brake at national level; the need for a workable application of structural balance rule; and the importance of ensuring that as much of the contents of this treaty as possible are put on a clear European Union legislative footing.</p>
            <p eId="para_263">This last point is an important one.  Indeed, I would go further and state clearly that I strongly wish to see the contents of this agreement incorporated, at the earliest possible opportunity, into the legal framework of the European Union.  We believe that such an approach would serve to lend clarity and would help to prevent any damage to the Union, its institutions and its established processes.  The Government and I will continue to work to ensure Ireland's interests are reflected in order that we are in a position to ratify the treaty when agreed, including putting it to the people in a referendum, if necessary.  However, I reiterate to the House again today that it is only when a final text is available and the Attorney General studies the legal implications that it will be possible to reach a view on what is required.  The House can rest assured that whatever path toward ratification is required, it will be fully involved in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_264">The informal meeting of the European Council is also expected to discuss measures to promote growth and create jobs throughout Europe.  I will support these efforts, working with like-minded countries to ensure an outcome which boosts our small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, improves conditions for access to credit, investment in research and development, and bolsters key parts of the Single Market which are especially important to Ireland, including the digital agenda.  To this end, we have submitted to the President of the European Council two joint contributions from Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK, Finland and Estonia as inputs to the preparation of next Monday's informal European Council meeting.  The first paper is on growth and focuses on measures such as completion of the Single Market, reducing the regulatory burden on SMEs and better targeting of labour market supports, including a new focus on youth unemployment.  The paper also calls for proposals to ensure that all actions at European Union level fully support economic growth and job creation.</p>
            <p eId="para_265">The second paper includes proposals on building the digital single market, particularly in the area of copyright.  It focuses on measures to improve digital rights management conditions and creating cross-border pan-European licensing schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_266">I had a working lunch with Prime Minister Mr. Viktor Orbán of Hungary in Government Buildings on 1 June last year during Hungary's Presidency of the Council of Ministers.  That meeting was an opportunity to survey some of the issues then on the EU agenda, especially economic questions.  I took the opportunity to brief the Prime Minister, Mr. Orbán on efforts under way to improve Ireland's economic position, including through implementation of the EU-IMF programme.  The Prime Minister, Mr. Orbán touched on some other issues with which the Hungarian Presidency had been dealing, including the negotiations on Croatian accession and the package of legislation on economic governance then being advanced.  The House will be aware of the recent Croatian decision by way of a vote.</p>
            <p eId="para_267">The Prime Minister, Mr. Orbán and I attended the European Council meetings on 11 March, 24 and 25 March, 23 and 24 June, 23 October, 26 October and 8 and 9 December 2011 and the Eastern Partnership Summit in Warsaw on 29 and 30 September.</p>
            <p eId="para_268">I met the Prime Minister Mr. Cameron on 12 January in London.  I am also in ongoing informal contact with my colleagues from the European Council.  I plan to have a bilateral meeting with the Danish Prime Minister Ms Helle Thorning-Schmidt and the Prime Minister Mr. Jyrki Katainen of Finland while I attend the World Economic Forum in Davos on 26 January.  I may have further meetings while there.  I spoke this morning to Chancellor Mr. Werner Faymann of Austria and will have further conversations with a number of colleagues ahead of next week's meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_269">With regard to the Commission proposal for a financial transaction tax, FTT, we have made it very clear that such a transaction tax should apply on a global basis.  We are also firmly of the view that, to avoid distortions of financial transactions within the Single Market, any introduction of a tax in the European Union should include all member states.  The application of such an FTT here in Dublin but not in our closest neighbour in the City of London could have an adverse impact upon our International Financial Services Centre, which is of such critical importance to the Irish economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_272">Despite the Taoiseach's efforts, I can learn a great deal from this answer.  In reply to Deputy Finian McGrath, the Taoiseach stated that, if the Irish Government was as powerful as the Deputy suggested, it would have dealt with the troika very effectively.  Implicitly, the Government has not dealt with the troika very effectively.  More importantly, there is some evidence of a little bit of an inferiority complex.  This Government has the same rights and entitlements as the government of any other state dealing with these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_273">I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has met many of his counterparts informally, spoken with them via telephone or written to them, but does the Government agree with sanctions being imposed on member states that surpass the 0.5% deficit requirement?  Does it not know that the austerity budgets that must be implemented by this and other states must continue beyond 2015, the year required by our EU-IMF programme, and past the Government's term?  It might even be generational.  What is the Government's position on these possible sanctions and has it made its position clear?</p>

            <p eId="para_274">We have dealt with the troika very effectively.  We are part of the Union and the eurozone and, as such, are a respected member.  Due to the openness and trust engendered between Ministers and the troika, as the Deputy is aware, quite a number of changes to the original memorandum of understanding have been brought about in the interests of the Government's programme for Government and the Irish taxpayer and Irish citizen.</p>
            <p eId="para_275">The issue of the structural balance is one that has been at the centre of quite a deal of discussion over the past period.  I am happy now with the transparency that is in here and with the requirement to have a structure that will deal with that in respect of each individual country.  It is fair to say that we agree with fiscal discipline and better governance.  From that point of view, there have been some further discussions and progress has been made at the technical level in regard to the issue of sanctions, where the European Court of Justice would be the determining body over whether a country was out of line but where the Commission should be the implementing body, which would root it in the legal requirement of the European Union treaties, which is important from everybody's perspective.</p>

            <p eId="para_276">I am glad to get that little bit of information, but the Taoiseach is handing over more authority from the Government to the European Court of Justice.  This is clear from the draft of the treaty that I read.</p>
            <p eId="para_277">The Taoiseach did not tell me whether he was for the sanctions.  I would like clarity on that matter.  It is obvious that the Taoiseach is for the treaty.  He has been clear on that issue at least.  I will ask him again.  Given the ongoing surrender of significant control of Irish fiscal and budgetary matters to officials and unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, is it not time to take a step back, review the situation, reflect on it and take a different approach, one that is about producing measures to stabilise the euro through investment in jobs and negotiating a write down of toxic banking debt on behalf of indebted citizens, including our own?</p>
            <p eId="para_278">If the Government insists on proceeding with this austerity budget, a decision with which I am disappointed, it should at least go to the people.  Do not dance on the head of a pin concerning the Attorney General.  The Government should accept the democratic imperative that, in a republic, the citizens must have their say, particularly when the Government is giving away so much of what remains of the sovereignty, fiscal power and other authority that is vested by Irish citizens in the Oireachtas.</p>

            <p eId="para_279">The first point I will make is that this country no longer controls its economic destiny by virtue of the fact that we are in a programme.  The programme that we are in ends in 2013.  That programme supersedes the issues that are currently under discussion in terms of the international agreement on this treaty.  The language surrounding the introduction of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, is important in this sense.  Any programme country - obviously, I would like to see Ireland out of its programme as quickly as possible - should be able to link itself to the possibility, if it required the ESM, of being able to avail of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_280">In regard to the referendum, there will not be dancing on the head of a pin here.  It took Deputy Adams quite a long time to recognise the legitimacy of the democracy we have here, and I am glad he did.  As part of that democracy, the procedure is for the Government of the day, in regard to any transfer of competence in terms of Bunreacht na hÉireann, to ask the Attorney General of the day for formal legal advice.  On the basis of that formal legal advice, the Government of the day forms its view.  I have made it perfectly clear in my reply to the Ceann Comhairle and the House that, when the text is finalised at the Heads of Government meeting on Monday and is prepared for signature, then and only then will the Attorney General be asked for formal legal advice.  If that legal advice clearly indicates that a referendum is necessary, then a referendum will be held.  I hope this is clear.  From that point of view, we will go through the process, which is well recognised in this democracy and has stood the test of time over very many years.  I hope that answers Deputy Adams's question.</p>

            <p eId="para_281">The lack of involvement by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste in meeting other leaders gets starker all the time.  In the lead-up to the last summit, the Taoiseach failed to outline to the Dáil the demands he would present.  Just before the summit he gave RTE a copy of a letter which he had sent to the President of the European Council, Mr. Van Rompuy, which included some details.  Without going around the houses, will the Taoiseach tell the House exactly what proposals he has made to other leaders before the upcoming summit?  Will he clarify whether he has circulated any paper and, if so, will he make that paper available to this House?</p>

            <p eId="para_282">I made it perfectly clear that our demands were that there be proper and adequate firewalls to prevent contagion, that there should be better governance of how the operation is run, and that budgetary discipline be prioritised.  Those are the three key demands.  It is not a case that when one attends a European Council meeting the agenda will include a list of sub-items submitted by this country or that country.  The process is that Mr. Van Rompuy determines the agenda based on the connections he has with all countries.  As I said, the issues were firewalls, budgetary discipline and better governance.</p>
            <p eId="para_283">Ireland, along with the other countries I listed in my reply, has submitted two papers for Monday's informal meeting, both in respect of SMEs and the way in which we can have access to credit and so on.  Growth and jobs are central to the recovery of Europe.  It often happens, as the Deputy is aware, that Governments and personalities can get involved in interminable institutional arguments such that we lose sight of what is critical for the development of the Union and the achievement of the full potential of the Single Market, that is, growth and jobs.  Ireland, together with several other countries, has submitted a paper on that.  In my discussions with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, in the past fortnight, we agreed that both Ireland and Britain would submit papers to colleagues at the table and to the Commission proposing that growth and jobs would be central to the decision-making process of Europe, either through regulation or at directive level, so that when the legislative process begins, people's focus would be on that at all times.  These are the issues of importance to us.</p>

            <p eId="para_284">The Taoiseach may have heard the saying, "Is mór idir é agus an chosúlacht".  He said in his reply that the proposals are tabled by the President of the European Council, Mr. Van Rompuy.  The public has the impression, however, that the people putting forward the proposals are the French President, Mr. Sarkozy, and the German Chancellor, Ms Merkel, whose six-point agenda will be pushed at the upcoming summit.  What has the Taoiseach done to discuss this agenda with them?  Does he agree that the entire concept of the Union is being undermined by the bilateral approach of these countries?</p>
            <p eId="para_285">Soon after assuming office, the Taoiseach said he saw a great difference between substantive meetings with other leaders and ones which involved chats at the margins of larger meetings.  It is fair to say that in terms of EU business, the Taoiseach has had one formal bilateral.  He has met his British counterpart, of course, but he has had only one formal bilateral in regard to Europe.  Will he tell the House whether that policy will change?</p>

            <p eId="para_286">Ministers of this Government attend their meetings, in contrast to behaviour in the past.  That is the first point.  It is not  a case of President Van Rompuy speaking only to certain people.  There are consultations with every country and every leader.  The main items on the agenda are determined long in advance and, given the crisis we have had in the eurozone for the past three years, firewalls, budgetary discipline and better governance procedures are central to all of those.  They have been the subject of the discussions at the EU Heads of Government meetings since I had the privilege of being elected Taoiseach.  They are central to all discussions.</p>
            <p eId="para_287">I am a strong supporter of the <i>communautaire</i> method, which involves the Commission and all of the member states.  I have never been afraid to say that and have done so on many occasions.  Clearly, countries that are contributing to the funds to keep other countries moving - funds which must be repaid - have an interest in seeing that where payments are made, conditions are accepted and adhered to by the receiving countries.  That is the reason for the anxiety in respect of putting together what is now an intergovernmental treaty to bring that about from a political point of view.  That is why all the intensive discussions that have taken place are to find a formula of words that can accommodate that.</p>
            <p eId="para_288">I am leader of a party and Government which are very focused on the potential of the European Union.  The Union was founded on the principles of solidarity, co-operation and trust.  From that perspective, the <i>communautaire</i> method and the Commission are vital to the future prospects of the European Union.  I am of the view, however, and I hope the matter can be concluded successfully, that when these matters are resolved, everyone will understand the importance of playing their part in a European Union that has let itself slip over the years by not focusing on the realisation of its true potential.  I hope, following the conclusion of the intergovernmental agreement and its ratification, by whatever method, by the countries involved, that Europe can then have adequate firewalls and will have clearly arrived at a political situation where there is budgetary discipline, conditions applying and sanctions imposed on countries which step out of line.</p>
            <p eId="para_289">Ireland will continue to measure up in order to get out of this programme as quickly as we can.  Our objective is to regain our economic independence in order that we can decide as a Government, in co-operation with our European Union colleagues, what is in the best interest of our country, our people and our children's future.</p>

          <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_162">
            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_290">Does the Taoiseach agree this is not about forms of words, but rather about the brutal austerity that has been imposed on people in this country for the past three years which has led to a massacre of jobs, a massacre of our public services and attacks on the most vulnerable in our society to the point where many people are on their knees?  All of that resulted from a decision by governments in this and other European countries to bail out banks at all costs and to impose austerity.  Given the obvious disastrous consequences of three years of austerity and bailing out banks, how on earth can the Taoiseach or other European leaders expect that institutionalising austerity in the form of a euro compact will make things any better?  Surely it is absolutely inevitable that it will do exactly the same as it has done in the past three years.  By prioritising banks and their balance sheets and insisting on the imposition of austerity on ordinary people, one will get the same result and the situation will get even worse.</p>
            <p eId="para_291">The Taoiseach referred to firewalls against contagion in the eurozone.  Where are the firewalls for the unemployed in the euro compact?  Where are the firewalls for the vulnerable?  Where are the firewalls for workers?  My colleagues and I from the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform met the German ambassador earlier today.  He told us that announcements would be made on Monday regarding stimulus measures and job creation.  He did not say much about what these measures would involve but that, given the demand for fiscal rectitude and austerity, they would hinge on competitiveness.  What the hell does that mean?  When wages have been ratcheted down to the extent that most low and middle income workers in this country have been impoverished, when we have 400,000 unemployed and the numbers on the streets are multiplying daily, what does competitiveness mean?  Does it mean the country must be starving before investment magically floods back into it, following which everything will be all right again?  Where are the proposals in the euro compact for job creation?  Where are the proposals that will ensure investment?  If we do not get people back to work or do not have investment to make this happen, we are on the road towards a 1930s-type crisis.  Even Christine Lagarde of the IMF is saying this.  I cannot understand how the Government is slapping itself on the back for signing up to a treaty that will mean austerity and suffering for the people in perpetuity.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might explain where this is leading.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_292">That is the Deputy's usual rant.  I prioritise people over banks.  The Deputy was not in the Chamber when I responded to Deputy Gerry Adams's question about bondholders and so on.  The European Central Bank has made available to this country €110 billion, at an interest rate of 1%, to enable us to run services.  The Deputy will agree that that is a phenomenal amount of money.  He is engaging in magic finance methods in terms of his belief our bills can be met and that no one will have to pay as a consequence.  It is not nice to have to stand up and say the money must be repaid.</p>
            <p eId="para_293">The Deputy spoke about people's vulnerability, rightly so, and the impact of austerity and unemployment.  The Government is focused on what it can do, within the limits imposed on us by virtue of our financial circumstances, to improve the lot of the people.  In this regard, it has reduced PRSI contributions for particular sectors, removed 330,000 people from liability for the universal social charge, restored the national minimum wage, made available, through the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, houses in NAMA for those in need of social housing and will, through the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, introduce an action plan designed to stimulate job creation, investment and sustainability, which I know the Deputy will support.  Also, the Minister for Social Protection will bring forward a range of initiatives to ensure persons on the live register who want to contribute to the economy will have an opportunity to retrain and upskill, leading, it is hoped, to their finding a job.</p>
            <p eId="para_294">Despite the doom and gloom, the standard comments of many, including the Deputy, between March and October last year 125,000 individuals moved off the live register.  I acknowledge they were replaced by others, but this is an indication of the extent of movement within the labour market, which is what we need to capture.  Decisions such as the proposed investment of €250 million announced two weeks ago are statements of intent to invest in the country.  The Government wants to focus on increasing the indigenous economy and confidence in it in order that people can spend.  It was for this reason that the Minister for Finance included in the budget the stipulation that mortgage interest relief be available for seven years to those who purchased houses.  However, this does not apply to commercial activity involving the block purchasing of property held for seven years in order that no capital gains would accrue.  These are direct stimuli to the indigenous economy in the hope it will start to move.  Given the extent of money available, the Government is focused on attracting it, by way of pension funds and so on, for investment in job creation.</p>
            <p eId="para_295">The two papers submitted by Ireland and a number of other countries which deal with the digital single market and its potential are due for consideration on Monday.  The text submitted by Ireland and a number of other countries which will have a direct impact on growth is also due for consideration on Monday.  These two issues are central to achieving progress at the European Council meeting and we will support them vigorously.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_296">One can always point to this or that glimmer of light.  We are all looking for such glimmers.  However, the facts speak for themselves.  It is not only the doom and gloom merchants - the Taoiseach describes us as such - who are criticising this approach.  Christine Lagarde, someone very far away from me in terms of her viewpoint on economics and politics, is saying we are heading towards a 1930s style depression unless we solve our problems.  The reason she is saying this is yet again today the IMF has downgraded its growth projections.  The December figures for the retail sector in Ireland indicate that the sector is in real trouble.  We are in decline and must face reality.  There can be no jobs and growth without substantial investment.  Investment has collapsed.</p>
            <p eId="para_297">Where in the euro compact or among the EU leaders is the plan for us to achieve a recommencement of investment?  I put it to the Taoiseach that there is none.  The euro compact is about balancing the books with an ever diminishing cake.  One can try to balance the books all one likes, but if the cake is diminishing, it means suffering and that there will be no economic growth.  Where are the proposals for serious investment in the digital and other sectors which we know have the potential to develop?  There is no sign of such investment.  The reason for this is the Government's decision that all funds will be placed in the vaults of bondholders and banks.  We are not the only ones who are saying this: Roubini and Stiglitz are saying it.  Anyone looking at the situation objectively is saying this cannot work.  Why, therefore, are we signing up to it?  Why can we not at least have a debate on whether this is the best way to go?</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_165">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_298">There will be a discussion on that matter later, to which I assume the Deputy will contribute, although I do not know if he will have anything different to say.  It is necessary for us to be involved in this structure because we are the recipients, through the covered banks, of €110 billion to run services.  We are faced with this problem because of the extensive recapitalisation of the banks at high interest rates prior to the ESF and the ESM and the need to close the deficit which will not close by itself despite the fact that the Deputy believes it will.</p>
            <p eId="para_299">I note Christine Lagarde's comments.  She is a good friend of this country who has made it perfectly clear that there is a need for strong leadership at European Union level and adequate firewalls to be built in, particularly in her comments in respect of Italy where Prime Minister Monti is making huge strides and also in respect of Spain.  Former Commissioner Fischler said yesterday that the implications were clear if we decided to go down the road towards default.</p>
            <p eId="para_300">The Deputy will recall that a number of weeks ago a figure of €17 billion was provided for in the capital programme.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is one of a few in respect of which an increase was provided for because of the requirement for job creation and the importance of innovation and research and what could emerge from them in terms of job creation.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, is well down the road in introducing legislation to deal with the issue of credit access and partial guarantees in order that people can access credit from banks, which is crucial in terms of what we must do.</p>
            <p eId="para_301">The Economic Management Council which I chair will shortly meet the banks for the second time for a frank discussion on bank lending policies.  I have heard stories from many small businesses which have not been able to access credit.  We must deal with this issue.  The two covered banks, Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks, have signed on to lend €3.5 billion in 2012.  The Government wants to see this happen for small businesses.  I do not know if the Deputy often has an opportunity to travel outside his constituency, but perhaps he might undertake a tour of the country to speak to those small and medium-sized enterprises and hard-pressed retailers who cannot access the credit they need.</p>

            <p eId="para_303">This is the reason Ministers are introducing legislation to deal with that issue.  Moreover, the reason the Government will establish a micro-finance start-up agency to provide them with a stimulus is because they wish to employ people.  They want to get out of this recession and to play their part in building confidence.  Everywhere I go, big and small operations are focused on getting out of this mess our country has inherited.  This is the reason the Government is making various decisions such as providing a capital programme of €17 billion and providing specific stimuli within the budget by way of taxation decisions and by way of the finance Bill, as well as through legislation.  It is so doing in order that people can focus, within the constraints under which we operate, on what can be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_304">Moreover, this is being followed by the labour activation measures the Minister for Social Protection will launch shortly and which are designed to give a sense of confidence and hope to the many people who find themselves obliged to watch television during the middle of the day when the vast majority of them wish to get out and contribute to the country's well-being.  The Deputy should turn his thoughts to assisting those people, rather than being on the rant of disillusionment and despair I hear him voice each time he appears in the Chamber.</p>

            <p eId="para_306">The point is that when the Government takes €3.8 billion out of the economy in a single year and when it drives down the living standards of middle and low-income workers, it is achieving precisely the opposite of that to which the Taoiseach states it aspires.  Moreover, the Government's labour activation measures, which is a despicable term, are designed to put pressure on people who have been cast into unemployment to go into the lowest-paid jobs the Government is facilitating the bosses to implement legally.  This is reprehensible and will not be economically successful.</p>
            <p eId="para_307">Does the Taoiseach not realise the crisis in Europe is a crisis of the financial system?  The capitalist financial system in Europe is in an appalling crisis because of the craziness of that system.  For example, is the Taoiseach aware that the fund of €400 billion to €500 billion made available by the European Central Bank for European banks has been massively taken up but that the week before last, when approximately €450 billion had been borrowed by the banks from that fund, precisely the same amount had been deposited back by the same banks?  This is because they are not investing but are on a strike of capital because it is not profitable for them.  Against this background, does the Taoiseach not acknowledge it is insane to design a straitjacket for member states of the European Union with regard to the necessity for economic policy that expands the economy and provides stimulus job creation programmes, which are desperately needed at present?  The Taoiseach seeks the incorporation of this so-called fiscal compact, which is in fact an austerity treaty, into the treaties of the European Union.  Does he not understand that by so doing, he is spancelling the member states from taking action at decisive times, which is critical to kick-start economic life precisely to counteract the effects of the strike of capital and the fact that the markets simply are not working for people?</p>
            <p eId="para_308">Does the Taoiseach not realise that borrowing of itself has not been a problem but that borrowing by spivs and speculators for speculation and short-term private gain has caused the crisis here and throughout Europe?  Does he not realise that emergency investment in, for example, job creation, which can involve borrowing, can be critical to kick-starting the economy and getting this State out of the mire of deflation and mass unemployment to which the Government's policies are condemning it?</p>
            <p eId="para_309">The Taoiseach has stated that he does not know whether a referendum would be needed.  I put it to him that he does know or should know that the last version of this proposed austerity treaty of which Members have had sight refers to a balanced budget and an automatic mechanism to take corrective action.  Is the Taoiseach aware that a referendum was called in regard to transferring powers of this State to the International Criminal Court because it was formally transferring powers previously vested exclusively in the organs of our national Government?  Does the Taoiseach not agree that what the Government proposes to do in this treaty is to transfer over powers now invested in the national Government or the Parliament to outside agencies?  Is it not clear this will require a referendum?  In any case, if the Government proposes to spancel the people to this austerity treaty with all the serious economic consequences that would have, it should give them the opportunity to have a major debate and to vote on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_310">I thank Deputy Higgins for that long dissertation and preamble.  He speaks in respect of middle and low-income workers.  Because the Government has a concern about this and every other sector of society, it entered serious negotiations with the troika to make changes to the original memorandum of understanding.  This is the reason, based on those discussions, that results were achieved in making no change to income tax in the recent budget.  This allowed people to look at their pay cheque in January and to see no change in income tax from the position that obtained in December.  This is the reason, as I told Deputy Boyd Barrett, the Government made changes to the universal social charge that removed 330,000 people from its scope.  These changes and the reversal of the cut in the minimum wage meant that 36,000 people were restored in this regard.  In addition, the figure of €17 billion over the lifetime of the Government for a capital programme to which I already have referred speaks for itself.  Moreover, 23,000 people are employed in community employment schemes, as well as another 5,000 people between the JobBridge and Tús programmes.  Many of those people now are being offered full-time employment because of their performance on training schemes and on temporary work with specialist firms.</p>
            <p eId="para_311">Consequently, the emphasis of the Government at present is to deal with the requirement to be able to ease the burden of repayment, based on the excessive amounts borrowed, to recapitalise the banks in the first place.  Ireland has not sought a write-down and in that context, the discussions now are at a point at which the troika itself put forward the proposition that a paper should be prepared based on the unique and onerous challenge that Ireland faces in this regard.  When that paper is produced and finalised, it will have the status of a troika presentation to our colleagues around the table.</p>
            <p eId="para_312">The Deputy spoke of the issue of a referendum.  While I believe I dealt with this matter before the Deputy entered the Chamber, perhaps he was present for some of the time.  The democracy in which Members work means the Attorney General of the day makes his or her view known formally and legally when requested to so do by the Government.  However, the Deputy specifically referred to the question of the transfer of powers from the European Court of Justice to an intergovernmental treaty.  The discussions taking place yesterday were to the effect that while one might prefer to be able to deal with that element of the discussions by way of secondary legislation, which would as a consequence be rooted in the European Union treaties - I understand that progress has been made in that regard, in that the European Court of Justice would be the determining body of a country having strayed outside the conditions of the intergovernmental treaty - it would be the European Commission that would be the sanctioning entity which is directly rooted in the EU treaties as a fundamentally important European Union institution.  Nobody in the Oireachtas is in a position to give the Deputy a definitive answer today as to whether a referendum will be required in the context of non-compliance with Bunreacht na hÉireann.  It will only be on Monday next, when the text of the intergovernmental agreement, from a legal perspective, has been presented and signed off on, that the Attorney General will be asked to provide her formal legal advice.  That is the position on the Deputy's specific comment about the European Court of Justice.</p>

            <p eId="para_313">That is in the event the Government does not consider, for other reasons, that there should be a referendum.  There is nothing which bars the Government from holding a referendum.  The people have experienced three years of ongoing austerity, cuts, attacks on their living standards and the stripping down of services in the pursuit of a ruinous policy of bailing out bankers and financial institutions.  That policy is killing the economy.  I put it to the Taoiseach that holding a referendum would give the people the opportunity to exercise their democratic right just over one year after they went to the polls in the general election.  Those in government promised to put in place fundamentally different policies from those pursued by their predecessors.  However, since entering office they have performed an about face and aped - almost to the dot and comma - the austerity policies of their predecessors.  In the context of justice, democracy and fairness, the people should be given a say.</p>
            <p eId="para_314">Is the Government afraid to go to the people, engage with them in a democratic discussion and then allow them to vote?  Is that the real issue?  Can the Taoiseach not see that handing over essential elements of control of the economy and fiscal policy of one of the member states of the European Union to the right-wing, neoliberal European Commission which is anti-public sector and pro-privatisation in every way and never misses an opportunity to come down in favour of the corporate sector at the expense of working people represents a serious surrender of the rights of the people he claims to represent?</p>

            <p eId="para_319">A Government elected since the foundation of the State is only required to hold a referendum where there is a proposal to change the Constitution.  On issues relating to the European Union, if the Attorney General of the day is of the view that, in the context of formal legal advice, there is a transfer of competency which requires compliance with the Constitution, a referendum is required.  I want the Deputy to clearly understand the Government has no fear of holding a referendum, if that is a requirement.  I have made this perfectly clear in my response to him.  We must focus on the reality of the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  The discussions that have taken place at both technical and ministerial level on financial matters will be concluded at the meeting of the Heads of Government.  When the text has been finalised and signed, the Attorney General will provide formal legal advice.  If required, a referendum will be held.  If not, one will not be held.  I hope that is perfectly clear.</p>
            <p eId="para_320">When the Deputy refers to a right-wing, neoliberal regime, I am sure he appreciates that the same regime has been compliant in making available €110 billion to the covered banks in order that ATMs continue to operate and that the salaries of nurses, doctors, gardaí and other public servants, including everyone here, continue to be paid.  If he possesses a magic wand which might allow us to wish away all our liabilities and have a brand new future without these liabilities, I would like to hear if he proposes to use it.</p>

I could bring him to many rural and urban areas in the Republic in which stout leadership and a willingness to avail of various supports, the services of entities, etc., have resulted in the development of really strong communities that focus on opportunities which suit local needs.  In times of economic challenge these communities are more important than ever.</p>

The group responsible for this paper is chaired by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Licence applications are being received in respect of major salmon aquaculture development projects which are worth in the region of €100 million and which could give rise to at least 300 jobs per unit.  Such projects will be of enormous importance to the future of the economies of coastal regions and will give rise to the creation of jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_332">The streams for which the Ministers for Social Protection and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are responsible are absolutely critical to the future well-being of people whom the Deputy and everyone else present knows.  We want to see imaginative and creative ways being utilised to take advantage of people's initiative and wish to contribute to their country.  I do not like to see 450,000 people on the live register.  I do not like to be told by individuals that they are obliged to stay home and watch daytime television.  I do not like the fact that children are returning from school to homes in which no one has gone out to work that day.  We have so much potential, but we must do this right.  That is why the Government is now focused on more creative ways of producing this potential.  The vast majority of people I meet want to work and want to contribute, but they expect somebody to ring the bell and say where the opportunity is.  The marriage of social and economic policy is important for our people's confidence, well-being and contribution.  We will focus on that over the next couple of weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_336">I will put a question now, but it is important to correct the record.  The Taoiseach spoke about the €100 billion being put into our banks.  Would he not agree that what happened had nothing to do with a fiscal deficit in Ireland?  In fact, we would have complied during the good years with all the new rules that are being brought in here.  What happened is that banks in the centre of Europe, especially German banks, lent recklessly to the periphery.  They are afraid they will not get their money back.  In an effort to do so, they are more than willing to let the ECB lend to our banks so that our banks can give them back their own money.</p>
            <p eId="para_337">Has the Government had discussions about sharing the burden equally?  The periphery is lining up with the full cost of the banking policy.  Has the Government pursued the issue at the heart of this problem to ensure that what happened cannot happen again?  This is more of a banking crisis than a fiscal crisis.</p>

Permanent, binding austerity must be enforced by this Government or any future government.  How can the Taoiseach say that that level of infringement on the right of democratically elected parliaments in Europe does not justify the people of this country and the people of Europe having a say on whether they want to give up that level of democratic oversight on their own affairs and their own future?  Legal issues aside, how can anybody say that this level of incursion on democratic rights does not require a democratic referendum, so that the citizens can decide whether they want permanent austerity dictated from Brussels or Frankfurt?</p>

            <p eId="para_344">His party has been relegated to fifth.  Some of the comments I heard might have put them further back, but perhaps that was not the final lap.  The issue both he and Deputy Higgins have raised is under discussion at a technical level.  The Minister for Finance has spoken to Commissioner Rehn and he will speak to Mr. Draghi about it later this evening.  This arose from the comments we have been making here for a number of months, coming to a conclusion with discussions between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, that the troika should prepare and present a paper on this issue.  I expect the troika will do this and we will speak to each individual leader as we approach that.  The issue for discussion on Monday is the treaty and the question of growth and jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_345">The issue of the €30 billion promissory note, to be paid over ten years, is crucial and it would be of enormous benefit to Ireland were an improvement to be made.  Figures have been mentioned on this issue.  The discussions will continue, although hopefully not for too long, but it is not for immediate decision now.</p>
            <p eId="para_346">The draft that was finished last weekend is available at the moment, but it is important for Deputy Boyd Barrett to understand that Ireland is in a programme.  As such, the programme supersedes the issues that are here.  Our programme is due to be finished at the end of 2013.  The Government hopes that Ireland can emerge from its programme by then and fly on its own independent economic wings.  When we sign on for the rules, however, there must be adherence to those conditions.  What went wrong in Europe for many years was that conditions were set out but not adhered to.  The importance of the intergovernmental agreement before us is that if we sign on, we must adhere to the conditions.  These conditions are in respect of fiscal discipline, better budgetary policy and better governance.  The fact that this country is in a programme, challenging though it is, means it supersedes this particular draft until we finish it at the end of 2013, when hopefully we will no longer be in such a programme.</p>

Will the Government confirm whether new legislation will be required to fulfil this and whether the decision is a Government one?

          <p eId="para_389">The Legal Services Regulation Bill is on the Order Paper for today.  Last week I asked whether the regulatory impact assessment would be published in advance of the resumption of Second Stage and the Taoiseach said the Minister would correspond with me directly.  I received a letter from him today which stated that ideally it would be published in advance of the legislation but he hopes after consulting with stakeholders that it will be available prior to Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">I raised this at the Whips' meeting last week and I asked whether it would be on the Order Paper for this week.  At a meeting I was told it would not be on the Order Paper for this week because the regulatory impact assessment had not been published and for other reasons.  I was very surprised to see the Bill which was supposed to be on the Order Paper for today pulled and the Legal Services Regulation Bill replacing it.  It is very difficult to plan work for the week and do business when one's legitimate expectation with regard to what will be on the Order Paper is not fulfilled.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I want certainty about the Legal Services Regulation Bill.  It is not acceptable to receive the regulatory impact assessment prior to Committee Stage; we need it for Second Stage.  Second State has commenced but it should not be resumed until we receive the regulatory impact assessment.</p>

          <p eId="para_392">It is fair to say there should be a break between Second Stage and Committee Stage.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will be in the House this afternoon.  Deputy Murphy was informed on Monday morning that Second Stage would continue.  We are on the first round of speakers and there is a great deal of interest in the Bill.  At the end of Second Stage analysis will need to be done of all of the comments made by all Deputies.  If the regulatory impact assessment becomes available the Minister will circulate it for debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I would like all Deputies to have an opportunity to have their say on Second Stage and to have an analysis of their comments prior to Committee Stage as would be right and proper.  I understand Deputy Murphy was informed on Monday morning that Second Stage would continue and that there would be a decent space between its conclusion and Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_398">Deputy Murphy is well aware from her experience here that changes are made to Bills on Committee Stage when the Minister decides whether to accept amendments on the basis of their credibility and validity.  It would be wonderful to have all of these things beforehand.  The Legal Services Regulation Bill is enormous and it makes very great changes to the provision of legal services.  The regulatory impact assessment will be available, but as the Deputy is aware changes are made to a Bill on Committee Stage and Second Stage is when Deputies from all parties comment on what they think should be in a Bill and how they consider it, whether good, bad or indifferent.  Added to these comments will be reflections on the regulatory impact analysis, but it is on Committee Stage that these reflections are put into amendments submitted by Deputies which may be accepted by the Minister.  It is then that a great deal of consultation will take place on this very extensive Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_427">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to the House.  I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter which concerns the payment of the household services charge.  The main question I am asked by people who approach me on it is how they can make the payment.  I hear two points from constituents.  First, there is still confusion among many people as to whether they need to pay the charge.  Second, the overwhelming majority of people who want to pay the charge are unsure about how to make the payment, which makes it more difficult for them than should be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_428">I have three suggestions to put to the Minister on this matter.  In the legislation passed to set up this process I understand it was designated that each local authority had to have one office at which people could make the payment.  For Dublin City Council that means that if people who do not have access to the Internet want to make the payment in person they must go all the way to Civic Offices in Wood Quay passing many city council offices on the way at which they cannot make the payment.  I ask the Minister to find a way in whereby any local authority office can receive and process the payment.  Many local authorities have decentralised their offices and facilities into communities and people have to leave their communities to make the payments in the respective headquarters of the local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_429">If somebody wants to pay their ESB bill or waste charges, and a major difficulty has arisen regarding the rollout of a new waste charge system in the Dublin City Council area, they can make the payment in their local post office.  If we can put such a system in place for the payment of a waste charge surely we should be able to put one in place for the payment of the household services charge.  That would allow people make the payment in their local post office or equivalent.</p>
            <p eId="para_430">The third point people have put to me is the possibility of having the payment deducted, with their consent, from a pension payment.  I accept that would be possible only with consent but there is the possibility in the future of a fine being deducted from somebody's pension or income.  If people make the decision to have the charge deducted from their income from the State, we should facilitate that.</p>
            <p eId="para_431">I emphasise the importance of this issue.  My experience is that this charge will be paid by the overwhelming majority of people but many of them, particularly those who do not have access to the Internet, are finding it more difficult than it should be to make the payment.  Given the sensitivity around this charge we should change the system in place to make it simpler for people to make the payment.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government  (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_432">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  To give him some background on it, the reason we are introducing this household charge is the requirement in the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, which commits us to a property tax in 2012.  It was not possible to do the more progressive fairer system on this occasion and therefore we had to bring in a modest charge initially in 2012 on a flat rate basis.  It is the intention of the Government to agree shortly the terms of reference where we can draw up a more progressive and fairer system for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_433">There is a range of options available for persons to pay the household charge.  As the Deputy mentioned, an on-line system is in place under the Local Government Management Agency to enable homeowners pay the household charge by credit or debit card or in four instalments by direct debit.  In addition, homeowners can make payment by cheque, postal order, credit or debit card or in four instalments by direct debit by completing the mandate on the declaration form and posting it to Household Charge, PO Box 12168, Dublin 1.</p>
            <p eId="para_434">A bureau is in place in the Local Government Management Agency to administer the charge on a shared service-agency basis for all local authorities.  In addition, all county and city councils have been requested to have arrangements in place for persons to attend their principal offices to pay the household charge up to 31 March, 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_435">I take on board the suggestions made by Deputy Donohoe and I am prepared to examine how we can deal with major urban areas such as Dublin, to which he referred, and other cities such as Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford to allow us utilise area offices because of the devolution of administrative functions in the various local authority areas.  We will contact the relevant local authorities and if they are in a position to process these payments in offices other than the principal offices I will ask them to make those arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_436">We ran into some data protection difficulties, as the Deputy would be aware, regarding the ESB and An Post.  We were anxious to have some transactions directly with An Post but it required a transaction charge in respect of each transaction which was not acceptable and, therefore, An Post, which was anxious for the business, did not engage commercially with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to ensure it would be in a position to do that business.  Notwithstanding that, we are prepared to enter into discussions with utility companies and with the Data Protection Commissioner to ensure we overcome any issues that may cause a problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_437">The deduction of the charge at source, whether by the Revenue Commissioners or any other source of collection by the Department of Social Protection or whatever, will be considered in the context of rolling out a fully fledged and progressive property tax in 2013, 2014 and beyond.</p>

            <p eId="para_438">I thank the Minister for his response and urge him not to under-estimate the level of confusion there is about how to pay the charge, particularly among people who do not have Internet access.  The issue of how to make the payment is one that has been regularly raised with me.  Because the legislation specifies a principal office in which this matter be handled, local authorities believe they are doing their job well if they have one office within their jurisdiction that provides for managing this charge.  It was extraordinary to hear that An Post sought to make a profit from handling a transaction on behalf of the State when many other household transactions can be made and handled in the post office.</p>
            <p eId="para_439">At the very least, we must deal with the position whereby people have to travel past city council community facilities and offices to go to a central place where they can pay the charge.  That position needs to be changed before 31 March and then that change will need to be advertised.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
            <p eId="para_441">The predicament of the people who lived in the Priory Hall complex was big news a while back and then it was in the news again but, sadly for them, the nightmare has not gone away.  I visited the complex last week and from a construction point of view, it is a disaster.  There is a good deal of poor workmanship in it, poor building methods were used, the complex is not damp-proof or water-proof.  It is not safe and what has happened is certainly not fair to the residents.</p>
            <p eId="para_442">The council said that it will take €6 million to €7 million to fix it.  As a builder, I think it might be a better idea to knock it down and start again.  Someone has to take responsibility for it and someone has to help the residents.</p>
            <p eId="para_443">In terms of responsibility, the builder is the biggest culprit.  Did he have insurance?  He was supposed to have it.  The architect signed off on the development but he should not have done so.  Did he have insurance?  He should have had it.  The engineer signed off on the development and, from an engineering point of view, it should not have been signed off on.  Had the engineer insurance?  The bank, which agreed to grant mortgages to the tenants, sent out a valuer and he passed units and said they were worth the money the bank parted with in terms of the mortgages.  What will the bank do about this?  It is pretty obvious the council did not inspect the complex properly because if it had, it would not have allowed it to be passed either.</p>
            <p eId="para_444">At this stage the people are in a terrible predicament and nobody seems to care.  While the problems in respect of this complex might not have started during the Government's term, given that the council had been negligent the Government has to intervene because it does not appear that anyone else will do anything for these people.  Somebody has to sort it out.  The Government should initiate a process to make things happen.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_269">
            <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
            <p eId="para_445">I echo the point that this is a modern disaster.  It is an absolute tragedy for the families concerned.  They have been evacuees from their homes for more than 100 days now.  As we sit here not a single thing is being done to rectify those homes.  Work is not being undertaken and they are no nearer to returning to another home.  They do not want to return to the home they had because it could not be called a home.</p>
            <p eId="para_446">I would like the Minister to address a few issues.  Previously when the residents asked the Minister to meet them, he said he could not, that the issue is before the courts, it is not for him to intervene and that the matter is <i>sub judice</i>.  That is not good enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_447">I agree that Mr. McFeely, the developer, is responsible for this but he is a product of the lack of regulation that successive Governments allowed to prevail.  Dublin City Council did not enforce the regulation, even though it was inadequate, but the little bit of protection that was in place was not enforced, therefore it has a responsibility, but more than that there was a system of self-certification in place and in that sense the Government and the Minister have a responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_448">When the court adjudicates on this case, the scenario for these homeowners whereby their rent is being paid by Dublin City Council, will cease.  They cannot afford to pay a mortgage for a worthless home and rent for somewhere else.  It is impossible.  Somebody must step in.  We effectively own the banks.  The Minister should step in and demand that these tenants be released from their mortgage commitments given that they cannot enjoy the benefit of their homes.  There has been a breakdown in trust with the local authority and there is no dialogue with it.  It is up to the Minister to step in and examine if some form of mediation can take place.  Moving those families back to the complex and restoring those units is not a runner, despite what Dublin City Council says, but dialogue needs to take place and people need to discuss the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_449">I ask the Minister to comment on, and intervene to address a matter reported in the newspapers whereby the management company is being pursued over outstanding VAT payments as a result of the developer defaulting on his payments in that regard.  It is disgraceful that the Revenue Commissioners would pursue effectively the residents through their management company because of debts which Mr. McFeely had.  That is nonsense.  Penalties and late payments have applied and the bill is on the shoulders of the residents.  That is not good enough and the Minister has to intervene in that respect as well.</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_450">I can understand the deep frustration of the residents, which the Deputies have articulated, but we should not lose sight of the fact that Mr. McFeely is responsible for this as well as the professional people, as Deputy Wallace said, who signed off on this development.  That is no comfort to the residents this evening as we speak in this House in terms of the difficulties they have experienced, through no fault of theirs, but due to the negligence on the part of the developer and the professional people who signed off on the development, as Deputy Wallace indicated.</p>
            <p eId="para_451">The legal proceedings in regard to Priory Hall are continuing but I wish they were over in order that I could do much more than I can do now from a legal point of view.  The Department is being kept informed by Dublin City Council of developments with regard to the issues at Priory Hall.  The Department is also assisting the council, in consultation with NAMA, in securing alternative accommodation on a temporary basis for the residents.  We are making financial contributions to the residents to ensure we deal with the temporary issues they have in the context of a judgment of the High Court, which showed that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government was not responsible.  Dublin City Council is the designated authority in regard to these issues and it pursued the developer when it came to its attention in 2009 that there were difficulties.  Unfortunately, it took two years to get the developer to court to deal with some of the issues about which we now all know.</p>
            <p eId="para_452">I would like to be in a position to tell the Deputies that we can move quickly on this matter but the council, through court proceedings, has brought the developer, on behalf of the residents, to book.  Legal complications in this respect have now gone as far as the highest court in the land.  I had hoped that we could have dealt with these issues without going to that extreme.  I cannot meet the residents because I am a party to the proceedings in so far as helping Dublin City Council to meet some of the financial obligations of the residents and in meeting their immediate demands on a temporary basis.  I am not in a position to meet them but I will be glad to meet a representative group of the residents as soon as the court proceedings are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_453">The overriding priority for me arising from this case is that last June before the issue came to court, I immediately initiated a review of the building control standards and the building control legislation and I have put forward for public consultation a new mandatory certification in order that we can ensure that none of the problems in regard to this developer or the professional advisers involved will happen again.</p>
            <p eId="para_454">I assure Deputy Wallace in particular that we are following up on all the insurance issues and professional indemnities in regard to the professions involved.  I say to Deputy Clare Daly that I cannot mediate while the issue is before the courts.</p>

            <p eId="para_455">I trust the Minister will actively get involved and sort out the problem when the law allows.  He has said the local authority got involved in 2009.  It should have been involved a long time before then.  These properties should never have been sold, as they were not fit to be sold.  The local authority must carry responsibility in that respect, as it should not have passed the building.  The same is true of the bank valuer.  The residents should not be paying their mortgages because the bank valuer was wrong to pass the apartments as fit to be bought.  The builder is, no doubt, the biggest culprit.  The builder, the architect and the engineer all need to be dealt with by the authorities.  There has to be a law.</p>

Somebody is responsible; the residents certainly are not and the Minister is in the unique position of being able to assist them.  I do not accept that he cannot step in until the legal process is over.  If Dublin City Council wins the legal proceedings, as is likely, and is released from paying the rents of the home owners concerned, who will pay their bills?  Does the Government expect them to pay mortgages on valueless properties, as well as rents to keep a roof over their heads?  They cannot meet one payment, not to mention two.  Will the Department step in?  Will the Minister pressure the banks?  Who is going to meet the payment?  If it is not met, there will be severe homelessness, even worse than at present, in the very near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_458">I say to Deputy Mick Wallace that trust has broken down between the State and the residents with regard to consumer protection.  Professionals, developers and builders did not do the jobs they were trusted to do.  I now have to intervene with new legislation to regulate developers and builders who should have done their jobs properly and followed the certification process we had in place.  We can no longer trust professionals to sign off on things on a professional basis in the interests of consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_459">From his background, the Deputy will know that we did trust people and we can no longer do so.  In the past when a clerk of works had to give a certificate of reasonable value for first-time buyers, people used to complain about the cumbersome nature of the approval and certification process.  We now have to go back to look at these systems again.</p>

            <p eId="para_461">The Deputy is unique in that regard.  What I announced last year will bring back into vogue the sentiments he expressed about how we needed to certify all these properties because professionals whom we had trusted to do the job on a devolved basis on behalf of the State had failed to do so.  The residents of Priory Hall are the victims in this case.  There are probably other cases which we do not know of and which will come to the fore in due course.  I am trying to track these developments through the local authority system and put in place new legislative and regulatory requirements to stamp this out once and for all.</p>

The news has broken that Ms Louise Bayliss has been reinstated to her position by The Irish Advocacy Network Limited.  I welcome this news and congratulate Ms Bayliss as the hard-working and caring person of great integrity we now know her to be.  However, I am still concerned about the circumstances that led to her removal from her position when she showed herself to be a caring person advocating for vulnerable persons.  I ask the Minister of State, for whom I have tremendous regard because of her passion for the mental health sector, to consider the circumstances of the case.  Will she or her Department speak to The Irish Advocacy Network Limited, the management of St. Brendan's Hospital and senior management in the HSE about the possibility that this is happening, without notice, time again?  Is the Minister of State satisfied that this issue has been resolved?  What steps can she take to ensure it does not happen again?

            <p eId="para_463">I, too, welcome the reinstatement of Ms Louise Bayliss by The Irish Advocacy Network Limited.  This is a good outcome.  However, it does not remove the necessity for us to raise the issues surrounding her case.</p>
            <p eId="para_464">The treatment of women patients in St. Brendan's Hospital is a very serious matter.  After Ms Louise Bayliss blew the whistle, the matter was raised in the Dáil by a number of Deputies, including me, and the Minister of State subsequently visited St. Brendan's Hospital to see what had been described as temporary arrangements brought about by staff shortages.  That happened on 15 December.  I trust the Minister of State will take the opportunity to provide an update on the situation in St. Brendan's Hospital for the women concerned and generally, given the ongoing staff shortages.</p>
            <p eId="para_465">The issue that must be addressed is why did it take a patient advocate to go to the national broadcast media to highlight the situation and seek a remedy.  We would not have know about this were it not for the actions of Ms Louise Bayliss who deserves great credit for her courage.  Where are the safeguards for patients falling short?  Where are the reporting mechanisms in the system breaking down?  These are the issues that must be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_466">We have to see this issue in the context of the narrowly averted industrial action by members of the Psychiatric Nurses Association in St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.  All of this is related.  Again, the issue is the pressure exerted on reduced staff numbers and the reduction in bed numbers.  I trust the Minister of State will address these issues.</p>

Her reinstatement is a victory for her courage and commitment to the cause of mental health patients in ensuring they are properly treated.  However, major questions still need to be answered.  Why was she removed from the wards after blowing the whistle on behalf of patients?  We need to find out who made that decision and they need to be held to account.  We need to end the situation where retaliation is possible or punishment is meted out in any State agency or sector of society to people who are doing their job and acting in the interests of society and the persons they are supposed to be looking after.  We must urgently bring forward the promised whistleblower legislation.  We must address the lack of resources in mental health facilities and the health service generally which can lead to the mistreatment of patients and bodies trying to cover up that mistreatment by acting in the way Ms Louise Bayliss was treated.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health  (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
            <p eId="para_468">We need to clarify one matter.  No one was mistreated.  Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett needs to be careful about the language he uses.</p>
            <p eId="para_469">I would like to outline some of the background to this issue.  When the issue of the transfer of patients from Unit 3B to a low secure ward in St. Brendan's Hospital first arose back in December, I visited the hospital to satisfy myself that the temporary arrangements made for the five vulnerable patients in question were appropriate and would provide a good standard of care.  During my visit I was satisfied that they were very well cared for and were comfortable in their new accommodation.  I was not alone.  Other Deputies accompanied me on that visit.</p>
            <p eId="para_470">I spoke with the patients and staff and, while accepting that the move had been somewhat unsettling for them, believed every effort had genuinely been made to keep the disruption for the patients to a minimum.  I do not want to overstate this.  Clearly, people did not want to be in that position.  They would have preferred to remain in their own unit to which they were more used.  Because of staff holidays and the Christmas period the move had to be made from a safety point of view.</p>
            <p eId="para_471">The decision to keep the patients in another ward in St. Brendan's Hospital was made after careful clinical assessments had been carried out when their individual needs were taken into account.  It must be remembered that these women were familiar with the staff in the hospital, some of whom transferred with them.  They were also comfortable with their general surroundings.  I am delighted that the HSE, with the co-operation of management and staff, managed to reopen unit 3B in early January, a fortnight earlier than originally planned.  A degree of organisation was needed for that to happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_472">It is important to recognise that A Vision for Change places the service user at the centre of our mental health services, care and treatment.  They have a role in how services are offered, including the design, delivery and evaluation of services.  The HSE funds and supports a number of voluntary organisations that are working to develop the capacity of service users to fulfil this important role.  The trainee advocate involved in this case is under contract with the Irish Advocacy Network, a voluntary organisation that is supported and funded by the HSE to provide peer advocacy services nationally.  Peer advocates are people with personal experience of recovery from mental illness who have completed an accredited programme at FETAC level 4.</p>
            <p eId="para_473">The HSE has made it clear to me that at no time did it seek to interfere with the internal workings of the Irish Advocacy Network, nor has it ever sought sanction of any kind against the staff member referred to by the Deputies.  The HSE has categorically confirmed that at no point - locally, regionally or nationally - was the network advised that this trainee advocate was not welcome in HSE inpatient units.  The decision to deal with the issues the network had with certain trainee advocates was taken solely by it.</p>
            <p eId="para_474">I understand the Irish Advocacy Network issued a statement today indicating that, following indepth and intensive consultation within the organisation, it has offered to reinstate two trainee peer advocates who had their training posts terminated last week.  One of the trainees has agreed to accept this offer.  The network is meeting the other trainee tomorrow.  The network has made it clear that the HSE had no role in its decision to let the two trainees go, or in its decision to offer to reinstate them to their six-month training posts.  I understand a meeting between the HSE and the Irish Advocacy Network is scheduled for this Friday.  I will seek a report from the HSE on the outcome of that meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_475">One of the key principles that should underpin our mental health services at all times is that of autonomy for the patient.  The services are required to consult service users on service planning and delivery issues.  Such autonomy and consultation are critical to our strategic direction in the way in which we intend to continue to develop mental health services in this country.  Despite the consequences and the outcome of what happened in this case, it is important for us all to keep in mind that the Irish Advocacy Network is completely independent.  I would have it no other way.  I do not intend to interfere in any of the decisions it makes, regardless of how we might feel about them.  Whistleblowers legislation is an entirely different aspect of all of this.  The Irish Advocacy Network needs to be independent.  If we start to interfere in its operations, it will not be able to do its job.  We need to be very careful about that.</p>

            <p eId="para_476">I thank the Minister of State for her detailed response.  I have asked the Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which I am a member, to invite Ms Louise Bayliss to address the committee so we can hear her story.  I have also proposed that representatives of the Irish Advocacy Network should be also invited to that forum.  Some outstanding questions about the function, funding and supervision of the network need to be answered.  The Chairman of the committee has indicated that my request will be considered on Thursday morning.  I remind the House of the importance of the legislation I mentioned in my initial contribution.  I ask Deputies to imagine the society we would have if Deputy Rabbitte had been successful when he sought to introduce whistleblowers legislation in 1999.  They can reflect on how free and comfortable some staff in Anglo Irish Bank might have felt in recent years if the legislation had been passed, and on how that might have changed Irish society.  The same thing applies to the staff of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda and some of our nursing homes.  The introduction of such legislation is of crucial importance.</p>

Are contingency plans in place to address the additional staff shortages that are expected across the mental health services?  It is clear that such shortages contributed to the issues at St. Brendan's Hospital that we have already discussed this afternoon.

            <p eId="para_478">I do not want to bandy around terms in a sensitive area like mental health.  It seems to me that moving patients from an open unit where they are happy in a community to a closed secure unit - at Christmas, of all times - essentially because of staffing shortages is not the best treatment possible for patients.  The question of who is responsible for that is a separate one.  Ms Louise Bayliss was right to blow the whistle on it.  Although I do not know the truth of the matter, I am absolutely convinced that Ms Bayliss is telling the truth in every single detail of her account.  Therefore, questions have to be asked about why she was removed from the wards the day after she blew the whistle on what was happening at St. Brendan's Hospital.  I absolutely accept what the Minister of State said about the independence of the advocacy network.  I suggest it needs to have an independent source of funding.  We can argue about the difference between direct pressure and indirect or implicit pressure, but I suggest that if one's funding comes from the HSE, one will feel compromised in one's ability to advocate on behalf of patients if one thinks it might annoy the HSE.  That has to be addressed.</p>

The serious difficulty we have is that we are not certain.  We managed to secure 400 additional places in the health service plan.  The moratorium or pause is a big issue.  We need to start dealing with that.  I am sure the Deputy, like me, was gratified to hear the Minister, Deputy Howlin, say in the media recently that certain front line services will have to be the subject of an indepth examination.  We will have to look at who we employ, where we employ them and the gaps that exist in that regard.  That work will have to be done as a matter of urgency.  It is clear that more people have always left the psychiatric services than any other part of the health service.  That has been the case not just this year but for a number of years.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_290">
            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_487">I thank the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, for coming to the House to respond to what I have to say on this issue.  He will be aware that the correct sheep and cattle stocking levels on hill farms in the west of Ireland have been a matter of contention since the sheep premium was introduced in the 1970s.  The introduction of the sheep premium caused two problems.  The incentive to increase numbers at the expense of quality and sustainability meant that the price of sheep collapsed over time because of excess numbers and poor quality and that ecological damage took place.  When a system incentivises bad practice, hard-pressed farmers will go with the flow.  Recognising the damage caused by its policy, the EU reversed engines and for the past ten years pushed a policy of destocking.  I accept some destocking was necessary but local farmers, who understand the hills better than anyone, now say that under-grazing is becoming a problem and that this could have even more serious consequences than over-grazing and it could be more difficult to resolve.</p>
            <p eId="para_488">The Maamturks and Twelve Bens were very significantly destocked in recent years, on orders from the Minister's Department.  If a hill becomes under-grazed, the issues arising relate to the growth of wooded material which sheep will not graze and this material then takes over the hill.  This, in turn, leads to fires, especially in a dry spring season, which cause major ecological damage and present a significant hazard to human life and property.  The only answer to under-grazing is to restock the hills, but this is not as simple as destocking on open hills such as in Connemara.  The only way of restocking a hill is to breed the stock on the hill.  Bought-in stock placed on a mountain, just like homing pigeons, will go back to the mountain on which they were reared.  It is not a question of restocking by buying 50 more ewes and putting them out on the hill because it will be the case that the person who sold the ewes will end up with both the money and the ewes again.</p>
            <p eId="para_489">The Minister will also be aware that on the hills in Connemara, for every 100 ewes put to the ram, one is lucky to get a survival rate into the first year of 79 lambs or 0.7% of a lamb per ewe.  This is in the case of good hills while on the poorer hills it could be even lower.  As half of these lambs will be ewe lambs and the others will be male lambs, the reality is there will be 0.35% of a ewe lamb to every ewe on the hill.  One must then deduct from this statistic the fact that up to 10% of the sheep on a hill in a place like Connemara can die every year.  I know this is a fact from my experience of running a hill farm.  The older ewes must be sold.  If one takes out the 15% sales, 10% mortality, one has 0.15% of an extra ewe per annum for every ewe.  One hundred ewes will produce a very small gain and numbers will be very slow to increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_490">It is imperative, therefore, before numbers become too small and before the under-grazing problems becomes too big an issue, that farmers would be allowed to restock their holdings.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, should not use excuses about resources but rather they should immediately review the number of stock each farmer is permitted to have.</p>
            <p eId="para_491">It is also imperative that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht continue to pay compensation to farmers.  There is no point in saying that a farmer can go from 70 ewes up to 120 ewes but that the money granted from destocking will be stopped.  Restocking must be allowed to happen gradually because, as I have pointed out, it is not possible to go back to higher numbers of stock overnight.  I ask that this not be allowed to become an even greater ecological disaster than the over-grazing situation, that this matter be tackled immediately and that farmers be allowed to have sustainable numbers of sheep to stop the hills being completely destroyed by overgrowth.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht  (Deputy Jimmy Deenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_492">I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for raising this matter.  I am very familiar with this issue.  I have met the IFA and groups of farmers from Connemara, Nephin and other parts of that region on a number of occasions in the past year.</p>
            <p eId="para_493">Many commonages in the west were subjected to serious sheep over-grazing in the 1980s and into the 1990s, to such an extent that Ireland was brought to the European Court of Justice in June 2002.  The court found that Ireland was in breach of the EU birds directive by permitting the deterioration of habitats of the red grouse and the State was obliged to take measures to resolve the effects of over-grazing.</p>
            <p eId="para_494">The then Department of Agriculture and Food and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which is now in my Department, co-ordinated a national survey of commonages to evaluate the condition of each commonage and to prescribe destocking where necessary.  This survey was commenced in 1999 and the results and the required destocking were communicated to all shareholders in October 2002.  The two Departments are currently carrying out a re-assessment of the commonages and it appears that substantial recovery has been delivered.  However, there has been only limited recovery in the Twelve Bens-Garraun and Maamturk mountains special areas of conservation, SACs, in County Galway and the Owenduff-Nephin special protection area, SPA, in County Mayo.  Therefore, some continuing restrictions are necessary in these areas until there is a significant recovery of the vegetation.</p>
            <p eId="para_495">It is expected that all interventions in Mayo and Galway can end in November 2013 and cross-compliance norms will apply thereafter.  In the Twelve Bens-Garraun and Maamturk mountains SACs, my Department is making top-up payments to REPS and AEOS farmers for these additional restrictions.  These payments are designed to compensate farmers for losses arising from the necessary destocking and off-wintering of livestock.  In the Owenduff-Nephin area, it was necessary to extend restrictions partially for a further two years to repair the vegetation where recovery had not been fully delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_496">In 2011, the National Parks and Wildlife Service made payments to farmers in these two areas of Galway and Mayo to the amount of €1.55 million.  This was in addition to moneys paid by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine under existing REPS or AEOS contracts and single payment scheme.  The payments made by my Department come exclusively from the national Exchequer and would not be necessary if the land was in good environmental condition.  My Department is aware of the threat posed by under-grazing which can lead to increased growth and may pose a fire risk as well as reduced habitat quality.  However, in the case of commonages in the Twelve Bens-Garraun and Maamturk mountains SACs, this risk is not deemed to be significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_497">An essential component of the grazing package is that farmers must maintain sustainable stock numbers on the hill through their participation in a farm plan.  There are no indications to date of any concerns in relation to compliance with this requirement.  A review will be held in 2013 of the effect of the interventions and it is likely that stock numbers may then be allowed to increase.</p>

            <p eId="para_502">The Minister, in his reply, stated: "It is expected that all interventions in Mayo and Galway can end in November 2013 and cross-compliance norms will apply thereafter."  Will this include the Twelve Bens-Garraun and Maamturk mountains SACs, since these are in County Galway?  He also stated: "An essential component of the grazing package is that farmers must maintain sustainable stock numbers on the hill through their participation in a farm plan."  My understanding is that under the farm plans there is a maximum stock number.  Is there also a minimum stock number and is every farmer also required to keep the minimum stock as well as the maximum stock?  Clarification is required from the Minister.  Does he accept it is too late when over-grazing is discovered because it will take many years for the farmers to build up the stock because the sheep must be bred on the hill and because of the mortality levels?  The hills in Connemara, in some cases, would be much poorer in terms of land quality than those in the Minister's county of Kerry and we have a less benign climate.  Does the Minister accept that it is a case of ní hé lá na gaoithe lá na scolb, in other words, that it is too late when there is too much growth?  The Minister might answer these three questions.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_517">I am pleased to have the opportunity to brief the House ahead of the forthcoming informal meeting of the European Council in Brussels on Monday next, 30 January.  This informal meeting will take place over a working session on Monday afternoon.  There will be two issues before us, both of great significance for the European Union.  First, we will address any outstanding questions on the draft intergovernmental treaty and, second, we will examine what needs to be done to ensure a return to growth and job creation.  Both issues are important for Ireland and concrete progress on each is essential.  I will be working to ensure an outcome which is well balanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Clearly, a common currency needs common and enforceable rules and a shared commitment to discipline.  That is what the new treaty is about.  It is also clear that putting in place measures that will help us to avoid future crises, although they may improve market sentiment, will not on its own get us beyond the current crisis.  For that, we need growth and, to be more specific, job-creating growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The Government has been very active in advancing Irish positions ahead of the meeting.  I spoke this morning to the Austrian Chancellor and will make a number of calls to colleagues, including the Dutch and Italian Prime Ministers, this week.  In addition, I will meet the Danish and Finnish Prime Ministers at the World Economic Forum in Davos.  The Tánaiste has also been engaged with his colleagues ahead of the meeting and met a number of them, including his Portuguese, Luxembourg, Dutch, Austrian and Finnish counterparts, at this week's meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has been in intensive consultations with his counterparts, including a recent visit to see a German Minister, Mr. Schauble, in Berlin and a call on the President of the ECB, Mr. Draghi, in Frankfurt today.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">In addition, to help drive the growth agenda, the Government has taken a proactive step and co-authored two key inputs to next week's summit.  Our contributions focus on areas which should see a concentration of effort, with one on the digital Single Market and one on broader Single Market questions, including advancing the trade agenda.  We have done so in co-operation with a number of like-minded member states, including Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Estonia.  I will say more about these in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">Before I do so, I will update the House on progress in the negotiations on the draft intergovernmental treaty.  As I said after the December European Council meeting, it was clear to European leaders at the time that, in spite of the extensive range of measures already taken to restore stability and strengthen co-ordination, more needed to be done.  To get ahead of the economic and financial crisis once and for all and in a convincing manner, we had to act decisively.  We decided to firm up the stabilisation tools we had put in place to underpin the currency - the firewalls - and strengthen budgetary discipline by entering into more binding commitments to each other.  These new commitments are to be enshrined in the new treaty under consideration.  It is in Ireland's vital national interest that each and every member state of the euro area implements completely and without delay the full range of commitments it has entered into.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">It is this element - honouring and implementing the rules - that has not always been achieved in the past.  At this stage we are well beyond the point when we can afford to turn a blind eye.  We have seen in recent times how vulnerable we all are to a loss of confidence in the ability of one member state or another to sustain its economy.  We should be clear that all the hard work we have done to make our way back to a secure position could be undone, through no fault of our own, by the reckless behaviour of others.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Ireland needs to see the new treaty adopted and enforced.  It is absolutely in the national interest to do so.  I reject arguments that fail to recognise that this approach will best serve our interests and bolster our recovery.  Discipline and co-ordination will be our touchstones.  The new treaty will take implementation of all that has been agreed previously to a new level.  In the past we relied, perhaps too heavily, on peer pressure and are now giving real muscle to the process.  All member states - big, small, north or south - will have to abide by the rules and the EU institutions will have a key role to play.  Adoption of the treaty will help to generate confidence, the necessary precursor to investment, growth and jobs in Ireland and across the euro area and the wider European Union.  That is no small prize, but it is one that the Government is firmly fixed upon.  It is critical to the national interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">As the House will be aware, the negotiations are being advanced rapidly.  An initial draft of the text was circulated just a week after the December European Council and the following week - Christmas week, when the House was in recess - negotiations started in earnest in Brussels.  Further intensive rounds have taken place and as the negotiations have progressed, revised versions of the draft treaty have been prepared, each of which has sought to capture agreements and understandings reached during the preceding negotiations and, naturally, bridge differences between member states.  This has been a thorough and methodical process which nonetheless has been undertaken at considerable speed, given the pressing need for the treaty to be put in place without delay in order to instil the maximum degree of confidence at the earliest possible moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The latest iteration of the draft treaty was shared with member states last Thursday night.  Reflecting our desire to engage with Members of the House, the Tánaiste shared the draft and his analysis of the state of play with the members of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs last Friday morning.  That same draft was the subject of further discussions in Brussels yesterday and today, this time among EU Finance Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">On Friday morning Ministers attending the General Affairs Council meeting in Brussels will have a breakfast meeting with European Council President Van Rompuy when he will brief them.  Just this morning it was decided that there would be another round of negotiations at senior official level on Friday afternoon next in Brussels before the final draft is presented to us at the level of Heads of State and Government.  The text will then be taken up at next Monday's informal meeting of the European Council.  We are now approaching the end game.  I am hopeful that when EU leaders gather in Brussels, we will be able to bring the work to a successful conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">During the course of the negotiations the Government, assisted by our team of senior officials drawn from each of the relevant Departments and Offices, has been fully engaged with our EU partners, both in Brussels and across EU capitals, in order to ensure our national concerns are fully appreciated and understood by other member states.  At each iteration Irish interests have been advanced.  At the same time, we have been active in cultivating alliances with other partners on matters of common concern.  This approach has been productive.  We have particularly pressed our partners on the need for Ireland's programme country status to be properly taken into account; the need for an appropriate basis to incorporate a debt brake at national level; the need for a workable application of the structural balances methodology; and the need to ensure as much of the content of the new treaty as possible is put on a clear EU legal footing.  That is important.  In each of these instances I am satisfied that the draft text has been moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">Of course, the negotiations are as yet not concluded and, therefore, the draft text remains open to further revision.  A number of issues remain outstanding, some of which may require final decisions to be taken by leaders when we meet next week.  These include arrangements for the treaty to enter into force and for participation at euro summit meetings by non-eurozone member states.  These are important considerations.  However, as we reflect on the detail, we should not lose sight of the reason we are pursuing this course at this time.  We are not negotiating a new treaty for its own sake.  We are doing it with a view to making a serious and credible contribution to stabilising the common currency as a means to support a return to sustainable growth, accompanied by job creation.  The Government is using all it energy to secure this outcome at next week's meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">As I have said many times previously, Ireland has nothing to fear and a great deal to gain from this process.  That is why we continue to work to ensure our best interests will be reflected in the outcome.  We do not want to see the important progress we have made through our hard work and determination set back in any way.  We are working our programme and meeting our commitments, of which we want to make a success, difficult though that is.  Anything that makes a positive outcome more likely is to be welcomed, as the new treaty should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I appreciate the great interest the House takes in what will be required in order for the country to ratify the new arrangements.  At the risk of repeating myself again, I can only say the Attorney General will be asked for a formal view once a final text is available.  Until then it is not possible to be definitive and it is not helpful to speculate.  The test will be whether the proposed treaty is compatible with the Constitution, Bunreacht na hÉireann.  The Attorney General will study the legal implications carefully and advise accordingly.  As I have stated in the House and elsewhere many times, if a referendum is required, one will be held.  Whatever path towards ratification is required, the Oireachtas will be fully and appropriately involved in the process.  That is without question.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">As I said, discipline on its own will never be enough.  I will work for an outcome that recognises the urgent need to prioritise steps we can take to encourage and sustain growth.  We can be absolutely sure about one thing: without growth, Europe will not recover and we will not generate jobs.  Growth is the key.  It is necessary, therefore, to restore fiscal balances and market confidence in debt sustainability.  It is the key to supporting job creation and addressing the unemployment crisis, particularly that facing our young people.  Growth will not generate itself.  We must create the right conditions and environment to nurture growth across the European Union.  That is what is of real importance to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I wish to see real results arising from next week's meeting.  It is an objective I share particularly with colleagues in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland and Estonia, which is reflected in joint contributions with these countries to next Monday's meeting.  We have co-sponsored two papers which address a number of important issues which serve to advance our national interests.  These include: priority actions to complete the Single Market, including, in particular, the significant potential in the digital Single Market; further reduction of regulatory burdens on the small and medium enterprise, SME, sector; better targeting of labour market supports, including a new focus on youth unemployment - this matter was discussed at the British-Irish Council in the past two weeks; a stronger emphasis on the external dimension of the Single Market and the growth potential of third country trade; a more growth-friendly EU budget; and a growth test for future EU proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Europe has a real opportunity to progress an ambitious package of measures, reflecting the seriousness of the situation.  The Commission's annual growth survey 2012 was published in November, marking the starting point of the second European semester of economic governance.  The key message is that, faced with a deteriorating economic and social situation, more efforts are needed to put Europe back on track and sustain growth and jobs.  Ireland supports the five priorities suggested by the Commission: pursuing differentiated, growth-friendly fiscal consolidation; restoring normal lending to the economy; promoting growth and competitiveness for today and tomorrow; tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis; and modernising public administration.  These are consistent with the Europe 2020 strategy for growth that is smart, sustainable, and inclusive.  They align well with the national priorities established by the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">It is clear that we must deliver better educational outcomes, that we must keep our focus on knowledge-intensive development and that we must improve participation and employment rates with sensible and job-friendly labour market policies.  A key challenge in the current environment is to create a climate of confidence for new investment and to steer this investment in a direction that is sustainable.  Again, we see strong complementarities in this regard between the Europe 2020 strategy and the programme for Government.  Countries that, like Ireland, are participating in an EU-IMF programme are not required to prepare a full national reform programme and a stability or convergence programme for submission in April.  That is because the extent of the monitoring and reporting already taking place through the regular quarterly reviews is seen as rigorous and largely sufficient.  However, we will, nonetheless, be preparing a comprehensive review of national progress under the Europe 2020 strategy for submission and look forward to engaging constructively in the second European semester process.  The emphasis of the European semester on strengthening the alignment between budgetary priorities and structural reforms is the right one.  It is consistent with the direction we have set for ourselves in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">I wish next Monday's informal European Council to be a productive one to demonstrates the European Union's ability to focus on the urgent and important issues and at the same time conclude work on the new treaty and intensify efforts to deliver growth as a means to recovery.  I will, of course, report back to the House after the meeting.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_310">
          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_536">Next Monday's meeting of the leaders of Europe is shaping up to be yet another summit at which they will fail to take any decisive step to overcome the economic crisis that is accelerating in Europe.  Since they last met, the growth forecasts for most countries have been reduced, the sovereign ratings of many have been downgraded and unemployment has continued to rise.  Yet in spite of this, the agenda for Monday involves nothing more than a series of side issues or failed policies.  No matter how many times leaders use the word "jobs" in their statements, all they are discussing is fiscal consolidation and a Franco-German obsession with tax harmonisation.  It is also yet another summit that Ireland will attend without its Head of Government having made any effort to promote an agenda by undertaking even a basic round of serious bilateral meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Since last March, our party leader Deputy Micheál Martin has taken the lead in the Chamber by setting out the specifics of what is required to address the crisis.  He was well ahead of most commentators in pointing to the likely impact of the delays from March to July in implementing a debt sustainability deal that was agreed in principle in December 2010.  In spite of the frequent jibes thrown at him by the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, he has been correct in challenging the false dawns that have been announced after every new measure's adoption.  His consistent critique has been that the Council has been focused on addressing issues that did not cause the crisis and will not solve it.  The failure of Europe's leaders to challenge the failed orthodoxies continues to do significant damage.  It is true that key bond yields on the secondary market have fallen, but the evidence suggests that this is purely as a result of unsustainable co-ordination between a range of institutions and banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Deputy Martin has also set out a constructive agenda of measures that Fianna Fáil supports.  Unlike others, we have not taken the path of angry opposition or unthinking support.  I will revert to the specific proposals that, even at this late stage, we believe the Taoiseach should formally place on the Council's agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">As these are the first statements since the Croatian referendum, I would like to join with others in welcoming the strong "Yes" vote to membership of the EU.  Croatia is a country that was born in difficult circumstances and has overcome many hurdles in the past two decades.  It has built a strong liberal democracy and has worked hard to overcome ethnic divisions that could have festered for a long time.  Ireland has been a strong supporter of Croatian membership and opposed the artificial barriers placed in its way at different times.  I also acknowledge the leadership role in the referendum played by foreign Minister Vesna Pusić, who is vice-president of our European party and who we look forward to welcoming to the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, ELDR, congress in Dublin later this year.  The referendum shows that, even at this time of crisis, the idea of the European Union has a strong attraction for all those who want to build a democratic and peaceful Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I welcome the early statements of the Danish Presidency and its constructive approach.  Last week, Prime Minister Thorning-Schmidt placed the issue of youth unemployment at the centre of her address to the European Parliament.  It was a positive start to the Presidency and I hope that President Sarkozy will have the decency to apologise for the insulting attitude to Denmark and other small countries that he adopted in his statements at the December summit.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The proposed fiscal treaty will be finalised next Monday, but there is no indication that anything of substance is likely to change.  In a move typical of this Government, even though there is a final text available, it will not reveal its understanding of the treaty until the latter has been agreed.  The debate on this treaty has been the worst of any Europe-related treaty since we first applied to join the EU 50 years ago.  The likelihood of a treaty emerging became clear in August following a Franco-German summit.  The only response by the Taoiseach was a doorstep interview some time later when he stated that a referendum should be avoided.  From that point on, the basic strategy of the Government has been to focus on whether the people need to be consulted and not on looking for a deal capable of restoring stability and growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">Last week, the Tánaiste stated that it was disgraceful to suggest that the Government was trying to avoid a referendum.  As we know from WikiLeaks, the Tánaiste has a record on this issue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_547">I am glad that the ability to read the Constitution and to understand its implications survives.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">There is simply no doubt the sole thrust of negotiations since 9 December has been to finalise a treaty that can be ratified by the Oireachtas and will withstand the inevitable Supreme Court case.  Ireland was not alone in trying to reduce the radicalism of December's agreement.  To deny this is to deny the obvious.  In spite of the Taoiseach's comments, the truth is that he has received legal advice at every step on whether a vote might be required.  I noticed his clever use of the word "formal" today.  He is getting good at word crafting.  The Taoiseach must wait for a final text to get a final piece of formal advice, but I am sure he already has informal advice.  He knows exactly what is the Attorney General's view of the current text and he should be honest enough to outline it before he signs off on the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The text that will go to the summit does not represent the implementation of December's deal.  The provisions have been carefully drawn to leave out legally binding provision for, in effect, a two-speed Europe.  Enhanced co-operation may happen, but there is no legal obligation to agree in advance to be covered by policies with which one disagrees.  In addition, for all of the fighting in December about the place of existing EU treaties and institutions, existing treaty law will remain fully in force.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">The draft treaty explicitly states that the issue of real change is being kicked down the road with a target of doing something within five years.  As currently drafted, it is a minimalist treaty that appears to do little more than put a small amount of extra enforcement behind policies already incorporated in EU regulations.  The specific fiscal targets are those that were agreed last year and finalised in a regulation that came into force in November.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">What is new is the idea that the European Court of Justice would be able to fine member states through cases that will be easier to initiate.  At the heart of this is perhaps the most ridiculous idea in the construction of the Stability and Growth Pact, namely, the way to deal with a government in debt is to fine it an amount that is a fraction of that debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">No doubt others contributing to this debate will speak forcefully about how the treaty spells the end of the world and is revolutionary.  In truth, it is nothing of the sort.  As drafted, it is a tokenistic effort that entrenches already agreed policies but fails completely to address the causes of the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">Various parties and individuals have already started a competition for who can get to the High Court fastest when the Government tries to ratify the treaty through the Oireachtas.  Just as the Government's main interest is in avoiding a vote, the main interest of these parties lies in having something to campaign against.  What people ignore is that since we joined the European Union, there have been at least eight treaties between member states which have not required the holding of a referendum.  For example, the 2003 accession treaty included amendments which were agreed for Ireland in response to the referendum in the State on the Nice treaty.  Not every change automatically requires the holding of a referendum.  The important issue is to see the final text first.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">The problem with the treaty is not that it does too much but that it does nothing about the real causes of the crisis.  In particular, it completely ignores the policies required to return growth and job creation to Europe.  Not a single provision in the treaty would have prevented the current economic crisis.  In Ireland's case, we fully met every provision therein, right up to the start of the recession.  Others would have had to run slightly tighter budgets, but they would not have been obliged to adopt any policies which would have averted the crisis.  It is a great pity the Taoiseach put party politics first by repeatedly linking Ireland's problems with the failure to operate to these fiscal rules.  In doing so, he has significantly weakened Ireland's hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">We support the idea of greater efforts to ensure long-term fiscal stability in Europe.  What we do not support is the notion that strengthening fiscal control will solve any problem.  Britain, the United States and many other countries with no sovereign borrowing problems have worse fiscal balances than in the eurozone.  In the case of the United States, the yields on Treasury bonds are at an historic low.  Outside of the governments of a handful of European countries and, tragically, the board of the European Central Bank, nobody believes the crisis will be ended by showing greater resolve on borrowing and debt.  In fact, the recent downgrading of France and other countries was explicitly justified on the basis that the agenda agreed in December was the wrong one.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">The core cause of the sovereign debt problem in the eurozone is the lack of a lender of last resort for the primary bond markets.  Investors are losing confidence that the money will be available when they seek to redeem bonds and, consequently, have been driving up yields.  In the past month there has been some respite, but the evidence is that this is because of background manipulation of the market in an effort to restore confidence.  In reality, we have the ridiculous situation where the ECB is lending money to banks in the hope they will buy up sovereign bonds.  Other central banks are buying them directly, with lower costs and risks and a much greater impact.  The failure of the draft treaty to include a single word about any reform of the ECB is the greatest indicator of its irrelevance to solving the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The policy of the European Union remains the funding of bailouts rather than preventing them from being required.  The failed policy which drove Ireland and then Portugal out of the markets in the past year and a half remains untouched.  If the leaders of Europe want to address the causes of the crisis, they should at least indicate an intention to explore a series of specific steps.  The fist and most significant of these is the need to change the mandate of the ECB.  At a minimum, the bank should be given a mandate to target economic growth as well as low inflation.  Equally, it must lead a unified financial regulatory approach.  Second, before trying to establish a fiscal union, the leaders should agree to establish a significant fund to assist countries in facing major economic shocks.  The former President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, showed he understood this when he pushed for Cohesion funding, but it appears to have been forgotten by those who believe growth can come from control without investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Third, the leaders should agree to a significant increase in funding for employment creation in the worst affected countries.  The reason people here and elsewhere developed a growing respect for the European Union was that it played a major role in tackling unemployment.  That should be remembered and addressed in the agreement next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Fourth, the leaders must signal that they will no longer tolerate the fracturing of the European Union and the arrogant behaviour of a couple of leaders more concerned with domestic opinion polls than the worst economic crisis since the 1940s.  They have been helped by the timidity of the Taoiseach and others who have failed to build alliances or forward an alternative agenda.  If President Sarkozy and Chancellor Merkel turn up on Monday with a prepackaged agreement and demand that everyone shut up and sign, they should be told "No".  All 27 member states have rights which must be respected.</p>

          <p eId="para_562">Go raibh maith agat a Chathaoirligh, agus tá mé buíoch don Taoiseach fosta.  I listened to the Taoiseach's comments and carefully examined the script distributed.  I do not know who writes this stuff, but some of it is incredible.  For example, we are told that we are now "giving real muscle to the process" of budgetary oversight within the European Union.  The Taoiseach said all member states, "big, small, north or south," would have to abide by the rules.  He spoke about needing to instil the "maximum degree of confidence at the earliest possible moment," but he does not say who will have confidence instilled in them.  The speech included one gem, in particular, the reference to the need to "ensure as much of the content of the new treaty as possible is put on a clear EU legal footing."</p>
          <p eId="para_563">The Taoiseach paid the usual service to the issue of growth, but he did not refer to the growth in poverty and inequality and the other social problems that are getting worse by the day.  He also states, "It is clear that we need to deliver better educational outcomes...."  One might conclude from this that there will be no closure of DEIS schools, no increase in student charges and no closure of educational institutions.  The Taoiseach is getting good value from the advisers to whom he is paying huge cheques if it was one of them who came up with the lovely phrase:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_564">I want next Monday's informal European Council to be a productive one, one which demonstrates the European Union's ability to focus on the urgent and the important at the same time....</p>
          <p eId="para_565">I joked the other day that sometimes the discussions in this House were like an episode of "Father Ted".  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste remind me of Fr. Ted and Dougal; I am only waiting for Mrs. Doyle to come in at any moment and tell us, "Go on, go on, go on."  If it were not so serious, we would be in the territory of Myles na gCopaleen, Spike Milligan or whatever one is having oneself.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">The difficulty is that the Government is simply afraid of the people.  It has made clear that it is totally in favour of the proposed treaty, yet the Taoiseach says there will not be a referendum unless the Attorney General directs that one is required.  It is almost as though the Government, somehow, is not allowed to call a referendum.  It as if it does not have the power to do so and that we do not live in a republic.  The very least citizens in a real republic expect is that they get to decide on any agreement with such far-reaching consequences.  This refusal to face up to holding a referendum, to call one on a democratic principle, is cowardly and unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">We have seen other Ministers do what the Taoiseach is doing today, namely, attempting to portray the choice facing the people as one of staying in the eurozone or leaving it.  The Government knows that is not the case.  It should seek advice from the Attorney General in that regard if it is unsure.  The reality, of course, is that our position as a member of the eurozone is secure no matter what position the citizens of the State take on the emerging treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The big question is whether the treaty is good for Ireland and Europe.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are clearly of the view that it is a good treaty, even though it is not yet completed and another round of negotiations is due to take place.  Sinn Féin believes what is proposed is not for Europe and, in particular, Irish citizens.  It is bad economics and bad politics.  Tá a fhios maith ag an Taoiseach go bhfuil an Stát seo briste brúite agus nach féidir linn an bille le hAnglo a íoc, cé go mbeidh Anglo ag fáil airgid amárach.  Méid mhór airgid atá ann, a d'fhéadfaí a chur i dtreo fostaíochta nó chun an córas sláinte nó an córas oideachais a fheabhsú.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">The Government should reconsider its support for this deal.  The systems are not working for the vast majority.  We spoke earlier about the need to marry our economic and social progress, but we are doing the opposite.  The Labour Party, in particular, needs to be conscious of the result of all of this.  This is not a fiscal compact; it is an austerity treaty, as the Taoiseach knows.  This is about right-wing austerity policies being imposed in perpetuity.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Providing in State law for the 0.5% of GDP deficit limit will require the Government to implement austerity budgets - I presume it would be legally bound to do so - not just until 2015 as demanded by the EU-IMF programme but for its full term in office and beyond.  There are 450,000 on the live register and the Government is poised to close up to 900 nursing home beds and cut 500,000 home help hours at a time when tens of thousands of our young people are being forced to emigrate.  If austerity was the solution, it would have worked by now.  The significiant transfer of power to the European Court of Justice will emasculate the Oireachtas in terms of the limited authority it will have.</p>

This so-called fiscal-austerity compact demonstrates that the leaders of Europe, including the Taoiseach, either do not know the causes of the problem or are in denial in this regard.  The Government needs to stand back and look at how we got here.  The crisis commenced with the formation of European Monetary Union and the eurozone when trade surpluses materialised in Germany resulting in the euro making the German economy even more competitive and in having a considerable bulk of the wealth at the core, followed by irresponsibility in distributing that wealth.  The blindness of the European Central Bank allowed core state banks to lend recklessly without regulation to the periphery, including private banks in Ireland and governments, without due recourse or due diligence in terms of what they were doing.  That is how the crisis was created.  There is a fundamental problem with European Monetary Union as configured.  A one-size-fits-all policy does not work for Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">I have no doubt that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are aware that the saddling of the people with billions of euro of private sector debt is a gross injustice which undermines the principle of the European Union based on solidarity.  In the eyes of every fair international commentator and economist we have been disgracefully and abysmally treated.  The Government has a huge moral platform to defend the interests of the people.  They know this is wrong, as does the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">Sinn Féin's document lists four main solutions to the main elements of the crisis, namely, investment, the banking system and the sovereign debt issue.  On investment, the potential of the European Investment Bank needs to be unleashed for a number of reasons, including that it has a solid track record of prudent investment and returns.  This would be a good way of sensibly lending from the wealth of the core states to the periphery.  This is a core issue.  To do this, we need to deploy resources to the European Investment Bank.  It is critical at this time that we send the message that there is a plan for job creation and growth in Europe.  The European Investment Bank has been completely under-deployed.  For example, we could use the National Pensions Reserve Fund in conjunction with the European Investment Bank to address core deficiencies in the State, not least the need for the roll-out of next generation broadband.  I could go on.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">The second element is the banking system.  There must be a cleansing of the European banking system.  There must be rigorous stress testing of the core banks, which we know has been avoided to date.  This must happen if we are to restore faith in the peoples of Europe and the markets about which we hear so much.  When this happens, deleveraging and recapitalisation will be required on a case by case basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">The third element is the sovereign debt issue, on which we must take a sensible approach.  Proper debt restructuring on a case by case basis will be required, in particular for Ireland.  Without this, there will not be growth in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are west of Ireland men.  They know the impact of austerity on rural Ireland and are aware that the trail of emigration has recommenced.  They know that Sydney, Perth, Chicago, New York, London and Glasgow are filling up with another generation of Irish people.  We cannot sustain this.  We cannot continue to pay the private banking debt while crippling the hopes of the people.  Yesterday I visited the CoLab facility at Letterkenny Institute of Technology.  My spirit was lifted by the fantastic entrepreneurs in the building, people who have ideas around computerised gaming, media technology and medical devices.  They are brilliant people whose potential we need to unleash.  However, because of the manner in which we are going about addressing the crisis we cannot do this.  The Taoiseach knows that we cannot deploy austerity only and hope to return to growth.  As such, we need to do something about this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The final element relates to existing EU treaty provisions.  Sinn Féin believes that if there is the will, there is the scope to deploy the ECB to purchase Government bonds on the primary markets.  It has been doing this on the secondary markets but now needs to do it on the primary markets.  The specific article which Sinn Féin believes permits this is Article 282.2 which provides the capacity for this in the context of the collective interests of the peoples of Europe being demonstrated.  Could there be a more important time to do this?  The Government needs to deploy the ECB to purchase Government bonds on the primary markets, deploy the resources of the European Investment Bank, in conjunction with the resources of member states, including in Ireland of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, and deal with the issue of sovereign debt in a fair, sustainable and credible way.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">There is also the issue of the cleansing of the European banking system.  These are four concrete solutions and I will submit the document to the Government because sometimes the Taoiseach suggests Sinn Féin is reckless and so on.  This is an extremely responsible and sensible document that analyses clearly both the problems and what must be done.  The difficulty is that, for whatever reason, the focus is on austerity alone.  While that might be the view of Chancellor Angela Merkel, it is wrong.  It will not solve the crisis and the markets are not convinced.  Consequently, on behalf of my party, I appeal to the Government to consider its solutions which cover all aspects of the crisis and begin to defend Ireland's interests.  We are on a hiding to nothing and if we continue in this way, we will be facing a lost decade.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_585">I wish to share time with Deputies Mattie McGrath, Thomas Pringle, Clare Daly and Richard Boyd Barrett.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">I listened carefully to the Taoiseach's statement, one paragraph of which shocked me.  He stated, "It is in Ireland's vital national interest that each and every member state of the euro area implements completely and without delay the full range of commitments it has entered into."  While I fully understand the relationship between each country and how one can have an extremely negative impact on the other, I am shocked that this is the approach being taken by the Taoiseach.  This is because it ignores one fundamental issue, that Ireland will be signing up to implement fully a GDP-to-debt ratio of 60% at a time when its ratio is almost double that figure.  Moreover, we will be obliged to reduce it by one twentieth each year and we will be signing up to sanctions if we do not do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">On the other hand, the Taoiseach referred to the need for growth and stated, "Growth will not generate itself.  We must create the right conditions and environment to nurture it across the European Union."  While we may think we are broke now, were we to sign up to this compact without securing some commitment in respect of dealing with the debt, our prospects for growing the economy would be absolutely gone.  Had Ireland been invaded, had a war taken place here or had Ireland instigated a war, we would have been given time to pay war reparations.  The problem is that although we face all the financial problems of a war, we have no rebuilding to go with it.  Something like the Marshall Plan implemented after the Second World War is needed, but that is not happening.  The Taoiseach's speech is at variance with the draft under discussion because the draft is only about austerity and I cannot discern anything within it that provides any prospects for growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I wish I had more time to discuss this issue, but as a final point, I note the Taoiseach stated, "The EU institutions will have a key role to play."  What about the Commission, the Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the veto?  None of that matters because it all has been sidelined by this intergovernmental arrangement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_326">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_589">I am also pleased to be able to make a brief contribution.  Having listened to the Taoiseach's contribution, I am also disappointed because it is the same old mantra and the same old spin that is always being put on it.  All of these summits have been built up to be something, but they have never lived up to expectations.  This is a disappointing aspect for Ireland because as the growth rates of all European Union countries literally are slipping back by the day, these targets will not be met.  Consequently, being in a straitjacket of fiscal rectitude is not working.  Anyone with any understanding of running a business will attest to the fact that concentrating exclusively on cuts without providing a stimulus or for reinvestment does not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">Last week the Tánaiste asked Members to put on the green jersey.  However, my response is to ask him where is his green jersey.  What has happened to his green jersey since he moved to the Government side of the House?  He has lost his voice, his courage and certainly his stamina for a fight.  He was all action and was going to burn the bondholders.  It was going to be his way or Frankfurt's way, but what happened?  We have been getting a severe dose of Frankfurt's way and nothing else since.  He has lost his stamina completely.  Where are his Labour Party colleagues?  I do not see any of them present in the Chamber and have seen few of them during debates other than this one.  I ask the Tánaiste to wear the green jersey and bring one for both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  He should tell them to put them on and stand up for Ireland because we have rights as a constituent member of the European Union.  Ireland has passed all the treaties in the past, although it was necessary to go back a second time to pass some of them.  However, it will be hard to have a treaty passed again by the people because they have had a dose of what they do not like.  They have been given a dose of the big minders, with Ireland being given a pat on the back and told it is doing great stuff and that the Government is meeting targets.  However, this is all a lie and untrue.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">I was pleased to have the opportunity last week to meet the troika with my colleagues from the Technical Group.  I compliment Deputy Catherine Murphy on securing such a meeting.  We told its representatives some home truths and while I consider them to be genuine people, they have been fooled by both the Government and its predecessor into foolishly believing the Government has a mandate to introduce the cuts that are wiping out schools, education, hospital and services of all kinds, as well as dumping people on the dole with no hope and killing off business initiatives.  Moreover, the Government is telling the troika, certainly not in my name or those who voted for it, that it has a mandate to do this.  The Tánaiste is aware that the Government has a mandate to do no such thing.  He is aware that he received a mandate for his voice while in opposition and promises to burn the bondholders, get rid of the last Government and change everything.  However, what did people get?  The Administration took the same attitude hook, line and sinker, which is an absolute disgrace.  Moreover, it is an even bigger disgrace for the Tánaiste to tell people in Europe that he has a mandate to do this.  In common with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and all other Members on the other side of the House, he should be ashamed of himself.  This is a complete con job and a trick of the loop.  While the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, may have called Members of the Technical Group a pick and mix and so on, it is the Government Members who are the pick and mix.  They will be a disgrace and traitors to the country.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle</from>
          <p eId="para_592">The forthcoming European Council meeting next week has again been mooted as another crunch moment for Ireland.  Members have heard calls from the Tánaiste to don the green jersey and support what the Government is trying to do in Europe.  In the Taoiseach's mind, this means supporting its stance and ensuring at all costs that there will be no need to hold a referendum in Ireland.  This is so that we can again show to our European masters that we are the good boys and girls in the class.  It is to show we are willing once again to prostrate ourselves to bail out Europe and force the Irish people into a permanent austerity programme.  Proposals for a permanently balanced budget probably will ensure Ireland will never emerge from its current bailout programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Already Ireland is being warned of the dire consequences if we dare to exercise our democratic right to ask the people to endorse whatever deal is made.  While speaking in Trinity College last night, the former German Foreign Minister warned of extreme consequences were we to reject the compact.  When does the exercising of a democratic process invite extreme consequences?  It seems only when a nation wishes to follow its constitutional processes and it does not fit with the agenda of "Merkozy" and the European masters.  When will the Taoiseach stand up for the people and tell them where to get off?  It is time for him to don the green jersey and tell them his first responsibility is to the people and that he will do what is good for them, that democracy is the basis for Ireland's Constitution and that he will protect the people through his actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">There is a huge and dangerous democratic deficit in Europe.  "Merkozy" has deposed the governments of two sovereign states and imposed technocratic governments in Greece and Italy.  Moreover, the proposed fiscal compact will further weaken democracy.  The real purpose of the European Union is emerging through the proposals appearing, namely, the domination of Europe by a small core of countries that will force everyone else to follow their will.  In the 1950s Jean Monnet, one of the founders of the European Economic Community, stated the first steps on the road to a federal Europe had been taken.  That road has now led us to our current position and the sad part is that the Government is happy to proceed with it and give away any sovereignty that remains.  Ministers have made much of our loss of economic sovereignty and how their job is to get it back.  The fiscal compact will give away Ireland's economic sovereignty forever and make Ireland a province once again.  If the Taoiseach wishes to don the green jersey, let him put it on, attend the Council meeting and tell "Merkozy" and the Commission that the Irish Parliament and people have given him a single mandate, that is, to defend the independence of the nation and that whatever deal comes from the Council will be put to the people.  The Taoiseach should tell them that only if he receives their endorsement, will he be in a position to sign up to any deal.</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_328">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_595">It is clear that the key issue before the European Council is that relating to the austerity treaty.  In a certain sense, we are operating in something of a vacuum because we have not seen the final draft of the treaty.  However, we have a fair and clear idea of what it is going to contain.  An article in today's <i>Financial Times</i> indicates that Frau Merkel of Germany has decided that she may like to consider the idea of allowing the EFSF to use its funds in parallel with those of the ESM which the European Union hopes to launch in July, but that, in return, countries must sign up to the rules relating to the cutting of budget deficits and public debt in a far tougher way that has been speculated upon up to now.  There are reports that phrases and provisions which would have allowed countries to breach the deficit limits being spoken about in the context of the treaty in periods of economic downturn were being considered.  These phrases and provisions are deemed to constitute an escape clause by the ECB which wants cast-iron guarantees and rules to apply in any new scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">There is absolutely no doubt that the treaty revolves around institutionalising austerity throughout Europe in perpetuity.  What is being done is taking place in the context of a further diminution of democracy and will involve a transfer of powers from national governments and ordinary people to the European Commission and so on.  The Government has some audacity to consider such proposals in the absence of a referendum.  It is something of an affront for the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and a number of other Ministers to spuriously state there is nothing new in the treaty, particularly when what is being considered goes beyond anything seen previously.  What is at issue is the provision being made providing for permanent oversight of economic policy, as well as certain fiscal arrangements.  That is a fundamental departure.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Imposing fines amounting to hundreds of millions of euro on countries which are already struggling to cope with circumstances of the worst kind would be a sick joke.  The imposition of such fines will have profound implications.  There is a political obligation on the Government to put these issues before the people.  However, it is trying to engage in a cover up and do everything possible to prevent the holding of a referendum.  If the Tánaiste is so confident that the steps being taken are correct, why will he and his colleagues not debate the relevant issues with us and the people?  Such a debate would not revolve around whether we were in or out of the European Union, rather it would focus on the type of Union we wanted to see develop.  Like the Italians who are on strike today and the Greeks who are facing vicious austerity, we are more concerned about a European Union that is run in the interests of the people rather than those of the elites and the banks which are being protected.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_329">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_598">There is no moral, political or democratic justification for denying the citizens of this country or their counterparts across Europe a say in whether we should sign up to an arrangement, whereby permanent austerity will be imposed on them, society and the economy.  The draft of the treaty in circulation makes it clear that such an arrangement is being contemplated.  It refers to fiscal austerity rules being binding in force and permanent in character and stipulates that governments must guarantee to impose these rules on their national budgetary processes.  What is envisaged is written in black and white for all to see.  The democratic right of citizens and their representatives to decide their own economic policies will effectively be abolished with this treaty.  Surely, the very least to which the citizens of the country are entitled is the right to decide whether they want to abolish their right to control matters relating to their economic and social future.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Permanent austerity means permanent mass unemployment, emigration and attacks on the most vulnerable in our society, namely, those who are already reeling owing to the impact of three years of austerity measures which have not worked.  When will European leaders and the Government learn that the policy of austerity is not working?  Every indicator shows that the European economy is shrinking and that austerity is the cause.  What is being done appears to be underpinned by a belief that technocrats know better than the people and their elected representatives.  It is absolutely clear that all technocrats know about is balancing books.  That does not get people back to work, nor does it make economies grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">All the money we have collected via the austerity measures is being hoarded in the vaults of the European Central Bank.  We need it in order to create jobs and foster growth.  Why is no one talking about releasing and investing it in our society in order to create jobs, improve services and build infrastructure, thereby encouraging growth in the economy?  The people should at least be given a vote in order that they might choose the path we should take.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade  (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
          <p eId="para_601">I appreciate the contributions made by Deputies to this debate, even if I do not agree with all of the points made.  The Government is committed to stepping up its engagement with the House on European matters.  A healthy debate on such matters is in all our interests.  I attended a lengthy and in-depth meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs last Friday morning when I had a good exchange with colleagues from across the House, including some of the Members present for this debate.  I was particularly pleased that some of our MEPs were in attendance in order that they could bring perspectives from Brussels and Strasbourg to bear on the discussion.  The dialogue to which I refer is going to continue.  The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, will, as has become customary prior to meetings of the General Affairs Council, address the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs on Thursday.  The Taoiseach will return to the House to brief Members again in the aftermath of next week's meeting.  Let there be no doubt that the Government is serious about engaging in debate in the House on European matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The informal meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Monday will be an important event and mark a turning point.  As a Government, we will be working to ensure an outcome that delivers for Ireland.  What is good for the euro area and the European Union as a whole is in Ireland's interests.  We want to restore credibility and confidence in the eurozone.  That is the job at hand.  An agreement at the summit should lend stability to a volatile situation.  That would be a good outcome for this country.  We will be striving for a balanced outcome that marks significant progress on the two major issues on the table.  I hope it will be possible to finalise work on the intergovernmental treaty and thereby further strengthen economic policy co-ordination within the euro area.  Let us be clear, however, that the treaty is not an end in itself, it is a key element of a larger package of actions designed to respond to the sovereign debt crisis.  We have already accepted, with our European partners, the wide range of measures needed in order to respond to the crisis.  In terms of severity and duration, the current crisis is unparalleled since the establishment of the European Union.  The response has also been unparalleled, even if not always perfect.  Next week we will have the opportunity to take a positive step in addressing the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The treaty represents one critical piece of the jigsaw.  However, I am also extremely keen to see delivery on the growth agenda at European level.  Every Irishman and woman has a vested interest in next week's summit making real and concrete progress in that regard.  These two elements - strengthened economic policy co-ordination and the pursuit of job creation and growth - are complementary and mutually reinforcing and we will be pursuing them in parallel.  As the Taoiseach noted, negotiations on the draft intergovernmental treaty are moving in the right direction.  That is welcome, but this remains a fluid process.  As no agreement on a draft text has yet been reached, we will remain fully engaged with partners to ensure our issues of particular concern will be resolved in a satisfactory manner.  Just this morning another negotiating session on the draft treaty has been convened for Friday.  Our team of senior officials will once again fight our corner and promote our interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">At the same time and in the context of the broader growth agenda, together with five other like-minded partners - Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Estonia - we have submitted papers to the President of the European Council identifying priority issues to drive forward the growth agenda.  Next week's meeting presents us with a good opportunity to place a spotlight on the remaining potential to complete the Single Market, including through the development of the digital Single Market.  This is a complex area, embracing everything from intellectual property to consumer rights.  However, it offers real potential, particularly for a small member state interested in new business models and trading more extensively with partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">Concurrently, we want the European Union to support the engine of industry, innovation and job creation, namely, the small and medium enterprise sector.  We must work together to reduce the administrative burdens that hold SMEs back and ensure they have sufficient access to funding.  We also want to come together to tackle unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, and see if programmes and processes are targeted and focused as they should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The Government believes there is an opportunity to prioritise and drive forward those initiatives which best advance Irish interests and fit most closely our national strategies for growth and economic recovery.  We want to see full alignment between what we are doing at national and European levels.  The Cabinet sub-committee on European affairs is advancing this important work, including through examining how the programme for Government dovetails with priorities at EU level.  There are clear overlaps, whether through promoting energy efficiency - achieving green growth is a real target - the digital Single Market or strategies for job creation.  Our post-crisis recovery is being supported by a rebalancing of economic activity towards sustainable, export-led growth.  This must include Irish companies unlocking the full potential of Europe's dynamic market of 500 million consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">The discussion next Monday will not just be about the intergovernmental treaty.  It will also be a discussion about job creation and growth.  We have to combine these two tracks.  The treaty will not bring about recovery.  There has to be a strategy for job creation and growth as part of the European agenda.</p>

          <p eId="para_608">I am glad to resume this debate.  I was the last person to speak on it just before the Christmas break.  I had some very strong things to say that day.  I hoped that when we came back there would be a new year's resolution.  I spoke then about the arrogance of the Government after ten months in office.  Now we are back here after the Christmas recess, and after time for reflection I find nothing but total disrespect for the people on this side of the House and by extension, for the public.  We are seeing Bill after Bill.  The House was misled here about the water services Bill two weeks ago on the Order of Business, although I understand the Taoiseach is examining it.  Now the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 is back before us without any proper consultation.  The water services Bill was guillotined on Committee Stage, which I think set a precedent.  This is the transparency, openness and honesty that we were promised by the people on the Government side of the House when they were on these benches.  It is a total sham, but the people know that now.  They are eagerly waiting for them in the long grass.  They will wait as long as they have to, but by God will they get them.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">We are now discussing this Bill and our Whip, Deputy Murphy, has written to the Taoiseach about the regulatory impact assessment for the Bill, so that we can have an informed debate about it.  The Taoiseach wrote back and said that in an ideal world, an RIA is best completed in tandem with the publication of the Bill.  We do not have an ideal world and we do not have an ideal Minister either.  I said last year that he should be Minister for job creation.  I think he created 45 or 47 jobs in this Bill in one hour before Christmas.  I said he would meet them all at Christmas time in a State car and give them Christmas boxes as some of them were his friends.  There was no frost this year so he could safely drive, and he could even have worked around.  It is a pure mockery of the legislative system to bring this Bill before the House without any impact assessment.  It has been going on in every Bill.  The arrogance of getting into power with such a huge majority has gone to their heads.  They think they can do what they like and disrespect us over here, and a Ceann Comhairle who aids and abets them is unfortunately being biased.</p>

          <p eId="para_617">I am disappointed the Deputy did not get the heckler of the year award last year, but he will get over it.  He got it for a few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">The Government is putting an institution in place to regionalise water services and it is will have an impact assessment afterwards.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will have a consultation period in a couple of weeks, even though the Bill will be passed on Thursday.  What kind of Government is this?  How do we expect the public to have any respect for us if we vote for a pig in a poke and vote for something we do not know?  This might have happened in countries without a democracy, but these Ministers have a huge dose of arrogance and a huge dose of disrespect for the democratic process.  They are bringing Bill after Bill before the House and they are telling us we will discuss it afterwards with the stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">I know the Minister opposite, Deputy Shatter, is a new Minister and I wish him well.  I voted for his Government, in fairness, but I regret it already.  How long has this Bill been lying around in the Department?  Have the senior officials examined it?  Why could they not have the regulatory impact assessment ready with it?  They make excuse after excuse, but it is just not acceptable.  It is not good enough that we are expected to discuss legislation when we have not had proper, decent advice, and a consultation process carried out with the relevant stakeholders.  There are many of them here, such as the Law Library and the Bar Council, and many of them are friends of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">This is a sham and a scam.  It is a far cry from the transparency, openness and good governance that Government Members claimed they would bring.  They have become nothing but lapdogs for the EU.  They are summoned there every week and they will say "yes sir", "how much sir?" and "how many bags full sir?"  They made it worse then when they were found out last week.  The troika believed the Government had a mandate for this.  It has no mandate for many of the Bills it is bringing in here.  It is time the Government respected the other Members in this House and the electorate.  I wish the Minister a safe journey to the Bundesbank tomorrow.  I hope he brings the green jersey.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Mitchell O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_623">I warmly welcome the spirit of the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011.  However, I draw the Minister's attention to section 8 (2) (<i>a</i>), that stipulates that the 11 members of the authority will be appointed by the Minister.  This does not correspond to the make-up of similar regulatory bodies.  For example, the Teaching Council Act 2001 prescribes for approximately 62% of teacher council members.  I ask the Minister to review this section and allow for the incorporation of stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">I am disappointed that no provision was made in the Bill for the establishment of limited liability partnerships similar to those in England, wherein all solicitors in a firm have limited liability.  I recommend that the legislation include a provision requiring the authority to investigate the possibility of providing the legal framework for their creation, taking cognisance of best practice abroad.  This would undoubtedly reduce solicitor cost and client fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">I am particularly interested in the changes proposed in the training and education section.  The Bill allows other bodies to be accredited by the authority to provide the training services currently monopolised by the Law Society and the Honourable Society of King's Inns for solicitors.  This is a most welcome change to current practice.  I cannot help but feel that law students in some regards are currently being exploited.  The number of students sitting the FE1 examinations has risen significantly in recent years.  For example, in 1995 there was one single sitting of FE1 examinations for 251 candidates.  There were two sittings in 2005, one in April and one in October, with 1,499 students sitting exams in April and 1,548 sitting the October exams.  In 2010 these figures dropped to 1,121 students who sat the April examinations and 987 who sat the October examinations.  The examinations are costly, at €110 per exam, and each candidate must sit and pass eight FE1 examinations in total.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">The number of solicitors qualifying does not reflect the number of students who sit the examinations, even accounting for a percentage who may be unsuccessful.  In 2005, 420 qualified as solicitors; in 2010 the number was 725.  However, these numbers do not add up.  One can only conclude, therefore, that a sizeable number of students completing their FE1 examinations cannot acquire an apprenticeship placement.  This is very unfortunate and difficult for the students concerned as FE1 examinations cost a student a total of €880.  No grant or subsidy is provided for them and the qualification gained on completion of the FE1 examination is recognised only by the Law Society.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">In this regard, I welcome the requirement placed on the authority to investigate arrangements to facilitate the minimisation of duplication and consequent expenses incurred by a candidate in the taking of examinations in legal subjects.  The current system is not student friendly.  I look forward to the reports from the authority in this regard and, moreover, action being taken to ameliorate the position.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_343">
          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_628">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill, about which I have spoken to the Minister on a one-to-one basis on several occasions.  To be honest, there is anxiety about it and I do not think it is a fear of change on the part of the profession either in the Law Society or the Bar Council or among their representative members.  It is not an anxiety we can dismiss or leave aside.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">From speaking to the Minister, he is open to suggestions and being constructive.  The legislation has been lying around for 30 years; therefore, it is not being taken up on a whim.  It is certainly not the intention of the Minister to override a profession for the sake of it.  It is welcome that he is being constructive in that the many suggestions being made by members of the Bar Council and the Law Society will be duly considered and examined in a very proactive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">There are fears about independence, which I am confident the Minister will allay as the legislation goes through the Houses.  There are concerns about who will administer the €50 million compensation fund.  The Minister has stated the Law Society will continue to be the arbitrator with regard to the fund as it pays into and administers it.  The fund shows the competence and co-operative responsibility of the profession in dealing with odd cowboy or cowgirl, which there is in every profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">I encourage all solicitors and barristers to make submissions.  People should not rely collectively on the representative groups to make submissions.  Plenty of individuals have good ideas and proposals which they should put forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">With regard to the new body being established, it is important that we continue to have a filtering system which uses the years of expertise and in-depth knowledge of solicitors and barristers.  From speaking with the Minister, I have no doubt that a mechanism will be created to allow for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">Having spoken to a few people in my county, I have a particular concern which I hope the Minister will be able to allay.  It is with regard to the proposal that solicitors may employ barristers.  I know this is qualified by the use of the word "may", but we could end up with a premiership-elite legal system under which the top law firms employed the top barristers.  This would have a knock-on effect as the top barristers would be cherry-picked by the top solicitor firms and those solicitor firms not in a position to compete because of the levels of remuneration or wages offered would end up as part of a two tier system.  I draw a parallel with soccer clubs across the water where the top four or five clubs have the reputation and money to buy the top players.  In this cherry-picking system the other clubs are at a disadvantage.  Perhaps the Minister thinks there is nothing to be worried about, but further down the track a firm such as Arthur Cox would be in a position to employ the top barristers, while smaller firms would not be able to compete at that level.  It would also create a perception, as in advertisements solicitors would be able to state they had such and such a barrister with such and such a reputation and experience which would place them at a comparative advantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">A conversation is taking place among the law fraternity about the fact that it is difficult for young barristers trying to come through the system.  It is a difficult profession in which to be involved.  When conveyancing was at its height, it was a different world, but this is a different time and it is time for change.  This change will bring certain opportunities, but it is important to keep perspective.  The real issue is independence and, as the Competition Authority mentioned, providing the consumer with a voice.  I do not state consumers did not have a voice, but this might have been the case in certain quarters.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_344">
          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</from>
          <p eId="para_635">I welcome the Minister to deal with this very important legislation, the title of which includes the words "legal" and "services".  I commend the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House and his willingness to engage with Members.  Deputy Joe McHugh was correct to state there was anxiety among members of the legal profession, but I know the Minister is willing to engage and listen to all sides of the debate, which is how it should be.  I hope this applies across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">I do not have a vested interest in the legislation, as I am not a member of the legal profession and do not desire to take silk.  I speak as an ordinary Member of the House who wants to see change and reform.  Beginning with this premise, most reasonable people want to see change in the legal profession.  Confidence has been eroded in the legal profession for a variety of reasons one of which is the costs and length of the tribunal.  The practices and procedures of the legal profession have not evolved to the same extent as those in other sections of society.  We have seen a significant increase in the number of complaints against legal practitioners which has been to the detriment of the public and the majority of honest, law-abiding citizens and practitioners.  The legal profession, in the main, carries out great work and is very accessible but there is a desire for change even among those in the profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">I welcome the objectives the Minister has set as the bedrock of this Bill.  It is important, in terms of our legal services and system, that we have confidence in the profession, that consumer interests are at the centre of the legal services market and that we have an open and transparent regulatory process.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">I am open to correction but I am concerned that many people outside the legal profession see it as being elite, out of touch and beyond the reach of many because of the high fees charged.  I hope that perception will be changed as a result of this Bill and that we will restore confidence, restore morale among the practitioners and make essential legal services accessible.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The current model of regulation in the legal profession is an outdated version of self-regulation.  The main lesson we should have learned from the financial crisis in the banking system and from every other systemic problem we have come across is that self-regulation and light touch regulation does not work and is not in the interests of the wider society.  Vested interests cannot and should not be permitted to act as both advocates and regulators of the same group.  It has not worked, does not work and will not work in this case either.  I hope this Bill will end that era of self-regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">I very much welcome the Minister's proposals to establish the legal services regulatory authority.  Despite all of what we are hearing, that body must have regard to protecting and promoting the public interest and the interests of consumers regarding the provision of legal services, and promote competition in the provision of legal services.  That is a welcome move which will assist in re-establishing confidence in the legal profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">We must examine the issues of access and outdated practices, which have not evolved to the same extent as in other sections of society.  Restrictive practices which prevent direct access to barristers, force clients to instruct the number a barristers and require clients to pay junior counsel two thirds of what the senior counsel is paid do not operate in the interests of justice but in the vested interest of the professions.  I welcome the proposals in the Bill to do away with restrictive practices and make it easier for people to access legal services.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The changes are in the interest of consumers but they are also in the wider interest of the profession.  Abolishing these practices has support among lawyers.  I note that a former Chief Justice, Mr. Ronan Keane, has expressed support for some of these changes.  However, as Deputy McHugh stated, concerns have been expressed about the Bill by members of the profession.  I have been contacted about it also.  Many solicitors and a number of barristers have contacted me to express concerns about some elements of the Bill.  They are concerned that the proposals will vest too much regulatory power in the Minister and that the independence of the legal practitioners will be undermined.  We must pay close attention to those concerns.  We must ensure we do not undermine the privileged lawyer-client relationship which is fundamental to our system of justice and to the fairness inherent in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Equally, we must distinguish between the independence of the lawyer-client relationship and who is responsible for regulation.  Government is elected by the people, despite Deputy McGrath's utterances, to implement legislation, which includes establishing mechanisms for regulation across the legal, financial, health and other sectors.  While it is expected that certain interests will be opposed to the proposed changes in regulation, that does not make them wrong.  Regulation is essential but it must operate in the wider public interest, and I am sure the Minister agrees with that principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">The Bill proposes fundamental changes to our legal services.  Essentially, it proposes to establish a new legal order and do away with a system that has been in place for a long time.  The reasons that is necessary are, in many cases, because of erosion of public confidence but also because of an increased number of complaints, the difficulties faced by many lawyers practising in small country offices, and to fulfil requirements under the EU-IMF deal which is contained in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">It is important that the new system being proposed has the full confidence of the public, Members of this House and the legal profession who will work every day in that system.  It is important also that we proceed carefully with this Bill and that the Minister and the Government continue to engage not just with vested interests but also with those who express deeply held and legitimate concerns.  We must work to determine if the concerns can be addressed in this legislation and that it can, if necessary, incorporate some changes at a later date.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">We must not deviate from the intent of ending self-regulation and restrictive practices which do not operate in the interest of the consumers of legal services.  I commend the Minister on his approach and hope he will continue to listen.</p>

        <speech by="#BarryCowen" eId="spk_345">
          <from>Deputy Barry Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_647">Reducing costs and enhancing transparency are important and welcome reforms.  However, the creation of additional quangos that may infringe upon the independence of the legal system is a dangerous development.  An ever more complicated complaints system when a ready-made office, that being the legal services Ombudsman, already exists on the books to deal easily with complaints adds another unnecessary bureaucratic layer.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Fianna Fáil welcomes significant parts of the Bill including those that introduce greater transparency and will make it easier for young people to qualify as either barristers or solicitors, thus ending the monopoly the Law Society of Ireland and the King's Inns have in the training of both branches of their profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">The introduction of greater transparency is a welcome move that will allow free information on costs that should help reduce costs and allow consumers to gauge value for money.  However, there is a number of problems with these reforms and a series of measures are needed to strengthen these provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The proposed Bill also gives rise to a number of areas of concern which yet again reveal that the Fine Gael-Labour coalition is performing more U-turns on its pre-election promises.  This is particularly evident in the proposal by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to establish two new quangos entitled the legal services regulatory authority and the legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal.  That threatens competition and access for people to high quality legal services.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Fine Gael and Labour came to power promising they would cull quangos.  Fine Gael pledged to abolish 145 quangos in its document, Reinventing Government.  The programme for Government committed to reducing the number of State bodies.  Notwithstanding that commitment, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, is proposing to establish two new quangos.  First, the legal services regulatory authority will be required to regulate the entire legal profession.  Such a quango will be both large and costly.  To carry out the functions of the Law Society and Bar Council it must be heavily staffed.  We should make no mistake that this quango will cost the State money.  The Minister has indicated that it will be paid for by the legal professions.  The experience of other quangos is that, ultimately, the cost will be passed on to the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Fine Gael and Labour are in denial and are misleading people by saying this quango will not cost the taxpayer money.  It would be more appropriate if the Bar Council and the law society would carry out their regulatory functions and be supervised by an independent statutory authority.  That would be less costly and more efficient.  It is a system that is used in the United Kingdom and in other jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The second quango, the legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal, is a quasi-judicial body which will preside over alleged cases of misconduct referred to it by the legal services regulatory authority.  Cases are brought to the tribunal having been referred to it by the complaints committee of the authority.  Effectively, the tribunal and the authority complaints committee will replace the existing internal disciplinary procedures, namely, the Barristers' Professional Conduct Tribunal, the Professional Conduct Appeals Board and the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal.  The creation of the tribunal also renders obsolete the Legal Services Ombudsman Act 2009, which this party introduced, and having a single statutory independent body to deal with complaints.  The Fianna Fáil Bill was similar to the UK model, which has been rejected by the Government in creating this legal services authority rather than an oversight body, as is the case in the UK.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_659">-  these bondholders are anonymous speculators, many of whom bought Anglo Irish Bank bonds at between 50% and 80% discount and who stand to make huge profits if they are paid full face value for the bonds;</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_662">-  the Government plans to raise up to €1,200 million per year by 2015 through household and water taxes, deepening the impoverishment of ordinary people – and especially the unemployed and low paid; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_663">-  while payments to un-named bondholders are prioritised, the Government plans to cut thousands of jobs in the health service, to close hundreds of nursing home beds, to cut 3.5% from education spending over the next three years, and to cut €475 million from welfare spending this year; and</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_667">- shall not pay the promissory notes for the Anglo Irish Bank/INBS debt on 31 March, 2012 and shall not make any such payments in the future."</p>
          <p eId="para_668">I wish to share time with Deputies Collins, Healy, Mattie McGrath, Pringle and Donnelly.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">I have moved this motion on behalf of the United Left Alliance and members of the Technical Group who support it.  We are discussing this motion against the backdrop of the parents, students and teachers who had to take to the streets in their thousands last week against the cuts to DEIS schools; in the context of the almost 100 guidance counsellors who packed the Visitors' Gallery last week in opposition to the very short-term lunacy of the cutbacks in career guidance counselling at second level; against the backdrop of the €800 million in health cuts on top of a system already creaking under 12,000 health service job losses; and against the butchering of social welfare that has seen so many people suffering severe austerity every day.  We have to discuss these payments against the backdrop of recent studies and surveys which revealed that half of families in this country are struggling to meet their ordinary household bills.  Into that foray the Government is imposing a new household tax, a tax that will see pensioners and people in receipt of social welfare pay the same amount as a millionaire.  This is a gateway tax, a new tax, which is not progressive; it does not deal with property or wealth but is a regressive tax on people's homes, the roof over their heads, which is hardly an asset and in many senses is a liability.  It will see householders pay more than €1,000 per annum by 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">We have all this hardship and pain and for what?  The answer the Government gives us is that it needs the money and we are in an economic crisis.  There is no doubt that we are.  The key questions that must be asked are why is that the case and how we will we get out of it.  Ordinary people everywhere tell us it is galling that as this hardship and pain is imposed on them, we are preparing to hand over €1.25 billion, eight times the amount of the annual household tax, to unsecured Anglo Irish Bank bondholders.  We are preparing to hand over €3.1 billion, more than the entire primary school education budget for the country, in promissory notes on foot of the Anglo Irish Bank situation at the end of March.  These are moneys which were not part of any agreement and which will be paid over by a Government, whose parties stood before this electorate and promised they would share the burden and deal with the bondholders.  Shame on the Minister of State and his colleagues in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">I am glad at least this time around we have an opportunity to discuss the issues in regard to this tranche of our money that is to be handed over, unlike on the last occasion when the Government would not agree to change the Order of Business and allow the matter to be discussed.  We lay down a challenge to every Deputy; they all have an opportunity to have their say and put forward their position on this matter.  They must ask themselves, individually and collectively, will the payments of €1.25 billion and €3.1 billion to Anglo Irish Bank help or hinder us?  We do not have to be geniuses or fortune tellers to know the answer to that question.  It will be more of the same that has led to the problems we have now.  We can categorically state that the payment of these moneys will have cataclysmic consequences for ordinary people in Ireland unless a halt is called and the demands of the motion are implemented, namely, that the Anglo Irish Bank moneys would not be paid and that the promissory notes payments would be suspended.  We should remember this is not a payment of €3.1 billion this year, it is €3.1 billion for the next ten years and further billions for the next ten years after that.  This is economics of the mad house - the payment of €30.6 billion in capital, which is 26% of our GDP.  It is lunacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, said that if we do not pay this it would be like setting off a bomb, but a bomb for who?  We very much agree with a community activist, Mr. John Bissett, who pointed out that this Government is constantly setting off bombs in the community, the impact of which is being felt by the poor and those on lower and middle incomes, the unemployed and pensioners.  That is having much more devastating consequences than any bomb would have in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">We acknowledge that the motion coincides with the launch of the Debt Justice Action, a coalition of NGOs, unions, solidarity groups and eminent individuals who are dedicated to popularising the arguments against the continued madness of these payments to Anglo Irish Bank.  Likewise, a large number of high profile individuals and academics signed a letter last Saturday advocating that the Government abandon its course of austerity and bailouts.  We want the Government to start listening to the groundswell and emerging counter consensus, of which the ULA is very happy to be a part, with regard to the disaster the Government has stood over in the same way as did its predecessors.  We need to take on board the lessons of what happened in Latin America and other countries, namely, that these policies will result in ruin if we continue to pay illegal debts, a solution which is completely and utterly unworkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">We must ask what will happen if we do not pay this money?  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, said the roof will fall on.  Yet, in reality, he is saying that the Irish Government is a willing lap dog of the ECB, which is demanding that we pay a debt that is not ours in order to protect European banks.  What will happen if we do not pay this money?  The first answer commonly cited is that the ECB would cut off funding to our pillar banks.  Let us examine that.  That is not plausible as the pillar banks are being maintained to avoid contagion and it is clear that such a measure would provoke contagion if the ECB collapsed funding in that regard.  Why would it take that action when it has been trying to avoid it since 2008?  We are also told the measure would result in a loss of investor confidence.  With Government bonds now rated as junk and given that we are not in the international market, that risk is not of any consequence.  It would probably help us out given that we are being downgraded even when we are paying all the bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">The other threat is that there would be retaliation by the troika.  The promissory notes are not a condition of the bailout and would not directly affect the loan agreements.  We would prefer to take that risk, which we believe is minimal, rather than accept the hard fact that unless the Government changes course and ceases paying over these moneys, we have the certainty that the pain and hardship being inflicted on ordinary people will continue.  What is the reward for the bailout and austerity?  Absolutely nothing.  We have worse growth rates and debt levels than those predicted and unrelenting hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">The opportunity is being put before Members of the House tomorrow night to say "enough is enough".  We have a chance to reverse this lunacy and make a stand for the betterment of all our citizens and to be a beacon for our colleagues throughout Europe.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_348">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_677">The €1.25 billion to be paid to financial speculators is nearly equal to the total amount being cut from the health and social protection budgets.  In fact, there will be €25 million left over for the Minister, Deputy Quinn, in his review of the cuts in DEIS schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">This Government is devastating our public health system which is already in crisis and people will die as a consequence.  Instead of protecting the most vulnerable, they have been targeted.  The most vulnerable children will be hit by DEIS cuts and at the same time we have this amoral lunacy to be repeated again in June when another €1 billion will be handed over to the former Anglo Irish Bank.  No Government in its right mind would do that without good reasons.  Leaving aside the fear of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, that the troika will bomb Dublin if we do not behave, what are the good reasons?   First, it is claimed that Irish banks will find it more difficult to borrow.  Irish banks have not been able to borrow, unless from the ECB and the Central Bank, since 2008.  The same applies to the argument about European banks.  Interbank lending in the EU is frozen.  It makes no difference whatsoever if this bond is not paid.  It might affect the State's ability to borrow, but the State cannot borrow in the bond market.  That is why we had the troika bailout.  It will not affect our ability to go to the bond market in 2013 because there is not a snowball's hope in hell of re-entering the bond market next year.  A second bailout is inevitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">What does Deputy Varadkar's bomb consist of?  Is it a threat by the people who lend the State or the banks money, namely the troika?  If the troika, or the ECB, pulls the plug the result will be a default, the very thing the whole set-up is supposed to avoid.  The bomb would not only go off in Dublin.  It would explode in Frankfurt, Paris and other places across Europe and in the international markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">There is, of course, a risk in standing up to the bullying of the troika and the ECB, but look at the risk we are taking now.  The Government is destroying our domestic economy with austerity.  It is condemning thousands of people to mass unemployment and emigration, destroying our public services and putting at risk whatever progress we have made towards becoming economically viable with, at least, the minimum standards of a civilised modern society, and for what?  It is sticking to a programme that cannot work and will not work.  The Government knows that, I know it, the IMF knows it and Standard &amp; Poor's knows it.  We should call a halt to this madness and not pay this bond.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">I appeal to Labour Party Members, who pretend to protect the most vulnerable, to come into the Chamber and support the motion.  I ask them not to propose an amendment but to vote for the motion and support the people of this nation against the austerity cuts that have been implemented over the last four years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_349">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_682">More and more people are coming to the view that austerity is not working.  Even those who support the economic system we operate in are coming to that view and are expressing it forcefully.  Before we came into the Chamber this evening the IMF - that bastion of the capitalist system - said there are very serious dangers in forcing countries to pay down debt too quickly.  It also said there are serious dangers in prolonging the recession for decades.  Across the board, voices are saying austerity is not working and other avenues, such as stimulating the economy, are important.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">Money is flowing out of the country on a daily, indeed hourly, basis and the people are being ripped off.  This is not something new.  Throughout history we have had situations like this.  This issue was faced by Michael Davitt when he founded the Irish National Land League and opposed rack-renting landlords.  It was also faced by James Connolly, who wrote about it in <i>The Re-Conquest of Ireland</i>.  In that pamphlet he pointed out that the Irish rich were collaborating with international financiers and others to support the ripping off of the Irish people.  Even Éamon de Valera, when in government, found himself in the same position in relation to annuities.  The country is being bled dry and we are faced with the same rip-off today as were those people throughout the years.  We need leaders to stand up for the country and for its people.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">The amount of money being taken out of the economy and out of the country is horrendous.  Tomorrow, another €1.25 billion will be paid to unsecured speculators and Anglo Irish Bank bondholders, many of whom bought the bonds at knockdown prices and will make huge profits on that repayment.  As much of half the repayment will be profit for these bondholders and speculators.  The €3.1 billion to be paid in March of this year and for ten years and further until 2031 will amount to a minimum of about €47 billion.  However, when everything is taken into account the actual amount will be in the region of €85 billion.  These huge sums of money are being taken out of the Irish economy and are forcing austerity on Irish workers and families, particularly middle income and poor families while, as James Connolly said, the super-rich get away scot free and pay little or no tax - certainly not their fair share - and pay no wealth tax whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The single biggest rise in Government spending between 2008 and 2010 was an increase from €2 billion to €4.9 billion in debt interest repayments.  This figure will rise further, to €6.8 billion this year and to €10 billion in succeeding years.  We believe money borrowed to cover the debts of private banks should not be paid.  A considerable portion of the debt interest payment arises from this source, and this is interest alone.  Additional capital repayments will make debt servicing a crushing burden for decades to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">With regard to the promissory note liabilities undertaken by the State in relation to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, TASC, the progressive research group, has this to say:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_687">If we assume a fairly benign 4.7% interest rate on Government borrowings after the country has exited the external financial assistance programme, we can estimate that the total cost of these notes between 2011 and 2031, including interest on the borrowing, will be €85 billion.  Under this scenario, the annual cost would peak at over €5.3 billion in 2023 and there will be continuing debt interest costs on payments beyond 2031.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">The transfer of this money out of the country and the payment of bondholders and speculators is creating huge austerity and a spiral of recession.  Earlier tonight, the IMF again downgraded growth forecasts for the coming year.  Irish households, middle-income and low-income families, low-paid workers and people on social welfare payments are paying through the nose for this recession, which they had absolutely no hand, act or part in creating.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">Not alone must we stop this repayment of bonds, we must also ensure that the super-wealthy Irish, who own assets of €220 billion, are made to pay their fair share of taxation on those assets.  We must have a wealth tax to support the Irish economy and Irish workers and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">I second the motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_350">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_691">I too am glad to speak to this motion.  I compliment our colleagues in the United Left Alliance for putting forward this extensive and important motion at this vital time in our country's history.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, is here to debate the motion.  He is a reasonable man and is working very hard on his brief.  This morning, I listened to a debate between him and Deputy Stephen Donnelly on the "Today with Pat Kenny" radio show.  From his comments, I could tell he understands this problem as much as the rest of us do.  He said we are tied into an agreement made by the previous Government.  I voted against that agreement even though I was an <i>ex officio</i> member of that Government.  I knew it would be impossible for a country four times the size of Ireland to repay that kind of money.  Any half-baked individual would have known that.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">It was the last Government that insisted on the EU-IMF troika being brought in.  I met representatives of the troika last week.  As Deputy Healy mentioned, they downgraded Ireland's growth rates this week.  When we met them, they were very bullish about growth rates.  Some of my colleagues pointed out there was not a hope of those rates being achieved.  It is nice for them to meet ordinary elected representatives sometimes.  They should not meet Ministers and Government officials all the time.  The same officials were there the night the bank guarantee was agreed.  The same Professor Honohan is still the main man representing us out there in a voting capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">Why are the bad decisions that were made by the last Government being continued by this Government?  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, like the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and all the others, made promises to the Irish people, who were aghast about what was happening.  The people had a total distrust of the previous Government.  They were outraged by what that Government was doing in their name.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">I will admit that I voted in favour of the bank guarantee.  The life was frightened out of me.  The big line that was peddled was that if we did not do it, the credit unions would go bust because at least 50% of them had invested the money of ordinary local people in Anglo Irish Bank.  I could not find out from the last Government how many credit unions, if any, would have been affected in that way.  Nobody can find that out from this Government either.  I have no doubt that one or two of them got carried away in the absence of sensible directors and invested money in Anglo Irish Bank.  The other banks followed them.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">It is a disgrace to visit this vista on the Irish people.  It was a bigger disgrace to learn when we met the troika last week that this Government, like its predecessor, had led it to believe it had a mandate for this action.  The last Government's mandate was fairly tired and spun out by the end.  The people had lost trust in a depleted Government.  I was a proud member of the main party in that Government for many years.  I was born into it.  I was disgusted.  I was forced to leave it.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">Many good people around the country are still angry and annoyed about the way they were sold out.  What did our forefathers, including the people of 1916, James Connolly and others, fight for?  Did they fight to be betrayed by bankers, by some politicians and by the regulators?  We had regulators, but they were not doing their jobs.  They got paid and they got pensions.  They got rewarded.  They are probably in other jobs now as well.  Everybody knows it was a complete outrage.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">Those who voted for this Government <i>en masse</i> are sorry now.  What are they getting?  The Tánaiste asked us a week ago to wear the green jersey.  His Cabinet colleagues have taken the jerseys the last lads used to wear.  They got them tailored so they fit nicely.  They are pursuing the exact same policies even though they promised the people that things would be totally different.  How do they think the people feel?  We saw the results Fine Gael achieved in the presidential election and the Dublin West by-election.  The people are horrified.  They are turning out in great numbers at all kinds of public meetings throughout the country to voice their anger about austerity measures.  They voted for the opposite.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">I would like to refer to what the troika is being led to believe on a continuous basis by the Ministers and the over-paid officials who meet them.  Officials in Germany and elsewhere in the EU are aghast and horrified when they hear about the wages our officials get, the hotels they stay in and the first-class flights they take.  We have to get real.  We have to stand up and wear the green jersey, rather than decimating what is left of our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">The mantra of the Labour Party is that needy and vulnerable people should be supported.  Not many Labour Party Deputies are present this evening.  When they were elected, they said they would save community employment schemes, DEIS schools, small schools, school transport, hospitals and nursing homes.  The fear among the people is frightening.  Since the administration of the medical card scheme was centralised in Dublin, nobody can get a medical card.  It is disgraceful that so many files are being lost.  Sick and vulnerable people are having to go through all kinds of anguish to shore up Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide.  Those banks should be written off this earth.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, spoke about a "bomb" recently.  We have had bombings in Dublin.  I was in Dublin the day a bomb exploded.  It was an outrageous word to use.  The bombs will backfire on him.  We did not get involved in world wars.  We stayed out of them.  It is awful to threaten people in such a way.  The bomb will backfire on the Deputies opposite.  We are being found out by other countries as well.  Greece is getting great freedom because it is refusing to pay.  The troika is telling us we are not like Greece.  It thinks we are great because we are compliant.  We are getting a tap on the shoulder for doing our best.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">The troika was told that this Government has a mandate, but it knows different now.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, asked me last week how I got on with the troika.  He used a condescending voice to suggest I had no business talking to the troika.  I told the Minister he will know how we got on the next time he meets the troika.  We told the troika a few truths.  I am glad that a sizeable group of Independent Deputies were given a chance to meet the troika.  I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for fighting to ensure that meeting took place.  We will meet the troika again.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">I suggest the troika might have more respect for us than it had for the previous Government and this Government.  The troika has been led astray by the lies of both Governments.  It is not true to say we can pay this.  We cannot pay it.  We should not pay another penny.  I am sure the Minister for Finance has already signed the cheque for the €1.2 billion that will be given to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide tomorrow.  It is a waste of money.  It is a shame on the nation that it is happening.  A bigger scandal is that a further €3.1 billion will be paid next month arising from promissory notes.  Money is being shredded.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">Paper trails of money were created to bail out people who lied to the then Minister for Finance, God rest him.  They lied through their teeth to everybody at the time.  They are still lying to the people.  The banks - even the pillar banks - are not lending a bob to anybody.  They are codding the people who are pumping money into them.  When will we learn?  When will the Government realise the futility of what it is doing?  We need to stand with the people.  The people will stand behind us.  The people need to be given a choice.  There needs to be a real referendum.  The Government received a false mandate last year because it was given on the basis of false promises.  I beg the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to raise his voice.  Government backbenchers should try to bring a small bit of common sense to this matter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_351">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle</from>
          <p eId="para_705">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion, which has been proposed by the United Left Alliance and is being supported by Independent members of the Technical Group.  I would like to start with a quotation:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_706">What legal or moral compulsion is on Ireland, however, to honour in full debt incurred by Irish banks when there was no State involvement in the arrangements?  These loans were entered into freely by willing lenders and borrowers with absolutely no State participation.  The interest rate charged represented the risk at the time and there never was a State liability.  It is obscene that liability for these loans is now being transferred to the Irish taxpayer, in many respects to the poorest of the Irish taxpayers...  What a disaster and an obscenity...  The position has now become indefensible that the Irish taxpayer, even the poorest taxpayers, should be required to underpin the speculation of hedge fund investors.  There must be transparent, open, negotiated burden sharing of bank debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">Those words were spoken in this Chamber in December 2010 not by a member of the Technical Group, but by the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  What has happened since then?  The Minister, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have morphed into Fianna Fáil since 25 February 2011.  They are continuing the policies that had been adopted and were being pursued by Fianna Fáil prior to last year's election.  We will see the outworking of those policies tomorrow when €1.25 billion is paid to the same hedge fund investors to whom the Minister referred in December 2010.  It is even more galling that the bond which is being repaid was trading last year at a 60% discount.  If the Government had gone into the market at that stage to buy them back, at least something laudable and positive would have been done about them.  Instead, the Government sat back and waited and is now preparing to hand this money over to speculators who were betting, in the truest sense of the word, and are about to win big time tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">To add insult to injury, the Government intends to make a repayment of €3.1 billion arising from promissory notes in March.  It has already been mentioned that €47 billion will be paid in that way by 2031.  When the interest that will be paid on this is factored in, it is possible that up to €85 billion will be paid in the years ahead.  When the money paid in this way goes into the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan will press the "delete" button on his computer and that will be the end of that.  The funds in question could be invested in the Irish economy in a way that would encourage job creation.  If they were used as a stimulus, it would benefit everybody and put our people back to work.  Just one year's payment arising from these promissory notes would pay for the provision of fibre broadband in nearly every house in the country.  It would give every family in the country the ability to develop and grow.  It would enable every business in the country to make the best use of the Internet and create jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">Every school should encourage students to be the best they can be so that we can build a knowledge economy for the future and look after the safety of everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">Instead, the Government will hand it into the Central Bank and watch it disappear and continue to pay through the nose to repay that money.  We are facing into austerity forever.  The Taoiseach will go to Brussels next week and sign up to a treaty that will put us into permanent austerity, a treaty that will hand over control of the Irish economy to the finance committee of the Bundestag.  It is a treaty that will ensure we have to balance our budgets every single year and put us in permanent austerity.  Already this year, we will see the devastation of rural schools, the devastation of DEIS schools, the removal of guidance counsellors from our secondary schools.  We will see closure of nursing home beds in large numbers across the country, the destruction of our hospital services, including in Letterkenny General Hospital, forcing the most efficient hospital in the country to take further cuts.  This is all in the name of paying back bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank, the most corrupt and defunct bank ever in the history of the world.  We are doing this because the IMF, the ECB and the so-called troika, are telling us that we have to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">Yet, the Government will continue to attack low and middle income earners, forcing them to pay the household charge, septic tank charges and water charges over the coming years.  In a few years, people will pay on average €1,300 per year, between water charges and property taxes, all so that the Government can pay back €85 billion over the next 20 years.  It is a crying shame.  The Government should go to Europe and to the troika and say we will not do this.  At the very least, it should invoke the clause to delay the repayment of the promissory notes.  However, it will not do this; instead it will continue to try to be the best boys in the class, continue to get the pat on the head from the troika when it visits every three months and forget about the Irish people and force us into permanent austerity and into permanent emigration and oversee the destruction of services.  This is a shame on this Government.  It should don the green jersey, stand up for the Irish people and not kowtow to the troika and to the defunct Anglo Irish Bank.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#StephenDonnelly" eId="spk_352">
          <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</from>
          <p eId="para_712">The motion before the House calls on the Government not to pay tomorrow the Anglo Irish Bank bond of €1.25 billion and not to pay the promissory note of €3.1 billion at the end of March.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">I will deal briefly with the issue of the bondholders.  We all know that this €1.25 billion will go to anonymous holders of Anglo Irish Bank bonds, many of whom are speculators and who are set to make a probable hundreds of millions of euro in windfall profits tomorrow.  They may have bought at 50% discount or less.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">We know it is anonymous because I submitted questions to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, last week, asking if he knew their identities and if not, what steps had he taken to find out who they are.  We should at least know to whom we are paying this money.  His reply to my question stated that he did not know who they were and that IBRC had not tried to find out.  This is not acceptable, particularly when the Minister, as an opposition spokesperson, informed the then Minister, Mr. Brian Lenihan, of the two websites which contained this information as to the identities of the bondholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">I accept that the Government does not wish to pay this money, as do none of us.  The Government is making a judgment call and deciding that on balance this is the lesser of two evils.  There is a link to the promissory notes.  The Government has decided to pay and to keep the ECB happy and therefore it hopes to get a better deal on the promissory notes.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">If we can secure a massive write-down in the promissory notes, then I would accept that paying the bond tomorrow is probably the lesser of two evils and that it is probably worth it.  My concern is that the Minister will say that we still have to pay all the money and on time but we can now borrow the money at a lower rate of interest.  That would not be worth it.  I advise that the Government should pause the payment of the bond, find out who are the owners of these bonds and take a few lessons from Greece but not as regards the state of its economy.  The Minister can say that nobody wants Greece here but I do not want us to be in that situation either.  However, what we could learn from Greece is that to play hardball and engage in brinksmanship in these negotiations does appear to pay dividends.  So far, Ireland has had very little in terms of restructuring of interest rates and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">However, the opportunity for major debt restructuring is nearly gone.  The Fianna Fáil Government paid out a vast amount of this money to the unguaranteed bondholders and unfortunately, the current Government paid out a whole lot more last year and it will pay €1.25 billion tomorrow and there will be very little left.  Accepting this is the reality, the opportunity moves to the promissory notes.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The promissory notes are a technical instrument.  The Central Bank of Ireland created €70 billion out of nothing.  It does what central banks can do, which is, it made up money.  It deposited tens of billions of euro into an Anglo Irish Bank reserve account which the Central Bank held and which it regarded as a capitalisation.  What the Irish banks have been doing over the past year is paying that money back to the Central Bank and it has been making that money disappear.  To put this in context, between February and December of last year, the Central Bank was repaid €26 billion.  This is more than the entire recapitalisation from the BlackRock stress test.  If one follows the money, the Irish people borrowed all the money for the recapitalisation last year, we put it into the banking system which gave it to the Central Bank, and the Central Bank made it disappear.  The Irish people were left with a debt of €26 billion which they are borrowing at a very high interest rate.  That is what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">The Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, the former Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, currently owes the Central Bank a total of €42 billion in emergency liquidity assistance.  In March, we will pay €3.1 billion, mainly to IBRC, which will hand that money directly to the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan and he will tear up the cheque.  We will borrow it and pay interest on it and then it will increase our national debt and then the money will be torn up.  We are sucking €3.1 billion, plus interest, out of the system.  At reasonable market assumptions, €31 billion will cost us about €48 billion to borrow, in current cash terms.  This is a vast amount of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">The best possible outcome would be to get agreement that the Central Bank can say it invented the money and the €44 billion is gone.  I am not saying the Government could negotiate this in the next few weeks but the best case would be for the Governor of the Central Bank to say he accepts €44 billion as a write-down that the bank is  adjusting its own balance sheet and the Central Bank is now fully capitalised as a central bank.  That can happen and if we controlled our own currency we would be doing something like that.  This is what the Fed is doing and what the Bank of England is doing.  If we were to do this, not only would we not have to pay the €31 billion, for which we are borrowing €48 billion, we could pull a great deal of our money back out of IBRC.  Not including the promissory notes, the IBRC's assets exceed its liabilities to everybody except the Central Bank, by about €12 billion.  IBRC could use its real assets, pay back everybody and still have €12 billion in assets, which the State could take back.  We would save ourselves the €48 billion we need to borrow the €38 billion, plus €12 billion from IBRC.  Just doing that would write down future general government debt by about €60 billion.  This would get us very close to being able to exit an IMF mission.  We cannot over-emphasise the potential opportunity which the promissory notes and the emergency liquidity assistance, the money the Central Bank printed and put into our banking system, is worth.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">The next best case, which is another realistic negotiating option for this Government, is for the Irish Central Bank to say that €44 billion is still owed from the €70 billion but we will not talk about it for ten years.  For the monetary purists in the ECB, there would be an increase in the monetary supply and it will be decreased again, albeit in ten years.  We would not borrow the €48 billion we need now and inflation would do what it does, bringing down the total amount owed by 2.5% or 3.5% per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">What I do not see as acceptable is a Government position that will still see the €31 billion owed, with Mr. Patrick Honohan tearing up all those cheques, and the money borrowed from the European Stability Mechanism or elsewhere at a low interest rate.  That would not be enough.  I urge the Government to be very bold with the opportunity that the emergency liquidity assistance from our Central Bank and these promissory notes give us.</p>

          <p eId="para_736">During the first years of this century, Ireland lost its way.  Many people in positions of responsibility decided to take a walk on the wild side.  Reckless borrowing by developers, crazy lending by bankers and lax to non-existent supervision by regulators all contributed to the toxic brew.  It was party time.  The excesses of the crazy years were celebrated by the media and cheered on by Ministers.  When the German Ambassador questioned Irish payscales he was lambasted in the media.  When the European Commission raised concerns about Irish Government spending, the former Minister of Finance, Charlie McCreevy, responded in his usual dismissive, know-all way by saying "when we have it, we spend it".  As the property bubble accelerated out of control, a crash was inevitable.  That crash has caused immense damage to the country and real suffering and hardship to many thousands of people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_739">We are making real progress on returning this country to growth.  The Government is sorting out the mess in a calm, considered way and we are not indulging in theatrics or dramatic gestures.  Our ambitions and targets are clear and straightforward.  We want to bring a better balance into Government finances and we continue to negotiate for more favourable terms from our external funding partners. We are keeping a focus on restoring growth and encouraging job creation.  We are engaged in a major programme of reform and change, all with the intention of restoring the economy to an even keel and the country to a sustainable development path.  Our primary objective is the creation of jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">The initial response of the previous Government to the banking crisis in September 2008 was to provide a full unconditional guarantee for bank debt of the covered institutions.  In effect, the Government guaranteed approximately €375 billion of private bank debt and transferred, in that single decision, the liability for private bank debt to the taxpayers of the State.  Subsequent to the provision of the guarantee, decisions taken by the Government in regard to the banking sector were clearly driven by the need to ensure that there was no possibility of a "call" on the guarantee.  Effectively, a firm policy was established that no bank or financial institution in the State would be allowed to fail.  This policy was underwritten by a guarantee provided by the State.  Decisions to capitalise the banks, to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Nationwide Building Society, INBS, and the Educational Building Society, EBS, all flow directly from and reflect the underlying need to prevent, at all costs, a call on the guarantee.  Further, the exposure of the State both in terms of direct and indirect support for the banking system was a major factor in the necessity for the EU and IMF bailout.  It goes without saying that the collapse of the banking sector has been at the heart of Ireland's economic difficulties.  In repairing the banking system, the overarching challenge for the current Government has been to restructure the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">Significant progress has been achieved in recent months.  We have formed the pillar banks, merging EBS with AIB, and combining Anglo Irish Bank with the INBS to form the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, a bank that has no role to play in the future of the Irish banking landscape.  We have recapitalised the banking sector and strengthened the governance framework of the banks.  At this stage, it is fair to say there is a growing consensus that the recapitalisation decision established by the Government in March 2011 is succeeding.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">In terms of boosting resilience, a final €24 billion recapitalisation of the banking sector took place following the prudential capital assessment review, PCAR, process and earlier steps taken by the State during 2009 and 2010.  The PCAR process is regarded as robust and comprehensive, a point underlined by the outcome of the European banking authority stress tests announced recently.  With the additional PCAR capital, Irish banks are now among the best capitalised banks anywhere in the world.  It is worth highlighting that approximately one third of this capital injection was sourced from the private sector through burden sharing with subordinated bondholders in the various banks, anticipated asset sales and the injection of private capital into one major bank.  The contribution of the private sector is larger than originally envisaged and I view this as a clear vote of confidence in the Irish banking system and the future of the Irish economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">Since 2008, many Irish businesses and individuals have taken money out of Irish banks and other Irish financial institutions, and now is the time to bring that money back.  The banks, too, have a big job to do in reassuring their customers and growing their deposit base, and we have seen positive deposit flows for the Irish banks in the last quarter of 2011, a very positive development.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">At the same time, the programme of asset deleveraging is well under way.  Combined, the two pillar banks sold €15 billion of assets at significantly better prices than anticipated in the PCAR and prudential liquidity assessment review, PLAR, 2011 exercise.  As it is sometimes overlooked, I want to stress that more than 80% of the assets to be disposed of by the Irish banking system by the end of 2013 are located outside of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">The merger of Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society into IBRC has taken place, the disposal of deposit books has been completed and the work-out of the remaining loan books is progressing.  All of these measures are helping to continue the process of rebuilding international investor confidence in the Irish banking sector and we are confident in and committed to the bank restructuring plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The motion from the Opposition asks the House to agree that the Government shall not make the IBRC bond payment due on 25 January 2012, that the Government make no further payments to IBRC bondholders and that the payment on the promissory note of €3.06 billion should not be made.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_750">There are a number of distinct issues in this motion, including the promissory notes, payment to unguaranteed senior bondholders and reductions in Government spending.  The promissory notes were a mechanism of providing capital to the former Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society institutions without having to pay the cash up front.  The previous Government effectively issued an IOU in the form of a promissory note.  As it stands, the State has a debt to these institutions and it also has an associated interest charge.  This interest charge was set by reference to Government yields at the date of issue.  As currently structured, the total cost of the promissory notes out to 2031 is approximately €47.8 billion.  The reality for the Government at that time was that having committed to guarantee the bank's debts unconditionally, it had no option but to provide capital to those distressed institutions and to commit to maintaining the institutions as going concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">To do otherwise, in the circumstances of the guarantee, would be to create a situation of default, possibly leading to insolvency of the institutions and a call on the State guarantee.  Such a situation was unthinkable in terms of the implications for the State.  The promissory notes provided a technical mechanism for providing the capital benefit without the necessity to put the cash upfront.  If we consider the impact of unilaterally withdrawing the promissory notes from the institutions at this time <i>, </i>the implications are similar - the institutions would be insolvent.  Simply, if one removes €30.6 billion as an asset from the balance sheet of an institution, one will have to fill it from some other source or the institution will fail.  This will require payment of all amounts due under all contracts, even the guaranteed ones.  Therefore, the State may have to pay  a large amount of cash.  </p>
          <p eId="para_752">A further impact of being insolvent would mean the Central Bank of Ireland and the ECB would no longer fund the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and that funding of approximately €40 billion would have to be unwound.  The sum of €40 billion is predominantly State backed.  Again, given the level of support provided by the ECB for both the IBRC and the other Irish banks, a failure to pay the ECB could have a dramatic impact, as it would create a doubt about the future of the €110 billion being made available by the ECB and the Central Bank of Ireland to Irish banks at a low interest rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">It would be unwise to disregard market sentiment in a situation where a sovereign state reneges on its obligations or perceived obligations.  The potential implications for the State's ability to re-enter the markets and the cost of borrowing for State bodies such as the ESB and Bord Gáis are considerable.  The Minister is, nonetheless, eager to have the promissory notes examined to see if they can be re-engineered in a better way for the State.  Since the Government has taken office, we have consistently and persistently sought to restructure the promissory notes in a manner which would be of benefit to the taxpayer.  We have now agreed with our troika partners that a joint paper will be prepared on the structure of the promissory notes and covering alternatives structures, payment periods and interest rates.  Aligned with this technical review, the Minister has engaged at a political level and will at every available opportunity press home the need to reduce the overall cost of resolving the IBRC for the people.  That is why he was in Frankfurt today to meet Mario Draghi, president of the ECB.  As the former Taoiseach Mr. John Bruton has rightly said, by giving the bank guarantee the Government prevented a wider European banking crisis.  It is in the interests of all concerned that Ireland successfully exits the support programme, returns to the markets and has the opportunity and resources to grow.  With goodwill, a pragmatic solution can be found.  The Government will pursue this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">In relation to maturing bonds, the repayment of these bonds is an obligation of the bank and they will be repaid by it.  It is important to be clear that it is the bank, not the Exchequer, which will meet this obligation.  The Government has committed to ensuring there will be no forced or coerced burden sharing on Irish senior bank paper or Irish sovereign debt without the agreement of our external partners.  This commitment has been agreed with our external partners and is the basis on which Ireland's future financing strategy is built.  While the cost to the taxpayer has been and will remain significant, the Government clearly recognises the need to work as part of the eurozone in order to ensure a return to the funding markets in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">It is not correct to state only taxpayers have borne the burden of rescuing the Irish banks.  Holders of equity in the banks have been effectively wiped out in falling markets.  Also, holders of subordinated debt have incurred a €15.5 billion share of the burden to date, including €5.6 billion since the Government took office less than a year ago.  To impose burden sharing on senior bondholders or postpone the repayment of the bond at this point would not be in the country's best interests.  What is in the interests of the people is that we regain financial independence and that we place ourselves in a position to grow the economy and create jobs.  Reputation, reliability and commitment are essential elements of this proposition and reneging on senior debt would not enhance the Irish position.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">Implementation of the programme is going well.  We are working out of a very deep hole and making real progress.  We do not need to scupper our recovery, the goodwill generated or alienate our partners by taking unilateral action which in the medium to long term would prove wholly counterproductive.  If we were to postpone or suspend payments to creditors in the IBRC, that would have a significant impact on both the bank and, ultimately, the State.  Meeting this senior debt - unsecured as it is - is an obligation of the bank.  If it did not meet such obligations, it would lead to a default and following that, most likely, insolvency, which would result in a significant increase in the cost to the State to resolve the IBRC.  In such circumstances the State's negotiating position would, contrary to what has been suggested, be seriously weakened, if not wholly undermined.  Furthermore, the financial market's view of Ireland as a place in which to do business or invest would be seriously undermined.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">We should also consider that the value of support, present and future, we receive from our European partners far outweighs any short-term gain from imposing burden sharing on these bonds in the face of European opposition to such a move.  For example, €110 billion is being provided by the ECB and the Central Bank of Ireland for the Irish banks at a cost below which they could borrow in the market.  This support is in addition to the €67.5 billion provided by the troika for the funding of public services, including social welfare, pension, health and education services.  Would those Members across the House forgo these essential funds?  How do they propose to pay for these services without the assistance of the troika?</p>
          <p eId="para_758">As the Minister has indicated, there is no private sector involvement for Irish senior bank paper or Irish sovereign debt without the agreement of our external partners.  This commitment has been agreed with our external partners and forms the basis on which Ireland's future financing strategy is built.  This, I strongly contend, represents the best approach which will achieve our re-entry to financial markets and allow policy decisions to be made in this House as opposed to in conjunction with the troika.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">I briefly take the opportunity to reiterate the Government's firm commitment to restoring sustainability to Ireland's public finances.  Clearly, this presents challenges for policymakers and the Government, but we must remain steadfast in our commitment to reduce the deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2015.  I welcome the broad agreement that the deficit target of 8.6% of GDP in 2012 must be delivered on.  The country must remain on a credible path of budgetary adjustment, particularly when there is so much uncertainty further afield.  Through continuing to deliver on our targets we can continue to rebuild confidence in the country.  There is evidence that the public finances are continuing to stabilise and the economy returned to growth in 2011.  As of the end of December, Ireland is expected to record a general government deficit figure of less than 10% of GDP in 2011 which is within the 10.6% of GDP target previously set by the ECOFIN Council.  Also, after three consecutive years of annual decline, Exchequer tax receipts rose for the first time in 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">Just last week we concluded a successful review mission with our EU-IMF partners which concluded that the fiscal elements of the programme were on-track.  One of the aims of the joint programme of financial support is to provide a secure source of financing that can be availed of while the process of restoring order to the public finances and repairing the banking system is continued.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">Notwithstanding all of this, there is shared recognition among all of the main stakeholders that steep budgetary challenges still confront us and further adjustments will be required in the coming years.  Moving towards a balanced budgetary position is a necessary precondition for restoring the economy to growth and securing our objective of re-entering the markets to source our own financing as soon as conditions are favourable.  To this end, the Government has committed to broadening the tax base and reducing expenditure.  The introduction of the household charge and the proposed introduction of water charges alongside the reduction of Government expenditure are part of the overall budgetary strategy, which is fair and measured.  In conjunction with this approach, it is essential that productivity and efficiency are achieved in the delivery of public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">It is the strong, considered view of the Government that, while these decisions, including the decision to make the payment tomorrow, are difficult, particularly so given this year's adjustment of €3.8 billion, Ireland must get to a better place and have its financial credibility restored.  We have achieved that in less than a year, but much more needs to be done.  The Government's primary task when entering office with a significant mandate was to do what we could to renegotiate the deal entered into by the previous Administration.  We can point to significant successes in 2011, but further benefits need to accrue from the negotiations.  For this reason, the Government is committed to its strategy and is firmly of the opinion that we can get the country to a better place by following this difficult course.  We ask Deputies to support our counter motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_763">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Government's counter motion to yet another Opposition motion of this type.  We are debating one of the most unwelcome realities of the support programme into which we have been forced.  The ambition on all sides is that the programme will terminate at the end of 2013, which is less than 24 months away.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">At a time when the issue of money leaving the State is being debated, it is vital that we also discuss the total quantum of money entering the country.  The EU and IMF are providing us with significant levels of assistance.  Most of the EU's €45 billion is being used to pay for public services.  The ECB's €110 billion provides liquidity for Irish banks and, consequently, protects the families and deposits of Irish citizens and businesses.  It is fanciful and irresponsible to discuss the redemption of bonds without taking into account the broader Irish position.  It is equally simplistic to argue hypothetical situations, for example, having a Central Bank of our own again.  This is not the case.  We do not have such control over fiscal policy.</p>

          <p eId="para_766">The Government has been here before.  Were we to believe the Opposition, there was to have been no reduction in interest rates.  A significant reduction followed, but the negotiations undertaken by the Government were deemed unworthy of credit.  Our success will secure €10 billion in savings for the Exchequer.  No matter where one wishes to lay the credit for this reduction, one fact is irrefutable - the interest rate is lower because Ireland is at a significantly lesser risk of default.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">We were also told by many that our economy was incapable of growth.  Wrong again.  Modest growth was achieved in year one of the Government's term for the first time in five years.  Ireland will achieve growth again in 2012 and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">Recovery will only be delivered by stability, which can only come from agreement, not from unilateral acts that undermine every economy in the world in these fragile times.  It is vital to remember that Ireland is one of the most open economies in the world and has a significant trade surplus.  It will benefit far more than most from a global economic recovery.  We are a nation with integrity.  Until the last Fianna Fáil-led Government damaged our international reputation, our nation had always proven its ability to negotiate the best for its people.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">The greatest emphasis must be put on the acceptance by everyone that the Government has not completed its negotiations.  The debt burden we face is too high.  The issue of the promissory notes is unquestionably at the forefront of the minds of the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and every other Government member.  The prize for the Irish people is not to win a battle and lose a war or to be regarded as the good boys of Europe.  Selfishly, it is to guarantee for our farmers, food producers, business people and workforce that we stand ready to benefit from a global economic recovery, that we pay our creditors, that we be a good country to do business with and that we be willing and able to retake our place as one of the finest small economies in the world.  This is the Government's ambition.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterMathews" eId="spk_363">
          <from>Deputy Peter Mathews</from>
          <p eId="para_770">It is impossible in five minutes to deal with all of the matters that arise, but I will pick up on some of the comments that have been made.  We are a House of 166 Members and I respect every contribution.  I particularly respect the contributions of members of the Technical Group.  Deputy Donnelly gave us what amounted to a tutorial on the mechanics of balance sheet financing and structuring.  A great deal of nonsense has been talked on the airwaves by so-called experts, advisers and so on who do not have a clue.  Deputy Donnelly is right, in that the promissory notes are a ghost asset of promises on Anglo Irish Bank's balance sheet.  The corresponding credit financing comes from the Central Bank and the European Central Bank, as the depositors have all gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">It is possible to do financial engineering, but before one does so or engages in technical mathematics in these situations, one agrees in principle what is occurring.  For example, if one engages in an investment project, one decides its monetary cost and from where it will be funded.  Banking is not weird and wonderful.  It is quite straightforward.  In September 2010, Anglo Irish Bank's balance sheet had loan assets of €72 billion, of which €30 billion owed to the make believe bubble.  The value of those assets needed to be reduced to €42 billion and the reduced assets were shipped over to NAMA, leaving a hole in its balance sheet to be filled by pro-notes.  As Deputy Donnelly described, the amount of money created by the Central Bank must be paid down in little bits and the pro-notes are cashed and repaid.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">All of this can be changed.  During our Topical Issue debate last Thursday, I asked people to do the following - pause, suspend, think, discuss, negotiate, argue and explain.  Europe has been caught up in financial mayhem and volatility.  Given that we have been bundled and straitjacketed into the programme, parked safely and are addressing fiscal imbalances, we are not the main problem.  We have not even got Europe's attention yet.  I know this.  In May, I dared to write an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> suggesting that all of the margin on the programme loans from the troika should be eliminated, as it did not make sense.  My suggestion was considered to be nearly out of bounds.  The article was translated for <i>Financial Times Deutschland</i> so that people could begin to understand the principle involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">On 30 September 2010, loan losses were only beginning to be acknowledged at a level of €50 billion, which was far too short.  Even today, we are acknowledging losses of €74 billion following the BlackRock prudential capital assessment review, PCAR.  It is my professional opinion, as someone who has had the benefit of working in the industry since the beginning of the early 1980s and being involved in the loan work-outs and damage limitation exercises, that the final figure will be closer to €100 billion.  The reason the banks have not started to do write-downs and to collect debt at write-down levels is that they are trying to preserve the capitalisation they received last March for the next three years.  Instead of getting on with it and accepting reality, they are engaged in delaying tactics.  These are the issues we must explain to our partners in Germany and to Mr. Masuch of the ECB who was in Ireland last week.  We must set out clearly the provenance of the whole situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">I do not want to single out specific speakers among the various excellent contributions connecting the pain and hardship being experienced by people in this State to what went on in the banks, but Deputy Donnelly's contribution was particularly enlightening.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn, meanwhile, gave the correct historical analysis of the overload of debt in the developed world and the eurozone.  That is the core of the problem.  There is a rehypothecation scandal which only surfaced last December and which has not yet been fully absorbed and digested.  I urge Members to look up MF Global and the great Wall Street rehypothecation scandal on Google.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">What the Government should do now is press the pause button.  Last March, when the capitalisation of the banks took place, there should instead have been a creditor recapitalisation.  I am not trying to detract from the honest efforts of Members on all sides of the House, including my colleagues in government, but there are certain indisputable facts which cannot be ignored.  The credit default swap market is driving the fear that is abroad.  Markets know greed and fear, that is all; there is no in-between.  We must acknowledge that and ensure everything is up for discussion in Brussels.</p>

          <p eId="para_779">The motion goes on to note the Government's intention to make a payment of €3.1 billion, on 31 March 2012, in respect of a promissory note for the debt of Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  It further notes that promissory note payments to the value of €3.1 billion will be made each year until 2023, after which further payments will be due.  This, the motion observes, equates to a total payment of at least €47 billion by 2031.  The motion concludes with the demand that the promissory notes due on 31 March 2012, and any payments arising in the future, not be made.  That is the direction in which the debate is moving.  Anglo Irish Bank has caused enormous legacy problems.  As an institution, however, it has become less relevant.  What is relevant is how we as a national Parliament deal with the legacy of the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">There is fantastic scope for the Government to make major strides in this regard.  Its amendment to the motion states that it is working with its partners in the EU and IMF to address the situation.  I understand the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, was in Brussels today.  In truth, when a debate like this arises, the Minister is always very good at getting on the evening news.  We are sure to see him coming out of a meeting and talking about the serious discussions in which he is engaged.  This serves to take attention away from what is happening in the Chamber tonight.  By tomorrow or the next day, when this motion is out of the way, those serious discussions will be revealed to have been a puff of smoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">The Government has a track record in this regard.  If it were as good at negotiating matters relating to the financial affairs of the State as it is at the public relations feat of giving the impression of doing something, we would be home and dry by now.  Unfortunately, the public relations exercise comes before the substance in these matters.  The Minister is making these claims on the evening news because this motion is being debated in the House and is also likely to feature in news reports.  The media are assisting him in ensuring the real issues are not being dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">The Government amendment tells us that the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation will "fulfil its obligation" to redeem €1.125 billion in senior unguaranteed bonds.  The Government is thereby placing on the record its undertaking that these bonds will be honoured in full by it.  Their value on the market is now their full par value on the basis of this guarantee in the name of the Minister for Finance, by way of this amendment in the House of Parliament.  The amendment further states that we must take on board the views of our partners who are "providing the requisite funding for the State and for the financial institutions".  We cannot, we are told, act unilaterally.  Nobody has ever suggested that we should act unilaterally.  Nobody has argued for an unstructured default.  We are all in favour of negotiation and discussion.  If the electronic payment was not made tomorrow, that would constitute a default.  However, if it were planned and discussed and people were ready for it and could adjust for it, it would not be termed a default.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">The Fianna Fáil Party will vote against the Government amendment on the basis of this exhortation to have regard to our partners "providing the requisite funding for the State and for the financial institutions".  I have news for the Government - that is already done.  We have signed the deal with the IMF and the EU.  For the years 2011 to 2013, there is total financing of €88 billion available to the State, of which €21 billion comes primarily from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and €67 billion from the EU, ECB and IMF, divided into approximately equal thirds.  There are some bilateral arrangements with the United Kingdom and others.  For the Government to say that we should have regard to our partners ignores the fact that we are honouring the loan agreement.  In fact, we have been told we are top of the class in this regard.  The repercussions of taking action as set out in the Technical Group's motion are not what are being claimed by the Government.  We have our financing in place for the next several years and we do not have to return to the bond markets in the short term.  As such, we do not have to concern ourselves unduly about our rating.  To reiterate, we will not be borrowing in the primary bond market in the next two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">The Government amendment claims that the "implications of not making such payments are such that the State's ability to fund the provision of services, pay wages etc. could be put at the risk".  This is the double think we have seen before.  This payment is either linked to current budgetary activities or it is not.  The amendment is saying that if we cause a problem in this regard we will not have the funds to pay for services.  However, the funding for the State for the next two years is fully signed, sealed and delivered, and we are honouring our obligations in that regard.  The Government should not be issuing threats that wages will go unpaid if this payment is withheld.  That claim is false.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">I saw an interview with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, on television on Sunday night in which he made the confusing claim that these promissory notes are not being repaid with taxpayers' money.  I do not know where he thinks the money is coming from.  Perhaps there is a tree out in Dublin West which grows money, in which case Deputy Joe Higgins might like to know about it.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, seems to believe taxpayers will not be responsible for these payments.  Moreover, he said they are nothing to do with the current budgetary deficit and cuts in front line services.  I am pleased the Minister for Finance has overruled him by clearly linking, in this amendment, the payment of promissory notes to the need to pay wages and services.  That is a more accurate reflection of the situation.  The €1.25 billion that will be paid tomorrow is coming from Anglo Irish Bank, but where did that bank get its money if not from the taxpayer?</p>

          <p eId="para_789">The Government gave the promissory note for approximately €31 billion to Anglo Irish Bank last March.  The latter took the note to the Central Bank in exchange for cash, which it has used to put into its deposits in order to replace the funding which fled.  I agree with the final part of the motion which states the Government is committed to paying €3.1 billion per annum for the next number of years to Anglo Irish Bank in order that it can repay the Central Bank for the loan it drew down on the basis of the promissory note issued.  I acknowledge that Fianna Fáil supported in general the €3.8 billion in cuts announced in the budget.  Ministers have commented that this issue is not related to the budget.  However, Irish taxpayers must fund the payment of that €3.1 billion to Anglo Irish Bank on 31 March 2012 and will have to do likewise each year up to 2023, when the amount will drop to approximately €1 billion per annum, giving a total of €47 billion.</p>

          <p eId="para_791">The Minister, Deputy Noonan, when in Brussels today, should have pressed President Draghi of the European Central Bank for a clear timetable to reduce that debt in terms of overall European Central Bank requirements.  There is a compelling case for deployment by the European Union of a new funding stream to ease the burden of debt on the Irish taxpayer.  The ESF was not in place when the Fianna Fáil-led Government agreed to the EU-IMF programme.  Other countries can now draw on that facility.  The interest rate being charged on the promissory notes is 5.8% increasing to 8.2% from 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">This matter was discussed recently by the Committee of Public Accounts.  That committee received an important letter from the chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency, Mr. John Corrigan.  In summary, Mr. Corrigan suggests that, as an alternative to the promissory notes system, we should draw down cash from the ESF and, rather than paying the 5% interest rate we are currently paying, we should try to obtain that funding at the rate of 1%, which is the rate being given to Ireland by the European Central Bank.  This would reduce interest costs.  Funding would then come from the European Central Bank to the Irish Central Bank, which would result in a massive cash saving to the Irish Exchequer and taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">Why should Irish citizens bail out European banks?  The reason Chancellor Merkel, President Sarkozy and President Draghi want to protect the European Central Bank and the euro is to protect the big German, French, Spanish, Italian and UK banks.  The Irish taxpayer is not paying for Anglo Irish Bank.  We are paying so the German banks do not have to take a hit.  That is what this is about.  It is no wonder the troika thinks we are great people and that they give us a gold star each time they come here.  We are doing what no other country in the world is prepared to do, namely, impose hardship on our citizens because of European banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_797">We have moved on.  As I have stated on many occasions in this House, having 17 central banks in the euro area and 27 in the EU is a nonsense.  There should be only one central bank, and it should take over the Irish debt.  The removal of this debt from the backs of Irish taxpayers should be the focus of the Government in negotiations on this issue.  This debt is being carried by the Irish Central Bank, which is only an off-shoot branch of the European Central Bank, of which our governor is a member.  On the table of any negotiations in regard to fiscal compact arrangements should be that the European Central Bank take over the debts which existed prior to the putting in place of the ESF.  Had the ESF been in place earlier, we would not have had to go down the expensive promissory note route.  There is a compelling case for the Minister to go to Brussels prior to the due date of the March payment to negotiate that the European Central Bank take over these debts at a maximum 1% interest rate or that it absorb them in terms of any new arrangement to be entered into in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">Many people - I am sure other Members have said this - have made a return of up to 100% on these bonds, which were trading at 50% of their euro value more than a year ago.  Following the statement by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that we would guarantee these loans and pay them in full, the bonds increased to par value.  Had the Minister, Deputy Noonan, been clever, the NTMA could have purchased them on the secondary market at 50% value, thus saving us half the amount we are currently paying out.  The reason I say that the balance due to the Central Bank is now the big issue is, there is now only €1.8 billion of senior unsecured bondholders remaining after this payment which I expect will be made tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">I welcome the statement in the motion that the Government not pay the promissory notes for Anglo Irish Bank-Irish Nationwide Building Society debt on 31 March.  The Government needs urgently to renegotiate this matter in Brussels, Frankfurt and so on.  Everyone who has met the troika knows of the IMF, which has an American background.  It believes in the capitalist system and that if a bank is a dead duck, it should be allowed to fail.  It is far more sympathetic than are people in Europe about some of these bondholders taking a hit in respect of Anglo Irish Bank.  I would welcome further discussion on this issue.</p>

        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_377">

          <p eId="para_800">Cuirim fáilte roimh an rún atá os comhair na Dála ón nGrúpa Teicniúil.  Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go bhfuil an cheist seo, a bhaineann le Banc Angla-Éireannach, á phlé againn.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">I welcome the opportunity to discuss this motion.  I am conscious Sinn Féin brought a similar motion before the House last year.  It is opportune, in particular on the eve of this Government's handing over of €1.25 billion of taxpayers' money to unsecured, unguaranteed bondholders.  Much attention is being paid to what will happen tomorrow.  Let us also be conscious of what happened yesterday when more than €30.6 million was paid to unguaranteed bondholders.  Next week, €20 million will be paid out and in June a further €500 million will be paid.  This is not a stand-alone issue.  This is a repeated transfer of taxpayers' money to speculators.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">Despite repeated attempts by my party and others to have the identity of these bondholders revealed, the Government continues to shield them.  We know that the day one list has been sought.  I call on the Government and on the Minister for Finance in particular to publish the day one list for Anglo Irish Bank, which lists the names of those who bought bonds on the day the bank was nationalised.  It is likely they are private speculators, investors and hedge funds who were betting on the financial markets.  It is also highly likely that they bought these bonds at a dramatically reduced value.  The bondholder who will receive the €1.25 billion will get a massive windfall from the Irish people to the tune of millions of euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">I am not surprised at the number of empty benches on the Government side.  Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies must be deeply embarrassed by their Government's actions.  After all, it was only a few short weeks ago that the Government wrenched €3.8 billion from the economy in the form of spending cuts and taxes.  The €1.25 billion due to be paid tomorrow equates to almost two and a half times the total cuts in social welfare in 2012, more than twice the amount of cuts to the health service announced in the 2012 budget, more than eight times the total to be raised from the household charge this year, and almost ten times the amount to be cut from the education budget in 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, has been mentioned a number of times in this debate.  He told us on Sunday that not to pay these Anglo Irish Bank bonds would be akin to setting off a bomb in the middle of Dublin.  That horse has already bolted.  The December budget of this Government blew a hole so big in the finances of low and middle income families that it will take years for them to recover.  All the while this Government is fleecing the taxpayer and dismantling the public services, it is handing over billions of euro to Anglo Irish Bank bondholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Worse than that is the national scandal that is the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note.  This is an issue I have been raising in this House since early last year.  Despite promises to break with the failed banking policy that was pursued by Fianna Fail and the Green Party, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have signed up to it lock, stock and barrel.  Under the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note, payments will transfer from the Irish people to that bank up to 31 March 2031.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">The first payment of €3.1 billion was made on 31 March last year and the Government will again make a payment of €3.1 billion in March of this year and of every year for a long time thereafter.  On the total cost of the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note, I again challenge the Minister for Finance because he simply does not know what it will be.  Although more than €47 billion will be transferred to Anglo Irish Bank, there will be a cost associated with borrowing that from the State, which, at a reasonable interest rate of 4.7%, will be at least €74.63 billion.  That is what it will cost up to when the last penny is transferred to Anglo Irish Bank.  This equates to approximately 30% of the current national debt and it will add €3.1 billion to the Exchequer deficit every year.  This payment is so absurd that a national campaign has been formed in recent days - a meeting is being held in the Teachers' Club as I speak - comprising academics, community organisations and different groups that have come together under the banner of "Anglo: Not Our Debt".  Its purpose is to campaign to knock some sense into the Government and to join with others who have campaigned continually on this issue in a call to suspend this payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The promissory note is not our debt.  It should not be placed on the shoulders of the people, we simply cannot afford it and the mealy-mouthed approach by the Government must end.  I again call on the Government, just as I called on Anglo Irish Bank, the Governor of the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance in the early days of September before there was any mention of renegotiating the promissory note, to state clearly that this State is unable to pay the promissory note.  It should enter into negotiations with the ECB, which will be the beneficiary of that payment, not to tweak around the edges by reducing our costs marginally, however welcome that would be, but to have the promissory note parked for an indefinite period until this country can recover.</p>

The Public Service Reform Plan of 17 November 2011 also referred to the merging of the CPSA with the Office of the Ombudsman.

            <p eId="para_829">Under the old Guidelines on Ministerial Appointments, operated by the previous Government, Special Advisers were paid their existing salary plus an ‘attraction allowance' of 10%, subject to the overriding maximum remuneration of the Principal (higher) scale — currently €99,236.  Under the new Guidelines, Special Advisers should now normally be appointed on the minimum of the PO standard scale i.e. €80,051. In addition there is no longer an attraction allowance of 10%.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">The Government recognised, however, that there would be occasions when a higher salary might be required in order to secure the appointment of a Special Adviser with particular skills and expertise.  Remuneration in excess of the minimum point of the Principal Officer (standard) scale has been sanctioned by me in a number of instances in the light of the business case presented. In the majority of cases, this has been based on evidence of higher earnings in previous employment and the need to secure the appointment of an individual with particular skills and expertise.  At all times, I have endeavoured to keep exceptions to a minimum and in all cases value for money considerations were uppermost in my mind when approving exceptions to the Guidelines. I would like to add that in a number of cases, Special Advisers have been appointed on substantially reduced salaries compared to what they were earning prior to their appointment.</p>
            <p eId="para_831">In the case of the sanctioning of a salary of €114,000 for my Special Adviser, this salary was based on his earnings in his previous employment and the particular skills and expertise he possesses for the position.

            <p eId="para_833">Currently, personal data is shared between Government Departments and public bodies if required to allow them fulfil their objectives in the most efficient and cost-effective manner.

            <p eId="para_834">As part of the Public Service Reform Plan, published on 17th November 2011, a commitment was given that during the first half of 2012 there would be a review of all relevant legislative provisions in relation to data sharing between public bodies and that principles would be developed for the sharing of data. This review was to have regard to data protection legislation including forthcoming EU legislation and to consider any amendments which may be necessary in this regard.  I understand that draft EU legislation to replace the existing Directive will be published very shortly, perhaps even this week, and this will then allow the proposed legislative review to commence.</p>

            <p eId="para_838">The Government is committed to a programme of public service reform and improvement. The Deputies will be aware of the Government's plans to reduce the number of State Agencies.  As a further part of reforms in this area, the Government has also decided to:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_839">Introduce "sunset clauses" when new bodies are created which will ensure that a new body will cease to exist after a predetermined date unless its mandate is specifically renewed.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_840">Ensure that Departments regularly review the continuing business case for all significant State bodies; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_841">Require that robust Service Level Agreements are put in place as a matter of urgency by each Department with each of its State bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">Following the publication of the Government's Public Service Reform Plan of 17 November 2011, arrangements are now being put in place for each Minister to ensure that a business case continues to exist for the existence of the State Bodies under his aegis. Of course, State Bodies vary considerably in size, powers and purpose and they also take many forms and structures, including Government-owned companies, non-commercial service delivery bodies, advisory councils. Therefore, the form of the assessment that parent Departments will need to carry out in relation to their State bodies will reflect the function, size and budget of each body.  My Department is developing guidance to assist line Departments in advancing this proposal and to ensure that best practices are uniformly adopted across the Public Service.  A Reform and Delivery Office has been established within my Department to drive implementation and prioritisation of Public Service Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_843">Where there is a business case for the continued existence of a State body, the parent Department must ensure that it puts in place a Service Level Agreement between the parent Department and the body in question. Some Departments already have advanced arrangements in place in this regard and my Department is giving guidance to assist others.</p>

            <p eId="para_847">My Department is responsible for a number of commitments in the Programme for Government that form part of the Government's overall political reform agenda.  These include:—</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_848">introducing a statutory register of lobbyists, and rules concerning the practice of lobbying;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_849">legislating for a reformulated code of laws, replacing both the Ministers and Secretaries Acts and the Public Service Management Act, on the legal relationship between Ministers and their civil servants and their legal accountability for decisions and for management of Departments; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_850">prioritising a referendum to protect the right of citizens to communicate in confidence with public representatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">Work is ongoing in my Department in relation each of these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">Regarding a statutory register of lobbyists, and rules concerning the practice of lobbying, the Public Service Reform Plan contains a commitment to prepare legislation to meet this commitment. The Government Reform Unit of my Department is currently reviewing the approaches in place in the EU and internationally to the regulation of lobbyists.  This process, which will identify best practice internationally, will help to inform and guide the design of proposals for the regulatory regime in Ireland.  In parallel with this work my Department is currently seeking submissions from interested parties on a number of key issues relating to options for the organisation and implementation of a regulatory system for lobbying in Ireland.  A notice was recently placed in newspapers directing interested parties to explanatory documents on my Department's website with a view to receiving submissions by 29 February 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">I remain committed to bringing forward the reform required in the context of commitments on accountability arrangements, as set out in the Programme for Government.  Legislative change to clarify accountability arrangements is a key initiative of the Government's Public Service Reform Plan that was published in November 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">In addition, my Department is working with the Office of the Attorney General on the issue of the protection of communication between the citizen and their public representatives.  An important element of the Government's response to this commitment, included in the Public Service Reform Plan, comprises the proposed ‘Protected Disclosure (Whistleblowing)' legislation in respect of which the preparation of legislative proposals, subject to Government approval, for the drafting of a Bill over the first half of this year is at an advanced stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_858">I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 67 and 93 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">On 17 November last, I announced several key developments relating to Public Service reform and published the Government's Public Service Reform Plan which provides the basis for the comprehensive and strategic reform of the Public Service in the coming years.  The Reform Plan outlines the priority actions and timelines for reform in a broad range of areas such as:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_860">implementation of shared services models for HR, payroll, pensions etc;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_861">reform of public procurement processes and property rationalisation;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_862">evaluation of new business models for the delivery of non-core services;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_863">reducing costs, addressing duplication and eliminating waste; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_864">improving performance by organisations and individuals in order to ensure greater efficiency, effectiveness and economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">Implementation of the Reform Plan is being driven and coordinated by the new Reform and Delivery Office which I have established in my Department.  This Office is led by a Programme Director who was appointed last November and who has experience of implementing large scale restructuring in the private sector.  The Office will work closely with organisations across the Public Service to enable them to deliver meaningful reform at a local level, as well leading on certain cross-cutting initiatives from the Reform Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">Since the appointment of the Programme Director, I can confirm the following progress has been made:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_867">the finalisation of a comprehensive Reform Plan with 200 actions and 70 recommendations across all 14 cross cutting areas; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_868">the public communication of the Plan and engagement with key stakeholder groups including Oireachtas Committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">Against the Plan itself, good progress has already been made in implementing certain early actions, for example, the introduction of a range of public expenditure reforms and the establishment of a CIO Council.  Detailed proposals in other areas such as shared services, procurement, property management and Govstat are being advanced and a new eGovernment Strategy will be published shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">The Reform Office has also put in place the appropriate governance and planning arrangements to ensure a strong focus on delivery.  To this end, a number of high level groups have been established to support the work of the Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform.  In addition, each Government Department/Office has now developed an Integrated Reform Delivery Plan setting out both the organisation specific and cross-cutting reforms that they will implement over the coming months and years.  We have identified a number of Major Projects of strategic importance for priority attention this year including the Public Services Card, public procurement, property management, HR Shared Services (Civil Service) and Payroll Shared Services (Civil Service) and the Senior Public Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">In terms of shared services, while I recognise that there has been progress in this area in recent years, I believe that much of this has been on an ad hoc basis and there remains considerable scope to expand its use on a more strategic basis in line with the Programme for Government and the Public Service Reform Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">As set out in the Reform Plan, a sectoral approach will be taken to the roll out of shared services and it is intended that shared services developments in the Civil Service (including state bodies where appropriate) will focus initially on priority back-office areas of human resources; payroll; pensions; and banking.  Each sector has been asked to submit a detailed shared services plan by the end of Quarter 2, 2012.   A Shared Services Transformation Manager with private sector experience on a global scale will shortly be appointed to the Reform and Delivery Office to ensure a strong focus on this priority area.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">Work has already commenced under the auspices of my Department on the development of a HR shared service for the Civil Service with the intention of establishing a single HR Shared Service Centre that will undertake the transactional elements of HR processes for the Civil Service.  Finally, the reviews of the four Departments under the current phase of the Organisational Review Programme have been completed, along with follow-up action plans prepared by them.  Both the reviews and the action plans will be published in a composite report towards the end of this week.  All Deputies will be provided with copies on publication.</p>

            <p eId="para_875">The Troika view asset disposals as a structural reform measure — intended to improve efficiency and competition in the economy, while also offering the prospect of reducing overall debt levels. The Government, however, views asset disposals as offering the potential to release value from State assets for use on employment generating initiatives in the economy.  As I have previously stated, in our most recent discussions with the Troika, they have signalled that, in the context of Government pursuing an ambitious programme of asset disposals, they would be prepared to agree to the retention of a sizeable amount of proceeds from asset disposals for investment by the Government in job creation initiatives in the economy. I can confirm that this remains the policy of the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_895">The context of the questions is the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) governing the EU/IMF Funding Programme for Ireland, which commits the Government to considering options for an ambitious programme of asset disposals, based on the Programme for Government and the report of the Review Group on State Assets and Liabilities.</p>

In line with this commitment, the Minister for Finance presented an up-date to the Troika in December 2011, indicating that a part sale of ESB (as previously announced by Government) would be capable of achieving the Government's target for asset disposals. However, it was also indicated that there were a variety of policy, regulatory, legislative and financial issues associated with this proposed transaction which would have to be addressed before any transaction could be initiated but which the Government had not yet had the opportunity to consider.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">I do not propose to publish this report given to the Troika. In any event, things have now moved on and the matter has since been discussed with the Troika.

            <p eId="para_900">I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 82 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">There are no incentivised schemes for early retirement in operation at present in the public or civil service. Many of the retirements at this stage are occurring in the normal course where an individual has reached retirement age. There are also cases where individuals are availing of "cost-neutral early retirement", which allows retirement earlier than normal retirement age, but with an off-setting actuarial reduction applied to the individual's lump sum and pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">When public service salaries were reduced in 2010, it was agreed by the then Government that persons retiring during a transitional or "grace" period would have their retirement benefits calculated on the basis of the previous payscale levels before the salary cut.   That grace period will now expire on 29 February 2012. Persons retiring from 1 March 2012 onwards will have their retirement benefits calculated on the basis of their actual, reduced pay scale.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">The total number of applications to retire by the end of February is currently around 4,000, excluding the Health Sector. The sectoral breakdown of this numbers is as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_921">Following the outcome to the referendum on remuneration for the Judiciary, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act, 2011 was enacted. This Act provided for the application of the pay reduction and the pension levy on serving members of the judiciary and provided for reduced remuneration rates for newly appointed judges with effect from 1 January 2012. The Act also made provision to bring certain Office holders (Comptroller and Auditor General and Chairperson of An Bord Pleanála) within the public service pay ceiling and for the reduction of remuneration for future appointees as President and Ombudsman.

            <p eId="para_926">Pay and superannuation terms for Secretaries General and County Managers are in line with their contractual arrangements.  The Deputy will be aware that a number of significant steps have been taken to reduce costs which will make a significant contribution to the national effort to restore the public finances to a sustainable path. Among the pay measures introduced and impacting on the Public Service are:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_927">The general pay increases provided for under Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009 were not paid.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_928">A pension related deduction of an average of nearly 7% was applied to all the earnings (including non pensionable earnings) of public servants with effect from 1 March 2009.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_929">A reduction in rates of pay and allowances ranging from 5% to 20% took effect on 1 January, 2010.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_930">The Public Service (Croke Park) Agreement provides for an effective pay freeze up to 2014.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_931">The salary scales for new entrants to traditional recruitment grades across the public service with effect from 1st January 2011 were reduced by 10%.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_932">More recently the Government has put in place general pay ceilings for Senior Public Service posts (€200,000) and for CEOs of Commercial State Companies (€250,000).</p>
            <p eId="para_933">The measures taken by the Government reflect its determined view that in the light of the ongoing severe economic conditions facing the country a strong policy of pay restraint within the public sector is necessary, including the application of general pay caps where appropriate. These and other measures to reduce pay costs will have brought about a reduction in the pay bill to less than €14.795 billion in 2011 which represents a reduction of some 15.5% on the 2009 figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">Following a review of Higher Grade salary rates in the Public Service including Secretary General and related grades the Government agreed in June 2011 with my proposal to the introduction of a general pay ceiling of €200,000 for future appointments to higher positions across the public service. Following adoption of the pay ceiling those Secretaries General who were in receipt of salaries in excess of the pay ceiling voluntarily waived that portion of their salary in excess of the pay ceiling while the issue did not arise for County Managers. Revised rates for future appointees to Secretary General posts were implemented in accordance with the pay ceiling and I have no further plans to review the salaries of these grades at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">A number of pension-related measures have been implemented.  The Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) was introduced in January 2011.  The pay reductions introduced since 2010 will impact on pension benefits for those retiring after the end of the ‘grace period', i.e. from March 2012 onwards.  Those retiring on pension before that date are subject to the PSPR.  I have recently provided for an increase in the rate of PSPR that applies to pensions over €100,000 from 12% to 20% which will affect secretaries general on pensions above that level.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">In relation to the secretaries general of Departments, the Government introduced a new regime to apply to them on completion of their term of office. Newly appointed secretaries general, unless they have already reached pension age, will no longer benefit from immediate payment of pension and lump sum before they reach their preserved pension age; nor will secretaries general benefit from notional added years for pension purposes.  These are significant changes compared to the exit terms that applied to those previously appointed.</p>
            <p eId="para_937">Finally, it is important to point out that the Government's new Bill to provide for a Single Public Service Pension Scheme is currently before the Oireachtas and will be implemented this year.  It will provide for pension to be based on career average earnings, as opposed to the current system of pension based on final salary.  This and other provisions in the Bill will eventually deliver a saving of over a third in the Exchequer Public Service pension bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_940">The <i>Public Service Management Act 1997</i>   requires Secretaries General and Heads of Office to prepare and report on Statements of Strategy, and makes them more directly responsible and accountable for the day-to-day management of their Departments/Offices.  Such responsibilities and accountability can in turn be assigned to other officials.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">The Statements of Strategy set out clearly the high-level objectives against which the performance of Departments and other public service organisations will be assessed.  In particular, the annual Estimates of Expenditure for 2012 are being re-cast to ensure full alignment with the Statements of Strategy, and to include performance information against each of the high-level objectives (or strategic "programmes").  This approach, referred to as ‘performance budgeting', was piloted successfully for the Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Agriculture Groups of Votes in 2011, and is being rolled out more generally for the 2012 Estimates.  The overall intention, in line with Government Programme commitments, is to heighten the focus upon overall performance and delivery by Departments and Offices, and improve accountability by office-holders for the achievement of results.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">The Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) which applies in the Civil Service places a strong emphasis on individual performance and accountability through the setting of goals and the monitoring of performance.  The integration of this system with other Human Resource processes increases the level of accountability for individuals.  My Department has recently introduced changes to PMDS that streamline the process and make it a more useful tool for the management of performance.  My Department will continue to review the effectiveness of performance management and develop new ways to strengthen management capability.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">In addition, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to legislate for a reformulated code of laws, replacing both the Ministers and Secretaries Acts and the Public Service Management Act, on the legal relationship between Ministers and their civil servants and their legal accountability for decisions and for management of Departments.  Work is ongoing in my Department in this area.  I remain committed to bringing forward the reform required in the context of commitments on accountability arrangements, as set out in the Programme for Government.  Legislative change to clarify accountability arrangements is a key initiative of the Government's Public Service Reform Plan that was published in November 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_945">The Government's "Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012 to 2016" report, which was published on 10 November 2011, sets out the €17 billion Exchequer capital investment framework for the coming five year period.  In addition, as signalled in the plan, there will be capital investment  through the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF), the establishment of which was announced by the Government in September 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">The SIF will, following appropriate legislative changes to the investment policy of the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), channel commercial investment from the NPRF towards productive investment in the Irish economy. As well as money from the NPRF, the Fund will seek matching commercial investment from private investors and target investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the Irish economy. It will comprise a series of sub-funds targeted at commercial investment in critical areas of the Irish economy, including infrastructure, venture capital and the provision of long-term capital for SMEs. The NPRF will take a lead role in the development and implementation of each sub-fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">In November 2011, the NPRF announced a commitment of €250 million to a new Irish infrastructure investment fund which is seeking up to €1 billion from institutional investors in Ireland and overseas and which will invest in infrastructure assets in Ireland, including assets designated for disposal by the Government and commercial State enterprises and also new infrastructure projects.</p>

            <p eId="para_953">As I explained in response to previous Questions, the revaluation programme which began in November 2005 in the greater Dublin area is ongoing, the current emphasis being in the Dublin City Council area which commenced last May and which involves the valuation of approximately 25,000 properties.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">As part of the roll-out of the revaluation programme to other local authority areas, the Commissioner of Valuation signed the Valuation Order on 12th December, 2011 to commence the revaluation of the Waterford City, Waterford County and Dungarvan Town Council areas.  He has also advanced the formal consultations with Limerick City and Limerick County Council to the stage where he will shortly be in a position to sign valuation orders for those areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">The Commissioner had indicated that, with the intention of speeding up the revaluation work, two pilot schemes were to be undertaken on outsourcing some of the work and exploring the possibility of introducing a self-assessment scheme.  The enabling provisions to allow for the start-up of these schemes were included in legislative proposals approved by Government on 6th December, 2011 and as a consequence, planning for their initiation is currently underway in the Valuation Office.  As a further means of speeding up the revaluation generally and in particular to accelerate the capture of data on properties throughout the country, in advance of the roll-out to particular areas, a dedicated unit is being set up within the Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">As I mentioned previously, significant work has already been done on the formulation of a Bill to streamline and improve the valuation system and the Heads of a Bill, having been approved by Government, are now with the Parliamentary Draftsman's Office for drafting of the Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_958">The Government is committed to reducing the Public Service number to 282,500 by 2015. Given the importance of meeting this challenging numbers target, any recruitment will be directed towards areas of most need.  In order to mitigate the impact on frontline service provision as far as possible, with the co-operation and flexibility of individual public servants, we will fully use the mechanisms set out in Public Service Reform Plan, including the filling of essential posts and the utilisation of redeployment. Public Service Organisations must fully use all options for discharging work through reorganisation and redeployment of staff. Only after this will the issue of recruitment for current or emerging business needs arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">Should a Department identify a potential exception to the moratorium on recruitment the sanction of my Department must then be sought. Exceptions to the Moratorium may be granted on the following basis:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_960">a) statutory posts which have to be filled for legal reasons;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_961">b) where failure to fill posts would result in a breach of EU/international regulations and impact upon exports etc.;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_962">c) safety related posts — failure to fill them could leave the state open to potential legal liabilities or for security reasons;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_963">d) specialist/technical posts to ensure continuity of operations e.g. legal officers; laboratory staff, maritime safety, etc.;</p>

            <p eId="para_965">In addition, in the case of the Education and Health Sector, a number of grades are exempted from the Moratorium in order to ensure that these vital services are maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_966">Each Sector in the Public Service has been establishing its own Strategic Workforce Planning Group to ensure that sectoral employers are developing plans to deal with the operational and strategic consequences arising from staffing reductions. The sectoral groups are feeding into a central Strategic Workforce Planning Forum under my Department. Factors such as emerging demographic gaps in management grades will also be considered; measures such as the recently advertised graduate recruitment competition will address such gaps.</p>

            <p eId="para_981">I am very aware that public procurement can be an important source of business and jobs in local enterprises.  In general, SMEs' flexibility and ability to respond speedily to requirements can be advantageous in competing for local contracts. Current guidelines from my Department require public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">The guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote SME involvement in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_983">supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of €25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i> website;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_984">less use of "restrictive" tendering procedures and greater use of "open" tendering;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_985">ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_986">sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_987">the needs and possibilities for small businesses to compete and supply to be taken into account when setting up panels/framework arrangements;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_988">encouragement of small companies to combine with others to make a joint bid for a contract that they might not be in a position to perform on their own.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">Measures such as these should increase the opportunities for SMEs to compete for public contracts and will reduce the up-front administration burden for them.  The Government continues to review the situation in regard to SME participation in public procurement and where consistent with achieving value-for-money, probity and transparency, will seek to address any further issues that might be identified.</p>

The Report examined the savings and reform delivered in the first year of the Agreement and found that sustainable pay bill savings in the order of €289m had been achieved during the review period which "exceeded the targeted savings for the public service pay bill in 2011".

As before, it will also scrutinise the level of progress being made on implementing the  reform programmes in each sector.  I look forward to the outcome of that review which I expect will be published in May or June this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1067">I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 to 105, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">In international law the sovereignty of a coastal state extends beyond its land territory to the adjacent band of water and to the seabed and subsoil beneath it.  A coastal state exercises jurisdiction within that area.  The extent of that jurisdiction will depend, amongst other things, on any boundaries that may have been agreed with a neighbouring state.  There is currently no agreed maritime boundary within Lough Foyle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069">The question of property rights to the seabed is a separate issue, regulated by domestic law.  In this jurisdiction, with some small exceptions, the seabed adjacent to the coast belongs to the State and is currently vested in the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the State Property Acts.  In the UK ownership of the foreshore is vested in a number of bodies, including the Crown Estate in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">Uncertainty concerning the extent to which each side exercises jurisdiction within Lough Foyle, and the separate but related issue of property rights, have created practical difficulties for the conduct of a number of activities there.  This has included difficulty in creating a system for the licensing of aquaculture by the Loughs Agency in accordance with the intentions of the Irish and British Governments under the 1999 Agreement establishing Implementation Bodies.  Discussions between relevant Departments and agencies on both sides of the border on specific issues have been taking place on a case by case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">Recently the two Governments agreed to address issues relating to both Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough in the round.  A first meeting of officials took place last week in London.  While the issues involved — including the roles of the Crown Estate and all other relevant actors — are complex I am satisfied that both sides are committed to resolving them as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1077">Ireland's commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights has been and will continue to be a central component of our foreign policy. Successive Irish Governments have consistently stated the belief that the protection and promotion of international human rights is vital.  While different approaches to human rights may exist from one culture to another, international human rights standards are universal, indivisible, interdependent and inter-related, as outlined in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">States acquire international obligations in relation to human rights, either through ratification of an international treaty or through international customary law.  The Irish Government is of the belief that all states must continuously endeavour to better uphold and comply with the human rights obligations which are entrusted to them.  National history or cultural practices are not an excuse for non-compliance with states' international human rights obligations. However, such factors can help explain why human rights standards have not been respected and should be considered when seeking to identify the most effective way for a state to implement its international human rights obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">There is a variety of options which can be explored when responding to the human rights situation in other countries, according to the circumstances of the individual country in question. When considering which approach to take, Ireland and the European Union consider the degree to which a country's human rights record is improving over time and its willingness to interact with the international community, in particular the United Nations, on human rights questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">Sometimes condemnation on its own, or the isolation of a country in response to human rights violations, is not the most effective means of securing an improvement in the situation.  Engagement and co-operation can often be a better way of moving towards the further promotion and protection of human rights. It is for this reason that Ireland has supported the development and continuance of EU human rights dialogues with third countries which allow for structured engagement with those countries on human rights issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_1082">Work on the definition of Ireland's priorities for its Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013 has been underway for some time and is now intensifying.  The Government is seeking to ensure that the priorities reflect the main issues that concern citizens and Governments in Ireland and other Member States of the European Union which include, first and foremost, tackling the economic crisis and developing policies that restore strong, sustainable economic growth, and create jobs.  Other clear priorities include the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) which sets out the EU budget from 2014-2020.  This in turn will have a direct bearing on other issues of national importance, including the Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">Our Presidency will also coincide with the European Semester, the annual process of coordinating Member States' economic and budgetary policies.  There will also be a strong focus on securing agreement on Horizon 2020, the future framework programme for research and innovation which can make a critical contribution to boosting the EU's competitiveness and creating jobs.  Climate change and environmental issues are also likely to figure prominently on the EU agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">These are just some of the major issues that are likely to figure prominently on the Irish Presidency agenda.  The Irish programme will also reflect the progress made by the Danish and Cypriot Presidencies in key areas in 2012, and will need to be flexible enough to respond to unforeseen events.  The Government will continue throughout 2012 to develop and refine Ireland's priorities. It will also consult and work closely with the Commission and the European Parliament and with our European partners.  The Government will seek to ensure that its priorities demonstrate that Ireland remains a constructive, active and committed member that belongs at heart of the EU decision-making process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1087">Presidential and Parliamentary elections in the Palestinian Authority have been due for some time. Elections have been scheduled or announced on a number of occasions and for various dates, but these have fallen through. The problems relate to the difficulty of holding elections across the entirety of the Occupied Territories, and specifically in Gaza, which is under the de facto control of the Hamas movement and not the Palestinian Authority, which remains in control of the West Bank. In the absence of a lasting agreement between the Fatah and Hamas movements, it has been impossible for the Central Electoral Commission of the Palestinian Authority to operate in Gaza, and so to prepare for elections there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1088">Recent progress in reconciliation talks between Fatah and Hamas have renewed hopes that elections may soon be scheduled, and there is a growing acceptance that they cannot be postponed indefinitely. May 2012 has been spoken of in this context, but that date has not yet been firmly announced. It is thought more likely, to allow the Electoral Commission time to prepare, that an election announced now would fall slightly later than May.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">The European Union has long planned to send an electoral observation mission to the Palestinian elections, whenever they are scheduled, and Ireland has actively supported the maintenance of this as a priority in the EU's electoral planning. It is obviously not easy to earmark resources for elections which are not yet scheduled and have been repeatedly postponed, as there are many other elections elsewhere which should if possible also be attended by EU observers.  It would be my intention that Ireland nominate suitably qualified individuals to serve as electoral observers with any EU electoral mission which may eventually be deployed to monitor Palestinian presidential and parliamentary elections.</p>

            <p eId="para_1093">Addressing the situation of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements with the United States remain important priorities for the Government in its relationship with the US Administration and Congress.  The Taoiseach and I discussed these issues with President Obama when we met with him on 23 May last year in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">During the course of 2011, I also discussed the issue of Irish immigration with Secretary of State Clinton and Senator Patrick Leahy, Chair of the Senate Judiciary committee.  I also met with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and the Coalition of Irish Centres in New York.  The Government has provided almost $365,000 to support that organisation since 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">A particular focus of the Government's efforts has been on the achievement of E-3 visas for Ireland.  These E-3s are non-immigrant worker visas, renewable every two years and are currently available to Australian citizens.  Provisions which would allow Irish nationals to apply for E-3 visas were amongst those included in the comprehensive immigration reform Bill as introduced in the US Senate last June by senior Democrats, including Senators Harry Reid, Charles Schumer and Robert Menendez.  This Bill would also have helped to resolve the position of the undocumented, including the Irish.  Unfortunately, and not least due to the current US domestic political climate and the Presidential elections taking place there later this year, to date that Bill has not yet received the additional bi-partisan support which it would require to make further progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">Another significant development occurred at the end of November when draft legislation entitled the ‘Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act' (Bill No. HR 3012) emerged from the House of Representatives. Although the political climate for any immigration reform measures remains challenging, the broad bi-partisan support which this draft legislation secured suggested that there might be scope to make progress on Irish E-3s.  In early December, Senators Schumer, Leahy and Durbin, all of whom hold leadership positions on the Democratic side of the Senate, came together to co-sponsor a further version of the ‘Fairness' legislation that would include provision under which Irish nationals could apply for up to 10,500 E-3 visas each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">The Schumer/Leahy/Durbin Bill (number S.1983) also included ‘administrative waiver' provisions which would allow undocumented Irish migrants in the US to apply for E-3s without suffering certain applicable penalties for having been out of status.  Separately, Senators Scott Brown and Mark Kirk of the Republican Party tabled further stand-alone legislative proposals (Bill number S. 2005) that would also make Irish nationals eligible to apply for up to 10,500 E-3 visas each year but which do not include the additional ‘administrative waiver' provisions.  Both Bills have since been referred for examination by the US Senate's Judiciary Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098">While recent developments have been encouraging, the prospects for these Bills are uncertain.  Acting on my behalf, our Embassy in Washington, working with the Irish-American immigration community, continues to engage on an ongoing basis with the US Administration at senior levels and with both parties in the US Congress.  I will also be in Washington in early February where I will be engaging with key players to further advance our support for an Irish E-3 visa.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe Costello)</from>
            <p eId="para_1103">Ethiopia has been a priority country for the Government's aid programme since 1994, and we have been following closely the development of the Ethiopian Government's "villagisation" resettlement programme.  The NGO Human Rights Watch has recently published a report which claims that there have been human rights violations as a result of the programme, in the Gambella, region of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">In our ongoing dialogue with the Government of Ethiopia, they have stated that they view the programme as a key element in the development of some of the poorest regions, enabling the effective delivery of basic services through the voluntary resettlement of vulnerable communities.  The areas where the villagisation programme is being implemented are also among those earmarked by the Government for commercial land leasing and mining exploration.  However, the Ethiopian Government denies that an objective of the programme is to free up land for these purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">We take very seriously any allegations of human rights violations, and we are examining the latest Human Rights Watch report carefully, through our Embassy in Addis Ababa and in consultation with other international donors.  Officials from our Embassy have visited some of the areas involved to ascertain first-hand the validity of the allegations in relation to the villagisation programme.  These visits have not substantiated the claims of forced movements of communities.  However, we have expressed our concern to the Ethiopian Government at the scale and speed of the programme, and we are continuing to follow the situation closely, with Government, local communities and civil society organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">The Human Rights Watch report claims that aid from international donors is being used to fund the villagisation programme.  I can assure the House that Ireland's development assistance is not funding the resettlement of people or supporting the construction of new schools or health clinics as part of this programme. We do contribute to the costs of salaries of essential workers, such as teachers and nurses, throughout the entire country.  We can be proud that this support has contributed to the rapid improvement in human development for the Ethiopian people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">Ireland's engagement with Ethiopia is having a real impact in the lives of the most vulnerable people and communities.  The focus of our programme is on eliminating hunger and building basic services for the poorest and most vulnerable.  Our relations with the Government have always involved open and frank discussions at political and official levels.  As recently as last November, a delegation from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade had the opportunity to raise a broad range of issues including alleged human rights abuses at the highest political level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108">During my visit to Ethiopia in the coming days, I look forward to seeing the impact of Ireland's development programme, and emphasising the importance which we place on good governance, transparency and human rights.  I also look forward to open and honest discussions with the Ethiopian authorities on all current issues, including allegations which have been made in relation to the human rights situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1130">The current rate of Stamp Duty on transfers of residential property is 1% on properties valued up to €1m and 2% on any balance over €1m.  Given the low headline rate, I have no plans at present to provide a Stamp Duty exemption such as is suggested.  The tax code contains a number of credits, allowances, reliefs and exemptions for people with disabilities.  In addition, parents/guardians and persons who care for dependent relatives may also qualify for relief from tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">These include generally available reliefs such as medical expenses relief, and credits and allowances specific to people with disabilities and their families, such as incapacitated child tax credit or dependent relative tax credit.  There is also tax relief available for covenants drawn up for permanently incapacitated persons, and exemption from Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) for permanently incapacitated persons in certain circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132">Regarding the return of tax exemptions on vehicles for wheelchair users to which the Deputy refers, I assume him to mean reliefs available under the Disabled Drivers and Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme.  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners, who administer the scheme, that there has been no withdrawal of tax exemptions to those persons who have already established eligibility to obtain reliefs under the scheme, in accordance with the terms of the regulations.  There has, however, been a change in administrative practice, to ensure that the provisions of SI 353/1994 are being adhered to correctly.  It is important to note, however, that appropriately qualified drivers and passengers will continue to be able to avail of the scheme, but must accept that stricter interpretation of the provisions than has heretofore been the case will be applied.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1135">I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 122 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax, and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products, that the strategy employed by Revenue to tackle this illicit trade is multi-faceted. It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and inland, in order to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1137">Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises. Since mid-2010, Revenue has conducted a series of nationwide intensive tobacco "blitz"-type operations, concentrating additional Revenue resources at ports, airports and at selected inland retail points, including markets, for the purpose of identifying and seizing illicit tobacco products. To date, Revenue has conducted nine such national tobacco "blitz" operations resulting in the seizure of over 34.6m cigarettes and 1,715 kgs of tobacco. These intensive operations are of course additional to Revenue's ongoing day-to-day operations targeting illicit tobacco product.</p>
            <p eId="para_1138">Revenue also carries out regular multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations. Revenue both provides and receives intelligence from other Customs Administrations and works closely with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in its efforts to tackle the illicit sale of tobacco at an international level.  This international cooperation and sharing of intelligence and expertise plays an important role in combating illegal tobacco smuggling on a global basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">The Revenue Commissioners have established a high-level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level, to examine the risks related to tobacco products tax evasion and to oversee and optimise the detection of contraband and counterfeit tobacco products. This group has promoted a number of initiatives aimed at counteracting the illicit trade in tobacco. These include the adoption of a comprehensive tobacco strategy, which is underpinned by annual action plans.  This 3-year (2011-2013) strategy, which is published on Revenue's website <i>www.revenue.ie</i>, includes a number of programmes which are designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for contraband tobacco in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">Revenue's strategic-level plans include the taking of steps, to ensure that the legitimate trade remains compliant, delivering more effective and visible interventions through enhanced capability and better deployment of its resources, further development of cooperation and intelligence sharing at organisational, national and international level, a commitment to prosecute all serious cases of tobacco tax evasion and a focus, in partnership with other Government agencies, on reducing the demand for contraband tobacco.</p>

With regard to the Deputy's question on the subject of the testing of tobacco, the Commissioners inform me that the testing of seized cigarette and tobacco products is not, as a matter of course, carried out by the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">Legally binding agreements have been signed between the European Commission and member states (including Ireland) on the one hand and the four major global tobacco manufacturers on the other, with the objective of instituting formal cooperation arrangements to combat cigarette and tobacco smuggling.  The manufacturers include Philip Morris International (PMI), Japan Tobacco International (JTI), British American Tobacco (BAT) and Imperial Tobacco Ltd (ITL).  The agreements include the provision of enhanced support to European law enforcement bodies in the battle against the illegal trade in tobacco products.  This support also includes the testing on request of selected seized tobacco products to establish whether they are genuine or counterfeit. Under these agreements, the four tobacco manufacturers appear before representatives of the European Commission and the member states on an annual basis  to report on the progress of the agreed cooperation  commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">In addition to this, Revenue has signed Memoranda of Understanding with two of the main cigarette manufacturers, ITL and JTI, and is in the process of agreeing Memoranda of Understanding with PMI and BAT, to further cooperation in relation to the illicit tobacco trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">Where large consignments bearing established brand names are seized, test samples are forwarded to the relevant tobacco brand manufacturer, who, as the legal intellectual property rights holder, confirms in accordance with the Europe-wide agreements, whether or not the seized product is counterfeit.  For logistical and resource reasons, the more numerous small seizures of tobacco products are not forwarded for individual testing.   All contraband tobacco is liable to seizure as untaxed product smuggled into the State irrespective of whether it consists of genuine or counterfeit product.</p>

            <p eId="para_1264">As the Deputies will be aware, the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance received a number of letters from the ECB during November 2010. Some of these are already in the public domain, and details of those are set out below.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">A letter dated 2nd November 2010 concerned the extension of the Irish State guarantee of certain liabilities of credit institutions. This letter is in the public domain and a copy has been forwarded to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">A letter dated 18th November 2010 concerned the national implementation of Directive 2009/44/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 6 May 2009 amending Directive 98/26/EC on settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems and Directive 2002/47/EC on financial collateral arrangements as regards linked systems and credit claims. This letter is in the public domain and a copy has been forwarded to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1267">As I outlined in reply to PQ No. 155 on 28 June 2011, in relation to other correspondence, during an ongoing crisis, it is important for relationships between institutions to be developed, in order to allow for confidential negotiations to take place, especially on particularly sensitive issues. This is particularly the case in relation to the Irish authorities dealing with the ECB. It is normal practice for states to protect the confidentiality of these discussions, and in fact is usually enshrined in the rules of association of institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">Indeed, this is reflected in the Freedom of Information Act, which provides for exemptions for records relating to, for example, information received in confidence, commercially sensitive information and the financial and economic interests of the state in sections 24, 26 and 31. These factors counterbalance the public interest, protecting the ability of the Government when negotiating or deliberating on matters of national importance. It is considered that release of these records would impact on the integrity and viability of the decision-making process to a significant degree without a countervailing benefit to the public, and would prejudice our relationship with the ECB.  For this reason, I do not intend to release this information.</p>

            <p eId="para_1270">As the Deputy is aware, Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited changed its name to Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited (trading as IBRC) on 14 October 2011. The Bank has informed me that a significant part of this renaming and rebranding project was managed using internal resources. The main components of the project included the development of a new brand identity for IBRC and the consolidation of multiple websites into one site. The timing of Bank's name change was scheduled to coincide with the appointment of a new non-executive director to IBRC, Mr. Oliver Ellingham in order to minimise the replacement cost of printed materials.</p>
            <p eId="para_1271">The Bank has indicated that two principal elements of this project necessitated external costs to be incurred. They were: The development of a <i>new brand identity for IBRC:</i> External expertise was used to deliver identity guidelines for IBRC and the necessary redesign of over 200 pieces of print collateral currently used by the Bank. A minimum amount of internal signage was also required. The cost of this external design work and signage was €30,645.</p>
            <p eId="para_1272">The development of a <i>new website for IBRC</i>: An approved external supplier was used to consolidate the existing websites of Anglo and INBS and implement the changed name of the Bank, across a number of geographies, into one group site <i>www.ibrc.ie</i>. The cost of the external support for that project was  €7,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1273">The total cost of the renaming project undertaken was therefore approximately €38,000 (ex-vat). Finally, it should be noted that separate to the renaming of the Bank, as part of the broader integration of INBS into the new entity, the Bank is further developing its website so that it will be suitable for the combined entity's approved long term business objectives. This project is scheduled to be delivered this month with estimated external costs of approximately €60,000. One of the key objectives of this project is to save IBRC considerable site update and maintenance costs in the future.</p>

Revenue is charged with responsibility for the timely collection and recovery of taxes and duties due to the Exchequer.

Delay in payment or indeed non-payment of tax impacts on the level of Government borrowing and associated public debt interest additionally those who delay payment secure unfair competitive advantage over compliant businesses.

            <p eId="para_1283">The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (the Code) applies to mortgage lending activities with borrowers in respect of their principal private residence in the State. Compliance with the Code is mandatory on all mortgage lenders registered with the Central Bank. The Code provides a number of protections to borrowers. These include the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) to deal with mortgage customers who are in arrears or pre-arrears, the establishment of a dedicated Appeals Support Unit and a separate internal appeals process by lenders to deal with individuals on a case by case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">Provision 9 of the Code restricts lenders from imposing charges and/or surcharge interest on arrears outstanding in MARP cases. The Central Bank notifies each lender individually of the charges to which provision 9 applies by means of a letter of Direction. A copy of the Code is available on the Central Bank's website <i>www.centralbank.ie</i>.   With regard to monitoring compliance with the Code, in July 2011 the Central Bank published the findings of a themed inspection of mortgage lenders which examined compliance with provision 9 and related individual Letters of Direction that were issued in December 2010.  The Central Bank has also published on its website a copy of “Mortgage Arrears—a Consumer Guide to Dealing with your Lender”.</p>
            <p eId="para_1285">The Deputy will be aware of the report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Mortgage Arrears which was published last October. The report sets out a number of recommendations to address the situation of those in mortgage arrears. The report stated that the issue of mortgage difficulty can only be addressed in an efficient way on a case by case basis. Arising from the report, a number of developments are underway that will be of assistance to mortgage holders experiencing significant difficulty.</p>

The offer of the three year LTRO is open to eurosystem counterparties with suitable collateral and has no connection or relationship with the deleverage plans of the banks mentioned in the question.

While the reduced rate applies to agricultural diesel in Ireland, the majority of EU Member States apply much higher VAT rates to agricultural diesel than Ireland.   Ireland can avail of this reduced rate because of a provision, under Article 118 of the EU VAT Directive that provides that where a reduced rate applied to a good or service on 1 January 1991, Member States can continue to avail of that reduced rate. However, this provision is restricted in that only a rate of 12% or more may apply to domestic fuels.  Furthermore, as the VAT Directive provides that Member States may only avail of two reduced VAT rates, and Ireland already applies two reduced VAT rates of 9% and 13.5%, it is not possible to introduce a third VAT rate on agricultural diesel.</p>

            <p eId="para_1918">I am advised that the process of issuing new bonds is normally through underwriting, where one or more securities firms or banks form a syndicate buying the entire bond issue from the issuer and then re-selling to investors. Primary issuance is arranged by these syndicates who contact potential investors and advise the bond issuer in terms of timing, tenor and pricing of the bond issue. The bond issuer will likely have little knowledge of the original owners of the bonds; also these initial investors may over time sell the bonds to other investors.   Bonds are usually issued in bearer form which means that the purchasers of the bonds are unknown, with the bonds usually held by a securities depository company (e.g. Euroclear and Clearstream). When paying interest and principal the bond issuer will transfer the required funds to the securities depository company who in turn will pay the funds through to the bondholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">The function of the securities depository company is to receive the appropriate interest or principal payment for the entire bond issue from the issuer and to distribute the required amounts to the individual bondholders. This is a standard process for all such issuances. Therefore throughout this entire process the bond issuer is unaware of the individual bondholders' details. Accordingly, I am advised that IBRC is not in a position to ascertain the identities of the current holders of these bonds.</p>

In particular, the 13.5% reduced VAT rate applies to home heating oil under paragraph 17(4) of Schedule 3. In this regard, while the recent Budget increased the standard VAT rate from 21% to 23%, there was no change to the 13.5% reduced VAT rate and as such the Budget change had no impact on the VAT charged on home heating oil.</p>

For example, for services charges paid in respect of the years 2007 to 2010, the tax relief is given in the tax years 2008 to 2011 is the lesser of—</p>

            <p eId="para_1965">NAMA advises me that it does not pay salaries to debtors or their employees, as NAMA is not their employer.  NAMA informs me that it is the agency's practice to allow debtor companies to retain overhead costs from rental or other income that are produced by their assets, where this is necessary for that company's operations. In a minority of cases where assets are under development and not yet producing income, funds are advanced to debtors to cover essential overheads pending the completion of the project concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1966">NAMA assures me that the level of overheads is only agreed following a thorough and rigorous evaluation of the debtor's business plan by NAMA and that each cost element is reduced to the minimum. The level of overheads sanctioned by NAMA typically represent very significant reductions on the levels which prevailed in the past. Indeed, I am informed that NAMA on occasions has looked for and obtained a reduction of 50% to 75% in overhead costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1967">As part of these agreements on overheads, NAMA sets a cap on the salary level of the principal debtor but it does not specify salary levels for any other employees.

            <p eId="para_1975">Irish VAT law is subject to the provisions of the EU VAT Directive with which it must comply.  Article 110 of that Directive provides that Member States may continue to apply reduced rates, including the zero rate and exemptions from VAT, where such reduced rates or exemptions were in place at 1 January 1991.  As Ireland was not applying an exemption from VAT to admissions to pet farms at that date an exemption cannot apply to those admissions.  Up to 31 December 2011 admissions to historic houses and gardens, and open and pet farms were treated for VAT purposes as lettings and regarded as exempt from VAT.  Having regard to certain decisions of the European Court of Justice, where a letting was defined for VAT purposes, it was decided that such admissions could no longer be treated as exempt lettings and they became subject to VAT from 1 January 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1976">While admissions to pet farms became liable to VAT from 1 January last, I announced in the Budget that the VAT rate applicable to such admissions would be the reduced rate of 9% and not the standard 23% VAT rate, and this will be provided for in the forthcoming Finance Bill.  Schedule 1 to the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 does provide an exemption for the provision of children's or young people's education by educational establishments recognised by the State.  This exemption does not extend to admissions to pet farms for educational school tours.</p>

            <p eId="para_1978">The decision to apply to the Court for the appointment of a special manager is a matter for the Governor of the Central Bank, following consultation with me as Minister of Finance.  On 13 January 2012, the Central Bank of Ireland secured a High Court Order for the appointment of a Special Manager to Newbridge Credit Union.  The Central Bank states that a number of specific issues arose in relation to the finalisation of the 2011 financial statements; however, the draft accounts provided by Newbridge Credit Union show a solvent position.</p>
            <p eId="para_1979">This action has been taken to allow the Credit Union to continue to operate as normal and to protect members' savings.  The special manager replaces the management and Board of Newbridge Credit Union and his primary role is to establish the financial position and bring forward a business plan.  In accordance with the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011, the remuneration payable to the special manager was included in the special management order approved by the Court on foot of the Central Bank's application.  The order provides that for the first month of his appointment, the special manager shall be remunerated on the basis of €423 per hour.  Under the order, any payment to the special manager is subject to the approval of the Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1980">Newbridge Credit Union has 14 days to appeal the decision to the High Court.  This appeals period expires on 27 January 2012.  I believe that it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the issues raised in the question during the 14 day window during which Newbridge Credit Union may appeal this decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_2008">I understand that there are no particular requirements in place regarding the clearing of social welfare cheques.  The Irish Paper Clearing Company Limited (IPCC) is responsible for the clearing and settlement of cheques in Ireland.  The IPCC system provides the mechanism through which the participating banks exchange funds to honour cheques written by their customers, both corporate and individual.  The ‘Rules for Clearing' issued by IPCC govern the process whereby these payment instruments are exchanged for value between participants; the rules also govern the processes for dealing with unpaid items and for rectifying errors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2009">The clearing cycle for cheques drawn on other banks, or on other branches of the same bank, is normally three business days.  However, it should be noted that in some circumstances (in particular, where the payer's and payee's accounts are with the same branch of the same bank) the clearing cycle can be shorter than this.  There may be a shorter clearing period for social welfare cheques presented at Bank of Ireland branches as these cheques are drawn against the Department of Social Protection Bank of Ireland accounts.  Any bank or financial institution outside of the IPCC framework may have a longer cheque clearance cycle.  A list of IPCC participants is available directly from IPSO at <i>www.ipso.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2010">As to the related matter of when a bank will permit a customer to draw against a cheque lodged to his or her account, this is a matter for decision by each bank based on its own risk management arrangements, and would be outlined in the relevant terms and conditions.  I should note that this question also highlights the disadvantages of the continued high usage of cheques as a method of payment.  Greater use of electronic payment transactions have the potential to achieve significant savings for individual businesses; in particular electronic payments processing can realise significantly improved efficiency and improvements in the quality of customer service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2011">Under the European Communities (Payment Services) Regulation, 2009, (S.I. No. 383 of 2009), electronic payments are subject to maximum time limits for the transfer of funds between accounts.  From 1 January 2012, a payment must be credited to the account of the payee's bank no later than the end of the next business day.  I also refer the Deputy to the answer to Question No. 128 of 11 January 2012 relating to Central Bank proposals to prepare a National Payments plan to secure a decisive shift to electronic payments resulting in a reduced usage of cash and cheques in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_2015">There is no standard approach by financial institutions which involves debt forgiveness.  Where debt forgiveness has occurred the particular circumstances are stated to be exceptional and each such situation is addressed on an individual basis.  In general terms the approach, across financial institutions is to proactively work with the customer to find a solution which is practical for both and within the contractual arrangements between the borrower and the lender.</p>
            <p eId="para_2016">There are a range of strategies available to allow institutions to work constructively with customers in loan forbearance/restructuring.  These include extending the loan repayment period term, agreeing interest only periods, etc.  These strategies are aligned with the relevant codes of conduct e.g. the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears issued by the Central Bank.  Financial institutions write off debt in their accounts annually.  However this is not a proxy for debt forgiveness. It represents a point in time when, having pursued all avenues of recovery, there is no real prospect of recovery of the debt.  The debt still remains collectable but for accounting purposes is not held in the institutions balance sheet.</p>
            <p eId="para_2017">I have been informed by the institutions that information in relation to debt that has been forgiven cannot be provided for a number of reasons including:</p>
            <p eId="para_2018">The information has not been publically disclosed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2019">Extraction of the information as requested would be very difficult to verify.</p>
            <p eId="para_2020">The information is commercially sensitive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2021">Any such information, if disclosed, would also need to be released to the market in light of Stock Exchange Obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2022">In relation to mortgage lending the Deputy will be aware the Mortgage Arrears Expert Group, during its period of research, could not identify any arrangements internationally that could be characterised as mortgage debt forgiveness schemes, with the exception of parts of the US where non-recourse mortgage lending applies.  The group did not recommend a formal debt forgiveness scheme having regard to the broad range of policy considerations which are outlined in the main body of the report.  The Central bank is currently reviewing lenders mortgage resolution strategies and, as part of the "Keane Report" there is no blanket debt forgiveness planned.</p>

         the level of engagement between him and the State guaranteed banks in terms of potential large scale debt write-downs of loans by the covered banks; the mechanisms that exist to ensure that debt write-downs do not take place at effective cost to the Irish Exchequer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2026">As the Deputy is aware there is on-going and detailed engagement between my Department and the covered institutions.  The current and projected capital requirements of the institutions form part of this engagement these and are monitored and assessed on an on-going basis.  The Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR) carried out in 2011 by the Central Bank independently assessed the capital requirements having regard, among other things, to the asset quality and the potential impact of such asset value/quality in base and stressed case scenarios.</p>
            <p eId="para_2027">The Central Bank of Ireland has informed me that in October 2011, the EBA conducted a review of the capital requirements of the 91 European banks that participated in the 2011 EU-wide stress test against a more stringent set of conditions compared to the 2010 EBA stress test, for example incorporating a capital buffer against sovereign debt exposures and the removal of certain regulatory capital filters) and a Core Tier 1 ratio of 9%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2028">As noted by the Central Bank of Ireland, the results of the EBA tests show that the Irish banks meet the stress requirements and do not require additional capital beyond the requirement set in the Financial Measures Programme published in March 2011.  The results of the EBA stress tests take account of the recapitalisation measures announced following the Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR).</p>
            <p eId="para_2029">The Irish banks have been recapitalised, following the Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR) process in March 2011, and are required to maintain a minimum Core Tier 1 Ratio of 10.5% on an on-going basis.  Further the Central Bank has also advised me that as agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) with our external partners, that the PCAR will be conducted as an annual stress test of the capital resources of the domestic banks.</p>

         if he will clarify a matter (details supplied) regarding the fair deal scheme.

            <p eId="para_2031">The matter of the proceeds of a family home depends on the circumstances of the case.  However, I understand the Deputy is concerned about the tax treatment of capital in the case where a family home is sold.  I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that under the Fair Deal Scheme the recipient of nursing home care is treated as accepting a loan from the HSE.  He /she undertakes that the loan will be discharged after death by his/her Personal Representative.  As part of the loan process a charge, similar to a mortgage, is placed on the home, and the house is security for eventual repayment after death.</p>
            <p eId="para_2032">The capital gains tax treatment of a disposal of the home by the Personal Representative is no different in this situation than would apply if the Fair Deal Scheme had not operated.  A Capital Gains Tax charge will not arise on the death of the deceased.  The Personal Representative will sell the house (if the 15% due under the Fair Deal Scheme is not otherwise capable of being paid by him out of the person's estate).  For capital gains tax purposes, a Personal Representative takes assets at market value at the date of death.  Any gain/loss is calculated as the difference between this market value at the date of death and the sale proceeds, less allowable costs of the disposal.  If it is the case that the house is sold for less than the market value at the date of death then no capital gains tax liability will arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2033">The Personal Representative is responsible for paying any capital gains tax resulting from any gain on the disposal of the house.  The proceeds from the sale of the house and any other assets of the person less the capital gains tax paid will form part of the person's estate.  The 15% due under the Fair Deal Scheme is, I understand, payable out of the person's estate before it can be distributed among beneficiaries in the usual manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_2034">Capital Acquisitions Tax is the overall name for both Inheritance Tax and Gift Tax.  Only the net proceeds of the sale of the house will form part of the deceased persons estate for Inheritance Tax purposes, (having deducted from the sale proceeds any Capital Gains Tax paid when the property was sold and also having deducted from the sale proceeds the amount of the sale proceeds being paid over to the HSE).  The net proceeds of sale, as stated, will then form part of the deceased persons estate, along with any other assets owned by the deceased.  There is no Inheritance Tax on assets inherited by a spouse or by a civil partner of the deceased.</p>
            <p eId="para_2035">Apart from the exemption for spouses and civil partners, there are three tax — free thresholds — known as Group thresholds — for other beneficiaries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2036"><i>Group A: €250,000 —</i>applies where the beneficiary is a child ( including adopted child, step-child and certain foster children) or minor child of the deceased. Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute from a child.</p>
            <p eId="para_2037"><i>Group B: €33,208 —</i>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the deceased.</p>
            <p eId="para_2038"><i>Group C: €16,604 —</i>applies in all other cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2039">If the value of gifts and inheritances received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 exceeds his or her Group threshold, then a rate of CAT of 30% will apply on the difference.</p>

            <p eId="para_2043">The Department is currently finalising new Relationship Framework documents for each financial institution in which the State has a shareholding.  The framework documents, which generally formed part of the recapitalisation agreements, will define the relationship between the Minister and the relevant institutions.  These documents will be drafted and structured to ensure that the institutions will operate on a commercial basis and independent of the Minister in respect of their day to day operations.  The role of the Minister will also be set out and will reflect his shareholding in the relevant institution and also the other support provided to that institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2044">In the case of IBRC there is an existing Relationship Framework in place.  Following the combination of Anglo and INBS the existing Relationship Framework applied to the merged entity.  This document sets out the respective roles and responsibilities of both the Minister and the bank. In general terms the Board is responsible for the day to day operation of the bank and the Minister as sole shareholder retains certain "reserved matters" over which his express permission or approval is required.  The Relationship Framework is currently being revised to reflect the changed situation following the combination of Anglo and INBS to form IBRC.</p>

            <p eId="para_2046">The legal services firm referred to by the Deputy have been engaged by my Department since September 2008 to provide advice in relation to general banking matters including those referred to in the Deputy's Question.  In March 2010 certain banking system functions of the Minister for Finance were delegated by Government Order to the National Treasury Management Agency.  The delegation of banking system functions to the NTMA ended in August 2011 with the secondment of the NTMA Banking Unit to the Department of Finance Banking Division's new Shareholding Management Unit.  Following the transfer the NTMA continued to pay to the legal services firm professional fees incurred by the new Shareholding Management Unit to end 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2047">Professional fees paid to the legal services firm by my Department and the NTMA in relation to the issues raised by the Deputy are being collated and I will forward this information to the Deputy as soon as possible.  The Deputy may wish to note that the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission paid the legal services firm €1.25m (inc VAT) for the legal due diligence exercise on AIB carried out on the Commission's behalf at the request of the Minister for Finance prior to the €3.5 billion investment in AIB by the Fund at the direction of the Minister for Finance.  The Fund received €30 million in arrangement fees from AIB in respect of this transaction.</p>

         if, in view of the progress made to date in respect of reaching the deleveraging target set for AIB, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life and Permanent, an extension to the timetable would ease the pressure on credit availability to consumers and business providing assistance to the domestic economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2132">As the Deputy will be aware the covered banks are required to deleverage circa €70bn of assets by 31 December 2013.  To date significant progress has been made in that regard:  The two pillar banks met the 2011 deleveraging targets with almost €15 billion of these assets sold at significantly better pricing than anticipated in the PCAR/PLAR 2011 exercise.  Total deleveraging achieved across government supported banks was €40.5 billion through end November 2011 against full year 2011 expected deleveraging of €34.7 billion.  In addition, Irish banks enjoyed deposit inflows in the final quarter of 2011 despite the very difficult international environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2133">It is important to maintain the progress in downsizing our banking system which was made in 2011, and we are working to refine the deleveraging framework to minimize risks to lending to the economy and discourage excessive competition for deposits.  Nonetheless, it is also important, as part of the overall strategy to maintain progress in regard to deleveraging and this momentum will ensure that banks will better able to support the real economy in the shortest possible timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_2134">As things stand the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the next three years.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period.  The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  The position will be monitored on an on-going basis and any adjustments required will be considered and addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_2161">There is no deduction from the Pension of the person referred to by the Deputy for the value referenced by him in the details supplied.  However, there is a deduction for a slightly higher amount which is in respect of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR).  The Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) applies to the pensions of civil and public servants with effect from 1 January 2011.  This measure was introduced under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010 (No. 38 of 2010).  The attachment contains further details on the Public Service Pension Reduction.</p>

              <i>Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) — Frequently Asked Questions</i>
            </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2163">1. What is the basic design of the public service pension reduction?</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2164">The measure is a once-off reduction applied to the gross annual pension of public service pensioners by reference to a set of rates and income bands. In this sense it is not a levy in the way that the public service pension-related deduction is often called the pension levy.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2165">It will apply to existing pensioners and persons retiring up to end-February 2012. Retirees thereafter will not be affected, but their pensions will be lower as they will be affected by the January 2010 pay cuts.  The reduction has a proportionately greater impact on persons with more substantial pensions. Pensions below €12,000 will be exempt.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2166">2. From what date will the reduction apply?</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2167">The Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) applies to the pensions of civil and public servants with effect from 1 January 2011.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2168">When making the first pension payments in the year 2011, public service employers must ensure that the PSPR only applies in respect of the days of the first 2011 pay period that fall in 2011.  This means that any part of such 2011 pension payments attributable to the year 2010 must not be subjected to the PSPR.</p>

            <p eId="para_2241">However, the qualifying criteria for the special rate of grant for students applying under the 2011 student grant scheme are: 1. Student must qualify for the ordinary rate of grant; 2. Total reckonable income must not exceed €22,703. 3. On the 31st December 2010, the reckonable income must include an eligible long-term payment prescribed under the scheme.  I have no plans to change these criteria.  An applicant may appeal the decision of the grant awarding authority to its appeals officer.  Where the appeals officer decides to reject the appeal, the applicant may appeal this decision to my Department or the independent appeals board, as appropriate.</p>

The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to €6.5 million annually. This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.</p>

            <p eId="para_2283">The Forward Planning Section of my Department has examined all areas of the country to determine where additional school provision will be required at both primary and post-primary level up to 2017.  The data indicates that there will be a modest increase in enrolments at both primary and post-primary level in the Ballina area.  However, it is anticipated that this increase may be catered for by existing school capacity.  Forward Planning Section will continue to monitor enrolments in the area with a view to determining if expansion may be required into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2285">Changes to the School Transport Schemes, including the ‘Closed School Rule (CSR)', were announced in Budget 2011 and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the Scheme.  The Deputy will be aware that from September 2011, the distance criterion of 3.2 kilometres was applied nationally to all pupils travelling under the primary school transport scheme, including those travelling under the CSR.</p>
            <p eId="para_2286">The second element of the change is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of pupils commencing their primary education from that date. This second element will restrict school transport eligibility for those pupils entering in September 2012, to pupils who meet the distance eligibility criterion and are travelling to their nearest school. Existing eligible pupils, who are not attending their nearest school, will retain their school transport eligibility for the duration of their primary education cycle provided there are no changes to their current circumstances. Siblings of these pupils, who wish to attend the same school, may apply for concessionary transport subject to a number of terms and conditions.  In this regard, it is worth noting that the annual charge for concessionary tickets will be reduced to €100 for the 2012 school year which is the same charge that applies for eligible tickets.</p>

            <p eId="para_2288">One of the changes in the school transport scheme which took effect from the beginning of the 2011 school year was an increase from seven to ten in the minimum number of eligible pupils, residing in a distinct locality, required to establish or retain an individual school transport service.  This change now forms part of the School Transport schemes.  As is currently the position, families of eligible pupils, for whom there is no school transport service available, may apply for a remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_2294">I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 and 233 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2295">The new simplified approach to the General Allocation Model of support for schools will make it easier to automatically update it annually in line with the changes in the number of classroom teachers in each school. Schools will also have autonomy on how to deploy the resource between language support and learning support depending on their specific needs. The arrangements for the staffing allocation under the General Allocation Model (GAM) are specifically designed to facilitate GAM hours being clustered into full-time posts — either entirely within their own school or with a nearby neighbouring school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2296">The new GAM allocations are being done in 5-hour blocks which is the equivalent of the tuition time for a full school day. Teachers that are in shared posts between schools can therefore operate local arrangements that enable their travel to a neighbouring school to be done, where possible, from the start of the school day thus avoiding loss of tuition time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2297">As part of the reforms to the teacher allocation process existing posts will be used to put in place a network of about 2,450 full-time resource posts in over 1,600 base schools throughout the country that will be allocated on a permanent basis. This approach builds on the interim arrangements that operated in 2011 but in a more structured and transparent manner. The annual changes in resource hours at individual school level will only affect where the teacher is working on any one day — not whether the base school continues to host the full-time post. This approach will introduce a greater constancy in the context of the annual allocations and redeployment process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2298">The teachers in these full-time resource posts will undertake NCSE approved (low incidence) resource hours in the base schools or in neighbouring schools. Schools are typically notified of their NCSE approved resource hours in the late Spring/early Summer period but also throughout the school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2299">Through his/her role in allocating resources the local SENO will have an oversight role in relation to the sharing arrangements between schools so that they can operate as efficiently as possible and any time loss due to travel between schools can be kept to a minimum. Schools that are unable to access their NCSE approved resource hours from this network of full-time resource posts will be allocated mainly part-time temporary posts.</p>

            <p eId="para_2310">My Department is very conscious of the potential impact on service provision of the expected increase in retirements on or before 29 February 2012. The effective management of staffing resources within Employment Control Frameworks and/or the moratorium on public sector numbers is ongoing within each organisation in the education sector, through prioritisation of work and working practices. This process is regularly monitored to ensure continued effective delivery of key services. However, unlike other parts of the public sector, our school going population is rising rapidly. Places have to be provided for the extra 70,000 pupils arriving in our schools in the next six years. Teachers will have to be appointed to teach them. As Minister for Education and Skills, I will ensure every child has a physical place in which to go to school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2311">That is why, despite the need to reduce teacher numbers and the other spending reductions that have been made, the overall number of teachers employed in our schools is about 200 below what they were in 2008. This represents a net overall reduction of about 0.3% in the overall number of teachers despite several changes to the PTR at both primary and second level.  Under the terms of the current ECF, my Department has delegated sanction to fill vacancies arising in teaching and at third level, subject to the ceiling figures for those areas not being exceeded.</p>
            <p eId="para_2312">To reduce the impact on students preparing for the State examinations, I am allowing schools to re-employ until the end of the school year teachers who retire between 1 December 2011 and 29 February 2012 and who had been teaching classes sitting State exams in 2012 before their retirement. In the case of teachers who are not teaching exam classes, replacements can be employed until the end of the school year, subject to the numbers frameworks.  It is a matter for each third level institution to manage its own retirements as they arise. They have delegated sanction to fill certain vacancies, subject to the ceiling figures set out in their individual ECF.</p>
            <p eId="para_2313">Should any organisation suffer such a level of retirements that it cannot effectively order and prioritise its work and working practices, it can apply for an exception to the moratorium from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The projected numbers of teachers who will retire between 1 January and 29 February 2012 is set out in the table. Information relating to projected retirements in the higher education sector and on the breakdown of retirement applications by grade is not readily available at this time. This information is being collated and will be forwarded as soon as possible.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_2329">I propose to take Questions Nos. 203, 206, 227 to 229, inclusive, 237 and 238 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2330">At a time of great strain in our public finances, we have to ensure that the very valuable but limited resources available for the education system are used in the best way possible.  The staffing schedule at primary level disproportionately benefits small primary schools. It is worth noting that we have 3,200 primary schools across Ireland. Over two thirds of those schools have more than 86 pupils and, as a result, have far higher average class sizes than all of the schools affected by this measure. For example a two teacher school with 32 pupils has an average class size of 1 teacher for sixteen pupils. In contrast, a typical ten teacher school with 272 pupils has an average class size of 27.2 pupils. It is important to retain a sense of perspective and balance when discussing this matter and to realise the exceptionally favourable supports my Department will continue to provide for small schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2331">For that reason, as part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014. Even when all of these phased increases are implemented, the threshold for small schools will still be significantly lower than the minimum of 28 pupils that was required for the appointment of a second teacher in schools prior to the mid-1990s.</p>
            <p eId="para_2332">The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible. If amalgamations take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by my Department.  My Department's focus is on implementing the staffing arrangements for the coming school year and I do not propose to divert scarce staffing resources to deal with the individual type queries from the Deputies.  My Department will be notifying schools in the coming weeks of the new staffing arrangements for 2012/13 school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2339">As the Deputy is aware, the Government's Medium Term Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework, which was published on 10th November last, sets out the demographic challenge facing the education system. Total enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by almost 70,000 between now and 2018 — over 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post primary — and will continue to grow up to at least 2024 at post-primary. In view of the very real need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of new schools, together with extension projects, will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.  In the context, therefore, of the financial constraints imposed by the need to prioritise available funding for the provision of school accommodation, it is not possible for me to advance with a summer works programme this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2346">The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  All schools have now received their resource teaching allocations for the current school year, based on the number of valid applications for resource teaching support received by the NCSE to 25th November, 2011, and taking into account my Department's Employment Control Framework obligations which limits the number of overall resource teaching posts which may be allocated to schools.</p>

In the interim, schools should support pupils for whom new applications are being made from their existing resource teaching allocations, until revised allocations are made for the September 2012 school year.  Where a pupil meets the criteria for Resource Teaching support, following diagnosis or enrolment to a school which does not have any existing allocation of resource teaching support, the NCSE may make an allocation for such pupils from the small pool of remaining posts which have been reserved for such emergencies or eventualities.</p>

            <p eId="para_2349">I wish to advise the Deputy that over 1,600 primary schools throughout the country will be identified as base schools for about 2,450 full-time resource teaching posts. The aim is to have a good geographic spread of full-time resource posts in base schools so that the teachers in these full-time permanent posts are in place to undertake the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) approved resource hours for pupils with low incidence special needs either in these base schools, or in neighbouring schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2350">The base schools will be selected on the basis of the number of NCSE resource hours approved for each school for the current 2011/12 school year, as at 31 December 2011, and in accordance with the criteria set out by my Departments.  However, schools will make their applications for resource teaching support to the NCSE for the coming September and will receive an actual resource teaching allocation from the NCSE, based on the number of valid applications received.  The actual resource teaching hours allocated to schools for the coming year will therefore be based on the number of valid applications received for support by the NCSE for September, regardless of where base posts are located.</p>
            <p eId="para_2351">Schools will then be able to enter into sharing arrangements for the filling of allocated hours and schools that are unable to have their NCSE approved resource hours met from the network of full-time resource only posts will be allocated mainly part-time temporary posts.  The list of base schools for the resource posts will be reviewed regularly to ensure that it reflects the needs of newly established and rapidly developing schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_2361">For student grants purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances either as students dependent on parents or a legal guardian, or as independent mature students.

The documentary evidence normally required includes utility bills, such as telephone, gas or electricity bill, evidence of registration with the Private Residential Tenancies Board or official documentation received at the address, for example, from a Government Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_2367">The Deputy will be aware that the purpose of the Home Tuition Scheme is to provide a compensatory educational service for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.  I wish to clarify for the Deputy that home tuition was not refused in respect of the child in question.  An allocation of 20 hours per week has been approved until the end of June 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2368">As home tuition takes place outside the school environment my Department's preference is that the tuition provider be a qualified teacher. Where this is not possible approval may be given for a tutor with alternative qualifications to undertake the tuition. In such scenarios approval for nominated tutors is made on a temporary basis pending a qualified teacher being sourced. In the case to which the Deputy refers the initial tutor nominated was not qualified and therefore was only approved for a limited period.   This period has been now been extended.</p>

            <p eId="para_2377">I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 and 221 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2378">The Postgraduate Applications Centre Ltd (PAC) was established in 1998 to centrally process and assess applications to PDE courses.  A common points system was devised and it has been used since.  Applicants apply to PAC online and their applications are centrally assessed by a team of assessors.  In 2006 a decision was taken, due to the large numbers of applicants with business related degrees, to put a cap on business type degrees. To this end a 10% allocation was imposed.  The decision was taken to ensure that there was an adequate supply of post primary teachers for all subject areas and to avoid an oversupply of teachers of business subjects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2379">Since the demand for places from graduates with business related degrees is high and the number of places available capped, the point scores tend to be higher than for other degree areas.  However, the Deputy should also note that demand for places on all PDE courses is very high (2,400 applications for 800 places) and a large number of successful applicants across all subject areas would have post graduate qualifications.</p>
            <p eId="para_2380">The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.  However, I have been informed that the scheme is available to eligible people on certain social welfare payments to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.  Progression has always been a fundamental condition of BTEA to ensure displacement does not occur, in that courses could be offered to students who are not progressing at the cost of students progressing from a lower education level. The BTEA scheme is in the main in line with the progression rules  in place for the student grant scheme  administered by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2381">The BTEA scheme covers a large range of full-time courses of education in approved colleges spanning basic foundation courses to third level courses across all disciplines. Courses may be pursued up to a higher diploma level in any discipline [level 8 in the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ)] or a Professional Diploma in Education hitherto known as a Graduate Diploma in Education [level 8 NFQ]. Other postgraduate qualifications including a Masters (level 9 or level 10) are not included.</p>

            <p eId="para_2388">The review of supervision and substitution and related matters commenced following the October 2008 Budget announcement in relation to supervision and substitution and the subsequent circulars issuing in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2389">The interim outcome of the review provides that the substitution cover arrangements introduced in January 2009 will continue for the 2010/2011 school year. These arrangements provide for an allocation of hours to individual schools to enable substitution cover for uncertified sick leave for teachers in post-primary schools and for official school business in post-primary schools.</p>

              <i>1. Allocation of Hours:</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_2391">Each post-primary school will be provided with a defined number of hours of substitution cover outside of the supervision and substitution scheme to provide cover for teacher absences arising from uncertified sick leave and official school business. This will be calculated on the basis of the number of pupils in a school with a minimum number of available hours for all schools with less than 100 pupils. Thus for the 2010/2011 school year 0.31 hours substitution cover will be allocated for each pupil in a school as per the school's recognised pupil enrolment on the 30th September 2009. Examples are an allocation of 62 hours for a 200 pupil school and 124 hours for a 400 pupil school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2392">The allocation of substitution hours for secondary and community/comprehensive schools will be issued by the Teacher Allocation Section before the commencement of the new school year. It will be issued in an amended staffing allocation schedule and shall be titled "substitution". The "substitution" allocation will not be taken into account in calculating Posts of Responsibility. The claims for substitution for uncertified sick leave and official school business should be made from the part time hours allocation on the On Line Claim System.</p>

            <p eId="para_2402">I fully acknowledge that the reduction in resources to second level schools will be challenging for schools. However, the change must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government  in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times. The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2403">Schools will have autonomy on how best to prioritise its available resources to meet its requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to its students. Decisions on how this is done will be taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.  I have also provided for the filling of 300 Assistant Principal posts in second-level schools over the level originally planned. This will ensure that schools have sufficient management positions to ensure appropriate supports are available for all students.</p>
            <p eId="para_2404">A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level school in DEIS, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will be given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_2408">My Department has been in contact with the Deputy's Office and I understand that the question relates to my Department's general position regarding school amalgamations. The decision making authority for any amalgamation belongs to the Patron of a school, subject to the approval of the Minister for Education and Skills. My Department's role is to facilitate any such proposal or discussions between the relevant parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_2409">The initiative for an amalgamation may come from a variety of sources, such as parents, staff, Board of Management and Patron. I have said on several occasions that any decisions to amalgamate schools will be voluntary and follow decisions taken at a local level.  The financial consequences associated with amalgamations would also have to take into account the continuing requirement to manage expenditure within the context of overall educational policy and the level of budgetary provision available at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2410">It is worth noting, however, that we have 3,200 primary schools across Ireland. Approximately, one third of those schools have less than 86 pupils and, as a result, have far lower average class sizes.  For example, a two teacher school with 32 pupils has an average class size of 1 teacher for 16 pupils. In contrast, a typical 10 teacher school with 272 pupils has an average class size of 27.2 pupils.  In that regard, the existing staffing schedule acts as a disincentive for small schools to consider amalgamations. At a time of great strain in our public finances, we have to ensure that the very valuable but limited resources available for the education system are used in the best way possible.  The Deputy will be aware that where conditions allow and the financial resources are available, school campus developments have taken place and will continue to take place which provide for the sharing of facilities by all schools on the campus.</p>

            <p eId="para_2417">The Deputy will be aware that from September 2011, the distance criterion of 3.2 kilometres was applied nationally to all pupils travelling under the primary school transport scheme, including those travelling under the Closed School Rule.</p>
            <p eId="para_2418">A further change is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of pupils commencing their primary education from that date. This second element will restrict school transport eligibility for those pupils entering in September 2012, to pupils who meet the distance eligibility criterion and are travelling to their nearest school.  It is worth noting that the annual charge for concessionary tickets will be reduced to €100 for the 2012 school year which is the same charge that applies for eligible tickets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2419">Existing eligible pupils, who are not attending their nearest school, will retain their school transport eligibility for the duration of their primary education cycle provided there are no changes to their current circumstances. There are no plans to review the changes to the Closed School Rule.</p>
            <p eId="para_2420">School amalgamation decisions are taken at a local level. The initiative for an amalgamation may come from a variety of sources, such as parents, staff, Board of Management and in particular, the Patron. The decision making authority for any amalgamation belongs to the Patron of a school, subject to the approval of the Minister for Education and Skills.  When a community makes a decision to amalgamate, clearly travel distances will be an important factor and the judgement on this will be made locally in light of local circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_2422">The new simplified approach to the General Allocation Model of support for schools will make it easier to automatically update it annually in line with the changes in the number of classroom teachers in each school. Schools will also have autonomy on how to deploy the resource between language support and learning support depending on their specific needs. The overall objective of the reforms is to enable the teacher allocation process to operate more smoothly and efficiently within the new climate of fixed ceilings on teacher numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2423">The arrangements for the staffing allocation under the General Allocation Model (GAM) are specifically designed to facilitate GAM hours being clustered into full-time posts — either entirely within their own school or with a nearby neighbouring school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2424">These reforms are intended to be neutral in relation to the overall number of teaching posts allocated to schools.  However, because many of the changes are designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools there will inevitably be some schools that will lose posts and other schools that will gain posts.</p>

The NBSS works with schools in addressing students' social, emotional, academic and behavioural needs at Level 1: whole school, Level 2: targeted intervention and Level 3: intensive individualised support.The NBSS also researches, collates and disseminates evidence that informs the development of a whole school positive behavioural approach that meets the needs of schools and provides sustainable long-term practice and outcomes.</p>

            <p eId="para_2534">As the Deputy will be aware, an extensive programme of reform has been ongoing since this Government came to office. The recently published Public Sector Reform Plan identifies the introduction of new arrangements for managing the performance and governance of State Agencies as a deliverable action. Such arrangements will include the greater use of Service Level Agreements with Departments that focus on outputs and outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2535">Taking into account work undertaken in the context of the TPS programme, it is my Department's understanding that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform intends developing guidance on best practice in relation to the governance of State Agencies and their relationships with their parent Departments and their respective roles. Officials in my Department will work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in order to progress this action. In relation to my Department the following are examples of agreements in place or being developed:</p>
            <p eId="para_2536">Arrangements for the operations of FAS are the subject of a detailed annual budget and operational policy letter, which include arrangements covering governance, spending, activity, prioritisation and other matters, and which also includes provision for ongoing monitoring of outputs and outcomes. These arrangements are the subject of frequent detailed communications and reporting throughout the year between my Department and FAS, reflecting both agreed arrangements and policy adjustments as necessary. These arrangements will be the subject of further elaboration when arrangements are finalised for the replacement of FAS with SOLAS, the new Further Education and Training Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2537">A Memorandum of Understanding is currently being finalised between my Department and the National Council for Special Education,</p>
            <p eId="para_2538">A Memorandum of Understanding between my Department and the Higher Education Authority has been finalised and will be signed shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2539">In addition, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the Further Education and Training Awards Council are soon to be amalgamated into a single agency, the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority of Ireland, and the introduction of a Service Level Agreement between my Department and the new agency will be examined following its establishment.</p>

            <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Brendan Howlin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2655">A number of reforms have been introduced in relation to the pension entitlements of TDs and Ministers.  The Deputy will be aware that the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 provided that pensions would not be payable to new Oireachtas members before 65 years of age, and under the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 2009 ministerial pensions are no longer payable to sitting Members of the Oireachtas following last year's elections, or to Members of the European Parliament following the next elections to the Parliament.  The pensions of TDs and Ministers retiring after February 2012 will be reduced in line with the substantial pay reductions applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts.  Furthermore, the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill 2011, currently before the Dáil, provides for a minimum pension age of 66, rising in line with the Social Welfare pension age, to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028; and will apply to Oireachtas Members who are members of the new single scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2659">The purpose of EU Regional/Cohesion policy is to reduce the significant economic, social and territorial disparities that still exist between Europe's regions.  The budget for the 2007-2013 round is €347bn.   Most of this budget is allocated for those countries and regions whose gross domestic product per capita is less than 75% of EU average (81.5% for convergence objective).    The remainder is for all other countries and regions (16.5% for regional competiveness and employment objective) and for cooperation across borders (2.5% for territorial cooperation objective).  The overall budget and country allocation is agreed between the EU Commission and Member States in advance of the programming period. Ireland has been allocated in total €901m in Structural Funding for the 2007-13 Programming period with €750 million assigned to the Regional Competitiveness and Employment (RCE) Objective.  Ireland's National Strategic Reference Framework (approved by the European Commission in July 2007) sets out the strategic context within which the €750m block of funding may be applied; the delivery is via three operational programmes, the National ESF Human Capital Investment OP, managed by the Department of Education and Skills, and the Border Midland and Western (BMW) and Southern and Eastern Regional ERDF (S&amp;E) OPs, managed by the BMW and S&amp;E Regional Assemblies.  The balance of €151m is for smaller Territorial Cooperation programmes including the PEACE III (Ireland/NI), INTERREG IVA (Ireland/NI and Western Scotland) and the Ireland Wales Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2660">For the purposes of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds, Ireland is designated into two NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) II regions, namely the BMW Region and the S&amp;E Region.   Of the €750 million allocated to Ireland under the RCE, €458 million has been allocated to the BMW Region (due to its phasing in status — moving from convergence (less developed) to regional competitiveness and employment (more developed) status) and €292 million to the S&amp;E Region.</p>
            <p eId="para_2661">The annual allocations are set out in the table 1 below and reflect the full amount of structural funds available to Ireland over the 2007-2013 programming period. Table 2 sets out the same information broken down by region.</p>
            <p eId="para_2662">Despite the significant socio-economic challenges, the implementation of the three OPs is progressing satisfactorily and it is anticipated that the overall objectives of each programme will be achieved and that Ireland will maximise its drawdown of the allocated funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_2663">Negotiations are ongoing at EU level in relation to the next round of EU funding for the 2014-2020 round.</p>

        <b> Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform</b>
         his views that the payment of approximately €250 million this year in pay rises for public sector workers in the form of increments is an appropriate use of scarce budgetary resources at this time; if he accepts that payment of these increases is linked directly to having to lay off public sector workers who are not on fixed term contracts; if he intends to pay them this year, and over the lifetime of this Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Brendan Howlin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2694">Based on more detailed information recently requested by my Department on the total cost of increments in a full year in the various sectors, the estimated full year cost of increments in the public service (excluding the Local Authority sector) is now estimated at no more than €180 million per annum and will be less than half that sum in 2012. Significantly reduced recruitment, the ongoing substantial fall in numbers of public servants, and higher numbers reaching the maxima of scales will ensure this cost will continue to fall over the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2695">I do not accept that the cost of increments is resulting directly in the lay off of public sector workers. Indeed under the Protection of Employees (Fixed Term Work) Act, 2003 public service workers who are employed under fixed term contracts, which I take to be the intended question of the Deputy, have an entitlement to similar terms and conditions of employment, including increments, as their permanent comparator public servants save with regard to the termination of their contract. While permanent employment has been the norm in the public service, employees on fixed term contracts are now widely employed in many sectors of the public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2696">The Government has reaffirmed the key commitments under the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 including that there will be no further reductions in pay rates, for serving public servants.  These commitments are contingent on delivery of the necessary flexibilities and reforms to public service delivery that are required under the Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2697">The allocation of all resources including those to pay public servants can and should be open to debate. However, I consider that there are fairer ways to control the cost of public pay, given that only a proportion of public servants, in particular lower paid and front line staff, would be affected by a suspension of increments. The other measures adopted by this Government, building on those taken in the past, will ensure that the total cost of the Exchequer paybill will have fallen by some €3.5 billion, or 20%, in the seven year period from 2008-2015. My Department is continuing to vigorously pursue further cost saving measures that are fair, targeted, and appropriate across the public service.</p>

            <p eId="para_2703">The issue raised by the Deputy relates to the provisions of the Public Sector Transfer Network (PSTN) which enables individuals to transfer service from one member organisation to another for superannuation purposes.  Membership of the PSTN is voluntary and organisations which apply to join are designated by Statutory Instrument as ‘approved organisations' under Section 4 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963 (No. 24 of 1963).  The organisations designated under the specific Regulations referred to by the Deputy, the Superannuation (Designation of Approved Organisations) Regulations 1987 (S.I. No. 110 of 1987), were the Nuclear Energy Board (NEB) and Fine Gael.</p>
            <p eId="para_2704">While my Department would be involved in transfers of service either into or out of the Civil Service, it has no involvement in transfers between the individual members themselves and, consequently, has no information regarding the numbers, costs, etc., of such transfers.  As regards transfers involving the Nuclear Energy Board (NEB) and the Civil Service, and Fine Gael and the Civil Service, the available records indicate that there have been no transfers between the NEB and the Civil Service; and one transfer from Fine Gael to the Civil Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2705">In relation to the Fine Gael case, the contributions payable by Fine Gael to the Civil Service are: (a) 1/80th of the uprated Fine Gael salary at the date of leaving Fine Gael, for every year of transferred service, payable six monthly in arrears for the duration of pension payments by the Civil Service, plus (b) a single contribution towards the cost of the retirement lump-sum of 3/80ths of the same salary figure in respect of the same amount of service.  This means that both organisations will contribute to the overall cost of the individual's retirement benefits.  No contributions have yet been received for the case in question.</p>

        <b> Deputy Willie Penrose</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</b>
         if he will confirm that the introduction of territorial cohesion under the Lisbon treaty is now a core competency of the EU; if he will confirm that same is based on the concept that every region, not state, should be allowed to make the most of its assets and resources and in this context, if an area like the midlands region is not being allowed to take advantage of its resources, which include a sizeable skilled and educated and available workforce, in a central location with an existing transport infrastructure and its proximity to other gateway regions; if in this context, it is appropriate that ministerial actions preclude entrepreneurs in this area from having the freedom to compete because of other considerations being made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2821">The competence of the European Union in the field of economic, social and territorial cohesion is set out in Article 174 of the Treaty.  The purpose of the Union's regional and cohesion policy is to<b/>  reduce the significant economic, social and territorial disparities that still exist between Europe’s regions.   </p>
            <p eId="para_2822">Ireland has been allocated a total of €901m in Structural Funding for the period 2007-13, with €750 million assigned to the Regional Competitiveness and Employment (RCE) objective, and the balance to Territorial Co-operation programmes, including the cross border PEACE programme.  In relation to the RCE objective, Ireland was required to put in place a National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) which was approved by the European Commission and sets out the strategic context within which funding may be applied.  The priorities for the NSRF were selected to complement national investment on the one hand and specific priorities on the other, in line with the EU regulations, regional foresight studies and the extensive consultation process undertaken to develop the strategy.  The priorities agreed with the Commission are the promotion and encouragement of innovation, the knowledge economy, enterprise, research and development, upskilling the workforce and increasing the activation and participation of groups outside the workforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_2823">For the purposes of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds, Ireland is divided into two regions, the Border, Midlands and Western Region and the Southern and Eastern Region. Of the €750 million allocated to Ireland under the RCE objective, €458 million has been allocated to the BMW Region and €292 million to the S&amp;E Region.</p>
            <p eId="para_2824">The Commission published its proposals for the next round of funding last October.  The strategic direction for future policy will be framed by the EU 2020 Strategy, which aims to support growth and competitiveness in the EU, as well as the broader discussion on the EU Budget.  As in previous rounds, there will be full consultation with all relevant actors, including the Regional Assemblies and Authorities, before decisions are taken regarding investment priorities for the new round, and proposals which accord with the aims of the 2020 Strategy, support the objectives of jobs and growth and meet the requirements of EU regulations will continue to be considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_2826">The Government has reaffirmed the key commitments under the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 on pay rates and job security for serving public servants. These commitments are contingent on delivery of the necessary flexibilities and reforms to public service delivery that are required under the Agreement.  The Budget process has recently outlined the Exchequer expenditure programme for 2012 and further Budgetary measures, should they arise, are a matter for consideration by Government.</p>

The conditions governing entitlement to payment of the allowance are set out in the Act.  The primary restriction in the Act on the use of the allowance is that it may not be used in respect of election expenses.</p>

            <p eId="para_3155">The rules on awarding public contracts have provisions which allow the specification of social criteria, such as the requirement for employment of long term unemployed, as a condition in the performance of the contract. Any such provision must be compatible with EU law, i.e. they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States. Subject to this, contracting authorities have the discretion to apply such conditions, as appropriate.  I understand that the National Procurement Service is currently looking at developing guidance for contracting authorities in relation to the use of such social clauses.</p>

         the number of jobs that would be created by an additional investment of €750 million in capital expenditure.

            <p eId="para_3157">The amount of employment generated by capital expenditure depends on how that expenditure is invested. For example, the purchase of new rail rolling stock would generate little direct employment in Ireland as such stock is generally produced abroad. Furthermore, different types of public construction project have different levels of labour intensity. For example, smaller scale projects such as school building and repair, or smaller local and regional road-works, tend to be more labour intensive than major national infrastructural projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_3158">As the Deputy will be aware, the details of an extensive review of the public capital programme were published by my Department on 10 November 2011 in "Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework". The focus of that review, which culminated in the publication of the Framework, was the identification of infrastructural investment that can aid economic growth, generate sustainable jobs in the medium term, and address urgent social requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_3159">In relation to job creation, it is important to note that much of the capital programme for the next five years will be geared towards smaller, more labour intensive projects. However, it is also noteworthy that investment in enterprise supports has the highest direct employment impact. Accordingly, the review made a point of protecting supports to the enterprise sector primarily through agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. The unprecedented level of investment over the past few years and in 2012 delivered through the Enterprise Development Agencies can foster sustainable and valuable employment in the exporting sectors of the economy which will be critical to recovery. While the overall capital envelope for 2012 has been reduced, we have actually held the level of capital allocation for the enterprise sector relative to the preceding period.</p>

            <p eId="para_3164">Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_3165">The person liable for payment of rates is the person in occupation of a rateable property on the date of the making of the rate by the relevant local authority. The owner rather than the occupier may be liable for commercial rates if the property in question is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate. Should a person's occupancy commence after the date of the making of the rate then that person is not primarily liable for rates for that year.  However, as a subsequent occupier, that person can be held liable for up to two years arrears of rates if they cannot be recovered from the person with whom the primary liability lies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3166">The Valuation Act sets out the procedures and basis for assessing the valuation of properties for rates purposes. The Act does not deal with liability for rates which is covered in rating and local government law.</p>
            <p eId="para_3167">The Valuation Act, 2001 provides for the valuation of all commercial and industrial property and the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Act and the making of valuations for rating is his sole prerogative.  Under the 2001 Act, which came into force on 2nd May, 2002, the basis of valuation for all commercial property is net annual value, i.e. the rental value of the property. To ensure equity and uniformity, valuation revisions which are set for modified or new properties are determined by reference to the values of comparable properties on the same valuation list.</p>
            <p eId="para_3168">Under section 28(4) of the Act, a Revision Officer of the Commissioner may carry out a revision of valuation in relation to a particular property only if a material change of circumstances has occurred such as a new building, a change in value due to structural alterations of an existing building, total or partial demolition of a building or a sub-division or amalgamation of relevant property.  The definition does not allow for a revision of valuation where the change in value is due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as roads or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property.</p>
            <p eId="para_3169">Revaluation is the mechanism whereby economic changes that take place in the property market are reflected in the valuation lists and in individual ratepayers' rates liabilities. The Commissioner of Valuation is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis.  The purpose of the revaluation process is to provide for more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and to assist in providing a more equitable distribution of valuations across those liable to pay rates.  Ideally, occupiers of properties of similar value in the same rating area should have a similar rates liability and following revaluation, there will be a much closer relationship between rental value and commercial rates liability and this relationship will thereafter be maintained by means of recurring revaluations provided for in the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_3170">The Commissioner, in consultation with my Department, has been reviewing various options for streamlining the valuation process and speeding up the national revaluation programme. In this regard, the Government recently approved the drafting of a Valuation Bill to amend the Valuation Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_3171">It is important to acknowledge that commercial rates, as a local tax, and the rating system generally, are deeply embedded in the local government system. Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.  All rates collected within a local authority area are spent exclusively in delivering the public services which are required locally to create the environment in which businesses can prosper. Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation they consider necessary in order to provide the required services. Rates are a stable source of financing for local government which is not affected unduly by short-term changes in economic circumstances.  A system having regard to economic factors on an ongoing basis would create uncertainty by providing for continuous change to the valuation base. Such a system would not provide a stable basis for funding local government and would require significant additional resources to operate.</p>
            <p eId="para_3172">Local authorities have been asked by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to exercise restraint in setting their Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) in the context of the adoptions of their 2012 budgets.  Local authorities have responded positively to similar requests in recent years. The Government recognises that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration and is determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency, and contain and reduce costs in the local government sector.</p>

Under the proposals, the total Cohesion package would be valued at €376 billion, making it the biggest single element of the EU Budget.  Discussions have been taking place at EU Council at official level since that date and I have attended an Informal Ministerial Meeting in Poznan and the General Affairs Council Meeting in Brussels last November and December respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_3192">The future of cohesion policy is being framed in the context of the current economic downturn and the challenge of an integrated cohesion policy is to address this.  The strategic direction for the future policy will, of course, be framed by the EU 2020 Strategy, which aims to support growth and competitiveness in the EU, and the EU Budget discussions.  Ireland supports the goals of the EU 2020 Strategy.  Cohesion Policy will be a key tool in the achievement of these goals.  Interventions must be focused on creating employment, research and innovation, education, combating poverty and climate change and energy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3193">The Commission's proposals are detailed and extensive and we are still examining them in consultation with my colleagues in other Government Departments and State Bodies.  The discussions at Council level have been intense and we expect the negotiations to be complex given the wider debate at EU level particularly in relation to the EU budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_3194">We have significant reservations about some aspects of the Cohesion proposals in relation to the financial management and control arrangements which could increase the complexity of fund drawdown.  However, we are engaging in the negotiations in a positive manner and in a spirit of partnership as it is in our common interest to ensure a successful conclusion to the negotiations.</p>

        <b> Deputy Dominic Hannigan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform</b>
         the position regarding the schedule for revaluations of commercial properties for the purpose of commercial rates in County Meath; his plans for a redeployment of staff to the Valuation Office in order that areas outside of Dublin may have their rates reassessed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for  Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Brendan Howlin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3196">The revaluation programme began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area where it was completed in 2007. It has since been completed in the Fingal County Council area in 2009 and in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown in 2010. The revaluation of the Dublin City Council area was commenced in May 2011, which entails the valuation of approximately 25,000 properties and the new list will be published in 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_3197">As part of the roll-out of the revaluation programme to other local authority areas, the Commissioner signed the valuation order on 12 December, 2011 to commence the revaluation of the Waterford City, Waterford County and Dungarvan Town Council areas.  As required by statute, he has also advanced the formal consultations with Limerick City and Limerick County Council to the stage where he will shortly be in a position to sign valuation orders for those areas. It is intended to extend the revaluation programme to further local authority areas as soon as it is practicable to do so; however it is not yet decided when the revaluation work will commence in County Meath.</p>
            <p eId="para_3198">Following detailed examination of various possibilities over the past few months intended to speed up the revaluation programme, the Commissioner of Valuation has concluded that it may be feasible to introduce a Self Assessment approach, accompanied by appropriate controls, and that it might be possible also to outsource some of the work. As well as helping to speed up the national programme an element of outsourcing, if it proves practicable, would allow comparison of the Valuation Office productivity and costs with those in the private sector.  The enabling provisions to allow for these changes are included in proposals for amending legislation which were approved by Government on 6 December, 2011 and are now with the Attorney General's Office for drafting of the proposed Valuation (Amendment) Bill. Preparatory work is continuing in drawing up the detailed schemes and, subject to the enactment of the legislation and availability of the necessary resources, I understand that the intention would be to initiate pilot revaluations using the self-assessment and outsourcing options in two local authority areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3199">Because of the complexity and the specialist nature of valuation work requiring staff with suitable professional qualifications, re-deployment of non-specialist staff from other Departments to do core valuation work is not considered to be a viable option. However, as a further means of speeding up the revaluation programme generally and to accelerate the necessary capture of data on properties throughout the country, in advance of the roll-out to particular areas, a dedicated data-capture unit is being set up which might hold potential to take on a number of suitable staff under the JobBridge scheme being sponsored by the Department of Social Protection and this option is being pursued at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_3201">The Government adopted my proposal in June 2011 for the introduction of:—</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3202">a general pay ceiling of €200,000  for future appointments to higher positions across the public service; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3203">a general pay ceiling of €250,000 for<b/>  future appointments to CEO posts within Commercial State Companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3204">Following the outcome to the referendum on remuneration for the Judiciary the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Act, 2011 was enacted. This Act provided for the application of the pay reduction and the pension levy to serving members of the judiciary and provided for reduced remuneration rates for newly appointed members of the judiciary with effect from 1 January 2012. The Act also made provision to bring certain Office holders (Comptroller and Auditor General and Chairperson of An Bord Pleanála) within the public service pay ceiling and for the reduction of remuneration for future appointees as President and the Office of Ombudsman. This legislation also formally provides for the reduction in the salary rates for members of the Government. Ongoing arrangements are being made on an administrative basis to implement the pay ceiling for future appointments where that is appropriate, for example within the Civil Service and the Heads of four Universities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3205">Based on the information available within my Department, there are 24 post holders in the public service on approved salary levels in excess of €200,000 and 11 CEOs of Commercial State Companies.

            <p eId="para_3262">I propose to take Questions Nos. 269 to 273, inclusive and 275 to 277, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3263">As is clear from the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014</i> published on 5 December last, the <i>Capital Infrastructure Plan</i> published on 10 November 2011, the Implementation Body publication of the Public Service Agreement<i> Progress Report</i> on the 17 November 2011, and the <i>Public Service Reform Plan</i>   also published on 17 November 2011, the Government is making good progress on achieving all of our targets and priorities, as articulated in the Government Programme, in terms of both bringing public expenditure back to a sustainable level and driving forward the public service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_3264">As regards revisions to previously established objectives under the EU/IMF Programme, I would point out to the Deputy that this Government successfully renegotiated significant elements of the Programme — for example the Jobs Initiative, the ending of further asset transfers to NAMA, reversal of the Minimum Wage cut, the provision that fiscal measures specified in the programme could be substituted by others of equally good quality and we successfully renegotiated the interest rate charged for the loans, along with important changes and improvements to the EU's EFSF funding facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_3265">Ireland is living up to its end of the bargain by delivering on all the conditions and targets in the EU/IMF Programme by the required deadlines.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the fifth quarterly review took place from 10th-19th January.  The mission was a success and the overall assessment was positive. Ireland is meeting all of the conditions and targets of our programme, including all reform and expenditure targets.  The Government has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to meeting the targets agreed with our European and IMF partners.</p>

            <p eId="para_3267">In the first instance, responsibility for operational planning in the context of reducing resources rests with the relevant Public Service body and its parent Department. Public Service organisations must fully use all mechanisms set out in Public Service Reform Plan for discharging work including reorganisation and redeployment of staff. Only after this will the issue of recruitment for current or emerging business needs arise.</p>

            <p eId="para_3277">Under the general rule of State indemnity the State carries its own insurance , i.e.  a commitment is made to protect against losses, should any loss or damage arise where the State was negligent.  For the following areas of risk:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3278">Personal injury to employees of the State;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3279">Personal injury to third parties (the public);</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3280">Third party property damage — including claims arising from road traffic collisions,</p>
            <p eId="para_3281">claims against the State are managed by the State Claims Agency (SCA), established under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act, 2000.  The SCA's remit covers personal injury and property damage claims against certain State authorities, including the State itself, Government Ministers, the Attorney General, health enterprises, the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána, prison governors, community and comprehensive schools and various other bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3282">Where this State indemnity applies, the relevant Authority does not purchase insurance for personal injury (employer's and public liability) and third party property damage and therefore, will not have to bear associated premium costs.   Indemnity operates on a pay as you go basis so that all costs associated with personal injury and third party property damage claims will be paid directly from the budget of the relevant Authority through a reimbursement system operated by the SCA. Analysis has demonstrated that the cost to the State of dealing with claims directly is significantly lower than the premium cost of insuring the risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_3283">Since 2001 the remit of the SCA has been expanded through various delegation orders based on value for money analysis. For example, the remit of the Agency was extended in 2010 and again in 2011 to include personal injury (employees and members of the public) and third party property claims against the Health Service Executive (claims for alleged medical negligence had been  delegated to the Agency in 2003) and 19 other State agencies.  This has yielded significant annual savings as these organisations no longer have to pay insurance premiums for delegated classes of claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_3284">In order to maximize savings the State must manage the claims made against it at the best possible cost.  For example during 2011 the SCA achieved significant savings on claims and related legal costs associated with the management of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme (CIS). An independent actuarial assessment projected that €106 million would be required to satisfy CIS claims and related costs in 2011. The outturn for the year was €81 million, representing a saving of €25 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_3285">The SCA directly, or through the Chief State Solicitor's Office or the National Procurement Office in the Office of Public Works provides insurance advice on Government contracts, licenses, schemes and tenders in circumstances where State indemnity applies or on insurances required where it does not apply.  This ensures that the States liabilities are minimized in the most cost effective manner.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)</from>
            <p eId="para_3291">I would point out that Ireland has a strong and robust regime for dealing with copyright infringements whether in the digital environment or otherwise.  The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 provides a technology-neutral exclusive right for copyright owners to communicate their works through any mode. The Act also contains extensive provisions dealing with infringement of that right or others, whether civil or criminal.</p>
            <p eId="para_3292">The rights holder may proceed against those who infringe their copyright in a number of ways. For example, in the digital environment, it is an infringement for the person providing facilities (such as an internet service provider) not to remove infringing material when notified by the rights holder.  Another remedy allows the rights holder to obtain the identities of alleged infringers, including those involved in illegal file-sharing, from an internet service provider by means of judicial process. These can then be pursued in the same manner as any other infringers.  It should also be borne in mind that the Copyright Act provides for secondary and contributory liability.</p>
            <p eId="para_3293">In relation to one of the remedies available to rights holders, a High Court judgment has held that, by reason of provisions of the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, an injunction is not available in cases of transient communications, and suggested that Ireland did not fully comply with EU law. For the avoidance of doubt, a legislative instrument is being finalised to restate the position that was considered to exist prior to this judgment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3294">In granting such injunctions the courts must take account of Court of Justice of the European Union judgements. These require that a fair balance be struck between the various fundamental rights protected by the Community legal order and the principle of proportionality. That would include, <i>inter alia</i>, the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals who are affected by such measures, the freedom to conduct a business enjoyed by operators such as Internet Service Providers, the protection of private data and right of freedom of expression and information.  It is expected that this measure will be introduced this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_3295">The Minister does not have information in relation to the costs of copyright infringement in the area of digital piracy.  Independent research as to the effects of illegal downloading is limited therefore the costs of such activity are not readily quantifiable. However, in the judgement of Mr Justice Charleton in EMI &amp; Others vs UPC (2009 no. S472 P) it is noted that Mr Dick Doyle of the Irish Recorded Music Association posited a cost of €20m per annum in relation to music.</p>

            <p eId="para_3298">To achieve balanced regional development, IDA Ireland markets the Gateway locations within each Region as areas of critical mass and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distance of these Gateways.  The East Region has one Gateway (Dublin) and a number of large towns including Navan, Drogheda, Naas, Arklow and Carlow and, as such, will continue to be a key location of focus for the winning of foreign direct investment (FDI).  As well as marketing the region for new Greenfield investment, IDA Ireland continues to work with existing clients in encouraging them to broaden their mandate and to continue to re-invest in their sites within the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_3299">The availability of cost effective and flexible private property solutions forms a central part of  IDA Ireland's  marketing efforts. In this regard, IDA Ireland has informed me that it has met with the promoters of the NEC Facility in Ballivor and that it is actively marketing this facility for suitable projects.  IDA Ireland has informed me that there are 16 IDA Ireland supported companies in Co Meath employing c. 1,300 people in key companies such as Generali International, Welch Allyn and Europ Assist.</p>

In April, July and December 2011, Enterprise Ireland met with the company to discuss the developments in St James's Gate and plans for Kilkenny and Dundalk.  Enterprise Ireland is continuing to work proactively with the company to ensure that it continues to develop its existing brands in Ireland, so as to ensure maximum job retention.</p>
            <p eId="para_3337">The investment announced for St James's Gate last week will consolidate brewing operations and while I welcome the company's announcement of the major new investment that secures the future of brewing in Ireland, the closure of the Dundalk site, which has been signalled since 2008, is a serious blow to the town.  I am very conscious of the anxiety that the closures will create for the workers involved and their families as well as the local communities and I can assure the Deputy that the enterprise development agencies will continue to engage proactively with the company to explore any future opportunities for staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_3338">Issues in relation to the payment of statutory redundancy entitlements under the Redundancy Payments Acts are a matter for the Minister for Social Protection.

            <p eId="para_3349">The restoration of national competitiveness is one of the primary focuses of Government policy. Price competitiveness is an integral element of restoring national competitiveness.  The Central Statistics Office's recent publication of the EU Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, which is accepted as the most appropriate measure for community wide price comparisons, shows that in the year to November 2011, prices in Ireland increased by 1.7% as compared with an increase in prices of 3.0% (provisional) in the Euro area and 3.4% (provisional) throughout the EU as a whole. It will be seen, therefore, that prices in most member states of the EU are increasing at a much faster rate than prices in Ireland. This price competitive advantage is helping in the effort to restore national competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_3350">Notwithstanding the welcome improvement in our price comparative position, undoubtedly a number of sectors have experienced above average price increases. Whilst some of the increases have arisen as a result of fiscal measures dictated by the country's difficult budgetary position, others, particularly in the energy sector, have been dictated by global factors such as increases in the price of carbon fuels, capacity difficulties for refining such fuels etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_3351">It should be borne in mind that a number of the sectors referred to in the Deputy's question are subject to regulatory oversight, including in relation to matters such as price. It is the case that consumer welfare is an integral element of the mandates of the regulatory bodies concerned, including in relation to the regulatory decisions that they make.</p>
            <p eId="para_3352">Any consideration of prices should also take into account the role that consumers can play in bringing about a more competitive marketplace. Consumers by informing themselves of the different offerings in the marketplace can help to ensure that they receive the best value for money, which in turn can be the catalyst for greater competition. In this regard, price comparison survey work carried out by the National Consumer Agency has helped to enable consumers to become much more informed and price aware in relation to their day to day shopping thus helping them to achieve the best value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_3353">In so far as the liquid fuel sector referred to in the Deputy's question is concerned, a survey of prices of home heating oil published by the National Consumer Agency in September 20011 showed considerable price variations amongst suppliers in a significant number of the areas surveyed. This survey and other like surveys clearly show that it is in consumers' own interest as well as the wider competitiveness interest to seek out the best value for money in their day to day spending decisions.</p>

The agency has also undertaken a major upgrade and enhancement of its existing Industrial Estate at Racecourse Road/Gallowstown which includes site services, broadband ducting and significant landscaping upgrades to bring the Park to top quality standards for marketing purposes.

            <p eId="para_3484">During 2011, I attended the Trade and Business North South Ministerial Council, which I chaired, and two meetings of the North South Plenary between the Taoiseach and First and Deputy First Ministers.  The Ministers of State at my Department and I also attended a number of North South conferences and events during the course of 2011. On 1 March next, I will attend the next meeting of the Trade and Business Development North South Ministerial Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_3485">Inter <i>Trade</i> Ireland was established under the Good Friday Agreement to ‘exchange information and co-ordinate work on trade, business development and related matters in areas where the two administrations specifically agree it would be in their mutual interest’.</p>
            <p eId="para_3486">Enterprise policy co-ordination and practical all-island business co-operation in the areas of Trade, Innovation and Business and Economic Research are already a reality through InterTradeIreland's work, which is underpinned by joint funding from my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3487">North-South economic co-operation is and will remain a priority for myself and the Government. This is evidenced by the fact that despite the enormous pressures on our budgets, I have secured an allocation for 2012 for InterTradeIreland which will be maintained at 2011 levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_3488">The enterprise development agencies North and South of the Border have for many years co-operated where this has added value to their activities, and this collaboration has greatly increased in recent years. Enterprise Ireland, which stimulates the development of indigenous enterprise, has extensive contact with its Northern counterparts and works with them on a range of programmes.  IDA Ireland collaborates with Invest Northern Ireland, for example, in the Northwest Now initiative. More recently, there have been very positive developments where a wide range of agencies and institutions now co-operate on science and technology issues, including participation in the EU Research Framework Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3489">My Department also provides funding support for Interreg projects, which are supported by the EU and the Northern Ireland Executive.  Through Interreg, we have supported a number of North South enterprise projects, including enterprise networking for the Border counties and Northern Ireland, for example, for renewable energy and sustainable development.  I understand that a number of other network projects are currently under consideration by the Interreg Managing Authority, the Special EU Programmes Body.</p>
            <p eId="para_3490">The Government, along with the enterprise development agencies, will work diligently with the Northern Ireland Executive and its agencies to increase the economic benefits accruing from cross-Border co-operation and the work of the North-South bodies.</p>

            <p eId="para_3492">Since coming into office last March, the Government has taken a series of actions to help enterprises to create jobs.  We launched a Jobs Initiative last May, within two months of the Government coming into office, to stimulate domestic demand and restore confidence in the economy internationally. We have brought stability to the banking system by recapitalising the banks and establishing two pillar banks to improve access to credit.  Bank of Ireland and AIB have both been set targets for lending to business.</p>
            <p eId="para_3493">Budget 2012 contained a number of pro-jobs measures, including:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3494">the maintenance of our 12.5% Corporate Tax rate and extension of the corporate tax exemption for new start-ups;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3495">improvements in the Special Assignee Relief Programme;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3496">the introduction of a Foreign Earnings Deduction to support companies who want to build export opportunities in the developing markets of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa;</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3498">continuation of 9% VAT rate in certain sectors;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3499">supports to encourage growth in specific sectors such as the international funds industry, aircraft leasing, agri-food and construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_3500">I have been co-ordinating the preparation of the Government's first annual Action Plan for Jobs, which will outline the measures to be taken across a range of Departments to support job creation in 2012.  The Action Plan will build on the Government's efforts to date, and will set out specific actions to be taken this year to further support job creation across the economy.  The 2012 Action Plan for Jobs will be launched in the coming weeks, following its approval by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_3501">The jobs and growth agenda is also being vigorously pursued at EU level. Since taking office, my colleagues Minister Sherlock, Minister Perry and I, along with senior officials of the Department, have availed of every opportunity to engage with the EU institutions on policies of mutual concern regarding jobs and growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_3502">Bilateral meetings have been held at both official and Ministerial level with Commissioners and high ranking EU Officials, EU partners and like-minded groups.  We have discussed with like-minded partners the prioritisation of EU initiatives under the Single Market Act aimed at stimulating the jobs, enterprise and innovation agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_3503">At Ministerial level, we will be forthright in pursuing at EU level several key strategic initiatives of national importance for our competitiveness, trade, jobs and growth agenda, including the proposed pan-European Venture Capital Fund, the Digital Single Market, the European Patent and the reduction of the administrative burdens for business.</p>
            <p eId="para_3504">We are also working to maximise our strategic interests and funding possibilities under the EU's new Research Programme (Horizon 2020) and the proposed Programme for Competitiveness and SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3505">I will continue to fully engage in the development of the EU's common commercial policies, which I believe provide a strong stimulus for growth and job creation.  2012 should see the successful conclusion of Free Trade Agreements with important markets for Ireland including India, Singapore and Canada.  This year should also see the mapping out of future trade and investment relations with the US in the context of the EU-US High Level Group on Growth and Jobs which is due to report before the end of 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_3507">The dispute at the Vita Cortex factory in Cork involves 32 workers who have been engaged in a sit-in at the factory since 16 December last arising from a dispute with their employer over redundancy payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3508">The workers are seeking severance terms of 2.9 weeks' pay per year of service, inclusive of statutory redundancy, in line with previous redundancy deals at the company.</p>
            <p eId="para_3509">In the interest of achieving a resolution in this dispute, I urged both parties to avail of the State's industrial relations machinery as soon as possible with a view to exploring ways of resolving the issues in dispute. Officials from my Department were in contact with the worker's union representatives in efforts to clarify the issues involved and to make them aware that the industrial relations machinery of the State is available to them to help them resolve the dispute.</p>
            <p eId="para_3510">In this context, the Labour Relations Commission invited both parties to meet in Cork on Tuesday 17 January to clarify the facts of the situation and, against that background, to explore with the parties the potential for moving forward.

            <p eId="para_3511">Regretfully, those talks adjourned on Friday night with no plans to reconvene. According to the LRC, they had been unable to find a basis for agreement between the parties involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_3512">The absence of an agreement on the payment of extra statutory severance terms for the workers is without prejudice to the arrangements being made by the Department of Social Protection to process the applications made for payment of statutory redundancy to the workers concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3513">The LRC has confirmed that they will maintain contact with both parties and that if an opportunity should arise for the Commission to be of further assistance in moving the situation forward, it is ready to get involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_3516">I propose to take Questions Nos. 300 and 301 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3517">There are eight Bodies under the aegis of my Department listed in Appendix IIA of the Government Statement on Public Service Reform and the current position with regard to their proposed rationalisation is set out below.</p>
            <p eId="para_3518">The <i>National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority</i> are to be merged.  As both agencies are established under statute, it is necessary to give effect to the newly merged body by way of primary legislation. In July 2011, Government approval of the drafting of this legislation was obtained and the Bill is expected to be published later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3519">In the meantime the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency are actively working together to plan for the proposed amalgamation so that as much of the preparatory work as possible is done by the time the implementing legislation is enacted.  The recently appointed Chairperson of the Competition Authority was also appointed as the Chairperson designate of the new body.</p>
            <p eId="para_3520">As both agencies are currently operating well below the staffing complement which pertained in 2008 when the merger was first announced, no actual staff savings are envisaged. Some additional costs may arise in relation to such issues as accommodation, IT, etc.  Due to the proposed structure of the merged body, savings of approximately €170,000 per annum will be achieved as there will be no fees for a Board or Chairperson to be paid (or associated costs such as travel and subsistence for Board members). In relation to the various bodies dealing with employment rights and industrial relations disputes, I have announced my intention to streamline the structures and procedures in place to create a simplified two-tiered structure comprising a single body of first instance adjudication and a single body of appeal.  Four of the existing bodies (the <i>Employment Appeals Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court</i>) are currently within my remit.  The <i>Equality Tribunal</i> is currently within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality, but plans to transfer its functions across to my Department are at an advanced stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_3521">I expect this major reform and streamlining project to deliver a measurable improvement in the quality of services provided to users of the State's employment rights/industrial relations dispute resolution services, providing a cheaper and more efficient at less cost to the State.  While it is not possible to be precise in terms of the savings to be achieved from the project, they are likely to be considerable.</p>
            <p eId="para_3522">Already the project has provided some significant early progress and has contributed to an improved service.  So far, achievements have included the development of a single complaint form for use in all existing bodies, the establishment of a single portal of entry for all claims, and the creation of a centralised website, containing all relevant information on employment right and industrial relation. Work will continue in 2012 on improving these facilities and looking at other aspects of this project.</p>
            <p eId="para_3523">In relation to Forfás, it is proposed to integrate the policy advisory and research functions of that Agency into my Department. A group comprised of senior officials from my Department and Forfás will be established shortly to examine and progress this proposal. It is not possible at this stage to identify the level of savings that would be realised in implementing this proposal.  Additionally, various options are being considered by my Department in relation to the restructuring of the <i>County and City Enterprise Boards</i> (CEBs). It is my intention, however, to ensure that any opportunity presented by CEB restructuring will not simply be about reducing or changing the numbers of CEBs in existence, but will be used as an opportunity to fundamentally reform, streamline and revitalise the manner in which the State supports the valuable micro-enterprise sector. Until a decision is in place on restructuring it would be premature to comment on potential savings.</p>

            <p eId="para_3525">The Government announced in the Public Service Reform Plan on 17 November 2011, in the context of its consideration of the streamlining of State Agencies, that Service Level Agreements (SLAs) would be put in place with all Agencies by June 2012. My Department is committed to developing, as appropriate, service level agreements for the Agencies under its remit, by this deadline.</p>
            <p eId="para_3526">The Deputy may wish to note that, in the case of InterTradeIreland, a Financial Memorandum is in place between the Department, the Department of Finance, the Agency itself and the two equivalent Departments in the North, which sets out financial procedures and accountability arrangements. The development of a suitable Service Level Agreement with InterTradeIreland would be subject to the agreement of the Northern Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3527">At present, the Agencies under my Department's remit operate on the basis of agreed corporate business plans and/or detailed work programmes, underpinned by three-year strategies and the requirements of the governing legislation. This is supplemented by regular meetings at senior management level between the Department and the Agencies, as well as ongoing interactions on various aspects of their operations, e.g., financial reporting, staffing, etc. As part of my commitment to stronger governance of the Agencies, I will be formalising arrangements to hold biannual meetings between the Management Advisory Committee in the Department and the Heads of the Agencies to focus on achieving targets.</p>

            <p eId="para_3529">The information sought by the Deputy will be published in the annual reports of the agencies concerned in the normal way and I would direct the Deputy to the agencies concerned. The fees paid to members of State Boards are set down by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and have been subject to reductions with effect from January 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3530">While I will keep under review the position in relation to the numbers serving on those State Boards coming under the aegis of my Department, you will appreciate that the composition of the boards is set down in the relevant establishing legislation.  My immediate priority and overriding focus at the moment is to find the best people for particular board appointments. In making appointments I have regard to the expertise and experience of individuals, the balance of skills and attributes in terms of the overall composition of the board, the gender balance of the board and the availability and commitment of people to serve on the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_3531">The Deputy will be aware that Government policy is to introduce greater transparency in the appointment process. In line with this policy and in an effort to broaden the pool of suitable candidates for consideration for appointment to boards, I sought expressions of interest last summer from suitably qualified people for appointment to the boards of several agencies under my Department's remit. I intend to launch another expressions of interest campaign in the near future in respect of further vacancies that have arisen or that are due to arise over the coming months.</p>

            <p eId="para_3533">My Department received 49,762 claims in respect of statutory redundancy payments in 2011.  The Department does not maintain statistics in relation to the number of companies with regard to their inability to pay or otherwise.  However, as lump sums are paid where companies refuse to pay or are unable to pay, an indicator which may be useful to the Deputy in this regard is the level of lump sums in comparison to rebate payments for 2011, as shown in the table below:</p>

            <p eId="para_3541">It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all eligible employees.  An employer who pays statutory redundancy payments to employees is then entitled to a rebate from the State of a percentage of the relevant amount.   Where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department that he/she is unable to pay the statutory redundancy to his/her employees the Department will make lump sum payments directly to the employees and will seek to recover the debt from the employer.  To prove inability to pay the employer must submit documentary evidence, usually a recent statement of affairs and a letter from the company's accountant/solicitor to confirm that this is the position.</p>
            <p eId="para_3542">Straightforward redundancy claims submitted online through a new processing system introduced in October 2011 are generally processed within 6 to 8 weeks but this can vary considerably depending on the complexity of the claims. Claims submitted before October 2011 or submitted manually take longer to process.  In relation to such claims, the Department is currently processing claims from June 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_3547">Rent supplement provides short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. Since 2005, rent supplement expenditure has increased from €369 million to a provisional outturn of €503 million in 2011. The number of persons claiming the allowance increased from almost 60,200 persons in 2005 to over 96,800 as at end 2011, a 61% increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_3548">The difference between the minimum contribution paid by households under the rent supplement scheme and that paid under the differential rents scheme administered by local authorities has been a barrier to the transfer of rent supplement recipients to local authority accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3549">The additional weekly contribution payable by a one adult household under local authority accommodation ranges from €22 to €34 per week with an average of approximately €27.  Budget 2012 has increased the minimum contribution for this category on rent supplement from €24 to €30 per week. Approximately 75% of all rent supplement tenancies are a one adult household.</p>
            <p eId="para_3550">The additional weekly contribution payable by coupled households (with no children) in local authority accommodation ranges from €49 to €66 per week with an average of approximately €53.  Budget 2012 has also introduced a new rate of minimum contribution for couples on rent supplement of €35 per week.  A circular advising staff of the increase in the minimum contribution payable in respect of rent and mortgage interest supplement issued to staff administering the supplementary welfare allowance scheme on 22 December 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_3551">These measures will more closely align the minimum contribution payable by households under the rent supplement scheme with those of local authorities. These changes will remove the disincentives for households to transfer to local authority housing.</p>

            <p eId="para_3928">The Community Employment programme provides a very important and valued contribution to social employment, training and progression for unemployed people. Furthermore, many Community Employment schemes provide vital community services right across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3929">There are currently 1,143 CE schemes in operation nationally with 23,300 participants. The overall estimated budget stands at €315,194 million for 2012. As this area has only recently come under the Department of Social Protection, I have asked for an initial review of the financial resources of all schemes to be completed in March 2012. Standard templates have been developed and issued to the employment officers involved. The review will be carried out between local CE sponsors and the Departmental employment officer responsible for the scheme under local management.</p>
            <p eId="para_3930">The discussion that will be undertaken with schemes will be conducted in an enabling manner and all support possible will be provided to help the schemes to remain viable.  Development officers are currently making initial contact with schemes. In addition to these local discussions, discussion and consultation with the main representative bodies and stakeholders involved in schemes will take place over the coming weeks in relation to funding.</p>

Community Employment will be reviewed as part of this exercise. This outcome of this review will guide future policy development and is expected to be completed by the end of March.  Following on from changes to the training and materials grant for Community Employment schemes announced in Budget 2012 I have made a commitment that no Community Employment Scheme would close pending the completion of this review.</p>
            <p eId="para_3932">The Government has been clear that in the event that the changes in the training and material grant announced in the Budget create financial difficulties for schemes, the Department of Social Protection will continue to provide funding for those schemes and funding has been made available in this context.

            <p eId="para_3939">Since 2005 rent supplement expenditure has increased from €369 million to a provisional outturn of €503 million in 2011. The number of persons claiming the allowance increased from almost 60,200 persons in 2005 to over 96,800 as at end 2011, a 61% increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_3940">Landlords are legally obliged to register tenancies with the PRTB within one month from the start date of the tenancy or at a later date on payment of an increased fee.  For this reason, it is not practicable for the Department to insist that a tenancy be registered with the PRTB before payment of rent supplement can be made.  There are also instances where a rent supplement tenancy need not be registered with the PRTB, for example, in the case of renting a room in a house or where a property is owner occupied. Rent supplement tenancies which are liable for registration with the PRTB, should be so registered.</p>
            <p eId="para_3941">The Department works closely with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to help ensure that rent supplement tenancies comply with the statutory system of tenancy regulation and safeguards.

            <p eId="para_3947">A variety of measures have been introduced to protect the intern and to ensure the integrity of the JobBridge scheme.  In order for all applications from host organisations to be approved they must meet a number of criteria so as to ensure that the potential internships are of sufficient quality.  These include the following: that the internship does not allow the intern to work unsupervised; that the internship is not displacing an employee; and that the intern accrues significant experience throughout the entire internship.  These checks are undertaken by staff in the National Contact Centre as part of their broader range of duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_3948">In order for an internship to commence a Standard Internship Agreement must be signed by both the intern and the host organisation. This Agreement clearly stipulates the terms of the internship and states the specific learning outcomes the intern will receive over the course of their internship.  To ensure compliance with the scheme, the Department of Social Protection is monitoring internships to ensure that they are of sufficient quality and that both host organisations and interns are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3949">This involves the monitoring of monthly compliance reports that are required to be submitted by the host organisation verifying that the internship is proceeding as set out in the Standard Internship Agreement. In addition, contact with the host organisations and interns including random site visits have begun as part of this process.  These visits are undertaken by staff in the Regions in conjunction with their other Employment Service duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_3950">A ‘whistle blowing' feature has been introduced, where any individual who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme's criteria, including in cases of suspected displacement or poor quality, may contact the JobBridge team. All such claims are fully investigated.   This is administered by a small team of staff in the Central unit.  It is worth noting that participation in the Scheme is voluntary and an intern may contact the JobBridge team at any stage of their internship. I believe that these measures are currently sufficient in relation to the operation of the JobBridge scheme. However, my Department continuously monitors the scheme and will introduce additional measures if the need arises.</p>

            <p eId="para_3971">The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of my Department which processes in excess of 2 million claims each year and makes payments to some 1.4 million people every week at a cost of some €21 billion per annum. However, it is important to recognise that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_3972">For 2011, my Department had a target of reviewing 780,000 individual welfare claims and achieving €540 million in control savings. At the end of 2011, some €645 million in estimated control savings were reported and over 982,000 reviews had been carried out.  For 2012, the target for control savings is set at €625 million, an increase of €85 million on the 2011 target.  The table gives a breakdown of the reviews and savings recorded for 2011.</p>

            </table>
            <p eId="para_4018">The Deputy should note that control review and savings data in relation to some of the schemes referred to by him are not available individually.  For example, Farm Assist and Pre-Retirement Allowance cases are included under the JA/JB figures listed above. Similarly, data for Guardians Payments are included in the figures shown for Widows/Widowers/Survivors and Civil Partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_4019">Control savings are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the schemes in payment. Control savings represent an estimate of the value of prevented expenditure on fraudulent claims over a future period. Control savings are not actual monies recovered by the Department but are a good indication of the increase in social welfare expenditure that would occur without these activities taking place.  These savings arise as a result of control activity on claims in payment, which result in claims being reduced or stopped. Control savings may also arise from inspections of employers.  These activities also have deterrent or knock-on effects, which are not readily quantifiable in monetary terms.  Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4020">Actual monies recovered arise where the Department assesses overpayments in individual cases and subsequently recovers those debts. Where, following a review of a claim in payment, it is confirmed that the customer had been receiving a payment to which they were not entitled, or were receiving a payment at a higher rate than they were entitled, a deciding officer makes a revised decision on the entitlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4021">Deciding officers decide the effective date of a revised decision having regard to the new facts or evidence and the circumstances of the case. This can result in the assessment of an overpayment. Departmental guidelines relating to the recording of control reviews and activities state that control savings should not be claimed when a customer merely transfers from one of the Department's schemes to another or to a community/employment scheme as a result of control activity, unless there is evidence that he/she was invalidly claiming in the first place. Thus, for example, where a person transfers from Jobseeker's Allowance or One Parent Family Payment to Back to Work Allowance following a review, this should not be counted unless there is evidence that they were invalidly working and claiming beforehand.</p>
            <p eId="para_4022">The exception to this is where a person ceases payment on one scheme (e.g. Jobseekeer's Allowance) as a result of a control activity and subsequently claims Basic Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA). Payments under SWA are discretionary and generally of short duration and in view of this, the Departmental guidelines include those type of cases as control savings.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware that responsibility for the Community Welfare Service which administers the SWA scheme transferred to the Department in October 2011.  It is intended, therefore, to review the procedures regarding the recording of SWA control savings in these type of instances.  In fact, my Department plans on reviewing and validating the whole process of recording control savings later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4023">The control guidelines state that savings are calculated by applying validated multipliers to the difference in the rate of payment before and after the control activity. Therefore, if, as a result of a control review, a qualified adult rate is stopped, while the main payment continues, then it is only the qualified adult rate which would be recorded as a control saving.  The control savings figures set out in the table above are those recorded in the manner outlined and are in accordance with the relevant guidelines.</p>

            <p eId="para_4025">Due to the current economic circumstances and the need for the Department of Social Protection to find savings of €475 million in Budget 2012, it was necessary to examine all aspects of Departmental expenditure. Under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in 2011 undertaken by my Department in September of last year, the effectiveness and value for money of spending programmes was reviewed, the option to reduce the Training and Materials Grants was included in this review. This has resulted in the changes being made to the Community Employment (CE) scheme, which were announced as part of Budget 2012, including the reduction in the training and materials grants from €1,500 to €500 per participant per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_4026">In relation to this reduction, the Department of Social Protection will seek to minimise the effects of these changes on those schemes most affected and will examine the income and expenditure of schemes with reference to their capacity to absorb the changes made to the grant.  Eligible financial commitments entered into prior to the budget announcements that have been approved by the local FÁS officer and manager (now with the Department of Social Protection) will be reimbursed.</p>

            <p eId="para_4028">The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing in this case. There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 and 2011 when the intake rose to 32,432 and 31,241 respectively.

            <p eId="para_4034">I propose to take Questions Nos. 338 and 375 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4035">Rent supplement provides short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. The Department currently funds approximately 40% of private sector rented accommodation.  Accordingly, it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in any way.</p>
            <p eId="para_4036">New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012.  These new limits are in line with the most up to date market data available.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that value for money is achieved while at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4037">At the end of December 2011 there are 2,700 persons in receipt of rent supplement in Wicklow at a cost of some €16.3 million to the taxpayer. The analysis of the rental market for Wicklow carried out by my Department found that rental prices for Bray have a distorting effect on the prices for Wicklow as a whole.  For the purpose of establishing limits for the county, Bray was excluded and will be managed separately.  Officials in my Department are in the process of drawing up local limits for Bray; this will ensure that tenants for the full county may continue to source accommodation within the prevailing market rates and ensure the best value for money is achieved for the taxpayer.</p>

By gradually increasing the qualifying age for State pension, people will be further encouraged to remain in employment beyond 65 years of age.  The person concerned will reach pension age at 66.

The apportionment of payment between the three constituent companies, Bus Éireann, Bus Átha Cliath and Iarnród Éireann is a matter for the CIÉ Group to determine. Approximately €61 million was paid to the CIE group during each of the last 2 years.</p>

        <b> Deputy Joe Higgins</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social Protection</b>
         her plans to revise pension and social welfare entitlements for self-employed workers who are not due a payment as their partners are still in employment yet are struggling to pay bills.

            <p eId="para_4096">Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).   Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits, including jobseeker's benefit, pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than €356, the rate of employers PRSI is 4.25%).</p>
            <p eId="para_4097">In this context it may be noted that self-employed workers generally achieve better value for money by paying social insurance compared to employees.  In terms of benefits the 2005 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund found that the self-employed contributor can expect to receive over 10 times what he contributes to the social insurance fund compared to the employee who only gets 3 times what he and his employer contribute — despite the fact that the range of benefits available to employees is greater.</p>
            <p eId="para_4098">Self-employed workers may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance.  They can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed unemployed claimant of jobseeker's allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4099">Any changes to the PRSI system in order to provide access to short-term benefits such as jobseeker's benefit would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.  I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.  The Advisory Group will, inter alia, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable. In addition, the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, which is due to be completed in mid-2012, will examine this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_4164">The Community Employment programme provides a very important and valued contribution to social employment, training and progression for unemployed people. Furthermore, many Community Employment schemes provide vital community services right across the country.  There are currently 1,143 CE schemes in operation nationally with 23,300 participants. The overall estimated budget stands at €315,194 million for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_4165">The current review of financial resources initiated by the Department of Social Protection, commenced in January, with a time frame for completion by the end of March 2012.  The outcomes will inform the overall approach to be taken by Department of Social Protection in prioritising spending while addressing the need for budget reductions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4166">At this stage, the agreed terms of reference for the review have been circulated to regional management. To ensure consistency in approach by the Department of Social Protection, a template/schedule outlining the areas for the financial review was designed and this is the basis of the review at scheme level.  The Terms of Reference for the Review are as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4167">To examine the income and funding of sponsoring organisations in terms of their ability to continue the programme with reduced funding from the Department of Social Protection.  There are community and voluntary sponsoring organisations that receive funding from a multiplicity of state agencies.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4168">To quantify the expenditure on training provided and the qualifications achieved by participants.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4169">Alternative sources of support will be examined particularly with reference to funding from other state agencies to avoid duplication.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4170">To establish if income is generated by scheme activity and the potential for utilisation of these funds to cover project costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4171">The review is being undertaken in consultation with Sponsors and CE Supervisors at local level. In addition to this, the Department will meet with representative bodies and relevant state Agencies to gather views ways to lessen hardships given the requirements of the reductions.  The outcomes will be incorporated into the Report for the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_4172">In addition, Initial work on a review of certain activation measures has commenced, including Community Employment.  The format of the review has recently been agreed and it will take a number of months to complete.  This is a high level policy review that is examining the current structure of certain schemes, their interactions, overlaps and aiming to determine if they are compatible with the Department's short, medium and long term goals in relation to activation.</p>

There are some exceptions, as for administrative or control purposes we may limit the choice of payment method e.g. Jobseeker payments may only be collected at Post Offices.

In these circumstances, the Department does not stipulate a minimum travelling distance for customers who are referred to alternative post offices.  However, I have been assured by An Post that before taking any decision to close a post office, it considers the relevant issues from a customer perspective, including the distance customers may have to travel to the nearest alternative post office.

The revised decision is based on all the relevant facts and circumstances of the particular case. An overpayment arising from the revised decision will be deemed to be due to either (a) fraud/suspected fraud, (b) customer or third party error or (c) Departmental error. In this context, there is no distinction made between the fraudulent or suspected fraudulent claiming. A case is only confirmed as being fraudulent where the Department successfully prosecutes a claimant for a social welfare offence.</p>

It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  These papers were received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 24 October 2011 and the appeal was assigned to an Appeals Officer on 11 January 2012 who will decide whether the case can be decided on a summary basis or whether to list for oral hearing.

            <p eId="para_4244">Since 2005 rent supplement expenditure has increased from €369 million to a provisional outturn of €503 million in 2011. The number of persons claiming the allowance increased from almost 60,200 persons in 2005 to over 96,800 as at end 2011, a 61% increase.  New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012. These new limits are in line with the most up to date market data available. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that value for money is achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4245">All new rent supplement applications are subject to these limits. As existing claims come up for review or when an existing lease expires, they will be reassessed using the new limits. Where a claim is under review and the rent is above the new maximum limit the customer is being asked to contact the landlord to renegotiate the rent.  Where a landlord does not agree to reduce the rent to the new rates departmental officials will discuss the options open to the tenant up to and including seeking alternative accommodation. Departmental guidance to the officers administering rent supplement states that where negotiation with the landlord fails then rent supplement may continue to be paid for a period of up to thirteen weeks at the higher rate. However, once the lease has expired the tenant will be expected to find suitable accommodation at below the new limits in force.</p>

The CIB publishes a list of serving board members in its annual report and on my Department’s website, as follows: <i>http://www.welfare.ie/EN/AboutUs/Pages/CIB_Members.aspx</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_4380">In 2011, the total amount of fees paid in respect of board members was €74,543.  This is in line with the fees payable to members of boards of category 4 non-commercial public service bodies, as outlined in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.  The CIB also pays expenses to board members in line with standard public sector rates. Expenses paid to board members are also published in the CIB annual report. The total paid in expenses to board members in 2011 was €9,226.</p>

            <p eId="para_4382">The Pensions Board is a regulatory body and the statutory role of the board is to monitor and supervise the operation of the Pensions Act 1990 (as amended).  The operations of the Pension Board, including payment of fees to the board members, are largely financed by annual fees payable to it by occupational pension schemes and by providers of Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) and trust Retirement Annuity Contracts. There are currently 16 members serving on the Board with one vacancy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4383">The total amount of fees and expenses paid to members of the Pensions Board in 2011 was €105,525.  There would be no savings to the State in the event that these fees are withdrawn as the fees to the board members are funded by occupational pension's schemes and by providers of Personal Retirement Savings Accounts and trust Retirement Annuity Contracts.</p>

Further information in relation to the boards of the Social Welfare Tribunal, the Citizens Information Board and the Pensions Board is available on the Department's website at <i>www.welfare.ie/EN/AboutUs/Pages/stateagencies.aspx</i> and is updated as required.</p>

            <p eId="para_4390">I propose to take Questions Nos. 407 and 408 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4391">The priorities set out in the Programme for Government for the rationalisation of State Agencies states that rationalisation must be cost effective and lead to a more transparent, accountable and efficient public service.  The overriding imperative is the requirement to affect savings and achieve administrative efficiencies in all areas of expenditure and to reduce overheads.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is not possible at this stage to outline projected savings for each State body to be rationalised.  However, the implications from this decision are currently being examined within my Department with a view to identifying savings and opportunities for efficiencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_4392">I am confident that there are currently a number of robust arrangements and legislative provisions governing the relationship between the various agencies under the aegis of my Department and the Department. I am satisfied, therefore, that compliance with public administrative procedures and related practices is monitored regularly through these mechanisms.  However, the Deputy should note that departmental officials are currently working on the development of uniform Service Level Agreements, which will be put in place for the relevant bodies under the aegis of my Department and will focus on outputs, accountability and efficiencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_4448">The 2007 EU Eel regulation (1100/2007), drafted in response to the endangered status of the European Eel, required EU States, including Ireland, to develop Eel Management Plans.  Based on the scientific facts available, a recommendation of this plan was that Ireland close both the commercial and recreational Eel fisheries in 2008.  The then Central and Regional Fisheries Boards engaged with the eel fishermen representatives to investigate possible diversification schemes; however, no specific funding was identified for diversification. I understand that   a number of former eel fishermen have been contracted by the ESB to undertake Trap and Transport operations to mitigate the impact of hydropower schemes as part of the eel management plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_4449">In June 2012, the status of eel in Ireland, and across Europe, will be reviewed as part of the reporting requirement for the 2007 EU regulation.  This will include a review of the status of the eel stocks nationally and the potential for commercial fishing in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_4450">This report will clarify and update the situation for eel fishery in Ireland and it will inform any decision to open the fishery or to keep it closed.  In line with the conservation imperative, no fishing will be permitted in the interim.  Recently the status of the European Eel in Ireland was defined as critically endangered on the Amphibians, Reptiles and Freshwater Fish Red Data List, published in 2011.  Scientific analysis estimated that 2007 eel escapement (adults going to sea) was at 23% of pristine stock and declining.  Due to the very long life cycle and slow growth in Irish waters it is probable that any recovery of the Irish eel stocks will be over a very long time frame.</p>

            <p eId="para_4452">I can advise the Deputy that based on assessments the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) on the Bandon River is 933 for the 2012 season more than twice the TAC for 2011.  The TAC is apportioned between the recreational and commercial sectors by the District Director of Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) following consultation with, and advice from, the Fisheries District Committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_4453">It is fair to say that the District Committee and the Director will, in this case, consider the overall TAC increase for 2012 and the interests of the angling and commercial sectors in their deliberations.  There are of course other factors to be considered in these deliberations, such as the impact of predation and fish health on the fishery.   This consultation and advisory process is due to take place in late spring/early summer and in that regard it is not appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of that process at this stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_4459">The 2012 Exchequer allocation for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is €100.336 million, which includes a carryover provision of €15 million and represents a reduction of €29.283 million on SEAI's 2011 allocation.  The administrative allocation for the SEAI in 2012 is €8.265 million, which represents a reduction of €0.703 million on 2011.  The 2012 capital allocation for domestic retrofit measures is €68.146 million, which represents a reduction of €15.537 million on 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_4460">Better Energy: Homes is a demand-led programme open to all homeowners of dwellings built before 2006.  The funding provision for 2012 allows for a similar number of transactions as in 2011.  The final number of homes upgraded this year will however depend on the number of applications received from homeowners and the nature of the measures applied for.  The grant levels are set out in Table 1 and homeowners can apply for any number of measures so long as the minimum grant amount of €400 for the first application is met.</p>

            <p eId="para_4501">The distribution of television licence fee receipts is governed by the provisions of Section 123 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by Part 4 of the Communications Regulations Act 2011.  In effect, the majority of licence fee revenue is paid to RTÉ, TG4 and an amount equal to 7% of net licence fee receipts is available to all broadcasters to apply for through the Broadcasting Funding Scheme.  I have no intention of amending this provision in the Broadcasting Act 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4502">RTÉ, as a public service broadcaster, is funded through a mix of licence fee and commercial revenues obtained largely from advertising.  The public funding element is provided for the purpose of allowing the company to meet its public service broadcasting objects.</p>
            <p eId="para_4503">These objects are set out in Part 7 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, and they provide the company's statutory mandates and encapsulate national policy in terms of public service broadcasting.  They include the specific objective of providing national, free-to-air public service broadcasting services, as well as the provision of a broad range of other additional services that are seen as fundamental to the role of the public service broadcaster.  In pursuit of these objects, the provisions in the Act subject the company to a range of additional requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_4504">The rationale for providing State funding for Public Service Broadcasting is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows the two public service broadcasting corporations, RTÉ and TG4, to attain their public service objects, while ensuring they can maintain a high level of editorial independence.  This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4505">These statutory objects and requirements clearly set the State-owned public service broadcasters apart from their commercial counterparts who, while bringing choice and competition to the market, are privately owned and funded companies that have entered the market on the basis of a commercial proposition.</p>
            <p eId="para_4506">I am aware that the funding of the public service broadcasters has been subject to criticism by private sector broadcasters and, in particular, that there has been criticism of the dual public and commercial funding model as applied to RTÉ.  The funding of privately owned independent broadcasters is, of course, derived from their own commercial activities.  Independent broadcasters can voluntarily apply for a broadcasting licence from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) and are not subject to the same statutory requirements in terms of their broadcasting remit.</p>
            <p eId="para_4507">It is also worth noting that public, community and independent commercial broadcasters can all access funding from the Broadcasting Funding Scheme, the purpose of which is to encourage the inclusion of additional programming of a particular character in broadcasters programme schedules.  The Scheme is open to independent producers and all ‘free to air' broadcasters and is funded by way of a payment of 7% of net licence fee receipts, which is paid to the BAI in respect of this Scheme.  This amount was increased from 5% to 7% under the Broadcasting Act 2009.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4554">I propose to take Questions Nos. 429, 445, 456, 457, 462 and 465 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4555">As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Development Survey 2011, launched by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas. Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4556">Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4557">Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4558">Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4559">Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents</p>
            <p eId="para_4560">Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorization process include, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4561">the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting facilities, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4562">the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4563">the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4564">the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4565">the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4566">where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with.</p>
            <p eId="para_4567">This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_4568">Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge. This list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012. A revised list of estates will be prescribed for 2013 after which time the waiver for unfinished housing developments will end. Throughout this period it is anticipated that the numbers of categories 3 and 4 developments will decrease significantly as my Department continues to work with local authorities and other stakeholders to resolve outstanding issues, including through the Public Safety Initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_4569">In terms of wider efforts to resolve problems associated with unfinished housing developments, my Department is also chairing the National Co-ordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments to oversee implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group, together with the Government's response to the recommendations. This Committee includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA, Irish Rural Link and the construction sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_4570">The Committee is meeting on a regular basis with the aim of publishing a report on progress achieved before the end of this year. In the meantime, work is ongoing on implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group and real progress is already being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates.To date, my Department has made allocations totalling some €2.54 million to twenty three local authorities from the €5 million funding allocation made available to address immediate safety issues. The types of works that have been approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting, and other works to secure sites. My Department will be making further allocations as applications are received from local authorities and assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4571">Planning authorities are also making progress in securing the co-operation of developers, financial institutions, both domestic and foreign owned, and/or bond holders, thereby obviating the need to use Exchequer resources to fund such work.</p>

            <p eId="para_4585">The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water.  The Programme for Government also commits to the establishment of Irish Water, a State company that will take over the water investment and maintenance programmes of the 34 county and city councils with the key aim of supervising and accelerating the significant investment needed to update the State's water and wastewater infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_4586">The Programme of Financial Support for Ireland with the EU/IMF/ECB also contains commitments to prepare proposals for implementation of the recommendations of an independent assessment of the transfer of responsibility for water services provision to a water utility and that water charges would be introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_4587">On 16 January 2012, my Department commenced a public consultation on the proposed reforms, seeking views from the public on the establishment of Irish Water and the introduction of water charges.  Persons wishing to participate in the consultation process can make submissions to my Department before the close of business on 24 February 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_4588">The Government has indicated its intention to commence the installation of water meters in households connected to public water supplies later in 2012.   This will facilitate moving to a charging system for domestic water users that is based on use above a free allowance as provided for in the Programme for Government.  No decision has been taken on the level of the proposed free allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4589">It is envisaged that the metering programme will create up to 2,000 jobs per annum over a three-year period and that installation contracts will be awarded to a significant number of private contractors. The nature of the work will involve minor excavation and reinstatement works and will provide much needed employment in the construction sector. The types of jobs involved could include general operatives, plumbers, fitters, supervisors, contract managers and accounts and administration staff.  The recruitment of staff and ensuring that they have the skills to carry out the necessary works will be the responsibility of the private contractors. A quality assurance system will be put in place to ensure that contractors install the boundary boxes and meters to a common and agreed set of standards.  The procurement strategy for the metering programme is being finalised and no contracts have yet been awarded.  Tenders processes will be managed in accordance with national and EU procurement guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_4590">It is proposed that regulation of the water sector will be managed under the Commission for Energy Regulation. The primary role of the regulator will be to protect the interests of customers and to ensure a consistent and appropriate level of service is provided to customers; the regulator will be given appropriate powers in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_4597">I propose to take Questions Nos. 435 and 437 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4598">The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure in County Cork.  The Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of some €230 million in the county during the period of the Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4599">The Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic recovery.  A key input to the development of the Programme was an assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, at my Department's request to the authorities in 2009.  These were subsequently appraised by my Department in the context of the funds available and programme priorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that were more strategically important at the time.  Cork County Council submitted proposals for both the Ballingeary and Macroom Sewerage Schemes but it was not possible to include these proposals amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion in the Programme.</p>

Inclusion of previously submitted projects was only considered where the circumstances had changed.  While Ballingeary Sewerage Scheme was included among the proposals received from Cork County as part of this review, as there was no change in circumstances which would alter the priority attached to the project, it was not included amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected as additions to the Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4602">Since 1990, my Department has, in funding the provision of secondary waste water treatment plants under the Water Services Investment Programme, also provided funding for anaerobic digestion facilities for sewage sludge treatment at such plants. There are some 15 anaerobic digestion plants in Ireland treating sewage sludge at municipal wastewater treatment plants.   Anaerobic digestion is one of a number of processes recommended for producing biosolids from sewage sludge suitable for recycling to agriculture.</p>
            <p eId="para_4603">The capital cost of an anaerobic digestion facility limits it's suitability to larger plants.  Therefore, while processes selected or approved by water services authorities for smaller schemes or group sewerage schemes respectively under the Rural Water Programme, are a matter for the authority concerned, from an economic perspective anaerobic digestion would not be suited to smaller town or village schemes.</p>

This provision applies to all premises, domestic and non-domestic. In addition, any company that discharges trade effluent to sewers requires an effluent discharge licence which is issued by a local authority under the provisions of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990.</p>

            <p eId="para_4622">Primary responsibility in monitoring the implementation of the plastic bag levy in shops and supermarkets rests with the local authorities. This involves local authorities undertaking a range of actions to ensure compliance by retailers with their obligations in respect of the plastic bag levy, including—</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4623">carrying out spot checks at retailers;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4624">ensuring that the levy is passed on in full to customers;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4625">ensuring that exemptions are not being abused;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4626">checking tills to confirm that customers are being charged the 22 cent levy for plastic bags where applicable;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4627">taking appropriate action where it has been established that the levy has not been charged to customers — such as  issuing a letter informing the retailer of their obligations under the legislation and taking appropriate follow up action to ensure compliance where necessary;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4628">investigating complaints from the public in respect of failure by a retailer to charge the levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4629">In relation to non-compliance discovered by a local authority enforcement officer, a warning letter is issued and a follow up inspection is carried out. If the retailer is still non-compliant, the next step would be for the local authority to pursue legal action. The Revenue Commissioners will also be contacted if it is suspected that the non-compliance has been ongoing, resulting in a significant amount of levy not having been collected.</p>
            <p eId="para_4630">Statistics collected by the Environmental Protection Agency on local authority enforcement activities indicate that approximately 800 plastic bag levy inspections were carried out in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4631">The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for collection and recovery of the levy and for ensuring that businesses are aware of their obligation in relation to making returns. This involves a range of actions, including—</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4632">identification of accountable persons;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4633">processing returns and payments received from accountable persons;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4634">carrying out verification checks relating to the accuracy of returns;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4635">pursuing accountable persons who fail to deliver returns and payments within the statutory time limits;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4636">raising estimates where returns are not received or where liability is understated;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4637">dealing with appeals against estimates raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_4638">Since its introduction on 4 March 2002, the plastic bag levy has been an outstanding success. It is designed to encourage people to make more environmentally friendly choices by using reusable bags. The levy applies to all bags made wholly or partly of plastic, regardless of durability, with the exception of the specific exemptions set out in the Waste Management (Environmental Levy) (Plastic Bag) Regulations 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_4639">I have no plans to introduce measures in respect of the durability of plastic bags which are being provided by retailers. Ultimately it is a commercial decision for retailers  to determine what, if any, form of plastic bag  they wish to make available to their customers and a matter for the consumer to determine if, having regard to its durability or any other factor, they wish to purchase that bag.  It is also a matter for the retailer to decide on any appropriate actions they may wish to take in response to customer feedback.</p>

            <p eId="para_4655">The Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011 sets out the duties for owners of domestic wastewater treatment systems including septic tanks. The Bill requires an owner of such a system to ensure that it does not constitute, or is not likely to constitute, a risk to human health or the environment and, in particular, that it does not create a risk to water, air or soil, or to plants and animals, create a nuisance through noise or odours, or adversely affect the countryside or places of special interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_4656">It is my intention, following the enactment of the legislation, to carry out a public consultation on draft performance standards for domestic wastewater treatment systems which will be prepared by my Department in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency.  The Bill also provides that householders must register details of their wastewater treatment systems on a national register and that a fee of no more than €50 will be charged for registration. Registration will be valid for a period of 5 years and there are no plans to introduce any further registration charges or an inspection charge.</p>

            <p eId="para_4802">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to improve the quality of information available on the Irish housing market by requiring that the selling price of all dwellings be recorded in a publicly available national housing price database.  This commitment has been given effect in the recently-enacted Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011. Under the Act, the statutory functions of the Property Services Regulatory Authority will include the publication of residential property sales prices. This data will be supplied to the Authority on an ongoing basis by the Revenue Commissioners who are in receipt of it for stamp duty purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4803">I intend to make an order establishing the new Authority as soon as possible. An advertisement inviting expressions of interest from suitably qualified persons for appointment as members of the Authority was published in December and a broad range of applications was received by the 21 December deadline. These are currently being assessed. I expect that the publication of residential property prices will be one of the Authority's priorities following its establishment.</p>

Neither in those reports nor in this response will it be possible to give details of the average and longest time that persons have been accommodated in each RIA accommodation centre.  Information is not compiled in such a way that would allow this detail to be provided. That level of detail would be considered unnecessary as residents are not allocated to or between centres based on time spent in the system. Therefore it is statistically likely that the overall breakdown shown in the annual and monthly reports would apply broadly to residents in each centre.</p>

            <p eId="para_4824">The Deputy will understand that it is not the policy nor would it be in the public interest to comment in detail on matters relating to the personal security of individuals, including witnesses in criminal trials.  A high level of confidentiality is essential to protect the individuals involved who may be subject to Garda protection measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_4825">The question of the level of protection afforded to individuals is a matter for An Garda Siochána in the light of their risk assessment. There has been no change in that policy. Furthermore there has been no decrease in resources allocated for witness protection in 2012. The budgetary allocation remains the same as that provided for in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_4826">The Deputy will be aware that there are also statutory protections available to witnesses.  Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 makes it an offence to harm or threaten, menace or in any other way intimidate or put in fear a person who is assisting in the investigation by An Garda Síochána of an offence or a witness or potential witness or a juror or potential juror in proceedings for an offence or a member of his or her family, intending to obstruct, pervert or interfere with an investigation or the course of justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_4827">The original penalty provided for in the 1999 Act upon being found guilty under this section was 10 years.  In view of the gravity with which this type of criminal activity is viewed, the penalty was increased to 15 years by the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009.  Let me emphasise that the Garda will continue to rigorously enforce the provisions of the law relating to witness and jury intimidation.</p>

            <p eId="para_4831">The Agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United States of America on Enhancing Cooperation in Preventing and Combating Serious Crime was signed on 21 July 2011. It requires the approval of the Dáil under Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution and a motion seeking the approval of the Dáil is due to be considered by the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in the coming weeks.  The signing of this agreement  assists in maintaining Ireland's ongoing eligibility for participation in the United States' Visa Waiver Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4832">The Agreement provides that fingerprint and DNA reference data from each country's national databases, when established, should be shared in specific defined circumstances. Under the Agreement, which is similar to the EU Council Decision on enhancing cooperation in combating cross-border crime, a search can be made by one party of the database of the other to establish if a match for specific data exists. There is no sharing of data at this stage, it is simply an anonymous check which results in a ‘hit' or a ‘no hit'.</p>
            <p eId="para_4833">Should the search procedure show a match for the data, a request can then be made for additional information.  However, any sharing of the details of the data will be governed by the provisions of the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the USA. In that context, I would emphasise that those provisions require that the data can only be provided in the context of a criminal investigation or prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_4834">Sharing of data related to minor offences are excluded under the Agreement.  In this regard a minor offence is one which, upon conviction, attracts a sentence of imprisonment of less than one year.</p>

         asked the

         the position in this jurisdiction regarding parentage, guardianship and citizenship rights for a child born to a surrogate mother outside of the State and returned to Ireland with its biological father and his wife, the adopted mother (details supplied); the child’s entitlement to an Irish passport based on its father’s nationality; if legislation will be introduced on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4852">As I indicated in my response to question number 25 of 1 December 2011, the law as it stands allows children born through surrogacy arrangements to acquire Irish citizenship, provided the commissioning father is the biological father of the child. Such a father may apply to court for a declaration of paternity under section 35 of the Status of Children Act 1987. Once paternity is established the child can be determined to be an Irish citizen.</p>
            <p eId="para_4853">Given the complex way in which existing law, domestic and international, applies to surrogacy matters, a guidance document for people who are considering arranging for a surrogate mother to give birth to a child outside the State is being finalised by an interdepartmental group coordinated by the Office of the Attorney General. I expect that the guidance document will be published within the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_4854">I have already indicated that I intend in due course to develop proposals for legislation on surrogacy.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the detail of the case to which the Deputy refers, as the matters concerned are family law matters and subject to the in camera rule. Moreover, I understand that the case is also sub judice as it is the subject of an appeal to the High Court.</p>

            <p eId="para_4899">The management and administration of the courts, as the Deputy will be aware, is a matter for the Courts Service.  The allocation of the business of the courts, scheduling of court cases and the management of court lists are matters for the judiciary and the Presidents of the courts.  The Deputy will also be aware that judges are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  The criminal courts are exceptionally busy, dealing with over 500,000 criminal matters in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4900">I am informed that the judiciary monitor waiting times and backlogs of court cases on an ongoing basis to ensure that delays are kept to a minimum.  Where possible, additional judges are assigned by the Presidents to Circuits and to Districts to assist with the disposal of cases where backlogs have arisen.  The Courts Service works with the judiciary to ensure that all cases are dealt with and disposed of as speedily as possible.  The Service has been engaged in a modernisation programme including an end-to-end examination and reform of court processes and procedures to bring about efficiencies in the management of the courts and the services provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_4901">Notwithstanding this I intend to take action, within my area of responsibility as Minister, to seek to address particular problems as they arise.  For example, in the context of a judgment from the European Court of Human Rights which found Ireland in breach of Articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, last year I established an Expert Group to consider, inter alia, remedies for delay in the courts and I look forward to considering their report when it is to hand.  In addition, a Working Group, which includes a judge from the Circuit court and the District court, is currently considering what measures or practices might assist in achieving efficiencies across the criminal justice agencies.  That Group has been asked to report both to me as Minister and the Chief Justice in her capacity as the Chairperson of the Courts Service.  In addition, as part of overall plans to improve the efficiency of the criminal courts, a criminal procedure Bill is in the early stages of preparation.  The Bill will focus on reform of pre-trial processes to allow for greater efficiency in the progression of criminal cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_4902">An area of concern is the backlog at Supreme Court level which currently stands at 39 months.  This can also impact on the progress of criminal trials as the outcomes of judicial review are awaited.  The Government is committed to establishing a court of appeal and in this regard my Department is further considering the report of the Working Group on a Court of Appeal.  My Department, also, is in the process of finalising the Heads of a Mediation and Conciliation Bill that will provide a more structured approach to mediation in the legal system and will assist in removing the pressure on court time and the courts.</p>

            <p eId="para_4909">The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

            <p eId="para_4911">I am aware that in 2010 the International AIDS Society convened the XVIII International Aids Conference in Vienna.  As stated in the official declaration of the Conference (also known as the ‘Vienna Declaration') the aim of the declaration is to seek to improve community health and safety by calling for the incorporation of scientific evidence into illicit drug policies.  The declaration calls on governments and international organisations to undertake a number of measures including a transparent review of the effectiveness of current drug policies, the implementation of a science-based public health approach to address individual and community harms stemming from illicit drug use, decriminalisation of drug users and the meaningful involvement of members of affected communities in developing services and policies etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_4912">The Government's approach to tackling the problem of drug misuse is through a co-ordinated and integrated approach under the National Drugs Strategy 2009 to 2016.  The policy approach outlined in the Strategy was developed over an 18 month period and involved wide public consultation under the oversight of the Steering Group established for this purpose.  This extensive consultation process was undertaken so as to afford individuals and groups an opportunity to outline their views on the effectiveness of the policies and priorities to be outlined in the Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4913">The Strategy tackles the issue of drug misuse under the pillar headings of drugs supply reduction, education and prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  The Strategy is being delivered,  under the stewardship of my colleague and Minister of State at the Department of Health Roísin Shortall TD,  by a number of Government Departments and agencies in partnership with the community and voluntary treatment sectors.  The Programme for Government affirms the Government commitment to tackling the problem of drug misuse through the pillar based approach outlined in the Strategy and in partnership with relevant stakeholders.</p>

        <b> Deputy Finian McGrath</b>
         asked the

         if he will support Justice for the Forgotten in 2012 with adequate funding. 
        [3491/12]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_718">
            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_4924">In the period from 2003 to 2008 Justice for the Forgotten received total funding of over €1.2 million through the Remembrance Commission, which was financed by my Department.  Given the severe financial restraints under which my Department, in common with other Government Departments, have had to operate in recent years, there is unfortunately no further funding available for Justice for the Forgotten.</p>
            <p eId="para_4925">As the Deputy will be aware, from 2003 to 2008 the Remembrance Commission operated a Scheme of Acknowledgement, Remembrance and Assistance for Victims in this Jurisdiction of the Conflict in Northern Ireland.  Under the scheme, payments could be made to individuals under various categories such as acknowledgement payments, economic hardship payments and medical expenses payments.  The scheme also contained a provision to enable payments to be paid to groups offering support services to victims of the conflict.  Under this element of the scheme payments were made to Justice for the Forgotten for the purpose of meeting the counselling and other needs of victims or their family members.  During the period of operation of the scheme Justice for the Forgotten received €1.2m of the €1.5m allocated for victim support services and was the only recipient of money under this heading.  In addition the organisation had received over €890,000 from the Department of the Taoiseach in the period 2000 to 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_4926">The term of appointment of the Remembrance Commission came to an end on 31 October 2008 and funding under the scheme was ended by the previous Government at that stage.  Nevertheless, a decision was taken to grant further funding of €125,300 to Justice for the Forgotten to see the group through until the end of their financial year (31 July 2009).  This funding was made by two separate payments in January and  April 2009.  In June 2009 a further once off payment of €65,000 was made to Justice for the Forgotten to enable it to continue to operate while seeking to put alternative funding options in place.  I understand that Justice for the Forgotten has been integrated into the Pat Finucane Centre and is still in operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4927">Nonetheless, I can assure the Deputy that those victims who require ongoing medical treatment for injuries sustained in bombings and other incidents arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland will continue to be provided for by my Department, through the Victims of Crime Office.</p>

            <p eId="para_4931">It would not be possible to exempt a class of persons such as BRIC (i.e. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa)  family members from the existing immigration requirements without a change in primary legislation.  Non-EEA nationals, whether visa required or not, may apply to visit the State for up to a maximum of 90 days, including where they are visiting family members.</p>
            <p eId="para_4932">The 90 day limit is not arbitrary but is linked with the provisions in the 2004 Immigration Act requiring any persons residing in Ireland for more than 3 months to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau or their local registration officer, if outside of Dublin.  In effect, beyond the three month threshold they would be seen as residing in Ireland as opposed to merely visiting.  That does not prevent persons being permitted to stay beyond 90 days in exceptional circumstances but they must have a specific permission to do so and must go through the registration process, including payment of the necessary fee.</p>
            <p eId="para_4933">I will nevertheless arrange for my officials to keep this issue under review in the context of the Immigration Residence and Protection Bill 2010 and in policy development generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_4935">I am committed to keeping Irish visa and immigration procedures under regular review in the light of ongoing experience and the position of the countries which are members of BRICS, ie Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, will be  borne in mind in any such review.  The Deputy may wish to note that nationals of Brazil are not required to be in possession of a visa prior to seeking entry to the State.  Similarly nationals of South Africa, which joined the BRICS grouping in late 2010, are also visa exempt.</p>
            <p eId="para_4936">My Department gives regular and comprehensive consideration to the matter of Ireland's visa requirement on nationals of certain non-EEA countries, taking into account all relevant factors including, <i>inter alia, </i>irregular migration risk in relation to each country, exercising reasonable immigration controls, the position of families who may be separated because of those controls and more general factors such as the potential for growth in business, trade and tourism.  The Government is also committed to ongoing cooperation between Ireland and the UK in relation to border control and visas in the context of the Common Travel Area (CTA), including working towards convergence of visa-required countries.  Therefore, any proposed changes to visa arrangements must be considered in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_4937">While it has not been the general practice of the Visa Office, Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service to grant multiple entry visas for periods of up to ten years, it is open to any individual to apply for a visa for any purpose, the onus resting with the applicant to comply with requirements as they apply to the different categories of visas — including multi-entry visas.  Guidelines and information on the visa application process are available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (<i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>).</p>

            <p eId="para_4971">In reaching a decision on the closure of Garda stations, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of the Garda Síochána's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, both in terms of opening hours and possible closures. In addition, all Divisional Officers were asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda Station in their area.</p>
            <p eId="para_4972">In the case of the Garda Station in Moyvane, I am informed by the Commissioner that the population figures for Moyvane are derived from the Census which was carried out in 2006. Moyvane sub-district forms part of the Listowel District in the Kerry Garda Division and the personnel strength of that District, on the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 54.  It is intended, where possible, that the resources currently available in Moyvane Garda Station will remain in the Listowel Garda District, subject at all times to operational requirements determined by the Commissioner.</p>
            <p eId="para_4973">It must be stressed that the key objective of the station closures is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than secure modest cash savings. In this context the Commissioner has concluded that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the frontline if these particular stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_4974">The Garda Commissioner has reiterated the commitment of An Garda Síochána to providing a professional and effective service to the community. Each Divisional Officer with responsibility for a Division that will be affected by this decision has been tasked with developing a comprehensive consultation strategy together with a tailored implementation plan that will meet the particular needs of their Division. They will consult with the various stakeholders within their respective Divisions during this process.  The priority will remain, that an effective and professional policing service is provided to every part of the community, both rural and urban.</p>

            <p eId="para_4982">The Fines Act 2010 contains a number of provisions designed to improve the collection of fines and reduce the number of people committed to prison for the non-payment of fines.  Among these provisions is the requirement that the court take the person's financial circumstances into account when fixing the fine.  Other provisions, which require changes to the Courts Service IT systems, will be commenced later this year.  These include: the payment of fines by instalments (section 15); the appointment of receivers to recover outstanding fines or assets to the value of same (section 16); and the substitution of community service orders for a fine, where the fine remains unpaid after a receiver has completed his or her work (section 18).</p>

            <p eId="para_4999">An Garda Síochána has undertaken a number of initiatives to raise awareness of metal theft.  As part of the Supporting Safer Communities campaign, advice has been developed on the prevention of theft of farm machinery and securing vulnerable metal farm equipment and a farm security initiative has been launched, with the support of the Irish Farmers Association.  All Divisional Officers have been advised of measures which can be put in place to prevent and reduce such crime.

With regard to the regulation of waste activities, my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has asked his Department to examine waste licensing and permitting legislation to ensure all necessary provisions, particularly those relating to traceability, are in place to avoid situations that might be exploited by criminal elements.  I am informed that this examination is ongoing.</p>

            <p eId="para_5003">The visa application referred to by the Deputy was received in the Visa Office, Dublin on 6 September 2011.   Following consideration by a Visa Officer it was refused on 14 November 2011 for the following reasons:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5004">1. There was insufficient documentation submitted in support of the visa application, specifically the Visa Officer noted that the contact/host in Ireland had not provided their most recent P60;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5005">2. The Visa Officer was not satisfied with regard to the relationship history of the persons concerned.  The evidence provided in support of the relationship history was deemed to be insufficient.</p>
            <p eId="para_5006">The Applicant appealed the refusal to grant a visa.   The decision of the Visa Officer was upheld by an Appeals Officer on 20 December 2011.  Each visa application is entitled to one appeal only.  It is however open to the Applicant to submit a fresh visa application at any time.</p>
            <p eId="para_5007">Where doing so the applicant may wish to note that photographs and immigration stamps alone are not deemed to be sufficient evidence of a relationship having been in existence prior to the application being made.  Because of the unique nature of each case, it is not possible to be completely prescriptive about the type of supporting information that should be supplied.  However, verifiable evidence of a shared life or shared experiences together such as bank statements, common ownership of property or independent evidence of face to face meetings between the parties would all help.  Guidance information on the visa application process is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (<i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>).  For future reference the Deputy may wish to note that the full visa application number is 7249872.</p>
            <p eId="para_5008">Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p>

            <p eId="para_5126">The Deputy will be aware that I published the Inspector of Prisons Report of his inspection of Limerick Prison on 17 January, 2012.  I also published the Inspector's report of his first follow up report inspection along with the Irish Prison Service' Action Plan for implementing the Inspector's recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5127">The Director General of the Irish Prison Service has assured me that the vast majority of the issues raised by the Inspector in his report can be remedied in the short to medium term.  The Action Plan sets specific objectives and timeframes for implementing the Inspector's recommendations.  These include, for example, putting programmes in place for improving sanitation facilities, cleaning and refurbishment, replacement of broken windows, installation of vandal proof phones, new arrangements to ensure the opening of the library, training for staff, and improving conditions generally for prisoners and staff throughout the prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_5128">I am happy to note that a number of issues have already been addressed since the publication of the report.  It may be difficult but I expect every effort will be made to ensure the Action Plan is implemented within the timeframe given. Like the Inspector, I am encouraged by the progressive attitude now apparent in the prison and the improvements detailed on foot of his follow up inspection.  I accept that more needs to be done and I intend to visit the prison shortly to see for myself the progress made.</p>

            <p eId="para_5130">In reaching a decision on the closure of a number of Garda stations, including Loughglynn, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of the Garda Síochána's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, both in terms of opening hours and possible closures. In addition, all Divisional Officers were asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda station in their area.  The Commissioner concluded that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if the stations in question, including Loughglynn, no longer had to be staffed and maintained. There are no plans to review this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_5131">The priority will remain the provision of an effective and professional policing service to every part of the community, both rural and urban.<b/>It is intended, where possible, that the resources currently available in Loughglynn Garda station will remain in the Castlerea Garda District, subject at all times to the operational requirements as determined by the Commissioner. There are currently 2 Community Gardaí assigned to that District.</p>
            <p eId="para_5132">It must be stressed that the key objective of the station closures is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than secure modest cash savings. I am advised by the Garda authorities that an expenditure of just over €2,000 was incurred by An Garda Síochána from the Garda Vote in respect of minor repair works to Loughglynn Garda station in 2010. I am further advised that the Office of Public Works has separately undertaken maintenance works at Loughglynn Garda station with a view to securing the overall fabric of the building, in the context of the ongoing maintenance of its property portfolio. Expenditure on these works has been provided from the Vote of the Office of Public Works.</p>

            <p eId="para_5134">The Inspector of Prisons recommended in his 2010 Annual Report that an independent audit be commissioned by the Irish Prison Service examining the type of education being provided in prisons, the relevance of such education, the numbers being educated and the value for money being provided.  The audit's findings are currently  being assessed in consultation with the Department of Education and Skills and the Vocational Education Committees (VECs) with a view to the early implementation of improvements.</p>
            <p eId="para_5135">Prisoners are encouraged to participate in education activities and waiting lists where they occur are generally for the more popular educational programmes.  Where demand exists for specific courses every effort is made to facilitate prisoners in the shortest period of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_5136">The Education Unit in Mountjoy continues to run drama courses for prisoners.  Teachers find that it can be the first step to a wider engagement in education for prisoners who often have very poor educational attainment.  It is also a valuable tool in helping prisoners explore issues around personal development.  While school tours are available in a limited capacity in some institutions, I am informed that Mountjoy Prison is not in a position to facilitate such tours at this time for operational and security reasons.</p>

         if he plans to amend the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 to include racially aggravated harassment or other forms of racial or sectarian incitement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5138">Under the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 it is an offence, inter alia, to use words, publish or distribute written material, or broadcast any visual images or sounds which are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended, or, having regard to all the circumstances, are likely to stir up hatred.  The word "hatred" is defined as "hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation".</p>
            <p eId="para_5139">In addition to the foregoing legislation, where criminal offences such as assault, criminal damage, or public order offences are committed with a racist motive, they are prosecuted as generic offences through the wider criminal law.  The trial judge can take aggravating factors, including racial motivation into account at sentencing.  This includes the harassment offence under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997. A person convicted on indictment for this offence is liable to imprisonment for up to 7 years or an unlimited fine, or both. Also, the court may, in addition to or as an alternative to any other penalty, order that a defendant not communicate with or approach a complainant. This option is also available to the court where it is not satisfied that a person should be convicted of the offence of harassment but believes nevertheless, having regard to the evidence, that it is in the interests of justice to make a prohibition order.</p>
            <p eId="para_5140">In this jurisdiction, the legislature enacts criminal laws which usually provide for maximum penalties in the form of a fine or imprisonment, or both. Within our legislative framework, the determination of penalty in any individual case is largely a matter for the trial judge, taking case law, including appealed cases, into account.  This allows the courts to take all the circumstances of the offence and all the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors into account.  The gravity of the offence, the facts surrounding the commission of the offence, the criminal record of the accused and the impact on the victim are among the critical factors taken into account before a sentence is imposed.  The judge must take into account the circumstances of the offence and the offender.  Also, the Director of Public Prosecutions can appeal against the sentence imposed if he believes it to be unduly lenient.</p>
            <p eId="para_5141">In all the circumstances, I have no plans, at present, to amend the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989.</p>

For example, a person who submitted a valid application in January 2012 can expect a decision on their application in June/July 2012.

            <p eId="para_5186">Improved productivity in on-farm activities, including any in west Mayo and south Sligo, is focused on systematic management of field activities and an increased usage of virtual office technology by Department field staff. Systematic management is being achieved through increased use and functionality in the Department's Agricultural Field Inspection Testing System (AFIT) which allows on-farm activities to be best matched to relevant and proximate staff thereby ensuring, <i>inter alia</i>  , that only necessary expenses apply.  Technology enhancements in telephony and increased remote access availability to the Department’s suite of on-line systems are considerably reducing the return to base frequency for field staff and consequently the overall costs involved in the Departments’ on-farm activities.</p>

            <p eId="para_5202">Food Harvest 2020 lays down an ambitious but achievable 50% growth target for the dairy output by 2020.  I consider the attraction of new entrants to the sector to be an important dynamic in achieving this goal and re-energising the dairy sector, and it is in this context that I have put in place a mechanism for setting aside a small portion of the additional quota available each year for new entrants.</p>
            <p eId="para_5203">In November 2008 the Council of Agriculture Ministers, as part of the transition to a non quota market situation, agreed to increase Member States' milk quota allocations by an immediate ‘across the board' 2% and by 1% per annum over the period 2009 to 2013.  Following detailed consideration with stakeholders, including industry representatives, on how best to utilise annual 1% allocation it was decided that one quarter of the increase should be set aside for a major initiative aimed at attracting new entrants into milk production.  Consequently over the last three Milk Quota years my Department has organised a scheme for the allocation of Milk Quota to New Entrants to dairy farming, based on 0.25% of the additional allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5204">The successful applicants were carefully chosen based on their own circumstances and their potential viability as dairy farmers. They each had to submit a comprehensive five year business plan and all applications were subjected to a rigorous assessment by a group of independent assessors. The successful applicants are required to attend training courses facilitated by Teagasc and provide financial statements on an annual basis to the Department.  I consider this Scheme to be an outstanding success and plan to run it again this year and next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5205">In respect of the existing milk quota holders they have received, in addition to the ‘across the board' 2% increase added to their quota in 2008, a 0.75% compounded increase over the last three years plus the positive effects of a downward adjustment in the butterfat coefficient which equates to a possible further 2% rise in their quotas.  They have received all of these increases at no cost.  Against this background I do not accept that the current mechanism of setting aside a certain volume of milk quota, free of charge, for the purpose of attracting new entrants into dairy farming can be construed as unfair.</p>

            <p eId="para_5220">Tote Ireland Limited (Tote Ireland) is a subsidiary of Horse Racing Ireland. The principal activities of the company consist of the operation of the totalisator at race meetings, the operation of a tele-betting service and an internet service. Tote Ireland's income derives from the amount retained from those wagers placed into Tote Ireland pools and the commission earned on bets placed into pools operated by Totes in foreign jurisdictions.  The accounts of Tote Ireland show a decline in income from €9m to €6.2m over the period 2008 to 2011. The company has achieved a reduction of 45% in its costs between 2008 and 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_5221">Tote Ireland reported losses, before distributions, of €0.4m in 2008 and €0.6m in 2009. The company reported a welcome return to profit, before distributions, of €0.5m in 2010 and €0.9m in 2011. These figures reflect outturn before accounting for payments made to racecourses. Over this period Tote Ireland made payments to racecourses to the value of €0.6m in 2008; €0.3m in 2009; €0.3m in 2010 and €0.3m in 2011, funded by reserves accumulated by Tote Ireland. It should be noted that in addition to the payments made to racecourses, Tote Ireland also made a significant dividend payment (€0.8m) to Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) in 2008. HRI, in turn, used this funding for prize money and various grant schemes of which racecourses are major beneficiaries.</p>

            <p eId="para_5248">As required by Government, my Department submitted a comprehensive expenditure review to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in 2011.  The review, which is available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform website, provides for cost reductions and a set of options to meet the funding constraints which are incorporated into the Government's public service reform plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_5249">The expenditure review, among other things, indicated Exchequer cost reductions totalling €47 million between 2008 and 2011 over the five (5) non commercial State sponsored bodies under the aegis of the Department (Teagasc, Bord Bia, Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Sea Fisheries Protection Board). Arising from the ongoing budgetary situation, the total Exchequer allocation, for all five bodies, has been reduced by a further €6m for 2012.  Additional Exchequer savings will arise over the coming years following the planned reduction in the total number of staff employed in the agencies from 1,685 at the end of 2011 to 1,393 by the end of 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_5250">The issue of securing further cost reductions from greater operational efficiencies across each agency is ongoing.  Over the last number of years the Department has been engaged in increasing the use of shared services between it and its state agencies, especially in the ICT area. The Department has just completed a major scoping exercise to identify further opportunities and will seek to make further progress in this area, especially in the context of the proposed shared service initiatives across the public service in payroll, pensions and HR.  In addition, the Public Service Reform Plan which was published in 2011 provides for specific reviews of the National Milk Agency, the Irish Maritime Development Office and Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  These reviews are being or will be undertaken by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_5254">As the Deputy may be aware a number of children focused services from various sectors, including the National Educational Welfare Board, have been brought together under my responsibility since June 2011 so as to facilitate Government's objective to deliver an integrated and consistent approach in the development of policy and services aimed at children.  The NEWB was established under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 as the statutory agency with responsibility to ensure that every child attends school regularly, or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_5255">With regard to allocations made available in previous years, €9,575,000 was made available in 2010 and €9,731,000 in 2011.  In the course of the 2012 Estimates process it was my intention to ensure, insofar as possible, that resources to address educational disadvantage were protected so as to maintain support to those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.  For this reason I am pleased to advise the Deputy that an allocation of €9,622,000 is being made available to the Board in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_5256">This level of funding will enable the Board to deliver on its expanded remit which includes responsibility for the administration and management of the Home School Community Liaison Programme, the School Completion Programme, in addition to the Education Welfare Service.  The Board is currently focused on developing an integrated school support service which can respond to the complexity of issues that impact on attendance, participation and retention in schools.  The resources being made available in 2012 will support the implementation of a new integrated model of service for the 2012-2013 academic year. It is also anticipated that the integration of services will realise further operational efficiencies in 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_5268">The Hague Convention website (<i>www.hcch.net</i>) sets out the position with regard to the countries which have ratified or acceded to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. The Hague Convention is designed to ensure a minimum set of standards in intercountry adoption. The latest information indicates that Taiwan is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_5269">The immediate priority for the Adoption Authority of Ireland is to put in place administrative arrangements with other countries which have ratified the Convention, as provided for under the 2010 Act. In this context, the AAI are currently developing administrative arrangements with a number of Hague countries.  Under the provisions of section 73 of the Adoption Act, 2010, "<i>the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State</i>.”  The AAI have not sought my consent in relation to Taiwan to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_5270">The Authority and my officials held exploratory meetings with Russian authorities in December in relation to preliminary discussions around the potential for a bilateral on intercountry adoption with that State. In addition, I have recently given the AAI  approval for the commencement of the process of examining the feasibility of a bilateral agreement with Ethiopia. The assessment of non-Hague countries and the possibility of entering discussions on a bilateral is complex and resource intensive. I am mindful that the Authority currently has a full work programme in terms of the countries which are signatories to the Hague Convention, and with Vietnam which is due to formally ratify the Convention with effect from 1 February 2012.  I have to have regard to the resources available to the AAI and to my Department, and to the work priorities of both.</p>

            <p eId="para_5274">The Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption is due to enter into force for Vietnam on 1 February 2012.   I have just returned from a very positive visit to Vietnam focusing on intercountry adoption. My visit coincided with a visit of a delegation from the Adoption Authority of Ireland led by the Chairman, Mr Geoffrey Shannon, to Vietnam to discuss administrative matters. My visit provided the opportunity for direct, personal engagement with the Vietnamese authorities, and the fostering of co-operation between our two countries on intercountry adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_5275">The Adoption Authority are continuing to advance the development of an administrative agreement with Vietnam, which was the subject of their separate discussions during the recent visit.  The Authority is also continuing work on the accreditation of agencies to work in Vietnam. The Authority informs me that the accreditation, by the AAI, of one or more adoption agencies to work in Vietnam in order to assist Irish couples is in progress. The agency accredited to work in Vietnam will work with the Authority in terms of processing applicants interested in adopting from Vietnam.</p>
            <p eId="para_5276">As Vietnam has been closed since 2010, the Authority do not directly hold information on numbers of applicants hoping to proceed to that country. However, I understand from information obtained from adoption providers that in the region of 350 prospective adopters have indicated a preference for Vietnam. It should be noted that this figure is indicative and the data has not been validated. It is to be expected that a number of these applicants will have, at this stage, proceeded to adopt from another country.</p>

            <p eId="para_5281">I propose to take Questions Nos. 577, 578, 582 and 583 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5282">With effect from 1 November 2010, intercountry adoptions can be effected with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention. Adoptions may also be effected with countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement.  The Hague Convention is a minimum set of standards in intercountry adoption in areas such as subsidiarity, consent and financial considerations.  Accordingly, the priority focus for the Adoption Authority is the putting in place of administrative arrangements with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention. Any bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would also need to meet the minimum standards as set out in the Hague Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_5283">The negotiation of bilateral agreements on intercountry adoption with states which have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010. Ireland has not to date entered into a bilateral agreement in respect of intercountry adoption. Under Section 73 of the Act, "<i>the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State</i>.”</p>
            <p eId="para_5284">Before Christmas I wrote to the AAI giving approval for the commencement of the process of examining the feasibility of a bilateral agreement with Ethiopia. The AAI have confirmed that, with the assistance of the Irish embassy in Addis Ababa, they are seeking an expert legal narrative and description of the current Ethiopian adoption law. This will be examined by the AAI to test for compatibility and compliance with the Adoption Act 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5285">In addition, the Authority and my officials held exploratory meetings with the Russian authorities in December. A delegation visited Russia in relation to preliminary discussions around the potential for a bilateral on intercountry adoption.  This was a follow up to previous discussions which took place earlier in the year, on the initiative of the Russian authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_5289">I propose to take Questions Nos. 579 to 581, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5290">A total of €1.7m (approximately) in funding has been available from 2010 to date for the specific support of the provision of youth cafés. The bulk of this funding was allocated to the dedicated competitive funding scheme announced in 2010.  The majority of the funds awarded from this scheme (approximately €1.5m) were distributed to the successful projects in 2011 and the facilities are gradually coming on stream. A further €200,000 was made available by my Department to various youth café projects in late 2011.  This brings the total funding (to date) to circa €1.7m. The funding was designed to both provide completely new youth cafés and to support existing youth cafés who needed assistance in providing additional facilities etc. Lists of the projects funded to date follow.</p>
            <p eId="para_5291">My Department is committed to supporting the development of quality, front-line youth work projects and services which address the changing needs of young people and communities. A key element of this is to support the continued nationwide development of youth café facilities given the considerable benefits they offer for young people to meet in safe drug and alcohol free spaces and most importantly the identification of the need for such spaces by young people themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_5292">In support of this priority, I have ensured that as part of the Government's Capital Review that capital funding available for youth projects is to increase from €0.8m in 2011 to €1.5m in each of 2012 and 2013. It is anticipated that a significant portion of this funding (approximately 50%) will be specifically allocated to youth cafés. It is important to state that this is capital not current expenditure.  Details of the manner in which these funds will be distributed will be announced in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_5293">The Department of Children and Youth Affairs now estimates that between 75-100 youth café facilities now operate across the state and are seen as hugely beneficial to local communities in terms of broader engagement with young people. The projects are in many cases run directly by or in partnership with young people and are popular with teenagers and young people generally. We must ensure therefore that we focus any funding supports to support as many as possible of the existing locations as well as providing targeted funding for new locations.</p>

            <p eId="para_5392">The Adoption Authority is an independent statutory body charged with implementing the Adoption Act, 2010. The Authority has responsibility for the direct operational implementation of legislation and Government policy.  Information relating to intercountry adoption from specific countries can be obtained from the Adoption Authority and is posted on the AAI website (<i>www.aai.gov.ie</i>).</p>
            <p eId="para_5393">With effect from 1 November 2010, intercountry adoptions can be effected with other countries which have ratified the Hague Convention or with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement.  As the Hague Convention is designed to ensure a minimum set of standards in intercountry adoption, it is appropriate that the immediate priority for the Adoption Authority on reaching agreements on arrangements with other Hague countries. The AAI are in the process of developing administrative arrangements with a number of countries which are signatories to the Hague Convention, and with Vietnam which is due to ratify the Convention with effect from 1 February 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_5394">Under the provisions of section 73 of the Adoption Act, 2010, "<i>the Authority, with the prior consent of the Minister, may enter into discussions with any non-contracting state concerning the possibility of the Government entering into a bilateral agreement with that State</i>.”  Ireland currently has no bilateral agreements in respect of intercountry adoption. The Authority and my officials held exploratory meetings with Russian authorities in December in relation to preliminary discussions around the potential for a bilateral on intercountry adoption with that State. In addition, I have recently given the AAI  approval for the commencement of the process of examining the feasibility of a bilateral agreement with Ethiopia.</p>

         asked the

         the level of funding that is available under the National Education Welfare Board for the school completion programme in 2012; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5405">The NEWB was established under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 as the statutory agency with responsibility to ensure that every child attends school regularly, or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The Act provides a comprehensive framework to promote regular school attendance and tackle the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The remit of the Board was extended in 2009 to include the Home School Community Liaison Service and the School Completion Programme (SCP), as well as the Educational Welfare Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_5406">With regard to the funding available in 2012, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that €28,256,000 is being allocated to the School Completion Programme this year. This funding is provided directly by my Department to the 124 projects and associated initiatives supported within the programme.  Although the 2012 Estimates process was the first for my new Department we have had to find savings as part of the national effort to address Ireland's deficit situation. With regard to the SCP the Comprehensive Expenditure Report identifies the requirement for savings of 6.5% per annum over the period 2012-2014. This equates to a saving of €2m in the Programme in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_5407">As a first step in considering how to achieve these savings I have requested my Department and the NEWB to complete a major review of the SCP by mid 2012. The review will be undertaken in conjunction with the Board's current work to develop an integrated national approach to educational support services. In this way the review will enhance the ongoing process of integrating the programme within a single national approach to attendance, participation and retention in schools. I appreciate that the achievement of savings will require difficult trade-offs to be made but it is anticipated that the review will identify operational efficiencies and other reforms which may assist to mitigate the impact of necessary savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_5408">As the SCP is a key school support strand of DEIS, I will continue to work closely with my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills and his Department to ensure that a coherent and consistent approach is taken to achieving our shared policy objectives within available resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_5430">I would like to inform the Deputy that the position in respect of my Department is that four agencies are funded by the Exchequer through my Department's Vote.  These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland  (AAI), the Family Support Agency  (FSA), the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and the Ombudsman for Children.  With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for children detention schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001. They are funded through my Department's Vote and I am responsible for the appointment of their board of management.</p>
            <p eId="para_5431">The board of the NEWB has a full complement of 13 members and there are currently 8 members, including the CEO, and 5 vacancies.  The AAI has a total of 7 board members and there are 2 vacancies at present.  The FSA currently has a complement of 12 board members with 5 currently serving and 7 vacancies.  The board for the children detention school consists of 13 Board members including a chairperson.  There is no board for the Ombudsman for Children's Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_5432">In respect of remuneration for board members in 2011, the remuneration payable to members of the FSA was €5,985 and the chairperson was paid   €8,978.  The chairperson of the AAI was paid €63,120 and ordinary board members were each paid €7,965.  The chairperson of the board for the children detention schools was entitled to a payment of €5,985 but was only paid €2,261.27 as he resigned on 18 May 2011.  Of the other board members,  6 were paid €2,992.50 each. The chairman of the NEWB was paid €5,000 but there is no remuneration being paid for ordinary members of the board. Members of boards who were already employed in the public service were not paid any remuneration.</p>
            <p eId="para_5433">Each agency maintains records of expenses paid to board members. For example, all board members are paid travel and subsistence as appropriate, in accordance with the provisions of the governing legislation, for attendance at board meetings. However, as each of the agencies in question and the children detention schools have not yet finalised their respective accounts for 2011, I cannot at this time provide the information on expenses paid to board members in 2011 as sought by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5434">Governance arrangements generally for these agencies and the children detention schools, including the potential for savings, will be examined in my Department in the context of the review of delivery of family and children services and in the context of this Government's commitment to Public Service Reform.</p>

            <p eId="para_5446">Substances which have the potential to be misused are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  The legislation prohibits the import, export, production, supply and sale, and possession of controlled drugs unless carried out in accordance with the terms of licences or regulations made under the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_5447">The Government has no plans to decriminalise the possession of illicit drugs deemed to be for personal use, for a number of reasons.  Significant physical and mental health risks are associated with long-term use of illicit drugs such as heroin, cocaine and cannabis.  Removing or lessening criminal sanctions may likely lead to increased levels of experimentation with drugs by young people, and sustained long term use causing increased health problems in our society.   Furthermore, decriminalisation at a national level rather than a European level might increase the risk of Ireland becoming a destination for "drug tourism" with consequential problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_5448">The Government is satisfied that the existing penalties associated with possession of cannabis or other controlled substances, which are lesser in the case of possession for personal use, are appropriate.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
            <p eId="para_5462">The legislative framework for the registration and inspection of residential services for people with disabilities is provided for by the Health Act 2007, which envisages a role for the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, in this regard. However, as the Deputy may be aware, the Act has not yet been commenced in respect of residential services for people with disabilities. Consequently HIQA has, at present, no remit in relation to inspecting these services.</p>
            <p eId="para_5463">In anticipation of the expansion of its role to include the regulation of this sector, HIQA has prepared and published standards which outline what is expected of a provider of services and what a person with a disability, his or her family, and the public can expect to receive from residential care services. The standards clearly set out what a quality safe residential service for people with disabilities should be and support the delivery of person-centred care in this sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_5464">The Government is committed to ensuring that vulnerable people with disabilities in residential services are safeguarded and protected, and that their quality of life is enhanced. With this in mind, the current Programme for Government commits to mandatory standards for this sector and inspections of services by HIQA.</p>
            <p eId="para_5465">As I announced on 16 June last, discussions have begun between the Department of Health and HIQA to progress this commitment. Given the complex nature of residential service provision for people with disabilities, ranging from congregated settings to dispersed housing in the community, careful consideration is being given to designing the most appropriate regulatory model and this work is ongoing. A target date of January 2013 has been provisionally set for the commencement of the proposed regulatory scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_5499">I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals.  In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</p>
            <p eId="para_5500">As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or day case surgery.</p>
            <p eId="para_5501">As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_5517">I propose to take Questions Nos. 629, 630, 665 and 666 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5518">As the HSE have investigated this incident and given that the response time was within the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) target for responses to Clinical Status 1 incidents by a patient-carrying vehicle, which is 18 minutes and 59 seconds, I do not consider it necessary for HIQA to carry out an inquiry into this case.  I understand that confusion may have arisen, and may have led to an impression that the response time was considerably longer, as a result of a procedural omission in which the on-scene arrival status button in the vehicle was not activated on arrival at the incident.</p>
            <p eId="para_5519">With regard to the second incident, a 999 call was received at 09:59 hours on 26 May 2011.  At 10:00 hours, the nearest available Emergency Response vehicle was dispatched to the scene.  It appears that a passing doctor started basic life support but then directed third parties to remove the patient in a van.  At 10.08 hours (9 minutes after receipt of the original call), a second 999 call, again by a third party, was received from the scene cancelling the ambulance as the patient was being transported by a private vehicle.</p>
            <p eId="para_5520">The NAS works on an area, rather than a local, basis and it is a dynamic rather than a static service in order to ensure the best placement of emergency cover.  Seven emergency ambulances operate directly within this area: two in Drogheda, four in Dundalk and one in Ardee.  They are supported by ambulances from surrounding stations in the first instance and also by NAS resources from adjoining areas.</p>

The CFRI  Annual Report for 2009 states that there were 1105 people diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis currently registered with the CFRI.  The Report indicates that this figure represents approximately 89.2% of the total Cystic Fibrosis population in Ireland.  The CFRI's annual census of living patients with Cystic Fibrosis indicates that there were 1,151 persons with a known diagnosis attending centres and clinics in the Republic of Ireland in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5525">Given the need to avoid the exposure of CF patients to possible sources of infection, the aim of the HSE and hospitals is to minimise wherever possible, the need to admit such patients to hospital.  Therefore the objective is to provide treatment for such patients on an ambulatory daycare basis, as close as possible to their home.</p>
            <p eId="para_5526">I recently approved a lotto grant of €150,000 to Build Life Cystic Fibrosis group in Cork/Kerry towards the cost of a plan for a dedicated 10 bed unit for Cystic Fibrosis in Cork University Hospital. I will be reviewing this project positively this year. The new unit at St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin is due to open in June 2012. I intend to actively examine some other projects to provide extra services for CF patients.

            <p eId="para_5532">The health and social care needs of individuals/families/communities are met by Primary Care Teams (PCTs) which include general practice (GP and practice nurses), physiotherapy, public health nursing, community nursing, occupational therapy, etc. and through the broader range of Health and Social Care Network services, e.g. psychology, dietetics, podiatry/chiropody, audiology, community ophthalmology, etc., who work with a number of PCTs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5533">Contingency planning is ongoing to ensure quality safe services can be delivered following the retirement of staff from services at the end of February 2012.  The HSE is currently carrying out a review of Public Health Nursing services, which is expected to be completed early in 2012.  This review will inform national HSE policy in order to facilitate the integration of services and the delivery of efficient and safe care to patients in the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_5534">In line with the commitment in the Programme for Government to significantly strengthen primary care services, additional funding of €20m has been provided in the HSE's National Service Plan 2012 to fill as many vacancies as possible and to expand existing arrangements where sessional services are provided by allied health professionals.  This will be increased to €25m if it can be established that there is scope for further savings of €5m in demand-led schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5535">During 2011, the HSE established a system to identify and record the numbers of staff applying to retire before the end of February 2012.  This information is updated on a regular basis as staff apply to retire.  Final figures for the actual number of retirements in this period will not be available until after the end of January 2012, reflecting the fact that a minimum of one month's notice of intention to retire must be given.</p>
            <p eId="para_5536">A breakdown by grade and region of Public Health Nurses (PHNs) who have indicated  that they will retire in the months of January and February 2012 has been provided by the HSE and is presented in the following table.  It should be noted that this data is subject to change in the event of additional applications being received or existing applications being withdrawn.  The breakdown provided is also subject to change as the individual applications are validated and processed.</p>

            <p eId="para_5568">Government policy is to support older people to live at home and in their communities for as long as possible. This is realised through a range of community based services such as mainstream Home Help, enhanced provision via Home Care Packages,  or through other service elements such as Meals-on-Wheels or Day Care. This is in addition to supporting access to other services that may be required, as appropriate, by older people such as high quality Intermediate or Long Term Residential Care.</p>
            <p eId="para_5569">While the recently agreed HSE Service Plan for 2012 involves a reduction of 4.5% in Home Help hours nationally, from around 11.2m hours in 2011 to 10.7m hours this year, the corresponding reduction proposed in the actual number of people receiving this service drops by only 1.2% or, in other words, from around 50,600 recipients last year to 50,000 in 2012. This reflects an increased focus by the HSE on more personalised care for the most vulnerable older people.</p>
            <p eId="para_5570">I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the levels of community based supports for older people contained in the HSE Service Plan maintains Home Care Packages for this year at 2011 levels. This reflects the commitment of the Government to provide the best possible services to the most vulnerable older people in the light of increasing competing demands and severe resource limitations overall.</p>

            <p eId="para_5575">The health and personal social services that will be delivered by the HSE within its budget and anticipated staff complement are set out in the National Service Plan for 2012, which I approved on 13 January.  It is clear that the cumulative impact of staff reductions from this year and previous years represents a significant challenge for the health system in delivering services.  It increases the need for reform including greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters as well as redeployment.  The Service Plan includes a commitment to addressing these issues within the context of the Public Service Agreement.  It also commits the HSE to minimising the impact on services by fast tracking new, innovative and more efficient ways of using reducing financial and human resources.  The Plan reflects the need to move to new models of care across all service areas which will treat patients at the lowest level of complexity and provide quality services at the least possible cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_5576">Other reform initiatives set out in the Plan include the development of proposals to protect the viability of community nursing units and to increase the intermediate care capacity for older people; a significant strengthening of primary care services; the enhancement of community mental health teams; a more tailored approach to disability services; and progression of the clinical care programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5577">I intend to review the Service Plan once the full impact of the staff leaving at the end of the 29 February "grace period" is known.  In advance of this, I have asked the HSE Board to submit as a matter of urgency its assessment of the likely impact of retirements to the end of February, to identify particular pressure points and to develop appropriate measures to deal with significant departures in a given service or area.</p>

            <p eId="para_5579">In the health service, agency staff have traditionally been used to meet a short-term service need or where some flexibility in staffing a service is required. In 2011, although the HSE had negotiated new agency contracts which involve lower unit costs, the use of agency staff accounted for approximately €200 million. This was accounted for in part by the usage of agency staffing to cover longer-term staffing needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5580">This is not a sustainable approach and the HSE's National Service Plan 2012 commits to significantly lowering the volume of agency usage across all staff functions, with a target reduction of up to 50% in 2012. The Plan also notes that the transposition into Irish law of the Temporary Agency Work Directive will increase the unit cost of agency staffing.  The Service Plan indicates that a national policy in relation to overtime and agency use will be finalised in early 2012.  This will reflect the commitment in the Plan that overtime and agency staffing are not to be used to support service levels beyond those agreed in the Plan or to substitute for staff losses as a result of the need to reduce health sector employment.  The Service Plan also provides that if the employment ceiling and budgets allow, some substitution through recruitment and employment of staff at lower costs may be possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_5582">Under its reform programme the Government has committed to achieving greater efficiencies in patient care and service delivery. We are also committed to developing a universal, single-tier health service, which guarantees access to medical care based on need, not income and that continues to be our aim. It will not be easy but I am certain that, having regard to the resources that will be available to it over the coming years, the Government can deliver a more cost-effective health service. This year we will deliver two important measures with the allocation of €35m for new mental health services and the €15m necessary to provide free GP care for people on the Long Term Illness scheme, which were promised in the <i>Programme for Government</i>. This underlines our commitment to the reform of the Health Services</p>
            <p eId="para_5583">I approved the 2012 National Service Plan on 13 January.  The Plan sets out a greater emphasis on maximising the level of services through innovation and more efficient use of the resources available. The reductions in funding for 2012 will pose major challenges and will require acceleration in the reform programme, which the HSE itself acknowledges.  I welcome the progress made by the Health Services in doing more with less and in providing flexibilities in line with the Croke Park agreement. We need the support and co-operation from healthcare workers at all levels to minimise the impact the reduction in funding will inevitably have on those who need our care. We will be working hard with the HSE, the unions and our staff to find ways of changing how we do our business and minimising the impact on service provision  as we move to models of care across all programmes that deliver services to patients and clients at the lowest level of complexity and the least possible unit cost.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Róisín Shortall)</from>
            <p eId="para_5607">I have requested a report from the Health Service Executive on its policy in relation to compensating those whose medical card renewals are delayed.  I have recently held detailed discussions with the HSE in relation to some issues which have arisen in the renewal of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_5608">A medical card holder who genuinely engages with the review of their medical card should not have their entitlement withdrawn before that review is complete.  The HSE is taking steps to ensure that this rule is properly implemented.  In particular, the HSE is undertaking significant changes to how it conducts reviews so that there is far less administrative burden placed on most medical card holders and so that reviews take far less time.</p>
            <p eId="para_5609">From this month, the HSE is easing the review process for pensioners.  The change will mean that reviews for medical card holders who are 66 years or over will operate on a self-assessment basis, as currently happens with over-seventies.  The self-assessment review model will also be extended to medical card holders under 66, who were granted their medical card on the basis of a means assessment, where the HSE is satisfied that the client has not passed away and is living in this jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_5610">The HSE is also standardising eligibility periods from two years to three years for people aged under 66 years, with a new four year eligibility period for medical card holders aged 66 or over. Notwithstanding, there continues to be an obligation on all card holders to notify the HSE of any change in their circumstances which would disentitle them from holding a medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_5611">In addition, from February 1, the HSE will implement a new system that provides additional functionality to GPs to maintain the eligibility of their patients where a patient is going through the renewal process.  This new system will also allow GPs to add new babies online.</p>
            <p eId="para_5612">These reforms should significantly reduce the administrative burden on these medical card holders and indeed the HSE, and ensure that some of the issues in relation to renewals are addressed.  I am continuing to engage with the HSE in relation to other possible changes to the renewal and application process.</p>

            <p eId="para_5617">At the request of my colleague, Dr James Reilly, Minister for Health, the HSE recently set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.

It is the Government's intention to extend free GP services to the entire population during the course of this Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_5620">The 2006 HSE guidelines (<i>Guidelines in relation to obtaining consent to Clinical Treatment in an Acute Hospital setting</i>) state: “Legally, the consent of only one parent is necessary.  The other parent does not have a veto, however best practice suggests the consent from both parents is preferred”.  In addition, the guidelines state: “If the parents of a child are legally separated, either parent can consent to medical treatment.  However, if the Court, in dealing with the legal separation conferred sole custody on one parent, a condition or direction would normally attach with regard to medical treatment for the child.”</p>

In the first half of 2011, discussions between the HSE and DCC, in line with recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General, were focused on establishing a co-operation agreement in relation to the future provision of ambulance services in Dublin.  The purpose of this approach was to ensure standardisation of emergency ambulances throughout the State and to achieve better value for money through economies of scale.</p>

Some of the funding will also be used to advance activities in the area of suicide prevention and response to self-harm presentations and to initiate the provision of psychological and counselling services in primary care specifically for people with mental health problems.   Some provision will also be made to facilitate the re-location of mental health service users from institutional care to more independent living arrangements in their communities, in line with <i>A Vision for Change.  </i>Details of how this funding will be apportioned are set out in the HSE National Service Plan for 2012 which was approved by the Minister in accordance with the Health Act 2004.</p>

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</p>

            <p eId="para_5658">I have held detailed discussions with the HSE with regard to issues arising in respect of medical card renewals.  A medical card holder who genuinely engages with the review of their medical card should not have their entitlement withdrawn before that review is complete.  The HSE is taking steps to ensure that this rule is fully implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_5659">The HSE is also undertaking significant changes to how it conducts reviews so that there is far less administrative burden placed on most medical card holders and so that reviews take less time.  From this month, reviews for medical card holders who are 66 years or over will operate on a self-assessment basis, as currently happens with persons over 70 years.  The self-assessment review model will also be extended to medical card holders under 66 years, who were granted their medical card on the basis of a means assessment, where the HSE is satisfied that the client is living in this jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_5660">The HSE is also standardising eligibility periods for people aged under 66 years, from two years to three years.  There will be a new four year eligibility period for medical card holders aged 66 years or over.  Notwithstanding that, there continues to be an obligation on all card holders to notify the HSE of any change in their circumstances which would disentitle them from holding a medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_5661">From February 1, the HSE will implement a new system to provide additional functionality to GPs to maintain the eligibility of patients who are going through the renewal process.  This new system will also allow GPs to add new babies online.  These reforms should significantly reduce the administrative burden on medical card holders and, indeed, the HSE, and ensure that some of the issues in relation to renewals are addressed.  I am continuing to engage with the HSE in relation to other possible changes to the renewal and application process.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
            <p eId="para_5694">The Special Delivery Unit has a special focus on trolley issues.  During October 2011, the SDU wrote to hospitals with the highest numbers waiting on trolleys seeking proposals aimed at reducing those numbers over the critical period of November 2011 to January 2012.  A range of measures were approved across 16 hospital sites and funding of €4.85 million was allocated for the purpose with strict performance criteria laid down.</p>
            <p eId="para_5695">In addition, the SDU put in place arrangements whereby a staff member was on duty every day over the Christmas and New Year period with each of the 28 emergency departments in the country submitting an update on the numbers waiting three times a day.  This allowed for close monitoring of hospitals at risk and facilitated quick decision-making on corrective action where required.  This process will continue during January 2012.  While it is too early for complacency, the signs so far have been encouraging.  Significant reductions in the numbers waiting each day have been recorded nationally, compared with the same period last year.  The situation will be closely monitored and appropriate action will be taken in relation to sites at risk, up to and including postponing elective surgery for a short period.</p>
            <p eId="para_5696">In relation to Galway and Portiuncula, sums of €350,000 and €87,000 respectively were approved to help alleviate emergency department pressures including the extension of Medical Assessment Unit from 12/24 to 24/24 (Galway); opening 8-bedded, 5-day unit (Galway); provision of off-site convalescence care for two week period, 6 patients per week for the remainder (Galway); enhanced interim care packages (Portiuncula); convalescent care (Portiuncula); and Open Beds — St. Francis Ward (Portiuncula).  I am pleased to report there has been an improvement in the number of patients on trolleys during this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_5697">I recognise there is a need to strengthen management capacity in the hospital sector.  The Galway hospitals have faced significant challenges in terms of service delivery and financial performance.  New management arrangements have been put in place in respect of Galway University Hospital (incorporating Merlin Park Hospital) together with Portiuncula and Roscommon Hospitals.  The hospitals have been placed within a single management structure led by a single CEO who will be responsible for group performance.  The CEO took up his post earlier this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_5698">These new arrangements are designed to deliver improved performance, organisational cohesion and effectiveness, and accountability for the safe and efficient delivery of acute hospital services within the Galway/Roscommon Group on a unified basis.  The new CEO will have full regard to the entire capacity of the hospital group with a particular emphasis on the developing the role of smaller hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_5699">While the overall target reduction in national employment numbers must be met, which will undoubtedly pose a significant challenge, the current Employment Control Framework for the health sector gives the HSE some flexibility in relation to filling posts in order to protect front line services in so far as possible while still achieving the required reduction in staff numbers.  In addition, the Public Service Agreement allows the HSE to redeploy staff based on service need.  My Department has requested the hospital and the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on the specific operational issues concerning nurse staffing and orthopaedics at Galway which he has raised.</p>

In this regard, I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</p>
            <p eId="para_5708">As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.  The management of waiting lists generally is a matter for the HSE and the individual hospitals concerned. I have, therefore, referred the Deputy's question to the Executive for direct reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_5718">The roads element of the National Development Plan evolved over the period of the plan.  The scale and scope of the roads to be constructed underwent a major expansion.  In addition, the higher cost of land and construction inflation had a significant impact on the eventual outturn figures.  Those elements of the national roads programme that were delivered were audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and were reported on separately in 2002 following an extensive review by Fitzpatrick Associates.   All the relevant audits acknowledged that the programme was, in general, well managed by the National Roads Authority in so far as factors within their control were concerned.  Over time, the original NDP underwent significant changes and eventually culminated in Transport 21 in 2005, which in turn was replaced by this Government's Infrastructure and Capital Investment Plan 2012 to 2016.  I am advised by my Department that given the variations in the programme of works arising from the different plans since 2000, a valid comparison between estimated costs over 10 years ago is not possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_5720">I am informed by the Road Safety Authority that there is an abundance of research into road traffic collisions involving motorcyclists, much of which focuses on the fact that motorcyclists are more difficult to see because of their relatively small frontal area compared to other vehicles.

            <p eId="para_5721">Observation studies conducted by the Road Safety Authority recorded high visibility clothing wearing rates of approximately 40% by motorcyclists in Ireland and that level may be higher now.

            <p eId="para_5724">A number of international teams have to date chosen the National Aquatic Centre at Abbotstown in Dublin as a training base before the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.  The UK Waterpolo team will be based at the Centre for a two-week training session in July 2012, immediately before the London Olympics. This development is a direct result of the international matches held at the NAC last year, between the British and Hungarian water-polo men's senior squads.  This booking is additional to the booking by the USA Synchronised Swim team who will be based at the NAC for up to six weeks prior to the Olympics.  The UK Paralympic Swimming Squad also participated in a week's training at the NAC last November.  The Dublin Cup Waterpolo competition, which will take place in the NAC in July this year will include the following international teams — Hungary (current Olympic Champions), Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, Germany and the UK.</p>

A CD containing the details of a number of Irish elite sports facilities which are suitable as pre-London training camps has been widely circulated internationally.  The   continuing difficulty is that the UK is offering financial incentives to every National Olympic/Paralympic Committee who brings their team to prepare in an approved Pre-Games Training Centre in the UK.  It is not feasible in the current economic climate for Ireland to offer similar financial incentives to try and attract international athletes and teams to base themselves here in the lead up to the London Games.</p>

            <p eId="para_5730">Little value could be attached to an estimate which stated that because Irish people spent a certain amount of money abroad on holidays that money would otherwise have been spent on holidays in Ireland. For example, a person may choose to holiday abroad because the range and type of their holiday may not be available in Ireland. If they were to holiday in Ireland they may spend less and decide to spend their money in a different fashion.</p>
            <p eId="para_5731">It should be noted that while figures are often cited in relation to expenditure by Irish persons on holidays abroad, this should not be viewed entirely as expenditure lost to the Irish economy and the Exchequer, as a proportion of this expenditure may be accruing to the Exchequer as it could be spent in Ireland or spent on Irish companies.</p>

            <p eId="para_5740">We are in the process of moving Ireland towards a Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) system, which is a more thorough way of ensuring that drivers gain the skills and experience needed to drive on our roads.  Last year, I introduced mandatory Essential Driver Training (EDT) for learner drivers as one important component of this system.</p>
            <p eId="para_5741">The proposal that people who do not have qualifications which we can recognise in this jurisdiction should be exempted from EDT would be a retrograde step in the light of the development of GDL.  The main purpose of requiring that compulsory lessons are taken is to ensure that drivers have sufficient knowledge and experience of Irish road driving conditions before taking a driving test. This applies equally to drivers from other jurisdictions where standards and practices may be different to Ireland. For example, many jurisdictions drive on the right rather than the left side of the road, and many have subtle differences in rules of the road.</p>
            <p eId="para_5742">While I appreciate that taking compulsory lessons may be unwelcome to people who have come here with good records of safe driving in other jurisdictions, I believe it will be of use to them, as well as beneficial to road safety in Ireland, in general, for them to go through the mandatory lessons.</p>

            <p eId="para_5765">I propose to take Questions Nos. 718 to 720, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5766">I am actively pursuing the rationalisation programme set out in the Public Service Reform Plan with the relevant agencies.  Developments so far in relation to agencies for which I have responsibility are that Dundalk Port Company merged with Dublin Port Company on 12 July 2011.  Tralee and Fenit Harbour Authority transferred to the control of Kerry County Council with effect from 1 October 2011.  Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour and Kinsale Harbour transferred to the control of Cork County Council, and Arklow Harbour transferred to the control of Wicklow County Council, with effect from 1 January 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_5767">I also recently announced that Dublin Tourism is being merged with its parent body — Failte Ireland — as part of the rationalisation programme. Furthermore, there is a review being undertaken with regard to the future tourism role of Shannon Development and its possible integration into Fáilte Ireland, while Coaching Ireland has been subsumed into the Irish Sports Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_5768">On the issue of possible further rationalisation, the Public Service Reform Plan requires that a number of other agencies are subject to critical review which will be completed by June of this year. In addition, a ports policy review is at an advanced stage and I hope to publish a revised policy document in the coming months. Port Company restructuring is one of the issues being considered as part of the policy review.  It is not possible to quantify the potential savings from rationalisation until full details of each implementation have been worked through with the agencies in question.</p>
