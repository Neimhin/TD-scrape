One parent families with children aged 12 will no longer be eligible for the one parent family payment.  These children are still in primary school and the Government will implement this change at 9 a.m. next Thursday, 3 May.</p>

          <p eId="para_8">There will be further cuts in eight months' time on 1 January for the parents of ten year olds.  These children are in fourth class.  The Government is saying to children, who are in sixth class today, that if their parents apply for the one parent family payment after next Thursday, 3 May which is the date in the legislation, they will not be eligible and that they are not to be at home to mind their children when they come home from primary school.  I ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, to take note of that.  This is a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">The Minister for Social Protection created a smoke screen over the past week that she would like the Scandinavia model in place for 2014 for seven year olds.  However, she did this to camouflage what is commencing next week in regard to under 12 year olds and under ten year olds.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">By reducing the age from 14 to seven, over the next few years, the Government will be reducing the number of people in receipt of this payment from 92,000 to 46,000 people and it will be saving €0.5 billion of taxpayers' money on the back of the one parent family payment.</p>

I am shocked that the Government has picked on people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.  It proposes to implement legislation today to give the banks and financial institutions a veto, which they never had before, in regard to people applying for mortgage interest supplement.  The Government is placing legal restrictions on those people and it is doing nothing to the banks.  Will the Tánaiste please explain why the Government is making these changes today?</p>

However, unlike this Government, his party made no provision for changes in the child care system to accompany that change.  The difference on this occasion is that the changes being made in respect of the one parent payment are being accompanied by changes to child care provision.  This year's Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2012 contains changes so that for new recipients from May 2012, the one parent family payment will be made until the youngest child reaches the age of 12.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">Many of those who raised concerns about the measures being introduced in the Bill are concerned about reducing the age to seven.  The Minister for Social Protection has already made it clear that she shares these concerns without their being a system of safe, affordable and accessible child care in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">The Departments of Social Protection and Children and Youth Affairs are already working to take a co-ordinated, cross-departmental approach to child care and after school care for the children of working parents.  Those Departments have already established a sub-committee of the interdepartmental group on the single working age payment to examine the delivery of after school care and to develop an appropriate framework for this.  The Department of Social Protection is providing data on the numbers of one parent family payment recipients by age of child to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs so that it can develop an information register on the number, type, cost and location of after school places available on a county basis.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is liaising with the county child care committees to examine after school care that is available and gaps in the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">The development of the national employment and entitlements service and the profiling of jobseekers, which is under way in the Department of Social Protection, will lead to a better identification and understanding of the supports needed by individual customers to help them to get back to work and the extent to which these are available and affordable.</p>

          <p eId="para_19">The Tánaiste made no reference to the changes the Government is making next week in regard to under 12 years olds and under ten year olds in eight months time.  It is reducing the age from 14 to ten within the next eight months and no accompanying measures will be in place.  The Minister for Social Protection created a very successful smoke-screen by throwing up the issue of seven year olds in 2014 so that people would be diverted and would not realise what was happening next week.  The Tánaiste did not address this point.  There will be no accompanying measure in respect of new applicants next week, by the 8 or by 1 January.</p>

I expect that the review will directly address the issue of growth and its necessity for the economy.  This Government has always made it clear that, in order to bring about recovery, we must get our budget situation under control, reduce the deficit and deal with the debt and considerable difficulties that we inherited from the previous Government.  We must get our economy to grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">This means two things.  We must bring investment into the country.  I am sure that the Deputy has read this morning's article by the IDA's chief executive in which he set out the progress the IDA has made in attracting additional jobs to the country in the past year.  As soon as I leave the Chamber today, I will join him and the Taoiseach in my constituency at a plant where 100 new jobs and 350 additional construction jobs will be announced.  This is evidence of the continuing attraction of jobs to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">In the chief executive's article, he made it clear that, in order for the attraction of jobs to continue, we need to pass the stability treaty, which Sinn Féin opposes.

This Government is focused on the measures required to grow and stimulate our domestic economy and to create the jobs that are necessary to bring about recovery.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">Under the influence of austerity the European economy plunged back into crisis this week.  The chorus of opposition to Angela Merkel's austerity treaty has increased, with unions and governments across Europe, including some of the Tánaiste's former comrades in the Irish trade union movement, have come out against the treaty on the basis that the austerity required would be disastrous.  The Government stands almost alone with Angela Merkel in continuing to promote this treaty as a good thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">In that context, the Taoiseach stated yesterday that the citizens of this country should have access to every piece of available information on the fiscal treaty prior to the referendum.  That commitment is hard to credit given that the Government has hidden the troika away from the press and Opposition precisely because it might make comments that will upset the citizens.  If the Taoiseach's commitment is a serious one, what will it cost the State to meet the treaty's targets for 2015 and beyond in regard to reducing the debt to 0.5% and the debt-to-GDP ratio to 60%?  I will be helpful in this regard.  The Central Bank quarterly bulletin for April indicates that our GDP is €162 billion.  Our debt-to-GDP ratio is due to reach 120% by 2014, which means a national debt of €200 billion.  Reducing that to 60% would require us to halve our national debt -----</p>

          <p eId="para_125">Deputy Boyd Barrett is correct that the country is substantially indebted and faces a large deficit.  Treaty or no treaty we will have to reduce that deficit because the only way we can at present bridge the gap between what we are taking in and what we are spending is by borrowing.  In order to borrow we have to find people who will lend to us.  Since the previous Government put us into the EU-IMF programme nobody in the private financial markets will lend to this country.  We have to get the money to pay wages and social welfare payments and keep the schools and hospitals open through the programme that has been agreed with the EU and the IMF.  Over time the new European Stability Mechanism will come into play.  We hope we will not need to access it but it is an important safety net or insurance policy.  For these reasons it is important that we pass the treaty to access the emergency funding.  If we do not have access to that kind of borrowing we will have to make huge cuts in pay, social welfare payments and the services we provide to our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">The Government's objective is to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio over time by growing the economy.  That is what happened in the 1990s.  Between 1991 and 2000 the country's debt to GDP ratio was reduced from 95% to 35% even though the actual size of the borrowings in monetary terms increased from £36 billion to £40 billion.  That was possible because the economy grew.  This is why the Government's strategy is, on the one hand, to ensure discipline in our budgets and prudent management of the public finances in order to reduce our deficit and, on the other, to grow the economy by attracting investment to create jobs and by pursuing a growth strategy.</p>

The Bill proposes the introduction of far-reaching changes, particularly for lone parents.  It is shameful and disappointing that the Government is opting to guillotine this debate.  We need more time to discuss it.  I am not under any illusion that the Government will be changed from this course of action.</p>

          <p eId="para_345">The point has been made in recent days but again, on this last day, before the guillotine falls, it is absolutely wrong for the Government to impose this guillotine on such important legislation.  Yesterday, we spent the best part of three hours debating one section of the Bill that deals with, in our opinion, the disgraceful cuts to lone parents.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">We needed that much time to discuss that section alone and probably could have done with more.  We still have an entire rake of sections to discuss that deal with important matters, such as the change in mortgage interest supplement that could cause real problems for mortgage holders in distress and the changes to jobseeker's benefit which will see part-time workers losing €20 or €30 a week.  These are very serious issues affecting groups in our society who are under serious pressure and no guillotine should be imposed by this Government.  We object very strongly to it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_494">These provisions are being introduced to allow the lone parents benefit system to change gradually so that, by 2015, only children up to seven years of age and their parents will qualify for this payment.  I had congratulated the Government on the gradual change to voluntary contributions and this should also be a more gradual change.  There is a substantial jump for those who qualify.  Year by year, it reduces from 14 years to 13 years to 12 years and then there is a sudden five-year jump to seven years of age in 2014.  While this is being introduced, the promise from the Minister is that we will see the delivery of child care support but this is not being presented as the Tánaiste suggested, coupled with this legislation.  If the two were coupled, we would produce a table such as that produced by the advisers, showing the transitional arrangement for how many additional after-school places and holiday places are made available between the ages of seven and 14 years.  While reducing the number who qualify on one hand, we would be increasing the number of places available in Irish society.  That is not there and it is for that reason I object to the additional amendments put by the Minister.  I object to the provisions in the Bill to change from a system which recognised a child as a child until the age of 14 for the purpose of qualifying for lone parent assistance and to drop this to seven years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The Labour Party opposed the Fianna Fáil change from 18 years to 14 years quite vociferously just two years ago and made proper arguments against it.  Those arguments still stand and are probably even more relevant given the financial crisis and the fact there has been no increased investment in child care in the country since the passage of that Fianna Fáil Bill.  At the age of 14 young people can travel home alone and look after themselves for a period, although they should not be left alone for long periods such as during holiday time, particularly over the long summer holidays.  These are the things that should be taken into account when trying to force lone parents into a jobseeker system.  The consequence of the proposed change is that these parents will move from the payment for lone parents to the jobseeker payment, which means they must actively seek work and be available for full-time work.  If that work presents, the parent will struggle to ensure proper arrangements are in place for the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">I do not see the logic behind the need to make the changes the Minister has introduced.  If these changes were not good enough for the Labour Party two years ago, why are they good enough today when we are in a worse situation?  The Minister made the point in her contributions on this and the previous section that the purpose of the Bill is to make lone parents more financially independent.  That is illogical.  The reason they are not financially independent is they do not have jobs, but they are not likely to get jobs in the current climate, particularly if they do not have additional supports such as child care.  Also, the changes the Minister introduced in December in budget 2012 substantially undermined many of the additional supports lone parents had in recognition of the difficult job they have in society and of the need to ensure a progression from social welfare to work or education.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">There is a perception that lone parents do not work, but that is not the reality.  The Department suggests that only 43% of lone parents are in work, whether full-time or part-time.  However, that figure should probably be closer to 60% taking into consideration those fully engaged in education to improve their qualifications so as to have greater access to the work market.  This proves that the majority of lone parents are actively working or seeking work and seek to change their circumstances in order to provide better for their children.  I do not have the figures to hand but I remember that when we were debating the 2010 change, a Government report at the time suggested that by the time the youngest child of a lone parent had reached the age of seven, the parent was no longer dependent on lone parent's allowance and had moved into employment and no longer qualified for it.  Therefore, there has never been a block on lone parents seeking or engaging in work, other than the blockages the Government and the state of the economy have put in their way, such as the lack of child care facilities, after school care and the lack of education.  Now too, due to Government policy, the additional supports that allowed people make that transition have been reduced.  The increasing lack of jobs is also a significant block to returning to work.  I have already mentioned that there are 50 people on the live register for every job vacancy, but in Germany, which is benefiting from Ireland's misery, that statistic is six to one.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">These amendments are logical based on section 4, to which I was opposed.  The Tánaiste said that this part of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill would be coupled with changes, but we have not seen any coupling.  I have looked through the legislative programme a number of times since he made that comment, but have seen no proposed legislation under the education or children and youth affairs umbrella that could be coupled with the proposed changes.  No such legislation is due in the summer session and none is listed in section B, the section which would normally be published by the end of the year.  The Minister said that she will not proceed with this before the end of the year, but there is no legislation promised in the legislative programme that can be coupled with it.  That programme was only presented to us on 17 April, just two weeks after the publication of this Bill and two or three days before she made the statement that she would ensure delivery of after school care.  There is nothing listed in section B under the Department of Education and Skills that is relevant to that and there is no relevant legislation promised under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Furthermore, there is no relevant promised legislation in the last section of the legislative programme.  There is only one Bill there listed under the Department of Education and Skills and it is unrelated to this.  The last section of the legislative programme includes the Bills that may be produced at some stage in the lifetime of the Government.  The promise made by the Minister is hollow because there is no legislative provision that will collapse this provision come budget 2013 until when the Minister says she will not allow this to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">Parts of this Bill will proceed over the next number of weeks and months.  Steps have already been taken for that and as of next week, any new applicant will be affected.  Therefore, how can the Minister change this in December and say she will not proceed?  She is proceeding with the changes from enactment date, 3 May.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">I am opposing these provisions.  If at all possible I ask the Minister to explain the reason it has not been more graduated as I have suggested, especially in the case of those already in receipt of this payment, as is the practice in any other major social welfare change.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_501">Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 are short technical amendments but I will concentrate on amendment No. 11 which is more substantive.  We have opposed section 4 of the Bill and these measures in section 5 are connected so I will be opposing section 5 which deals with practical transition arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Amendment No. 11 is three pages long I ask the Minister to explain the proposals in simple English, to give a bird's eye view.  The amendment proposes to amend the principal Act by inserting four new sections, titled 178B, 178C, 178D, 178E.  Section 178B deals with one-parent family payment transitional provision in certain circumstances where a child attains the age of 14.  I ask the Minister to give a simple explanation in two or three sentences of the meaning of the new section 178B.  Section 178C deals with one-parent family payment transitional provisions in certain circumstances where a child attains the relevant age.  Section 178D deals with a one-parent family payment continuation following certain disqualification.  Section 178E deals with one-parent family payments, miscellaneous provisions relating to claims made on certain dates.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">I ask the Minister to explain the separate sections rather than saying they all deal with transitional payment arrangements.  I think section 178B deals with people who were in the system prior to 27 April 2011 and the qualifying age for children is 18 years.  I think there is no change to this rule this year but next year, the age will be reduced to 17 years and to 16 years in 2014 and to children under seven years in 2015.  I ask the Minister to explain what this transitional arrangement means for those people who have been in the system prior to 27 April 2011 and when a child reaches the age of 14.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">Section 178C deals with cases which have come into the system in the past year and until 2 May 2012.  People are entitled to the one-parent family payment from 27 April 2011 to 2 May 2012, which is next week.  I ask the Minister to explain the meaning of this section.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">Section 178D deals with a different issue.  I ask the Minister to explain a point of detail.</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_514">Allowance,</p>
          <p eId="para_515">If people who are in receipt of a one-parent family payment move on to the back to education allowance, by definition they are disqualified from the one-parent family payment but they can return to that payment and some transitional arrangements allow them to return.  I understand they would have been entitled to the payment and they can return to the system without penalty.  My point of detail is on this section 178D (1)(i) which states, "having gross weekly earnings in excess of the amount specified in section 173(3),".  What is the level of gross weekly earnings in this case?  This is a significant difficulty.   A person may earn a certain amount while on the one-parent family payment and the ball park figure is approximately €160 a week.  There is a disregard and a tapering allowance.  The recent budget has cut this amount and this is another method which the Minister describes as being to increase the financial independence of the one-parent family payment recipient.  She cut the weekly amount to approximately €146 when the various disregards are included.  Where does the level of gross earnings referred to fit into this picture?</p>
          <p eId="para_516">I regard my constituency office in County Laois as being quite representative of constituency offices all over the country as it contains both urban and rural areas.  Over the years I have become aware of cases where a person's earnings may exceed the threshold.  When the P60 was submitted to the tax office and there was an exchange of information between the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue it was realised that the person in receipt of the one-parent family payment had exceeded the threshold for the payment and a refund was demanded.  I maintain that a person's income is liable to change in the course of a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">I make the point that even Members of the National Parliament are struggling - I know I am struggling - with the nitty gritty details of these issues.  Therefore, it is very unfair to penalise a person in receipt of a one-parent family payment who does not understand the rules when we here are even struggling to understand them.  In those situations, the recipient is often chased for a refund of the one-parent family payment and there may also be a taxation implication.  Part of the problem is that there is not a quick flow of information between the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners.  This was exemplified by what happened at the beginning of December last year when 155,000 letters were issued by the Revenue Commissioners to inform people that they may be liable to pay more income tax on their pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">There has not been a smooth exchange of information between the Department and the Revenue.  More has yet to happen with regard to other categories of payments as this recent event involved people in receipt of the State contributory and non-contributory pension.  In some situations the Revenue never knew about the pension and it did not result in a tax liability because even when one took the pension into account they were not liable to pay tax.  In other situations the Revenue was aware of the pension being received but was not aware of the current rate, especially when there had been a change in the payments and in some cases that led to a liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">We will not get into a discussion on the confusion caused to the 155,000 people, many of whom were upset over the Christmas period which is when the letters were sent out.  It will be said that it was a rushed job to get the tax certificates ready for the middle of December so that they could be processed in respect of people's various employments and to have them right for the January payroll, which would be issued in the first week of January but which in most companies were being processed before the Christmas period.  We will come back to the PPS number shortly, to which another amendment relates, and the linkage between Departments.  I seek flexibility on the gross weekly earnings in excess of the amount specified in section 173(3).  How much is the penalty or refund demanded if a person is a small amount over the limit?  How well will the situation be highlighted?  The Minister must have a figure in that regard and she must be able to give us an estimation based on current records as to how many people could possibly be affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">The next section with which the amendment deals is 178E.  I seek specific information and detail on one-parent family payments and miscellaneous provisions relating to claims made on certain dates.  I refer to cases where a person made a claim for the one-parent family payment before 27 April last year and the claim was not fully determined by that date.  These claims were within the system but were not determined by that date, and where the claimant would have been entitled to a payment but for the fact that the youngest child had reached the age of 14 years of age but as they were not in receipt of the payment by 27 April last year their entitlement could be affected under the changing rates for age groups.  I wish to know how many cases are involved that will be affected by section 178E.  The Minister must know because she included the provision.  How many people would have been entitled to the one-parent family payment on 27 April 2011, who had submitted their application but where the claim had not been fully determined by that date?  Some such cases must be in the system because that is how the system works.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I presume at this stage that no applications remain in the system and that they have all been cleared but I would like to know if some claims remain in the system 12 months on.  Some applicants may have been refused after 27 April 2011 and subsequently appealed their case to the appeals office.  Such a case could be still pending.  The appeals office might decide next month or the following month.  We all know cases can take up to a year in the appeals office, not to mind how long it took to deal with the case.  Cases involving valid applications might still be pending from more than a year ago involving refusals in the Department or in the appeals office that could yet be determined in favour of the applicant.  How will such cases fit into the scheme?  The Minister must have an idea of the numbers involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">I am not happy with sections 4 and 5 but given that section 4 has been voted through I presume section 5 will be voted through.  I am pleased the Minister is examining the cases of those caught out on the dates as the date on which one enters the system has a big impact on the transitional arrangements.  This arises because if the people were in the system between 27 April 2011 and 2 May 2012, the 14 year age group would come into play and then the payment would affect children aged over 12 years of age next year, ten years the following year and seven years in the following year.  Is there provision in the legislation for cases that were submitted before 27 April 2011 to make sure that they will be eligible under the old regime?  How many cases are involved?  It is a bit convoluted.  I accept we got a general note explaining the transitional arrangement but will the Minister differentiate between sections 178B, 178C, 178D and 178E and answer the specific questions on the gross weekly earnings excess and also the number of people who had applied before 27 April 2011 and had not been determined by that date?</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_523">This section essentially deals with the phasing in of the abolition of one-parent family payments for lone parents when their children reach the age of seven.  The Minister has suggested that the cut in payments to lone parents when their children reach the age of seven is designed to help them become financially independent, that is, to encourage them to get back to work.  The truth is that these are complex transition arrangements designed to minimise the outrage that is likely to be felt, and is being felt, by lone parents as it becomes apparent that the Government is targeting them for a nasty regressive cut that is going to have precisely the opposite effect to the one that the Government claims it wants to achieve, namely, it is going to drive lone parents out of work.  Lone parents and organisations representing them who have examined the measures are clear that this would be the effect of the changes, namely, to drive lone parents out of work, exactly the opposite of what the Government has said it wants to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">These sections are designed as the intricate machinery that is required to try to minimise the level of popular anger and protest over what the Government is trying to do.  There would be uproar if the Government reduced the eligibility for all lone parents with immediate effect when their children reach the age of seven.  The protests we have seen to date would be multiplied by ten or probably a hundred in terms of their size.  This measure is designed in a deceptive fashion to phase in the change gradually so that the real impact will be felt a little further down the line and for new applicants for the lone-parents payment.  The choreography of the nasty cut masquerading as something progressive cannot hide the simple fact about the legislation, namely, that it is difficult for lone parents to get jobs or to access education because they are lone parents and they need child care.  It is as simple as that.  Whether lone parents are trying to get jobs or access education and to upskill in order to access the jobs market, they need child care.  Lone parents need child care whether their child is aged one to seven or beyond that from seven to at least 14 years.  They need support in order to be able to access education and jobs and this measure takes that support away from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The Minister's suggestion that new applicants will be able to apply for jobseeker's allowance poses a real question which she should answer directly.  If someone is to be entitled to jobseeker's allowance, do they not have to be available for work?  Is that not the simple criteria; that one will be interrogated by the local social welfare office about whether one is available for work.  If one does not have the means to provide child care for one's children, one is not available for work and it is as simple as that.  One would have to lie to the social welfare office to suggest one was available for work and, therefore, one would not be entitled to jobseeker's allowance as currently constituted.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Lone parent payments were not so great in the first place but they gave a little bit of a leg up to lone parents to be able to cover the cost of child care.  It is completely inadequate given the very high cost of child care in the State, its lack of availability and the extreme difficulty of getting one of the very few jobs now available.  It is to the immense credit of lone parents that approximately 60% of them are in employment at present given the lack of support and the lack of affordable child care available to them.  They have made a supreme effort.  The lone parent payments have been of some assistance, although entirely inadequate, in allowing lone parents to access jobs.  This support, which has assisted to some degree in getting lone parents back into the workforce and education, is to be removed once their children reach the age of seven.  This is the simple fact and there is nothing else before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">We have received an off-the-cuff remark and verbal commitments to putting in place child care facilities and other supports which would mitigate against the impact of this nasty regressive cut.  However, as Deputy Ó Snodaigh stated, nothing concrete is on the legislative programme and nobody believes it is credible that these supports will be in place.  I presume the Government simply hopes the hullabaloo and anger will have died down by the end of the year, that people will just have to resign themselves to this nasty cut and its consequences and that they will forget about the Government's commitments to a Scandinavian model of child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The engineering of the phasing in period is amazingly intricate.  Trying to work it all out and figure out at what point people's entitlements begin to be reduced indicates it took much thought and work, and fair play to the officials for working it all out.  However, they are operating under a political direction from the Minister and the Government.  Where is the intricate engineering when it comes to putting alongside it and running parallel to it child care supports and facilities and other arrangements to compensate for the cut in lone parents' payments once children reach the age of seven or the various ages in the phasing in period?  This is the simple reality of the Bill and the section.  It contains complex engineering to cut the entitlement of lone parents to the vital support they need if they are to access employment and education driving out of work people who want to work and contribute to society.  It is unbelievably regressive.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">When Fianna Fáil reduced the age from 18 to 14, the now Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, stated reducing it to the age of 13 would drive 12,000 more people onto the live register and out of work.  Why does this logic not still apply?  Is this another treacherous U-turn by the Labour Party turning on the very people who probably voted for it looking for protection?  It has turned on them, driving lone parents, mostly young women who are struggling as it is, out of the workforce and back into dependency on social welfare and the poverty that goes with it.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_256" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_530">This morning, I had the honour of launching a very important document by the ESRI about families in poverty and children being at risk of poverty in Ireland.  It shows what a number of Deputies have referenced, which is that children most at risk of poverty are those in lone parent families.  It is not me who is stating this, but a group of researchers and professors of the ESRI, including Dorothy Watson, Bertrand Maître and Chris Whelan.  The very detailed study of work and living conditions in Ireland contains a huge amount of statistics in its ten chapters.  I know it is very difficult for Deputies opposite to accept, but the report shows comprehensively that, aside from the, thankfully, very small but very worrying number of children subject to neglect because their parents may have substance abuse problems or violence issues in the family, those at the highest risk of poverty are the children of lone parents.  The highest risk lone parent is one who has left education and stayed exclusively as a lone parent over a long period of time.  This may be difficult for some of the Deputies opposite to accept but I invite them to examine the report.  If they reflect on this and perhaps go to their constituencies and examine the situation, I think they will find what is shown in the report is correct. The way to reduce this high risk of poverty for the children is to get lone parents to return to education or training as soon as possible and ultimately to enter financially independent work.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">The report deals with what we discussed yesterday with regard to the tens of thousands of people in Ireland parenting on their own, but shows they do not fit Deputy Boyd Barrett's idea of loan parents.  They are people whom the country, their families and themselves assisted to keep up their education, qualify, train and ultimately have a financially independent job.  I listened to Deputy Boyd Barrett argue profoundly that the current payments to lone parents are not enough.  The country is spending more than €1 billion on these payments.  I do not know whether he has any consciousness at all about low-paid people in employment who pay taxes and PRSI.  We know he is in favour of tax and PRSI because he said so yesterday.  Unlike Scandinavia, he is not in favour of a range of taxes or any taxes to do with anything other than work.  However, he seems to have no consciousness that people at work, particularly low-paid people at work, contribute through taxation.  He seems to have a view that somehow or other everyone in Ireland can receive social welfare but nobody is meant to contribute apart from the few theoretical people who will pay for everything.  Countries that are doing well but are not perfect and have good social welfare systems and good outcomes for children do not put lone parents into a separate category for long periods of their working life.  Rather they provide them with pathways to continue their education, if disrupted by their having had a child or children on their own.  They are encouraged to take part in training and get back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">The Deputy does not seem to understand that while social welfare is a support it is a hand-up rather than a hand-out.  It is important that our pensioners have a decent income to live on when they retire and that people who lose their jobs are given income support.  We are in a difficult place in economic terms.  If Leon Trotsky were to return to earth tomorrow morning he would not be able to reincarnate the broken Irish banking system or property bubble.  It would take him time to work it out.  If we are to ensure that pensioners and everyone else who contributes to social welfare gets a decent level of support when they require it then we must as a country ensure that all our people of working age, regardless of their relationship status, are encouraged, empowered and enabled to work from the time they finish their education until their retirement.  Otherwise, we will not have enough people in work to support the type of social welfare system that as a country we are correct to aspire to.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Let us look again at the relevant age in other countries, many of which I am sure the Deputy has visited.  It appeared from his contribution yesterday that he has great knowledge of the United States.  Why do Germany, Italy, Sweden and Norway end exclusive categorisation of a person as a lone parent when the youngest child reaches the age of three? Each of those countries has in place good quality systems which we would admire.</p>

          <p eId="para_535">The relevant age in Finland is four years.  In the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand - members will be aware that many Irish people go to visit or live in Australia and New Zealand, some for a year or two - the relevant age is 5 years.  In Canada, the relevant age is six years and in the UK and 90 miles north of here, it is seven years.  Is the Deputy suggesting that in changing the arrangements to provide a greater pathway for lone parents to return to education, training or work and become financially independent we are not helping lone parents?  We are spending almost exactly the same amount of money, more than €1 billion.  We have a social welfare system that is often described internationally as passive owing to the fact that when people take up a specific social welfare payment they are forgotten about rather than assisted in getting employment, thus becoming financially independent.  We must offer assistance to people whose education was interrupted owing to their having had a child or children on their own.  I do not understand the reason the Deputy fears lone parents becoming empowered, enabled and encouraged to get back into education or training and ultimately, to financial independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">All of the international and national experts in Ireland who attended this morning's conference on poverty in regard to children made the same point.  Perhaps everyone in the world, except Deputy Boyd Barrett, is wrong.  Unfortunately, some lone parents interrupted or ended their education at a relatively young age.  I make no apology for providing them with a pathway to resume their education and training, leading them back to work, which I did in 1996, when a Minister of State.  That was possibly one of the greatest changes in respect of lone parents in Ireland.  It has been successful but not for everybody because not enough lone parents have availed or been able to avail of education and training and because well-meaning people wanted to give them financial support and nothing else.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">There are companies in Ireland wishing to recruit Irish people but we do not have enough people with the required skills to take up those jobs.  PayPal announced 1,000 new jobs at its offices in Dundalk.  Not all of those jobs will be taken up by people on the live register in Ireland because we do not have enough people trained and educated in the skills required for those jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">I invite Deputies to think about what would change the system to give lone parents better opportunities.  I have never heard Sinn Féin Members say that the relevant age of 7 years in the North of Ireland is wrong or that it is wrong that the relevant age in Canada is six years, in the Netherlands five years and in Finland four years.  The reason for those age limits is because those countries see families as families, parents as parents and children as children and believe that parents should be provided with education, training and work and that all children should be in families that ultimately have work.  We must have an active society in which everyone is included and is a participant.  We have a much more passive system here.  All international visitors, from the universities and so on, say that the Irish social welfare system is passive.  I acknowledge that is difficult for some people to understand.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Deputy Fleming asked why the complexity in terms of the timescale.  Having been a member of the previous Government for 14 years, the Deputy will be aware that during the boom - I acknowledge this was well meant - a great deal of additional money was paid out without enough detailed work on services being provided in a whole range of areas.  When one looks at a series of areas in social welfare, one finds in many cases that the issue of services is as important as the cash income.  The service might even be more necessary than the cash.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">A number of Deputies have asked how this country can create preschool and after-school services.  In fairness to the previous Government, it adopted the early childhood initiative as an alternative to a direct cash payment.  I congratulated the Government on its approach at the time.  As a consequence of the initiative, most children of preschool age now receive at least one year of preschooling.  People doubt that this country can develop preschool and after-school care services.  I think the development of those services will be demanding.  I remind Deputies that in the 1960s, the children of working class people did not sit the leaving certificate.  They were lucky if they completed the equivalent of the junior certificate at the time.  In the 1950s, most people finished their education at primary school level.  My parents, like most people's parents, did not go beyond primary school.  In the 1960s, we decided as a country that we could and should offer people secondary education up to leaving certificate level.  That opened many doors and broadened many horizons for a generation of people in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">In the 1970s, the OECD asked this country to establish regional technical education throughout the country, along the lines of what was offered in Dublin at the time.  When this country was planning to join the organisation that later became the European Union, there was a suggestion that we would not be allowed to do so if we did not improve our educational standards.  As a consequence, educational institutions in towns and cities like Galway, Sligo, Athlone, Letterkenny, Cork, Waterford and Carlow allowed people to access education.  I refer to people in this country who would not have been able to access it otherwise.  Along with my Labour Party colleagues, I was part of the Government that decided in the 1990s it was right that the child of somebody who worked for Dublin Bus should be able to access university-standard third level education.  Before that decision was made, the only people who could usually afford to do so were from places like Killiney on the south side of Dublin.  As a result of what the Government did in the mid-1990s, a person from the north side or the city centre - like me - could pass Trinity College on the bus and say "one day I will go there".  People were able to do just that.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The Deputies opposite are asking me to believe that a country which has achieved great things cannot develop better preschool and after-school services.  I do not know what they think of their own country.  Clearly, they do not think much of its capacity to do anything.  Ireland is perfectly capable of doing this.  It will take time to plan it.  A great deal of work will be required.  I hope that the next time we talk about lone parents at a conference, they will not stand out for the poverty risks of their children.  I hope it will not be the case that so many children of lone parents have not been able to complete or further their education to the extent required by people who want to get good jobs in a modern knowledge-based society.  The difficult economic recession in this country was caused by the collapse of the banking sector, the mismanagement of the economy and the bursting of the building bubble, etc.  I predicted that much of what has happened would happen.  When the Finnish banks crashed in the 1980s, the Government of that country decided to invest in preschool and after-school education, in education in general and in innovation.  As a result, Finland is now recognised for its achievement of a better and more equal society and better outcomes for children.  Others might not believe in this country's progress, but I do.  Our current social welfare expenditure could be better used to give people more opportunities.  That is what this is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">Deputies on the other side of the House have expressed their objections to transitional changes.  Deputy Sean Fleming asked why this process must be so complicated.  I remind him that I inherited it.  We hope to make it less complex.  I agree with the Deputy that many of the small changes that were made when large sums of money was spent during the Celtic tiger era require a great deal of understanding.  Of course the transitional arrangements will apply to people who are currently making appeals.  That is the standard way it happens in the Department of Social Protection.  In the case of a person who applied for a particular payment, his or her application will obviously go back to when it was initially made after his or her appeal has been heard.  There are many transitional arrangements in this regard.  People who go back into the back to education allowance, for instance, will be allowed to come back in.  I think the transitional arrangements are good.  Deputies need to reflect on the fact that much lower ages are provided for in those countries which are often cited.  That does not mean the countries in question do not support lone parents or their children.  It means that lone parents and their children receive the same range of entitlements and benefits as all other parents and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Incidentally, it will have been noted by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, that this approach also allows for the possibility of a greater role for the father of the child.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh mentioned that yesterday.  I expect that everybody would welcome that.  Every child has two parents, even if one of them is parenting on his or her own.  Very frequently, the other parent wishes to be actively involved in the life of his or her child.  Our system should encourage that.  There has been a certain amount of fear-mongering - perhaps inadvertently - on the part of some Deputies in this respect.  We are spending over €20 billion on our system of social protection this year, in the teeth of a very difficult recession.  Such a large figure indicates that this country attaches a value to all levels of social provision.  If we are to retain such a level of payment, we have to make sure that as many people as possible are helped to get back to work.  That is important in the interests of their own financial independence and the future of their children.  It will help to sustain the strong model of support for social protection that we have in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">As I said yesterday, it is important to reflect on certain figures in relation to lone parents.  The average duration of a one-parent family payment is 6.1 years.  During this discussion, people tend to talk about lone parents as people who parent on their own and are in receipt of State social welfare benefits.  Some 92,000 people are in that category.  Tens of thousands of other people who are parenting on their own do not receive particular State payments beyond ordinary child benefit or family income supplement.  I have mentioned that the average duration of a one-parent family payment is 6.1 years.  I mentioned last night that 10% of those receiving the payment have been doing so for one year or less.  It is a transitional support for them while they re-establish themselves.  Approximately 13% of those receiving the payment have been doing so for between one and two years and 28% have been doing so for between two and five years.  This morning's study showed that where this payment is used transitionally - where parents move back into education and ultimately into work - that is the best way of ensuring a lone parent can have an independent financial future.  The statistics bear that out.  Some 12% of those who receive this payment have been doing so for between five and seven years and 37% have been doing so for seven years or more.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">The average durations for different age groups are three years for claimants aged 25 or younger, seven years for claimants aged between 25 and 39, seven years for those aged between 40 and 49, and eight years for those who are 50 or older.  Having introduced the reforms in the 1990s, I realise most of those who are 25 or younger return to education nowadays.  Those who are over 50 were probably in the earlier system.  Younger people are much more likely to go back to education and, ultimately, work, and their parents are much more interested in supporting them.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">The two counties with the largest concentrations of lone parents are my county, Dublin, and Cork.  Next are Limerick, Donegal, Galway, Wexford, Kildare and Louth.  Some 82% of lone-parent allowance recipients are Irish.  Some 18% of payments are made to non-Irish nationals.  This is a very complex picture.  It is important that Deputies have an opportunity to examine the data and perhaps today's report and ask themselves honestly why all the international and Irish evidence suggests that encouraging lone parents to return to education and work, with appropriate child care, including preschool and after-school child care, produces the best outcome for the children.  A system that develops in that way will be strongly supportive.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">This Government chose to dedicate a Ministry to children, a Ministry for all children, because it recognises it is crucial to give the best possible future to all children, regardless of the relationship status of their parents.  I hope the Deputies accept that all the evidence supports what the Government is doing extremely strongly.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Change is always difficult.  If, in a perfect world, we had more money, I would invest it in education and educational services.  Education, particularly for children, presents the greatest opportunity.  I am disappointed that the Members opposite seem to believe this country, which has built secondary, technical and third level education systems, is not capable of building a system of preschool and after-school care.  I find this distinctly odd.  I hope the Deputies have more ambition for and faith in our country and its people.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">All the countries referenced are countries in respect of whose child care systems I have heard Members in the Opposition benches express admiration, bearing in mind that the countries' systems are not perfect.  Why have these countries and most OECD countries decided to prioritise giving people the capacity to have financial independence and employment?</p>
          <p eId="para_551">In Africa, where I worked and lived for a number of years, the key objective in development was to give women the capacity to earn their own incomes and build their own businesses.  It is a question of their becoming independent rather than dependent.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">On the complexities of the current lone parent allowance system, Deputy Fleming will have to question his colleagues because they were in charge of it for the past 14 years.  The system is complex but there are transitional arrangements.  I assure lone parents that the changes, as set out, will take considerable time to come into effect.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_554">I will be relevant because the Minister has managed to raise a number of interesting points in response to our contributions.  I have tried to be constructive in this debate.  I said from the outset that I do not have a problem with seven being the age of eligibility if the relevant supports are in place.  It is not right to misquote us and say we are opposed to the measure; it is absolute claptrap.  The Minister needs to listen.  She referred to the conference on the ESRI report, which I have not seen, but I know the position from my constituency, which is one of the most disadvantaged in the country and which has a considerable number of lone parents, some of whom are dependent on lone parent family payments and others of whom are in work or are lucky enough to receive family supports or others supports, in the form of maintenance payments, from the father of the children.  I acknowledge this and deal with it on an ongoing basis.  The problems have been created not only by the current Government but also by the previous Government because of a lack of investment in education.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">The Minister needs to listen to what is being said.  The required services are not in place, as she acknowledged.  However, we have not heard from the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, or the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, this week.  It would have been great if a committee had been in a position to invite them or their officials to appear before it to outline the plan for the additional supports that are not, but should be, in place.  Such supports are evident in Canada and the Six Counties, and Scandinavia in particular.  The Scandinavian model is the one we aspire to.  Where is the promise of investment?</p>
          <p eId="para_556">The Minister met representatives of the troika.  We are stuck in here today so I do not know what progress has been made today but I know the troika has not been approached by the Government to invest a number of billions of euro in the education system.  The Minister stated she would invest the money if she had it.  She had it but gave it away to Anglo Irish Bank and will continually do so.  She has a choice to invest in education, after-school services and child care facilities.  If she made this choice, we could follow the model Finland set out for us.  She could couple this with implementing the changes over a transitionary period.  What I propose is not happening and the Minister does not have a plan.  What the Minister proposes, therefore, should not proceed, to use her own words.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">I agree with the Minister that one way to break the cycle of poverty is education.  Many Governments have invested in education but the current Government confirmed, only a number of weeks ago in this House, cuts to DEIS programmes and schools dealing with disadvantage.  It backed down on some of the cuts but others are going ahead.  There are schools that are now in dire straits because of cuts being imposed by the Minister.  She can blame Fianna Fáil or whoever else she wants but the decision lies with the current Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">There are cuts to community employment programmes, which were among the vehicles being used by single parents, in particular, to educate themselves and obtain further training and qualifications.  These programmes are all being affected.  It will now be a lot more difficult for lone parents to gain access to community employment given the additional costs the Minister has imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">If the Minister does not remember the cuts, she will find them listed in OPEN's document "7 is TOO YOUNG".  The affected benefits include rent supplement and child benefit.  Not all applied exclusively to one parent families but some were directed exclusively at them and they will suffer the consequences, especially in regard to community employment.  Those cuts will push them away from one of the pathways to work.  They might not have been working ideally but cutting the training and materials grant is not the way to ensure community employment schemes work.  I know the Minister will say the progression rates from community employment schemes to work were terrible.  Those figures are based on those participating in community employment schemes at the height of the boom when work was available to the vast majority of people.  Many of those on community employment schemes found it more difficult to access the jobs market and were struggling to get qualifications.  Those progression rates were not based on today's figures.  Even today, the progression rates would not be great because there are no jobs.  Time and again we come back to that key point.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">It is all very well to change the age from 14 to seven but all one is doing is moving people from the lone parent payment to jobseeker's allowance.  One is not moving them into education because the education supports are not in place and are not likely to be because, according to itself, this Government does not have the money even though it is spending it in a different way.  That is where the money should be spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The Minister accused us of scare-mongering but I have shied away from scare-mongering.  She announced these changes and proved to lone parents that she will make substantial changes to the way they are trying to survive in society.  There is no denying the progress over the years in terms of education.  The reason Ireland is regarded as a developed country is specifically because of those changes.  I am a firm believer that if we educate our children, we will have a better economy in the future but we must create the jobs to keep them here and must not export them abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">I welcomed the commitment from the Minister last week that this will not proceed without the changes which are not only sought by me, but by those engaging with the Department, through their lobby groups, and with the people directly affected.  OPEN set out some of the supports which should be in place and it is probably more capable of doing so than I am.  It said after school care provision which is affordable, of consistently high quality and widely available should be in place, but that does not exist.  It said a programme and the resources to accompany it which provides proper career guidance to lone parents should be in place, but that does not exist.  It said training and education which leads to a career that moves a lone parent out of poverty and into work should be in place.  Some training and education is available.  The pathways to work and NEES programmes, when fully rolled out, will, hopefully, address that.  I acknowledge progress can be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">OPEN quoted the submission made by the Department to the comprehensive review on expenditure.  It stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_564">DSP is of the view that significant structural reform of the schemes and services operated by DSP is urgently required in order to better utilise scarce resources and, most importantly, produce better outcomes. [Nobody denies that.]  The provision of targeted income support, training, development and employment services as appropriate, based on individual needs and circumstances, is the priority with the twin aims of reducing the risk of poverty and maximising employability. [That is not a problem.]</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_565">Accordingly, it is necessary to reform the schemes and services so as to ensure an adequate and sustainable system in the years ahead while ensuring that they are compatible with realising the potential of all.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">We have no problem at all with that.  The problem is that when the new service, NEES, was being set up, it was clear that lone parents would not be its priority.  The Department stated that once activation NEES programmes were rolled out to cater for people on the live register, it would then cater for lone parents - the after thought - and people claiming illness and disability payments.  One of the way to ensure lone parents will be dealt with is if they are no longer lone parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">A point I made earlier, which the Minister confirmed, was that the vast majority of lone parents are no longer in receipt of the lone parent payment once a child has reached seven years of age because she said the age is 6.1 years.  That proves there is progression if the jobs are available.</p>

          <p eId="para_578">The point I am making is that those provisions are in place in those countries, or are being put in place.  They are not being put in place here.  There have been cutbacks in investment in education and an increase in the number of unemployed in recent years.  Unless the Minister comes into the House with a plan to address that, I must reject these amendments because they are not backed up by what she and the Tánaiste said will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">It is correct to encourage people to get back into education and into the workforce but only if it is not to the detriment of their children.  The Minister said the children are important.  If they are so important, she should come back to the House in one months' time, six months' time or in a year's time, having withdrawn these amendments, with a plan so we can say we are moving in the right direction.  It is no good giving a verbal commitment in the House.  A financial commitment is required.  If the Minister goes to the troika to say we will invest an additional €1 billion over the next two or three years or whatever in after school services, education and access to third level education for people in receipt of one parent family payment and in jobs which they can access, then I will look at this in a different light.</p>

I have a broader issue to discuss, but I asked a specific question on section 178D and the gross weekly earnings in excess of the amount specified in section 173(3).  What income level are we discussing?  Section 178D on page 5 of the list of amendments deals with the continuation of one-parent family payments following certain disqualifications.  If someone is disqualified - it is a funny word, but it is the technical one being used - from receiving the one-parent family payment because he or she is on the back-to-education allowance scheme, I presume he or she can swap back to that payment again.  Every Deputy agrees this is fine, but reference is made to a second group of people who may be able to resume the payment after being disqualified on the basis of having gross weekly earnings in excess of the amount specified in section 173(3) of the principal Act.  What is the income level involved and is there any flexibility in that regard?  The legislation specifically refers to a figure for gross weekly earnings, but what is the figure?</p>

I will try to answer the question myself now that the Minister has provided the figure.  A person with an income of up to approximately €140 will retain the full amount of the one-parent family payment, but if one earns more than €140, the one-parent family payment starts to taper off and is fully removed once a person's income from employment reaches €425.

          <p eId="para_618">I will address the section on transition years in respect of the one-parent family payment.  During the Minister's last intervention she made many points.  The single most shameful matter with which Ireland has never dealt is the lack of a child orientation, particularly in terms of young children's education, after school and preschool services and supports.  In the 1990s, the Labour Party played a role in developing the circumstances to improve access to third level colleges.  Money should also have been invested in early child education.  Had working class children been provided with that education, they would have been able to go on to third level education.  Although this formed part of the Labour Party's programme at the time, it was not done.  In the 15 years since the Labour Party was last in power, Fianna Fáil did not do much either.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">I know couples where one parent left work because child care for three kids cost too much, sometimes as much as a full wage.  That was during the boom, but we are now in a recession and up to 450,000 people are unemployed, many for the first time in their lives.  For this reason, the social welfare bill is €20 billion.  People are not on the dole or in receipt of jobseeker's benefit because they want to be or because it is a lifestyle choice.  They are in a terrible position, in that they have found themselves out of work and must ask for mortgage interest supplement, rent supplement and other supports to get them through this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">The countries to which the Minister referred provide good supports for child care and they also have jobs.  The Netherlands nearly fell apart over the weekend because of the austerity measures that were being proposed.  Dutch people were not prepared to accept cuts to child benefits and support systems and there was division in the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">The Minister should not touch the transition years until the necessary supports are in place.  If the Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills are preparing these supports, what models are being considered and how will preschool and after-school care be put in place in 18 months?  How will they determine the number of children needing child care, investigate training requirements and ensure child care is affordable and accessible?</p>
          <p eId="para_622">This is a big issue.  When I was in the CWU a proposal was made to provide child care facilities in O'Connell Street which would be funded by all the companies in the area.  Employees from the GPO and the shops in the area could bring their children to a community crèche or child care space on the street.  These suggestions have been under discussion for a long time by members of the Labour Party and others but we are still in the shameful position of not providing facilities anywhere.  Child care is generally provided through small for-profit facilities but while some of these are very well run they are not accessible to people on low incomes, whether they are lone parenting, on the dole or in low-paid jobs.  If these people are to return to work where are the jobs and what sort of training will be provided?  Money should be funnelled into education and affordable child minding services, where it is badly needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">It is disingenuous of the Minister to raise these issues.  The women who face a predicament because of what she is proposing are telling me that seven years is too young.  The transition measure should not be implemented until we put in place the child supports people in this society need.  If a strategy is being devised, what is it, where will it lead and when will be in place?  If the Minister can give us that information people will be more willing to accept her argument.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_306">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_624">The Minister deserves a medal for the smokescreen she has created in order to present this regressive legislation as something positive for lone parents.  She waxed lyrical about a preposterous vision for a wonderful child care and education system which would make lone parent payments unnecessary.  Let us clear the decks of the red herrings.  All of us would like the level of public services available in the countries to which the Minister referred.  The difference is that Finland, Germany and Sweden have state-of-the-art education systems and child care supports that are affordable or, in some cases, free.  If this or any other Government succeeds in putting such systems in place, I will be the first to applaud.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">However, we have to start from where lone parents are at present.  How will lone parents be impacted by the changes introduced in this Bill?  They will gradually come into force over the next several years until we reach a point where lone parents will not receive payments once their children reach the age of seven.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">It would be useful to rehearse the concerns raised by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Shortall, with the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Cuív, in June 2010 in regard to proposals to reduce the age limit for eligibility to lone parent payments to 13.  This is relevant because after next week new applicants with children aged 12 or 13 years will not be entitled to lone parent payments.  She stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_627">For those who manage to find work, the main problem will undoubtedly be who will mind their children when they are at work.  Most will not be able to afford to pay someone else to do it.  What is a lone parent to do during their summer months when his or her child is off school?  Teenagers are off school for three months in the summer.  Is it now Government policy for 13 year olds to have no parental supervision and to be left to their own devices during the three months of their summer holidays?  I would like the Minister to address that point in responding to the debate tomorrow.</p>

          <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
          <p eId="para_630">They are very specific.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_310">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_631">They pertain to the transition from the current age limit of 14 years to seven years.  There will be an immediate impact on new applicants who have children aged 12 or 13 years and from next year the measure will affect new applicants with children aged ten years or older.  This change will directly affect lone parents' ability to access employment and education.  While the Minister is trying to justify it as a labour activation measure designed to assist lone parents, it will in fact have the opposite effect, as her colleague pointed out when similar moves were made by the previous Government.  Therefore, the quote is relevant to these specific amendments.  Speaking when in opposition, the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, continued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_632">Just because a child is 13 does not mean he or she can look after himself or herself.  Has the Government even considered the social consequences of this?  There are huge implications for anti-social behaviour, drug abuse and, ironically, teenage pregnancy.  Has the Minister really thought this through?  It seems from his comments to date that very little thought has been given to the likely fall-out of his proposed changes ... it costs substantially more to raise a teenager than it does to raise a younger child.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_633">The withdrawal of one parent family payment will in many cases create an additional barrier to school completion and to third level education.  If the teenage children of lone parents realise that their parents are in far more strained financial circumstances under the Minister's new arrangements than they currently are, it will inevitably have a knock-on impact in terms of the ability of teenagers in poor lone parent families to remain in school.  The pressure will undoubtedly grow on them to leave school early and try to find work.  The pressures working against the possibility of them participating in third level education will be even greater.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_634">Will the operational guidelines for the jobseekers allowance be amended to reflect that for some parents the cost of after school care will represent a poverty trap?</p>
          <p eId="para_635">I could not put it better than that.  I do not understand how the Labour Party could argue all of this in 2010 and now argue for precisely the opposite.  The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, believed at the time it would drive lone parents out of work and would act as a disincentive for them and their children to access education and employment.  The Minister is trying to convince us that the same measures will actually assist people into education and employment.  It does not add up.  Therefore, one can only conclude it is a smokescreen.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">The other big difference between our country and the other countries the Minister mentioned is that they do not have the same unemployment crisis we have.  Where are these jobs?  To put it simply, as of next week a new applicant for one-parent family payment with a child of 12 or 13 years of age will not be eligible and will be refused.  What is such a person to do?  Earlier I asked the Minister a question that she did not answer.  I believe she said yesterday that such a person should apply for jobseeker's allowance.  However, a person, who is minding his or her children and, therefore, not available for work would not be entitled to jobseeker's allowance.  How can somebody, who is not available for work, be entitled to jobseeker's allowance without lying and claiming he or she is available when he or she is not?  That will be true for new applicants from January 2013 if their children are aged ten or older.  It continues until the age limit of seven is reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">As of next week lone parents with children aged 12 or 13 will be disadvantaged.  The Minister cannot tell me that by next week this beautiful vision of child care support and education support, to which we would all subscribe, will be in place.  That is preposterous.  I ask the Minister to tell the truth.  It has nothing to do with Leon Trotsky or jibes about Killiney and the north side and all the rest of it.  That is demeaning.</p>

It is appalling that the Minister would be involved in justifying any of that because I do not believe she herself believes any of those stereotypes and yet this legislation can only be motivated by that because that is the effect it will have.  It will attack those very sectors of society which two years ago the Minister and her party colleagues were championing and defending against precisely this sort of legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_683">Legislative changes were introduced in the one-parent family arrangements in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010.  These came into effect on 27 April 2011 and reduced the maximum age limit of the youngest child for the receipt of the one-parent family to 14 years.  Transitional arrangements were put in place for existing one-parent family customers at the time with the age limit not coming into effect until 2016 as per the table Deputies were given in the handout.  Customers were informed of these arrangements at the time.  These transitional arrangements will now continue until January 2015 at which point the age limit of the youngest child for receipt of one-parent family payment will reduce to seven years of age.  These further reductions will be considered in the context of the further development of relevant activation and support services.  Where existing one-parent family payment recipients have a child aged over 17 who is in full-time education, payment will continue to the end of the 2012-13 academic year.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Section 178C applies to existing customers in receipt of one-parent family payment from 27 April 2011 to 2 May 2012.  This customer group currently has an age cut-off of 14.  This will remain the case in 2012, and there will therefore be no change.  The age limit will then reduce on a phased basis to age seven in 2015.  These reductions will be considered in the context of further development of relevant activation and support services.  From 3 May 2012, new one-parent family payment customers will be subject to the new age qualification criteria for the youngest child.  That is, the payment will not be payable where the youngest child is aged 12 or over in 2012, aged ten or over in January 2012 and aged seven or over in January 2014.  These reductions will be considered in the context of the further development of relevant activation and support services.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">Section 178D deals with the continuation of one-parent family payment following certain disqualifications.  It is not desirable that current one-parent family payment customers decline to take education or training opportunities or opportunities to increase employment during the transitional phase.  For this reason, recipients who leave the scheme during the six-year phasing-out period to participate in the back to education allowance scheme, or whose earnings exceed the qualifying earnings limit, can reapply for the one-parent family payment based on the age conditions within the saver period - that is, to 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">I asked my officials to give copies of this document, which provides great detail, to each of the Deputies, and this was done on Monday.</p>

          <p eId="para_694">Of course I will make it available to the Deputies.  I understood they had it already; I apologise.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">Alongside the provision of free third level education, in 1995, my then colleague, the Labour Party Minister Niamh Bhreathnach, started the first universal preschool education system in Ireland, which was called Early Start and which was particularly targeted at communities in which there was disadvantage or poverty.  That scheme, which the Deputy has possibly heard about, has been one of the most successful schemes, and I am happy to say it was initiated by the rainbow coalition.  It has benefited many thousands of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">I will not give details of all the initiatives in the Department of Education and Skills, but in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs there is the early childhood care and education programme, ECCE, which is open to all children aged between three years and four months and four years and six months in September of each year.  Under the programme, child care providers are paid a weekly capitation fee in respect of each child.  Up to now, this fee has been provided at a rate of €64.50 per child per week, or €75 per child per week where the preschool leaders hold degree-level qualifications in early education.  Following the changes announced in budget 2012, these rates will change to €62.50 and €73, respectively, from September 2012.  As such, this change will not take effect in the current preschool year.  Some 61,000 places are being provided under the ECCE programme, consisting of 17,000 community places and 44,000 private places.  That is sufficient to provide the children in that age cohort with a free preschool year.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">The community child care subvention, or CCS programme, assists some 1,000 community-based non-profit child care facilities nationwide to enable them to charge reduced child care fees to disadvantaged and low-income families who avail of their services.  Parents in receipt of social welfare income support, including family income supplement, are subsidised by €100 for five days of full-day care, although most of them use half-rate or seasonal places, which are subsidised at reduced <i>pro rata</i> rates of €50 and €33, respectively.  Other parents who have medical cards or GP visit cards receive a lower subsidy of half the full day care rate, which is €50.  Data with regard to the eligibility of parents in the 2011-12 annual return has recently been sent to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and is currently being processed and examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">The child care education and training system is implemented by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on behalf of FÁS and the VECs.  Under this scheme, parents who are FÁS or VEC trainees and who need assistance with child care costs so that they can access education and training with the aim of entering or returning to employment no longer need to pay for child care.  Participating services are paid a weekly capitation fee of €170 for each child care place they provide for trainees, because, as the Deputy pointed out, child care in Ireland is expensive.  From September 2012, the capitation fee will be €145 per week, and child care services will be allowed to charge an additional day care fee of up to €25.  There are 2,800 places under this scheme.  To bring the Deputy up to date, there are 15,864 after-school places supported by the national child care investment programme, out of a total of 75,297 places.  A further 37,000 primary school children are cared for by childminders.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">The expansion and development of child care, both preschool and after school, is a big job for this country.  However, we are not starting from zero.  We actually have a significant child care infrastructure, including all of the crèches and so on built during the boom, but we also have the primary school network.  As Deputy Ó Snodaigh mentioned, there are primary school buildings that close in the late afternoon, which many of us would like to see being made available for a variety of community purposes.  In my own constituency we have the Fingal model partnership, which involves the county council, community centres, child activities, the county child care committee and the primary schools.  That model now applies in quite a significant number of schools and in joint campuses of primary and secondary schools, and is working very well.  Although there is a lot of work to be done, there is significant child care provision already.  We must seek to expand this significantly.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">A new study called Understanding Childhood Deprivation in Ireland was published this morning by the Department of Social Protection and the ESRI.  The study was conducted by independent experts who have been working on this data and producing a series of studies over a number of years.  The key finding is that children have a higher poverty risk than adults, and these children are more likely to be in low-income and jobless households.  Poverty is especially detrimental for children due to its long-term effects, which persist into adulthood.  An adequate income is the basic requirement.  Child and family income support plays a critical role in protecting children.  Beyond this, mothers' education, employment, especially of the mother, and family stability are critically important.  I suspect this is not anything we do not know already, even in terms of our own family experiences.  These are the acknowledged Irish and international experiences.  I hope some of the Deputies would look at some of these changes in that context, in terms of the betterment of children.  Change is difficult but although we continue to spend more than €1 billion per year on lone parents and their children, with another €2 billion going to supports for families and children in general, the current system is not producing the quality of outcome to which our lone parents or people parenting on their own and their children are entitled.  I return to the question that arises from experience in other countries.  Why do they emphasise an earlier age?  It is to provide for and encourage people to get back into education and training and, ultimately, back to work at an earlier age.</p>

          <p eId="para_931">Okay.  I have a question on this for the Minister of State and would like to hear the briefing note on it.  There are three subsections in section 5.  Subsection (1) 173A deals with a situation where the one-parent family payment is being made and following the death of one of the parents the surviving spouse, cohabitant or civil partner is in receipt of the payment.  I understand that where one of the parents has died, the payment will continue for two years following the death or until the child is 18 years, whichever is less.  I ask the Minister of State to inform me if that understanding is incorrect.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">I understand that subsection (2) deals with a situation where the payment is not yet being made but the parent dies within two years of the parent being eligible to receive the payment.  In that situation, the payment will continue to be received until the payment period expires in the normal course.  Will the Minister of State read the note on that?</p>
          <p eId="para_933">Subsection (3) deals with situations where one of the parents is in custody and I ask the Minister of State to read the briefing note on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_934">Having consulted the officials, the Deputy's assessment of the legislation as it stands now is correct in the context of the alterations being made in terms of the ages of the children and how that dictates the entitlement to these supports from the State.  None of the amendments impinges negatively in any way upon the provision whereby the payment will continue after the death of a spouse.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ciarán Cannon</from>
          <p eId="para_942">I understand that it was always a part of the provision that where a person was incarcerated, the payment was payable to that person upon release.  Therefore, that will continue under the new legislation.  There is no change to that provision.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_383">
          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_943">I will proceed with my questions on the section.  If the Minister of State does not have the details to provide, I am happy to accept a note on them later today or tomorrow.  I will not delay proceedings if the information is not available now and will be happy if note is taken of my questions and I am provided with a response later.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">Section 5(1) and (2) relate to continuing payments and deal with the situation relating to surviving spouses, cohabitants or civil partners in the case of the death of a parent.  However, subsection (3) relates specifically to people whose spouse or civil partner has been committed to prison and excludes a cohabitant.  Why is the cohabitant excluded in subsection (3), although included in subsections (1) and (2)?</p>
          <p eId="para_945">Again, subsection (3) refers to a situation where the civil partner or spouse - but not cohabitant parent - has been "committed in custody".  Does this also refer to people on remand, in custody and awaiting trial?  The subsection refers to a person committed in custody for not less than six months.  Many of those on remand are on remand for periods far longer than six months.  Therefore, why is there no provision here with regard to people on remand?  The following line of section 176 refers to a person "committed in custody to a prison or place of detention".  Can the Minister of State explain what is envisaged by a "place of detention"?  My understanding is that a place of detention deals with minors, for example, St. Patrick's Institution, whereas Castlerea, Portlaoise and Mountjoy are prisons.  This seems like tautology.  Why are we including a section dealing with spouses or civil partners when talking about people in places of detention, who are, by definition, minors?  How many married people would be in a juvenile prison or place of detention?  I suspect the answer is none.  Will the Minister of State clarify why there is a reference to a place of detention?  Perhaps it means something else in the context of female prisons.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">Section 176 goes on to state that payment will "continue for a period of 4 weeks after the release of such spouse or civil partner from the prison or place of detention".  Why should a woman's payment cease after four weeks merely because her spouse or civil partner has been released from prison?  That assumes the partner will return to the family, but that may not be the case.  In many situations where a person is sent to prison, the person is not welcome or may not choose to return to the family home.  There may be many reasons for that.  However, the payment to the spouse or civil partner will now be discontinued after four weeks because the other person has been released from prison, notwithstanding the person in question may not return to the family home.  I understand they may have to reapply for payment.  This seems unfair.  The relationship may be over and the couple may no longer live together.  It seems unfair that the payment would only continue for four weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">How do the Department of Social Protection and the Irish Prison Service communicate with each other?  Does the Prison Service provide information on a daily, weekly or monthly basis to the Department and does it provide the PPS numbers of people being released so that the Department can be aware of spouses in receipt of payment and stop it?</p>
          <p eId="para_948">The next section refers to extending the list of Schedule 5 to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act as regards PPS numbers.  Is the Irish Prison Service included in that list?  How is information provided by the Irish Prison Service to the Department of Social Protection with regard to the date of release of prisoners?  In fairness to the Minister of State, I do not expect he has all the answers to hand and I will accept a commitment that the answers will be provided in due course.  I wished to raise those points because that subsection caught my eye.</p>

          <p eId="para_949">On the finer points of the drafting of the Bill and the definition of "detention" to which the Deputy referred earlier, the Department will respond to the Deputy once clarification is sought from those who drafted the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">As regards the release of prisoners, it is my understanding the reason for the four-week period is to allow for the spouse to return to the family home on release from prison.  The four-week period is a transition period and is a supportive strategy.  Where the spouse does not return to the family home, the payment will continue on the basis of the normal assessment in assessing any individual lone parent payment application or claim.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_951">It states that the one-parent family payment shall continue to be paid for four weeks after release of such spouse or civil partner.  However, I do not think that issue is being addressed in the wording in front of us.  I am happy to wait for a note of clarification in due course.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ciarán Cannon</from>
          <p eId="para_952">The conditions of the scheme dictate that a person in prison is deemed to be separated from his or her family unit.  Once a person leaves prison and returns to the family home, the four week transitional period is available.  On the other hand, if a person does not return to the family home, in order for the lone parent family allowance to continue, the lone parent claiming the allowance will be required to go through the usual assessment process to ascertain whether he or she is fully separated from the spouse in order to claim the payment.</p>

          <p eId="para_955">This is a short amendment to change the use of PPS numbers.  The section allows for access by the vocational education committees, the Pensions Ombudsman and the Pensions Board.  My amendment would allow the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, to use PPS numbers for the purposes of the electoral register.  I had previously tabled a similar amendment.  The Minister indicated when dealing with the previous Social Welfare Bill which dealt with PPS numbers that she would consider the proposal and that it would be dealt with in the next Bill.  I will not press this amendment.  She has accepted the principle of the proposal and given the debacle associated with the electoral register in this State, that this might be a mechanism to ensure that all names are included on the register of electors.  How it is used for constituency purposes could be decided by the Department.  This provision is merely to allow the Department to use the PPS number.</p>

          <p eId="para_956">The Minister is sympathetic to the thinking behind this amendment which I assume is to provide for better authentication of the identity of persons for electoral register and voting purposes.  It would be premature at this stage to extend the use of PPS numbers to this area without first examining the range of important issues involved.  Given the range of privacy and data protection issues to be considered before a public sector body or agency can be permitted to use PPS numbers for the purpose of transacting with customers, that body or agency must first be statutorily authorised to do so.  That statutory authority is given by amending Schedule 5 to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 so as to add to the list of specified bodies.  As part of the process of giving that statutory authority, the body or agency in question must first submit a business case to the Minister's Department.  In deciding the merits of the case, the Minister will then consult with other interested parties, including in particular, the Data Protection Commissioner and legal advice would also be sought where appropriate.  A number of significant privacy and data protection issues could arise if PPS numbers were to be used for electoral purposes.  In particular, such data must not form part of the published electoral registers.  The data protection and other privacy implications of the proposal need to be examined carefully by the Department, the Data Protection Commissioner and any other interested parties.  Very recently the Department received correspondence from the Local Government Management Agency in respect of an electoral register improvement project, an overall project to improve the standard of the electoral register and that matter is being currently examined by the Department and a response will issue in due course.  On that basis the Minister does not propose to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1002">These amendments are required following the implementation of the provision relating to specialist assignee relief programme in the recently enacted Finance Act 2012.  The special assignee relief programme will reduce the cost to employers of assigning skilled individuals from abroad to take up positions in Irish-based operations of their employers by exempting income tax on 30% of salary between €75,000 and €500,000, for employees who assign for between one and five years.  The income on which this relief is granted will, however, be fully chargeable to both the employee and employer PRSI.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure the collection of PRSI on these sums and thereby protect PRSI income payable to the social insurance fund.</p>

          <p eId="para_1003">This issue was debated on Second Stage and we did not have time to submit an amendment.  I am somewhat confused as to the Government policy with regard to this issue.  The Minister for Finance announced with great fanfare on budget day the special assignee relief programme scheme in the budget is designed to reduce the cost to employers of assigning skilled workers from abroad to companies in Ireland.  These employees would be exempt from income tax on 30% of their salaries between €75,000 and €500,000.  This was designed as an incentive to companies to locate key people in Ireland which may in turn attract more companies to locate in Ireland.  This was announced as a pro-employment initiative and to promote foreign direct investment.  When it comes to the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, the Minister for Social Protection is, essentially, flying in the face of her ministerial colleague who made an announcement on budget day that this would be exempt from tax.  I suspect the Minister for Social Protection is not happy with this type of approach to tax reliefs.  She is now saying to the Minister for Finance that he may forgo his PAYE but that she wants PRSI from those people.  The Minister of State might indicate what the top rate of PRSI will be on the levels of income we are talking about in terms of the employer's contribution and the employee's contribution.  It is sending out a mixed message because people would have got it into their heads since 6 December that this scheme was a tax-free incentive.  Little did people know there would be a PRSI sting in the tail once the legislation is passed.  That was not flagged.  I do not believe it was the Minister's intention.  My concern is that it sends a mixed message.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">There is one aspect of this particular scheme that it would be remiss of me not to mention.  Also under the scheme the Minister announced on budget day that the Irish taxpayer will pay up to €5,000 for private education fees in second level schools for those people who come to this country under the special assignee relief scheme.  The Minister announced on budget day with a nod and a wink that he would provide income under the counter without deducting any tax and that with a further wink, wink, if those who qualify for the scheme have children in second level that they would be given €5,000.  There is specific reference to that in the Finance Act and the budget day announcement.  I suspect the Minister for Social Protection is not happy with such measures.  If she is to be consistent she should seek a PRSI contribution in respect of the €5,000 that is being paid by the taxpayer to those people as a benefit-in-kind or some form of additional remuneration by the taxpayer to them.  Given that the Minister is taking PRSI off the amount that we understood to be tax free, why is she not following her own logic and pursuing that extra €5,000 for PRSI that is being given as a bonus to those people if they have children in second level education to pay for their school fees?  I accept it is a small amount but the same principle applies.</p>

          <p eId="para_1005">As the Deputy is fully aware, the IDA has been successful in continuing to attract foreign direct investment, FDI, into this country.  Last year alone 13,000 jobs were created as a result of its efforts.  That occurred through companies consolidating and growing their presence in this country and new companies being attracted to set up.  One of the reasons the measures were announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in the recent budget was arising from significant consultation that took place with the IDA and also some of the ideas emanating from the global economic forum which was held in Dublin Castle in recent months.  A number of senior people in the FDI sector in this country pointed out to Government that to make this concession would be most beneficial, not alone in terms of expanding existing FDI presence in this country but also in attracting new operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">At the time when announcing the tax exemption the Minister, Deputy Noonan, was specific in his reference to it in his speech, that the income that would be exempt from tax would not be exempt from either the universal social charge, USC, or from PRSI.  In the Finance Bill it was made clear that the USC would be chargeable on all of the income and what we are doing now is putting the final part of the jigsaw in place in introducing an amendment to ensure that the income is subject to PRSI.  That was always the case; there was no wink, wink or change of mind or heart or conflict between the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">Perhaps the Deputy could clarify to which allowance he refers in terms of the €5,000 and then I can respond to him.  I am not aware of the allowance he spoke about.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_1008">The allowance is specifically under the new special assignee relief programme announced by the Minister on budget day.  He gave two incentives; first, to give a certain amount of income tax free and, second, on budget day he announced an additional incentive for those people who have children in second level education – that there would be an additional payment made tax free to them.  I presume it went through the employer and that it would also be tax free to encourage them to bring their family with them and put them into school in this country.  We would pay their school fees up to an amount of €5,000 for each child.  That was in the budget day announcement.  I wonder why the Minister is going after that €5,000 for PRSI but I accept it might be a matter for the Finance Bill as much as anything else.  I have made the point.  If the Minister of State has a response that is well and good but if he does not then we will move on.</p>

          <p eId="para_1020">These amendments are required to accommodate the payment directly to the Revenue Commissioners of PRSI on the gain from taxable share options.  Currently, arrangements for the payment of PRSI on taxable share options is quite complex.  If the individual is still employed by the company which awarded the share option, the employer is obliged to deduct the PRSI chargeable.  If the individual has left the employment the PRSI must be paid directly to the special collection unit in the Department of Social Protection within 30 days.  The tax and USC are paid separately to the Revenue through its relevant tax and share options system of collection.  To rationalise the collection systems to allow PRSI to be paid by the individual directly to Revenue when they are paying the tax and USC payable it is necessary to relieve the employer of the obligation to deduct the PRSI and this section achieves this objective.  This means that PRSI, together with a tax on the USC on gains from taxable share options can all be paid in one transaction directly to the Revenue Commissioners.  To ensure that the necessary arrangements are fully in place these provisions will be brought in by commencement order.</p>

In May 2011 the Minister for Finance announced the abolition of the employer PRSI element of the charge.  The exemption of employer PRSI liability on share-based remuneration was generally provided for in the Social Welfare Act 2011, however, to ensure that the exemption from employer PRSI applies to all forms of relevant share arrangements the definition of share-based remuneration is being amended to provide a comprehensive list of the schemes affected.  The amendments also provide for refund arrangements for PRSI which may have been incorrectly paid.</p>

The final review of the mortgage arrears and personal debt review group was published in November 2010 and its recommendations were considered by the interdepartmental mortgage arrears working group whose report to the Government's Economic Management Council was published on 12 October 2011.  The Department supports the key findings of the mortgage arrears and personal debt review group which is also supported by the Government's economic management council, that the curtailment of the mortgage interest supplement scheme should be introduced in light of other alternative social housing solutions now being proposed.  The budget for 2012 provided for the curtailment of access to the mortgage interest supplement scheme for the first 12 months while the person is involved in the mortgage arrears resolution process as set out in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears applying to mortgage lenders.  The underlying principle is to ensure the mortgage arrears resolution process functions alongside State supports such as mortgage interest supplement and that the forbearance arrangements implicit in the mortgage arrears resolution process are reflected in the eligibility criteria for the mortgage interest supplement scheme.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_1067">Fianna Fáil opposes amendment No. 17 in its entirety.  It is a scandal and a shame and I am shocked at it.  I know the Minister of State was not personally involved in its drafting but I am shocked that a Minister of the Labour Party would table a proposal to curtail mortgage interest supplement.  We have discussed changes to the one parent family payment, and those in receipt of it are at the end of the scale, the most economically disadvantaged, and experience a high level of poverty.  Aside from them if one were to ask the people to list those in the most economically distressed situation for whom they have most sympathy they would say those with mortgage arrears.  People in mortgage arrears fall into various categories but those in receipt of the mortgage interest supplement are those suffering most due to their income situation and not being able to maintain their mortgage payments.  They may have lost their job since they took out the mortgage and when they took out the mortgage they may have been well able to pay it.  One person may have had a loss of income or perhaps both people in a house may have lost income.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">It is very difficult to obtain the mortgage interest supplement.  One must go to one's community welfare officer and one must go through hoops to get it.  Community welfare officers have turned down numerous applications for mortgage interest supplement where the banks are chasing people for arrears.  A common cause for people being refused mortgage interest supplement is a community welfare officer deciding the interest rate one had on a sub-prime mortgage was very high to start with, notwithstanding that the rate is less than the rate now charged by some of the State-owned Irish banks, in particular Permanent TSB.  A community welfare officer may also refuse having decided the level of mortgage was too high for the person to take on in the first place or that the person should not have taken on such a large financial commitment because the value paid relative to the loan taken out was too high.  To receive mortgage interest supplement is a tough ask compared to receiving rental supplement.  Those trying to put their own roofs over their heads amount to a fraction of the people who receive rental supplement and who are not putting their own roofs over their heads.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">The Minister stated clearly the Department supports the findings which recommend curtailing the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  I find this very severe.  Essentially this will create a legal curtailment with regard to the most hard-pressed borrowers in the country.  However, no matching curtailment is being placed on the banks who lent the money.  I am shocked that in light of everything we have gone through no action has been taken on the Cooney and Keane reports.  The Taoiseach has stated the issue of mortgage arrears is a personal priority but we find the first legislative action to deal with it is to restrict and curtail mortgage interest supplement.  However, to obtain mortgage interest supplement one must be on a very low-income to start with.  Many people in mortgage arrears would not be eligible for mortgage interest supplement.  We are discussing people with a very low level of income.  Sometimes mortgage interest supplement is a fundamental factor in helping people avoid going into arrears.  The Government's answer to people in mortgage arrears is to take the mortgage interest supplement from them.  This is the first legislative action by the Government for people in mortgage arrears.  Shame on the Minister and the Government for doing so.  I am shocked.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">On Second Stage, the Minister stated she would not proceed with reducing the relevant age for one parent family payment to seven years unless she obtained a bankable commitment from the Minister for Finance and the Government.  She should tell the House she will not proceed with this unless she has a bankable commitment from the Minister for Finance with regard to tackling the banks.  However, the banks have a bankable commitment.  The Minister of State and I and the taxpayers of Ireland have already given €5 billion to the banks to deal specifically with mortgage arrears.  This should be trickling down to help those in arrears.  It should be used to help those in receipt of mortgage interest supplement.  However, what is the response of the Government?  The banks have been given €5 billion with no legal restrictions on them with regard to how it is utilised and none of the reports are being implemented, yet a legal sanction is being placed on the little person on the lowest rung of the ladder in the Irish financial situation.  I cannot understand the Bill and I will say so to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">The Bill has done three things.  It has attacked one parent family payments, it will cut jobseekers benefit for those on a two or three day week trying to cling onto their jobs and it will reduce mortgage interest supplement and so affect those who, more than any group, need help with their mortgages.  It is a shameful Bill.  Everything about the amendment is wrong and shameful but I suspect the Government will ram it through one way or the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">I want to deal with the specifics of what is proposed.  A person will not be able to receive mortgage interest supplement until he or she has complied with repayment arrangements for a cumulative period of not less than 12 months under the mortgage arrears resolution process as set out in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears applying to mortgage lenders.  This is shameful.  People are being forced to go further into arrears before receiving the payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">What I find objectionable and sick about the amendment is that for the first time we will give the banks a veto on who can receive mortgage interest supplement from a community welfare officer.  Community welfare officers have moved from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection but I did not know they had moved to work for the banks.  The banks will be able to give orders to community welfare officers whereby unless a person has a 12 month agreement which is fully complied with the community welfare officer will not be able to award mortgage interest supplement.  A community welfare officer will not be able to award a mortgage interest supplement payment without verification from the bank that the person is complying with the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">There must be two sides to everything.  Yesterday, the Minister stated €50 million of taxpayers' money is being given to the banks under the mortgage interest supplement scheme and that she wants a bang for her buck on behalf of the Irish taxpayers.  She is right but what she should be doing in parallel to the change being made to the mortgage interest supplement is placing a legal curtailment on the banks with regard to how they deal with their customers.  She is taking a one-sided view.  She thinks she will get something from the banks but all she is doing is penalising the poor borrower.  No legal restrictions are being placed on the lenders who caused the problem.  I do not blame any 20 or 21 year old or couple who received too large a loan from a bank.  A person seeking a mortgage from a bank, which has been in existence for years, is reliant on the financial advice of that bank and if told he or she can afford a mortgage of €300,000 he or she will accept that.  I do not blame the young couples or individuals in their twenties who took out huge mortgages.  The banks are to blame for that.  Yet, the legal restriction being introduced through this measure is on the borrower rather than the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">This section deals with the banks and financial institutions which are party to the mortgage arrears resolution process through the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Many of the banks providing mortgages in Ireland are not Irish banks.  While the main banks, most of which we own, are Irish a number of other banks in this country are mortgage providers that do not have a centre of business operation here and whose main business is operated from abroad.  These banks are not regulated by the Irish Financial Regulatory Authority but from eastern Europe and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">The Minister might think I am being alarmist but I am stating the facts.  Banks that do not have a presence in Ireland, in terms of an office, and as such are not regulated here can prevent a community welfare officer in the Department of Social Protection giving a hard pressed client mortgage interest supplement.  Shame on any Minister who would introduce such a provision.  If there is one inaccuracy in what I am saying, I invite the Minister to point it out to me.  The Minister has engaged in a great deal of scaremongering over the past three days.  I wish I was wrong but I know I am not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">This section refers to banks which are party to the voluntary rather than the legal code.  Before we conclude our discussions on the Bill today, I would like clarification from the Minister on the role of local authorities in this regard.  I have tabled several parliamentary questions on this matter.  Local authorities also provide mortgages.  Many people who have local authority mortgages are in receipt of the mortgage interest supplement.  Prior to applying for a mortgage from a local authority a person must have been refused same by two banks.  By definition, such a person is in a bad situation before even applying to the local authority for a loan.  Many people who have local authority mortgages are in receipt of the mortgage interest supplement.  As I understand it, the local authorities are not part of the banking federation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">I have asked in various parliamentary questions when the local authorities will sign up to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears which is being operated by the banks and have been told time again the matter is being looked into and that circulars in this regard were issued some years ago to the local authorities.  However, when one visits one's local authority one is told they are not obliged to follow the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  I am speaking in this regard about my local authority in County Laois.  I am sure the same applies in other areas.  Laois County Council has repossessed more homes in County Laois than have all the private banks in County Laois put together, primarily because they are not obliged to adhere to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  The banks are holding off for 18 months and are not repossessing many homes relative to the number of people in arrears but the local authorities continue to repossess homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">I was delayed attending this morning's Order of Business.  I received a telephone call last night at 10.25 p.m. from a distressed constituent who was in tears having received an eviction notice from a local authority in respect of a shared ownership loan which she took out with the authority, part of which was being met through mortgage interest supplement.  That is what local authorities are doing.  They are not covered by this provision.  To qualify for mortgage interest supplement a person must have complied with an alternative arrangement under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears scheme.  How is a person to get mortgage interest supplement if his-her lender is not party to the scheme?  I hope it will not be suggested that local authority managers will be issued circulars because that will not work.  While some local authorities are adhering in part to the code their heart is not in doing so.  People in arrears on shared ownership homes who, having lost their jobs, wish to discuss the matter with their local authority are being told the authority will not engage with them until their arrears have been paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">The Minister stated that one bank has 350 people designated to dealing with arrears.  While local authority staff are excellent they are not sufficiently trained to deal with mortgage arrears.  This amendment is a scandal.  It is the first legislative provision by this Government to deal with the issue of mortgage arrears and all it does is penalise the person at the bottom of the ladder on mortgage interest supplement and allow the banks off scot free, which is a disgrace.</p>

        <speech by="#JonathanOBrien" eId="spk_404">
          <from>Deputy Jonathan O’Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_1081">These amendments were published last Monday.  While an impact analysis is carried out on all legislation when published, there was no impact analysis of these significant Committee Stage amendments, which is wrong.  People are still trying to get their heads round the proposed amendments and their impact on the most vulnerable in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">Amendment No. 17 states that to qualify for mortgage interest supplement a person must engage with the mortgage arrears resolution process.  However, there is no obligation on the banks to offer an alternative payment arrangement under that process.  The amendment states that a person can only apply for mortgage interest supplement if he or she has, arising from such engagement, entered into and is, where required, complying with an alternative repayment arrangement.  What happens if the bank refuses to offer an alternative payment arrangement?</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">A large proportion of the mortgage repayment of people who purchased homes in the past few years goes on interest.  The people applying for mortgage interest supplement are more than likely people who have lost their jobs, who are already unable to meet their mortgage repayments and who, if the mortgage arrangement offered by the bank is an interest only payment arrangement, may not be able to comply with that arrangement.  The amendment not alone states that an agreement must be entered into but that the person must be compliant with the alternative arrangement.  As such, a person who is offered an interest only payment arrangement will not be able to access mortgage interest supplement because he or she may not be in a position to comply with the interest only arrangement.  In that situation, a person would have to wait 12 months before applying for mortgage interest supplement.  This creates a number of problems.  It does nothing to help those people in short term difficulty, namely, those who have lost a job or have been placed on temporary working.  If a person in such situation cannot access the mortgage interest supplement he or she will end up in arrears on their mortgage, which they will have to try to clear if they find new employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">The second issue relates to a person who is offered an alternative arrangement payment by the bank, such as an interest-only arrangement, but is unable to meet the terms of it.  If such a person had the ability to access mortgage interest supplement, that could represent the difference between them being able to make a interest-only mortgage payment and not being able to do so.  This needs to be examined.  We are talking about the most vulnerable people in society.  We have been told that one of the aims of this Government is to ensure nobody loses the roof over his or her head.  The amendment that has been proposed will make the loss of homes a reality because it will cause people to face increased backlogs, arrears and difficulties.  If someone is unfortunate enough not to have regained full employment after the 12-month period has elapsed, an assessment will be made of whether mortgage interest supplement will be paid to him or her.  One of the criteria that will be used in that assessment will be whether the mortgage arrears are manageable.  The introduction of this amendment will increase the possibility of a build-up of an unmanageable backlog of arrears.  That is a flaw in this proposal.  I ask the Minister to withdraw the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_405">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_1085">As Deputy O'Brien has said, there are key concerns about the process by which we reached this point.  This amendment has been introduced at the last minute.  It will have significant consequences for those who will apply for mortgage interest supplement.  I will give the House an example.  One usually receives a redundancy package when one loses one's job.  That money is used to try to hold one's life together.  One always lives in the hope of being able to get another job.  One does not always look for mortgage interest supplement straightaway.  One's first port of call is to try to look for work and ensure one can hold things together.  As one's redundancy payment or savings start to whittle away, one realises that one might not get another job.  One might not approach the Department of Social Protection to look for help under this new scheme until six months or a year after one became unemployed.  One will try to find a way of taking the big burden of one's mortgage off one's shoulders while one struggles to survive on the social protection one is receiving at that stage.  One's priority will be to ensure one has a roof over one's head.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">The process of making such an application can take a number of months.  At that stage, the Department tells the applicant "sorry, you have to liaise with your bank and come up with an agreement".  The whole onus falls on the applicant, who is already in distress.  That is fine until the applicant approaches his or her bank only to be told "sorry - no agreement, no hope, no nothing".  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which the Minister will probably mention, does not oblige the bank to enter into an agreement.  There is an obligation on the bank to meet the mortgage holder.  If it refuses a request, it is obliged to write a note setting out the reason for the refusal.  Even if the bank agrees to the request, it will be another 12 months before mortgage interest supplement is granted by the Department under this new scheme.  Where is one supposed to get the money to pay one's mortgage, in line with whatever is agreed, in the meantime?  One has to comply with the requirement to make every repayment under the agreement for a full 12 months before the Department steps in to help.  I know the Minister will say that a certain amount of money is being spent on this, but I suggest that some of the money that was pumped into the banks should have been conditional on a write-down of the mortgages that are held in the banks.  That would have been much more beneficial to Irish society.  What is done is done, in some ways.  The onus to change the system is now being placed totally on the person in mortgage distress, rather than on the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">I would like to refer to the case of a person who re-engaged with me this week about a particular problem he is having.  Some of the banks that are trading in this country no longer have offices here.  I refer to Bank of Scotland, for example.  One cannot meet a Bank of Scotland official in this State.  Such a person does not exist.  A company deals with the bank's mortgage accounts on behalf of the bank.  When one tries to engage with someone in that company as part of this process, or in the event of a problem, one cannot get beyond the person one meets at reception.  One has to deal with it on the telephone or send a letter.  The person to whom I refer has entered into an agreement.  In fairness, the Department is paying mortgage interest supplement to him.  As a result of the bureaucratic incompetence of the company in question, Certus, the man in question is being forced to jump through hoops every three months.  He receives a bill for the interest because the company in question is incompetent in its processing of documentation.  It is not the fault of the Department or anybody else.  This problem has continued for two years because the man cannot deal with an individual in the company on a continuous basis.  The Department and the Citizens Information Board have worked well with him, but the bank is forcing him to get bank statements, etc., all of which comes at a cost.  He cannot deal with a faceless company.  I mention this as an example of the bureaucracy that people in distress are having to deal with.  The man in question managed to get into an agreement, but the bank keeps breaking it and then blames him for breaking it.  If he was one of the individuals we have discussed, through no fault of his own he would not be able to get mortgage interest supplement in the future because of the chaos in the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">There has to be something in this.  If more time had been available, I would have tabled amendments to close this off.  This amendment is very conditional.  It sets out what the person has to do.  No provision is being made to allow the Department to consider offering mortgage interest supplement to a person who can prove or show that the bank has refused to engage or enter into an agreement with him or her.  Such a provision would offer some relief to those who are engaged in a process.  I have major problems with the requirement for a person to come up with a certain sum for 12 months.  As I have said, such people could be in total distress.  People whose short-term contracts are not renewed do not receive redundancy.  They do not receive the limited pot of gold that allows some people to survive their financial problems for a number of months.  Their distress is immediate because they are living from hand to mouth.  They do not have the luxury of entering into an agreement to be implemented over 12 months.  The way the redundancy issue is now dealt with in this country - people who have worked for many years are not getting what they should be due - means that most of those who are laid off need somebody to step in within weeks of being made redundant or moving into mortgage distress.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the amendment she has thrown in at this stage and to revisit this complicated matter at some future time.  Another social welfare Bill will be introduced in October and a further one will be introduced after the budget.  This is a cost-cutting measure because some savings are being made as a consequence of the decision to delay the payment of mortgage interest supplement to new applicants for 12 months.  The savings element of this measure is not so substantial that it cannot be delayed until its consequences have been properly reviewed, thrashed out and analysed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_406">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_1090">I will be brief because much of the debate yesterday and today focused on why many of us in the Opposition are opposed to this amendment.  I appeal to the Minister again to listen to what we are saying.  Any person who takes out a mortgage is told repayment is a priority.  One can cut one's private health insurance or cut down on going to the dentist, doctor, etc., but one must pay one's mortgage.  This view has been instilled in many people and they pay their mortgages in full for as long as they can.  This leads to the question about distressed mortgages.  The banks will deal with one only if one does not pay in full for over three months.  Thereafter, the alarm bells ring and the banks try to arrange a meeting with the mortgagor.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">The first thing those seeking support on foot of losing a job, through a company going bust or otherwise, or suffering from a long-term medical condition, such as a broken leg, and who are planning to return to work eventually are told in my office in Crumlin is that they are entitled to apply for mortgage interest supplement to support them over their period of difficulty, or to keep them out of difficulty.  The legislation implies one will not get mortgage interest supplement until one is in dire circumstances.  Even at this late stage, the Minister should ensure those who apply for mortgage interest supplement are requested to negotiate with their banks regarding repayments and securing an interest-only mortgage for a period, for example.  Families' or individuals' need of mortgage interest supplement would be a signal to the banks that they must be dealt with.  At least there would then be early intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">The point has been made that those who took out mortgages and who pay every month without ever going near the bank are nervous about approaching banks.  When trying to renegotiate, one may have three or four bank officials in front of one, and when one is given a form to fill out, one must go to MABS or elsewhere for help filling it out.  When one submits the form, it is checked along with one's income and other loans, and this is quite intimidating.  This legislation does not assist those affected in any way.  A provision to address the problem should be linked to a bank resolution or insolvency Bill in which every provision is put in place for one to be assisted.  Thus, one would not be left on one's own to sort out one's mortgage debt with the banks.  Only when such a system is in place should a provision such as that proposed by the Minister be considered.  While one is entitled to mortgage interest supplement if one is in distress in the short term, the legislation should be linked to insolvency legislation.  The banks are not even obliged to do as I describe at present.  The Government cannot tell them what to do; they do not listen to the Government half the time.  Therefore, the amendment should be rejected.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_407">
          <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
          <p eId="para_1093">I appreciate the concerns expressed by Deputies.  However, one must bear in mind the interests of those who have unfortunately found themselves without a job or, as in many cases, with a job but who have difficulty repaying their mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">As Minister, I am very conscious that the Department of Social Protection will pay more than €50 million this year addressing mortgage interest arrears on behalf of approximately 18,000 people.  The money goes to the banks, not to the people.  The object of public policy is to ensure people stay in their homes, even though they may have financial or employment difficulties.  For the €50 million, are we getting what we want from the banks?  Deputies have described the difficult circumstances people face.  Are the people involved and the taxpayers getting a good deal on foot of the banks' activities?</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">The code of conduct on mortgage arrears requires all licensed and registered banks and financial entities that give mortgages to subscribe thereto.  My Department spends approximately €47 million employing professional advisers in the Citizens Information Board and financial advisers in MABS.  The Department, therefore, is spending a lot of money on offering advice and information.  I was not clear on what Deputy Collins was suggesting.  Was she saying the services are an irritant to people in that they must fill out forms and talk to MABS?</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">I reiterate what I said yesterday, namely, one must get the lenders and those who are heavily indebted together.  Ultimately, they must be in a position to strike a deal.  The Government is developing a series of alternatives, on the basis of the Keane report and its predecessor, the Cooney report.  These include the mortgage-to-rent option.  In some cases, unfortunately, people may not be able to sustain their mortgages.  The object is to keep these people in the family home.  There is considerable work taking place to develop alternative mechanisms of resolution that ensure people can stay in the family home.  To date, only a mortgage interest rate supplement is paid over.  If this does not work out, however, there is not necessarily a resolution for the family.  It is meant as a short-term support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">One must try to establish a core relationship between the lender and borrower and determine realistically and genuinely what a lender can do, and what the borrower can pay.  The lender ultimately must be realistic about what the borrower can pay.  If the Deputies are suggesting that the Department of Social Protection should step in without bringing together the lender and the borrower to work seriously towards a settlement and ascertain the best outcome, they are misguided.  The first desired outcome is to keep the family in the home.  The second is to find the best mechanism by which to do so.  As I stated, the Government is working on new mechanisms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">The code of conduct on mortgage arrears is not an option for the lenders; they must sign up to it.  Many of these lenders are being kept alive by the Irish taxpayer and have been for a long time.  The people who signed the bank guarantee ensured the Irish taxpayer took responsibility for all these lenders, so I invite the Deputies to think about this and about how we get the best outcomes.  The best outcomes may not be the fastest ones or simply what was done before because over the period of the crisis, the Department has been spending an increasing amount of money - €50 million this year - on this area.  I would like to say all of the people ended up very happy but they are in a very serious financial position, in particular if their loss of income, loss of wealth or loss of employment is long term or if they went onto the mortgage interest supplement and cannot get out of it.  That is why the Government is arranging alternative products which give people an alternative route, such as mortgage to rent for a period of time.  People who were on local authorities will remember that years ago.  There were other ways to buy a house rather than by taking out a mortgage, such as co-ownership and shared ownership.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">I invite colleagues to think about it in a creative way because this is another €50 million - I know we talk in terms of billions of euro - which is just going to the banks.  I would like to see us genuinely getting as much comfort and security for as many families out of those scarce resources.  Why, for instance, are we paying all the interest without let or hindrance just because it was done when the numbers were very small?  What interest rates are paid?  Is it just whatever interest rate the bank has decreed?  Much serious examination and thought needs to go into this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">The code of conduct sets out how lenders must treat borrowers who are in, or facing, mortgage arrears with due regard to the fact that each case is unique and that it needs to be considered on its own merits.  The lenders have to set out and use a framework when dealing with borrowers in mortgage arrear or pre-arrears and all cases must be handled sympathetically and positively with the objective of assisting the borrower to meet his or her obligations or, as we develop new mechanisms, to perhaps enter into different arrangements which allow them to keep his or her family home.  A lender must explore all the options for alternative repayment arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">The options, with which Members will be familiar, are an interest only arrangement for a specified period of time; an arrangement to pay interest on part of normal capital element for a specified period of time; deferring payment of all or part of the instalment repayment for a period of time; extending the term of the mortgage; changing the type of the mortgage, except in the case of tracker mortgages; capitalising the arrears and interest; and any voluntary scheme to which the lender has signed up, for instance, a deferred interest scheme.  There is a series of options which the lender is obliged to offer to the borrower.  Members must bear in mind that many of the people who present to MABS have very complex debt problems with not just mortgage interest debts, but car loans, credit union loans, credit card bills and perhaps other secondary loans.  We are trying to deal with a complicated issue.  We should not just hand over €50 million to the banks, because that is where it is going.  Some of the banks complain that some people who get the money do not pay it to them but that is a separate issue and involves a small number of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">The case to which Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred is somebody who has been in difficulties for two years and is getting mortgage interest supplement.  That kind of proves the point.  That bank is actually being paid the mortgage interest supplement for that individual by the State.  It is getting its money and yet it is not treating the customer with the respect, sympathy or understanding required.  We are actually paying the bank.  I am not saying I have a solution to that but, to some extent, perhaps it has been a bit too easy for those financial institutions that the State will just pay and they can still continue to be not terribly nice to the poor unfortunate person who has got into financial difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">I do not know if Deputy Ó Snodaigh has a view.  The bank is getting its interest.  What does it want?  Does it think the person has other sources of money or is it that it simply wants to repossess the house?</p>

          <p eId="para_1107">The State, the Department of Social Protection and MABS cannot engage in detail in everything, but what we can do is work to a better framework.  Perhaps the person is semi-permanently in difficulty and that, hopefully, he or she will eventually get work.  I do not know what the circumstances are.  However, if he or she is two years in this process, perhaps he or she needs a better long-term process.  That is one of things which is being worked on.  Unfortunately, it is a much slower process from a legal point of view than any of us involved in government would like but then our Constitution is legally very detailed, very prescriptive and very strong on property rights, so the lender has many rights in regard to the mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">If the Deputy gives me the details, I will ask the people in the Central Bank about it because with my Department paying the mortgage interest supplement, why should that individual be harassed in the manner he described?  If our hardworking taxpayers' money is going to pay the mortgage interest supplement, why is that institution apparently in breach of the code of conduct in regard to mortgage arrears?  It might be interesting if we try to explore why that has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">It goes to show that banks believe they can get large volumes of money, through the mortgage interest supplement, without any work being done by them.  It is €50 million, on which there are a lot of calls, for 18,000 people.  However, it was always meant to be short term.  Given the way the difficulties in regard to mortgages have evolved, we need other mechanisms as well as the mechanism of the Department of Social Protection.  I will keep this area under review.  There seems to be an automatic expectation on the part of banks and lenders that the Department of Social Protection will pay out money willy-nilly without ever demanding that they go through the code in detail.  This is what we are trying to do so that we can get better value for the many tens of millions of taxpayers' money.  We must explore many questions about how the code operates in respect of mortgage interest supplement.  Deputies should bear in mind that community welfare officers, CWOs, who take part in this matter, joined the Department in recent times.  We have been able to get a great deal of regional and county data on the number of mortgages that are in difficulty and being assisted.  These data have been published in newspapers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">Although lenders may be robust when seeking their money, they must engage and treat people with dignity.  Most lenders assert that they have structures in place in this regard.  The supplement of €50 million to them is a valuable resource.  If they want it, they must engage with borrowers.  I am not satisfied that the existing relationship has served the general interests of people, specifically borrowers, well, particularly in the type of cases cited by Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  In those cases, lenders who have been paid mortgage interest supplement by the State are not responding appropriately.  The Deputy's examples show that this matter must be re-examined.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JonathanOBrien" eId="spk_412">
          <from>Deputy Jonathan O’Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_1111">No one is suggesting that the borrower and lender should not engage.  They should.  If someone gets into mortgage difficulty, the first port of call should be to engage with the lender.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">The Minister asked whether we were getting value for the €50 million.  We have invested billions of euro in banks to pay bondholders and have received no value in return.  At least this €50 million has a visible value, in that it keeps roofs over the heads of 18,000 families.  It is not fair to argue that we are investing €50 million in the banks without any evident benefit.  It has a tangible benefit, unlike the tens of billions of euro previously invested in banks.  The question of whether we are getting good value for money should be asked.  Under the Minister's proposals, however, the onus is on the borrower to enter into an arrangement.  Otherwise, he or she will be excluded from applying for mortgage interest supplement for 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">The Government has made much of its labour activation measures.  If someone loses a job, he or she might not receive a large redundancy package, if any.  A number of people are on short-term contracts that roll over continually, which means they will never be in a position to receive large redundancy payments.  I will cite an example of a person who loses a job and gets into mortgage difficulties.  The person engages with his or her lender and arranges to repay the interest only, which is the usual arrangement.  After waiting for 12 months, the person applies for and receives mortgage interest supplement.  A couple of months down the line, the person is offered three or six months work on a short-term contract.  Does the Minister believe that there is any incentive for those people to take up employment for such a short period knowing that, in three or six months time, they will be back to being unable to repay their mortgages and will need to go through the process again?  It is not reasonable for someone who is offered a short-term contract, summer work, etc.  The Government has stated that the nature of work is changing to something more transitional and seasonable.  If someone is offered three months work in the hotel trade, there is no incentive to accept the offer because he or she would be back to square one afterwards.  The amendment makes no provision for a suspension of the supplement during a short work period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">The Minister's proposal is flawed and I ask her to withdraw it to allow for further consultation.  As Deputy Ó Snodaigh stated, we can revisit the issue when we debate the social welfare Bill next October, but trying to introduce such a far-reaching amendment on Monday without an accompanying impact analysis is wrong.  It will only serve to create more problems for people who are already struggling, increase the likelihood of mortgage arrears among people who are in desperate need of the mortgage interest supplement and increase the possibility of family homes being lost.  There is no other way to view it.  It is shameful, disgraceful and short-sighted and should be withdrawn and reconsidered.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_413">
          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_1115">I will be brief, as I made many comments on this amendment while the Minister was out of the Chamber.  I will boil the issue down to one or two key points.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">I will put the €50 million that the Minister mentioned in context without commenting on it, good, bad or indifferent.  On average, the €50 million equates to approximately €3,000 per each of the 18,000 households.  For that amount, a roof is kept over a family's head and the family owns the house.  According to the briefing note that we received from the Department on Monday, the estimated cost of the rent supplement this year is €437 million, which works out at approximately €4,500 for each of its 95,000 recipients.  The cost of mortgage interest supplement is much cheaper per claimant.  I suspect that the majority of mortgage interest supplement claims are not made by individuals, but by families who bought houses, whereas many rent supplement claimants are individuals.  The number of people benefitting through the mortgage interest supplement is higher per €1 million spent.  The Minister wants to reduce the rent supplement as well, but that is another day's work.  Under the mortgage interest supplement scheme, less money is provided to keep a person's own roof over his or her head than is paid to landlords to provide rented accommodation.  I wanted to put these figures in context.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">I am utterly opposed to this proposal.  Even the Taoiseach has announced a few times recently that people with mortgage arrears are the Government's priority.  I am unsure, but it seems that the Government's first Bill on mortgage arrears will cut mortgage interest supplement or, to use the Minister's word, curtail it.  That word was used several times in her Department's briefing notes.  I understand what the Minister means when she refers to giving the banks €50 million, in that they must do something for it.  However, if the Minister is introducing legal curtailments of mortgage interest supplement, she should also impose legal curtailments on the banks as regards how they deal with their customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">We are still stuck with the idea of changing the law to get the small person while genuflecting to the banks and asking them to introduce a voluntary code of conduct, if they do not mind.  They voluntarily signed up to the code of conduct but they have made it clear that they do not want it to be put on a statutory basis in case it affects the rights they believe they possess to enforce mortgages.  The Minister referred to the constitutional rights of the lender on several occasions over the course of this debate but I did not hear her mention the constitutional right of the poor householder.  Is the Government's sole legal contribution to dealing with the mortgage interest arrears the curtailment mortgage interest supplement?  Those who suffered income reductions and are caught with mortgages are the first category everyone wants to help but the people who are at the bottom of the economic pile are those in receipt of mortgage interest supplement because they are on the lowest incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">I cannot understand why the Minister is passing legislation to put the boot in the little person without dealing similarly with the banks.  We have had the Cooney report and the Keane report but no legislation.  We could be considering this Bill in conjunction with legislation to force the banks to act responsibly.  The idea of leaving it to the cosy cartel of the banks is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">I will not rehash what I said earlier about the role of local authorities.  They are not part of the bank scheme even though they also lent money to people to buy houses.  They generally loaned to those on the lowest incomes because one of their requirements was for a borrower to have two refusals from the banks.  My local authority has obtained more evictions in County Laois than the banks because the latter have agreed to forbearance.  I tabled several parliamentary questions on this issue but I have not yet received a satisfactory answer.  Local authorities have been told to join the scheme but they are not legally required to do so.  Certain local authorities are making use of the courts with more frequency than the banks.  If county managers were asked the number of court cases they are pursuing over mortgage arrears, the Minister would be shocked at the answer.  Some local authorities may have signed up to the code in spirit but others are certainly not following it in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">Where are the laws to deal with the banks on foot of the Keane and Cooney reports?  The only legislation I can see impacts on the little person.  I am shocked that a Labour Party Minister is introducing these measures.  Curtailing the lone parent payment from 14 years to seven years is an awful attack on people.</p>

As Deputy Fleming was on the backbenches when Fianna Fáil was in government, perhaps the actions of the former Taoiseach from his own constituency escaped his attention.  The reason we have a problem is because Fianna Fáil decided to guarantee the banks, with the support of Sinn Féin, as the cheap alternative.  We are still trying to unravel the unholy mess created by the bank guarantee.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to undo what Fianna Fáil and the people who voted for the bank guarantee have done.</p>

          <p eId="para_1142">We are trying to unravel the difficulties in the banks which the previous Government caused.  This small country suffered a world class catastrophe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">The Government's objective is to keep people in their homes.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh raised a worrying case of an individual who has been receiving mortgage interest supplement for two years but is being treated badly by the banks.  I want to see a change which makes the banks engage with their customers.  We have devoted more time to protecting people's family homes than any other issue.  Thus far we have created a number of new products, including mortgage to rent, which will allow people to rent their family homes where their capacity to repay their original mortgage is not sustainable.  As the Constitution, which was designed by Fianna Fáil, offers strong protections for property rights, this issue is taking time to resolve.  The object of the exercise is to protect the family home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to a problem with the mortgage interest supplement.  Almost 60% of people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement receive it for 12 to 24 months and up to 72 months.  It is becoming apparent that in many cases it is very hard for people to go back to work because they do not have an alternative structure that would give them long-term security regarding their family home.  They fear that if they leave the mortgage interest supplement scheme they will actually lose that and therefore they will not be able to go back to work.  That is a problem we are trying to address by developing other longer-term products such as mortgage to rent and others that help people keep their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">The Fianna Fáil Deputy wants the code of conduct on mortgage arrears to be put on a legislative footing.  It is a pity that he never addressed that issue before.  He is a member of the Committee on Public Accounts and he will know that all of the financial institutions have signed up to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  If the Deputy is now suggesting as seems to be the case that the financial institutions are ignoring it, refusing it or denying it, he should state which institutions are doing so.</p>

        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_437">
          <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government  (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1264">I welcome this opportunity to speak to the House today on the issue of reform of the water sector, and to have the opportunity to clarify recent Government decisions and outline the next steps in the reform process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265">There has been a good deal of commentary in the last week on the Government's plans for reform of water service delivery.  I will take this opportunity to clarify some facts.  The Government announced last week its intention to establish a new independent State-owned water company within the Bord Gáis group.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266">It has been decided that domestic water charges should be based on usage and that a national metering programme will be commenced later this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">The Government has also decided to establish an independent economic regulator for water services.  This function is being assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation, which will be responsible for determining the cost of water services to the consumer and for ensuring that planned efficiencies are delivered.  The establishment of the economic regulator is a key and necessary characteristic of this new model and the need for such regulation was recognised in the last Government's programme for national recovery.  My Department will remain responsible for overall policy and legislation for the sector.  I will bring forward the necessary legislation to underpin the proposed reforms to the House in due course and we will have an opportunity to debate these issues further.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">The move of water service functions from local authorities to a new commercial semi-State body, in a regulatory environment, and a new funding regime based on domestic charges is a major organisational change.  Establishing the new organisation under the umbrella of a mature semi-State body has a number of advantages, including the existing expertise and experience to manage the set-up and with fewer risks than there would be with a greenfield set-up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269">The independent assessment, while recognising there were potential advantages to leveraging the structure, expertise and governance of an existing State agency in the establishment of Irish Water, also foresaw certain issues which would have to be satisfactorily addressed in such circumstances.  On balance, it recommended that Irish Water should be established as a new entity.  The Government also decided that this matter should be analysed further with a view to ensuring that existing resources and capabilities in the State sector were used to best effect.  This approach is also in line with Government plans to support economic growth by eliminating waste and duplication in public spending through rationalising State agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">The outcome of this analysis was that Irish Water should be established as an independent State-owned company within the Bord Gáis Group.  The process involved an assessment of the capacity and capabilities of a number of State agencies from amongst those identified in the independent assessment as having the potential to incorporate a new water utility.  It was not a tendering process culminating in the award of a contract.  It would have been wholly inappropriate to take that approach and, as suggested in some quarters, involve private sector companies in bidding when a key fundamental principle of this reform is that water services remain in public ownership.  There has been significant commentary on whether the establishment of the new water utility will pave the way for privatisation in this sector.  Let me be very clear on this issue.  The proposal to create a public utility is not about privatisation of our water resource, nor is it a precursor to privatisation.  Water services will remain in public ownership.  This is in line with the approach across Europe where privatisation is very much the exception rather than the norm.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271">I also wish to clarify which decisions have not yet been taken, as these issues have also been the subject of significant commentary and some guesswork.  The details of the funding model, including decisions relating to the precise charging framework including the level of charges, have yet to be finalised and will be a matter for Government and the economic regulator, in co-operation with Bord Gáis.  The amount of free allowance and the measures to address the needs of those with affordability issues or medical needs requiring a high essential use of water have also to be finalised with Government, Irish Water and the regulator.  There will be no up-front charges for meters and their installation, no charge for water until metering is rolled out nationally, and no earlier than 2014.  This will give home-owners plenty of time to be informed and to plan their water provision and water conservation measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272">It is important for us to try to frame the debate around water more strategically.  Water is a precious resource.  On a global level, pressures created by the world's growing population and economy, combined with the impacts of climate change, are making water scarcity a reality in many parts of the world.  Work undertaken by the McKinsey Water Resources Group shows that in just twenty years global demand for water will be 40% higher than it is today, and more than 50% higher in most rapidly developing countries, and that by 2030 over a third of the world population will be living in river basins that will have to cope with significant water stress.  I am struck by a recent meeting of the EU Council of Ministers on the environment at which 20 of the 28 member states spoke about problems they had with water quality and quantities.  These messages are reinforced by the OECD in its environmental outlook to 2050, The Consequences of Inaction, published last month, which shows the position deteriorating further if robust policy responses are not taken by governments and other key stakeholders.  The OECD report identifies among its main policy responses the need for improved water efficiency, including appropriate water pricing policies, an ongoing focus on improving water quality, and the need for robust water governance and ongoing investment in infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">Ireland's valuable water resources have the capacity to position Ireland well in terms of competitiveness and to support the success of many water-dependent sectors.  Ireland needs to exploit this competitive advantage and attract more water-intensive industries.  We need to explore all opportunities for using our water resources in a sustainable way to support economic growth, competitiveness and job creation.  From a national perspective, the key objective of the Government's water reform programme is to put in place structures and funding arrangements that will ensure we have a world-class water and waste water infrastructure that meets all environmental and public health standards, and is well positioned to attract foreign direct investment and support job creation and maintenance in key sectors such as pharma-chem, IT and food and drink.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">We have to address key organisational and funding issues in the sector or we will constrain our capacity to continue to exploit this natural advantage.  There has been a historical under-investment in water and waste water infrastructure which now needs to be addressed, as well as a requirement to invest for future needs.  The requirement for continued significant capital investment in water services has been estimated at €600 million annually - as compared to about €370 million in Exchequer capital spending this year -  together with the provision for the backlog of investment required mainly to meet statutory obligations.  In the context of our current public finances, this presents a significant challenge which requires an innovative response to develop a sustainable funding model which can deliver these massive investment requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">The existing approach where water services are delivered through 34 water service authorities has inevitably lead to fragmentation in delivery and duplication of functions across authorities which has inhibited our capacity to gain advantages through economies of scale.  A public water utility offers the best opportunity to build on the strengths of the existing system, improve efficiency and effectiveness of water services delivery, provide access to new funding sources and improve strategic planning and accountability.  Establishing Irish Water as an independent State-owned company within the Bord Gáis Group will facilitate making best use of existing resources and capacity within the public sector.  In deciding on this approach, the Government recognised that Bord Gáis Éireann has key capabilities that can be brought to bear in the establishment of Irish Water, including experience in operating as a utility in a regulated environment and a track record in raising finance.  The organisation has specific skills from its own experience of transformation, customer relations, network management, metering and utility operation that can be quickly deployed to assist in the successful establishment and operation of Irish Water.  These skills within the Bord Gáis Group will be combined with the considerable experience, skills and commitment to service in local authorities to build the new organisations while retaining the strengths of the existing model.  It is envisaged that service level agreements will be put in place between Irish Water and local authorities and that these arrangements would end in 2017 at the earliest.  This will ensure a smooth transition to the new model and guard against the loss of local expertise.  It will also mean that the majority of staff will remain in the direct employment of local authorities for a considerable period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276">Work is now progressing on the development of an implementation strategy which should be finalised in the next month or so.  This will focus on implementation and transformation issues involved in the creation of the new public water utility and will recommend appropriate transitional arrangements.  The strategy will also focus on maintaining the delivery of a critical public service during and following a restructuring process, and will give further clarity on the next steps that will be taken in the reform process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277">As I clarified earlier, many key decisions remain to be taken.  Much commentary has understandably focused on water metering and charges and what this will mean for households.  Ireland is the only OECD country which does not charge for water services.  Providing high quality water services without regard to cost or sustainability is no longer feasible.  By levying charges based on the amount of water used, households will be given an incentive to use water responsibly and to respect this valuable resource.  International evidence has shown that where meters have been installed significant reductions have been achieved in the level of consumption.  We have taken a conservative estimate of a 10% potential reduction in consumption that could be achieved following the introduction of water meters in households.  This is a conservative estimate because metering changes habits.  This view is supported by the trial carried out by "The Consumer Show" on RTE last Tuesday, which showed that a family of five in a three- bedroom semi-detached home can reduce their consumption by up to 30% by taking very simple measures, for example, not leaving the tap running when washing teeth or preparing vegetables, leaving a jug of water in the fridge for drinking purposes, using the economy setting on dishwashers and washing machines or fitting a water saving device costing just a few euro in the toilet cisterns.</p>

Reducing unnecessary water use reduces the operational costs of providing water services as well as providing longer-term savings on capital investment.

However, as is the case for other providers of utility services, Bord Gáis will be required to have a range of options in place to assist householders who have difficulties in paying their bills.  The economic regulator, with the Government, will be responsible for determining the cost of water services and ensuring efficiencies are delivered so that the cost of providing the service to the consumer is kept to a minimum.</p>

There is no doubt embarking on such a fundamental programme of reform for the water sector will bring many challenges but these reforms have the capacity to deliver a sustainable financial model in the future, leverage additional funding for investment, achieve efficiencies through economies of scale and elimination of duplication and, crucially, provide an improved service for consumers.  In light of the global economic challenge and the position of our public finances, the time is right to reorganise our approach in this sector to support economic growth and to meet the needs of future generations.  The opportunities and benefits the reform programme will bring for the economy, for society and for service delivery are worth the challenges and it is in all our interests to support this approach.  I look forward to hearing the views expressed in the House today and I am confident that constructive and informed engagement from all stakeholders will be a valuable input in the development of an implementation strategy to ensure the change is managed well.</p>

          <p eId="para_1282">The trend of failure from this Government has grown steadily week by week.  At the centre of the storm is the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who has now completed a perfect hat-trick of disasters.  The Government debacle in implementing water charges shows that it has failed to learn any lessons from the household charge and septic tank fiascos.  A lack of detail about how much metering will cost the consumer, outdated numbers, uncertainty for current employees, a rushed decision making process bypassing the Oireachtas and confusion in the Cabinet over the costs involved all point to another Government disaster.  The Government is rushing ahead with the creation of Irish water and rolling out water meters without clearly considering the costs involved to consumers.  Ultimately, householders will be left to pay the price for Government ineptitude.  We are calling on the Government to stop before it goes further down the disastrous road chosen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">Over the past few months the Customs House has become ground zero for a litany of Government mistakes, botched implementations, hasty decisions and poor communication.  At a time when the Government should be focused on a critical referendum on the country's future, its energies are spent on deflecting attention from escalating problems in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  A sense of arrogance has characterised the Government's approach to new charges.  Consultation with the public has been replaced with dictation from the Minister.  The abysmally low compliance rate with the household charge and protests over the septic tank tax on rural Ireland bears testament to the kind of approach taken by the Government.  This high-handed attitude by the Government is quickly becoming its trademark and now appears to be dominating the strategy to impose water charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">The establishment of Irish Water and the rolling out of water meters and charges by 2014 has been characterised by a lack of detail, ineptitude in communication and a critical failure to appreciate the scale of the challenge at hand.  Households have been hit with a raft of contradictory messages and numbers from the Government.  During a period when consumer confidence is at a low ebb, the Government appears to be committed to sapping any potential for future improvements in sentiment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">The roll out of metering was initially touted as an upfront charge, only to be replaced by a €800 standing charge over 20 years.  It is an excessively expensive exercise.  Amidst the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach directly contradicting each other, the ordinary householder is left trying to figure out the cost.  The price of meters can range from €60 to €150 with labour and additional cost depending on the location and work involved yet the Government indicated metering would cost €160 per meter with the remaining €640 going towards installation costs.  In these straitened times, it is difficult to see companies vying for the tendering process with such exorbitantly high labour costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_1288">The detailed 2009 Walker review in the UK considered the cost of alternative meter installations.  Internal installation was found to cost between £106 and £385 and external installation in new boxes cost between £293 and £471.  Employing these numbers, and assuming that meters are rolled out to 1 million households, the total cost would range between €125 million and more than €555 million.  Given the vast differences between these figures it is legitimate to ask what cost-benefit analysis, if any, the Government undertook on internal and external metering.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">The Irish people are borrowing €450 million directly from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to finance the roll-out of meters and the creation of Irish Water.  Over 20 years we are going to repay €800 million, almost €1 billion, on the back of taxpayers to install meters.  Dr. Edgar Morgenroth of the ESRI has set out that potential water charge rates could reach between €473 and €560 per household.  Simultaneously, figures from the ESRI last week revealed a potential property tax each year of about €2.50 for every €1,000 of house value or €500 for a house worth €200,000.  Struggling homeowners, shocked by the scale of the charges, have looked to the Government to provide clarity only to receive confusion.  Details on issues such as free allowances have not been forthcoming as the Government kicks to touch, passing the buck by transferring the problems to the, as yet, non-existent Irish Water.  Further questions linger over whether private wells will be subjected to metering under the water directive, as some Commission reports indicate they will.  These growing concerns, held by rural households across the country need to be fully addressed as soon as possible by the Government and the EU Commission.</p>

          <from>Deputy Niall Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_1291">When looking at the numbers involved in water metering yet more holes appear in the Government case.  The figures used by the Government are based on the 2006 census, as used in the PwC report on the provision of water services.  When we look at the 2011 census figures, we can see further potential problems with the Government's plans.  Some 503,000 units or 36% of those households eligible to pay water charges are potentially unsuitable for metering by the Government's standards.  These units were either constructed before 1960 or are apartments.  This is significantly higher than the 300,000 households or 20% of eligible units the Government has cited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">Instead, we learn that these homes will be subject to yet another regressive flat rate charge without any conservation incentive.  This leaves potentially just under 890,000 households for water metering, more in chime with the estimate of Dublin City Council executive manager, Tom Leahy, that one third of households cannot be metered.  In stark contrast, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government said that over 1 million homes would be metered by the end of 2014, with only 300,000 excluded because they are apartments or gated communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">It is unclear whether the 60,000 holiday homes across the country are eligible to pay water charges and whether a meter will be applied.  What is the plan for the 230,000 vacant houses in the State?  Will they be metered on an ongoing basis as they are occupied or in one fell swoop on estates?  Will they be allowed to opt into the metering scheme at their own cost once they are occupied?  It is imperative the Government updates its figures and sets out a clear business case for the plans announced before it goes further down the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">Fianna Fáil has a number of serious, specific concerns about the Government's NewERA project plans to establish Irish Water.  From what we have seen so far, the Government is rushing ahead with the creation of Irish Water without seriously considering the broader costs and consequences of setting up a new Government monopoly company over such an important resource.  A smoke screen consultation process was utterly undermined by the fact the Government had already decided what it was going to do.  The consultative process was mere window dressing and tinkering around the edges rather than coming to the key issues with an open mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">There are a number of areas in which I would like to reiterate our concerns, including stripping local government of its role.  The Government has yet to publish the White Paper on local government reform yet it is aggressively pressing ahead with stripping 34 local authorities of one of their key roles.  This incoherent, <i>ad hoc</i> approach undermines meaningful efforts to re-shape local government to suit the needs of modern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">The PwC report indicated that Irish Water will operate with significantly lower numbers than the 4,278 currently employed by local authorities in the provision of water.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">In yet another contradiction, the Taoiseach denied any potential job losses, only to be subsequently contradicted by the Department who said it would be a matter for Irish Water   Based on the example of Northern Ireland, at least 1,200 jobs could be lost here.  Local authority staff have on-the-ground knowledge that will be lost with the creation of a new company and the shedding of jobs.  The local response of a centralised company will inevitably suffer in comparison to on-the-ground operations that have experience in the field of dealing with the water infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">Thus far, some €130,000 has been spent on consultation fees to PwC, yet the advice they gave was ignored.  The absence of a coherent Government strategy has generated substantial fees for private consultants, with money going down the drain.  The experience in Northern Ireland confirms the large amount of money committed to contracting private consultants to help create a new body.  The studies published by the Government give no indication of the costs involved in hiring consultants, which will spiral as the scale of the administrative challenge created by the Government's decisions becomes more apparent over the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">The Government has set out the broad parameters of the NewERA Irish Water company but has failed to provide meaningful detail on the corporate governance structures of the company.  Details on whether it will provide a commercial return on its assets, reporting structures and democratic oversight remain absent. Furthermore, the links between this separate company and the planning authorities, which previously would have all been attached to the local authority, present fresh challenges in ensuring proper sustainable planning.  Regardless of its rhetoric in the Dáil, the Government's insistence on the creation of a company indicates that it is preparing the ground for an eventual privatisation of the water system.  The choice of Bord Gáis, which has been partially earmarked for sale, further confirms this suspicion.  The failure to consider a third way in providing strengthened oversight and an investment model to upgrade the water infrastructure reveals the privatisation goal at the heart of this NewERA white elephant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">The pressures mounting on the Department have clearly been shown up in the cracks now emerging.  The rushed nature of the plans to develop Irish Water will place additional pressure on a Department already under strain and local authority officials that will inevitably undermine the quality of work that underpins this project.  The lack of detail and contradictory messages thus far bear testament to the strain under which they are operating.  This does not bode well for the future implementation of an immensely complex process.  Again, the lack of any planned and strategic approach by the Government opens the door to expensive and unnecessary consultancy fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">The Government's justification for the creation of a singular Government monopoly rests upon the economies of scale of the project and efficiency gains.  The PwC report fails to specify detailed efficiency gains.  Instead, it gives a vague outline of potential savings.  For example, given the Taoiseach's insistence that no jobs will be lost, from where will the savings come?  The Minister has yet to clarify these issues.  The plans laid out for the future of Irish Water fail to place the customer at the heart of the process.  The deficit of local knowledge and on the ground responsiveness will inevitably negatively affect Irish customers.  Furthermore, the deficit of democratic engagement, the stripping of local authorities' involvement and the creation of a separate centralised body will create an unaccountable body detached from customers.  We fundamentally disagree with the privatisation model put forward by the Government.  It lacks local accountability and responsiveness and will lead to job losses.  We will shortly publish our own strategy to ensure adequate efficiency in infrastructural upgrades while keeping the effective local element that currently exists.  Our model will exclude the heavy consultation fees that the proposed system will generate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">The creation of Irish Water as a part of Bord Gáis follows a murky selection process without public scrutiny or accountability.  The decision flies in the face of the only advice the Government got from its consultants.  The PwC report commissioned by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government recommended against a multi-utility model on the basis of international experience that found this approach had been unsuccessful elsewhere.  The strength and associated experience of the retail side of Bord Gáis, which deals regularly with consumers, has, the Government claims, earmarked it as suitable for this massive project.  However, this is the side of the company that the Government intends to sell in the future, further exacerbating fears about the privatisation of Irish Water at some stage.  Further questions have been raised by commentators about the competency of Bord Gáis in taking on this onerous managerial responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">The conferral of price setting powers on the Commission for Energy Regulation raises another set of unanswered questions.  What additional resources will be given to the commission?  What will be the nature of the relationship between the Government and the revamped commission?  How suitable is this commission for this specific and challenging task?  What role will the National Consumer Agency have?  Rather than take heed and learn from the grave mistakes made in the all too recent past, the Minister has ploughed ahead with poorly thought out plans based on outdated figures, with little sense of the potential repercussions.  The future of water supplies in Ireland deserves and demands better.  The Minister and the Government need to answer the mounting list of questions over the future of Irish Water.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Stanley</from>
          <p eId="para_1304">I want to state in the strongest possible terms, Sinn Fein's opposition to the establishment of Irish Water and the introduction of water charges and our support for improving the existing local authority system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">The establishment of Irish Water is a Trojan horse for the installation of water meters and the imposition of water charges and lays the foundation for the full privatisation of the water sector in the future.  The basis for the Government's argument is a so-called independent report carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers.  The purpose of the research was never to improve water services for the Irish people but "to undertake an independent assessment of the transfer of responsibility for water services provision from the local authorities to a water utility", namely Irish Water.  Despite this bias, the report goes on to state: "The point has been made that universal domestic metering is a theoretical rather than a practical proposition and it is quite probable that a minority of domestic customers will continue for the foreseeable future on an unmetered basis."  It is important to note that the EU-IMF requirement does not mention metering.  The intention of the Government is that Irish Water be established as a State owned subsidiary of Bord Gáis Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">Meanwhile Sierra Support Services, a Siteserv plc company, has secured a contract worth up to €60 million to become the sole services provider for the installation, maintenance and testing of domestic boilers to Bord Gáis Éireann.  Siteserv was sold to businessman Denis O'Brien recently.  This raises serious questions about who will receive the contract for the installation and maintenance of more than 1 million water meters.  We are led to believe that these meters will require regular maintenance and recalibration.  Like SIPTU, we have concerns that the proposal to move 4,000 workers from their current positions in local authorities into a new utility will mean redundancies and a further loss of experience, intelligence, knowledge and talent.  This is echoed in the PwC report.  It stated that when Irish Water has fully taken over all water services from the local authorities, in 2018, employee numbers will be significantly lower than the 4,278 deployed today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">In its drive to establish Irish Water, the Government continues to spin myths about water charges and water meters.  Myth number one is that the public gets water for free.  This is untrue. The people already pay for their water through direct and indirect taxation.  The introduction of separate water charges is an attempt to get the public to pay for water twice, once in their taxes and a second time through the water meter.  This is unfair and regressive double taxation.  The second myth is that all other citizens in the EU pay water charges.  This is simply not true.  In the North, we had a situation where the Sinn Féin Minister in the Assembly resisted introducing water charges, despite attempts by Westminister to impose water charges.  People in the North do not pay the £600 average water charge on top of household and council charges people pay in England.</p>

          <p eId="para_1311">The Government would have us believe that water metering reduces consumption.  This is untrue.  In England, where water metering has been in place for many years, consumption is at 158 litres per day per head of population while in Dublin the consumption is 148 litres per day even taking into account all the leaks.  It transpires that one third of households in Dublin cannot be installed with meters and this is also the case in many parts of the country for various reasons.  If water meters equal water conservation then the Minister will have to deal with a serious problem.  According to that logic, one third of homes in the capital will have no incentive to conserve water because a flat rate will have no impact on water conservation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">The establishment of Irish Water and the introduction of water meters was brought through the Houses of the Oireachtas in the most underhanded way.  The working group has yet to report.  The report on the water sector still remains in draft form and is not available to the media.  Yet, Cabinet members have been commenting on and promoting the introduction of water charges.  I participated fully in that working group and I made a detailed submission with ten solution-based recommendations.  However, I am now left with no option but to resign from that working group because the process has been undermined.  The work of the group has been undermined by the spin doctors and by the Cabinet.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">We in Sinn Féin fully understand the challenge that lies ahead for the water sector.  However, rather than dealing with the challenge of getting water to those who need it, this Government has used the water crisis as an opportunity to promote its right wing agenda of charging ordinary people for the use of something they already own and for which they pay with their taxes.  Unfortunately, the Labour Party has moved from actively opposing water charges before the election to becoming cheerleaders for this form of double taxation.  Our approach is different.  It is based on ensuring that water provision remains in public ownership and paid for through progressive taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">We propose two simple but immediately effective planning recommendations.  We recommend the introduction of rainwater harvesting in new buildings to reduce water consumption by one third.  Dual flush toilets should be mandatory in new buildings and in replacement buildings.  This would reduce personal consumption by nearly 20 litres a day and would not incur extra costs for the taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">This Government would be far better off investing money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to create real jobs that will have a positive legacy.  The money being wasted on meters should be invested in upgrading an ageing, leaking water distribution system.  The Minister and the Taoiseach stated in the House last week that 2,000 jobs will be created and this is to be welcomed.  In my view, the money wasted on the installation of water meters should be invested in the upgrading of the ageing water system and in the repair of leaks in the distribution system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">Currently the water sector is managed by the 34 local authorities.  The move to Irish Water will not improve accountability or governance.  Local authorities are accountable to their communities.  They are able to meet local demands and can provide solutions to local crises and emergencies.  This was proved in the harsh winters of 2010 and 2011 when the local authorities responded better than the response of the single utility company in the North and which is more than an arm's length from government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">Like SIPTU, Sinn Féin is concerned that the proposal to move 4,000 workers from local authorities into Irish Water will mean redundancies and a further loss of experience and talent.  This is echoed in the PWC report which states "...when Irish Water has fully taken over all water services from the local authorities in 2018, numbers will be significantly lower than the 4,278 deployed today".</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">The PWC report highlights the strengths of the current structure:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1319">Services are managed by bodies that are close to customers and are democratically elected.  Water sector development can be consistent with Local Authority Development Plans; [They have] an experienced local workforce; Central co-ordination and prioritisation; Track record of successful delivery of capital projects and providing continuity of service, delivering to a growing population; Clear accountability for water and wastewater quality; Ability to mobilise local resources at times of need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">Sinn Féin believes that the current governance arrangements are sufficient for managing the service, albeit with considerable improvements.  It is to be hoped this can be achieved through local government reform.  A single utility is not the best or most cost-effective way to manage the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">As regards democratic accountability, if I wish to contact Bord Gáis, I can ring a call centre at 1890 312 312.  This is what will face Deputies and county councillors.  This will be the level of interaction.  Nowhere can we find details of how Irish Water will be financed or how much it will cost to establish.  Current reports are based on nothing more than assumptions.  The PWC report for the Department states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1322">The funding requirement is an estimate of what the utility will need to support its activities.  Our scope of work does not specifically include the evaluation of how that funding requirement should be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323">Sinn Féin calls for the establishment of a national water sector framework team overseeing governance of the water sector and capital investment for the sector.  It would be composed of city and country managers and be convened and chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324">According to the Irish Academy of Engineering, the cost of meter installation will be at least €500 million.  This €500 million would fund the water conservation strategy for six years.  It would be far more appropriate to invest the €500 million in water conservation rather than meter installation, thus saving water and public money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325">Sinn Féin supports the introduction of district metering as opposed to installing domestic water meters in every household.  This is already in place in a number of local authorities and is cheaper and more effective in monitoring usage and identifying leaks.  In County Laois it will be fully rolled out this year.  A water keeper from the Minister's county identifies the leaks very quickly.  He has an efficient method for identifying leaks in the system.  It is not the householder but the water distribution network that is the biggest culprit when it comes to water waste.  The State's water distribution network is antiquated.  In some local authority areas up to 60% is leaking away.  Capital investment in water has been cut by nearly €200 million since 2010 to €331 million in 2012, with more cuts planned until the budget is reduced to just €266 million.  With average leakage at a staggering 41%, there needs to be an increased level of capital spending on the State's water infrastructure.  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government must return to at least the 2011 level of capital spending.  There needs to be a Government-sponsored drive towards water metering in the context of overall Government policy.  When poverty levels and income distribution in Ireland are taken into account, it is obvious that water charges have a greater impact on low income households and their budgets.  Water charges must be considered within the context of the other additional costs faced by householders such as a flat rate household charge of €100; septic tank charges; an increase in the carbon levy of €5<i> </i>per tonne; a reduction in the fuel allowance from 32 weeks to 26 weeks; a 2% VAT increase.  In England the cost of water for a household is £600.  While the Minister’s proposals are focused on the domestic householder there is no mention of the debt owed by the commercial sector where only 52% of water rates are collected.  It appears that household are being penalised for the lack of building regulations, leaking pipes and poor governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326">The Government and the local authorities must take action on the outstanding water rates owed to the State by the commercial sector.  The crisis facing water supply does not start or finish at the Border.  Recognising that river basin districts cover both sides of the Border, it is essential that there is co-ordination of the water sector.  We need to develop an all-Ireland strategy on water provision.  There is a requirement on both the Northern Assembly and the Government to collaborate on the delivery of services where shared resources, joint capital investment in infrastructure and procurement, among other matters, on an all-Ireland basis, would clearly prove beneficial.</p>
          <p eId="para_1327">The establishment of Irish Water along with the imposition of water meters and water charges is at best ill-thought out and at worst is driven by Fine Gael's right wing agenda and supported by a limp Labour Party.  The Government fails to realise the level of anger that exists on this issue.  Water charges will be opposed at every opportunity both here in Leinster House and out in the community.  A wide range of charges have been imposed and people are at breaking point.  Water meters and water charges will be resisted every inch of the way by Sinn Féin and the general public.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_1330">I have so many points to make and so little time.  The Minister tries to portray the reform of water services delivery as harmless but we can demonstrate that the analysis on which the proposition is based is fundamentally flawed and the service will be enormously costly to the State and individual taxpayers.  While I have no problem with this debacle being the Minister's historical legacy, there are far greater issues at stake.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331">The decision to set up Irish Water was based on analysis which local authority engineers have described as containing significant errors, omissions and inappropriate comparisons of such significance that the conclusions reached could not possibly be valid.  They have demonstrated that PricewaterhouseCoopers produced its evidence for a comparison with Scottish Water based on completely wrong information.  They claim that the Irish water pipe network was 25,000 km long but the reality is that it is closer to 50,000 km long.  They claimed that 1,634 staff were involved in Scottish Water compared to the Irish context of approximately 4,000 staff when the reality is that the staff employed in Scottish Water, as per its annual report, is revealed to be 3,703.  We have had an analysis accepted by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government which states that the process and the trend has been away from municipal control in this area when the facts indicate the opposite is the case – 85% of water provision across Europe is under the control of municipal authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332">I do not have the time to debate these points but the reality is that the expertise and staff are based and organised in 34 local authorities.  They are the people on the ground, the water and sewerage caretakers, along with the local authority engineers.  The Minister, in his proposal to establish Irish Water intends to fundamentally disrupt that operation.  Not only that, but the PricewaterhouseCoopers report leaves out of the equation areas such as boundary issues, septic tanks, surface water drainage, planning and agriculture run-offs among other areas.  They have not been addressed in the proposed reform.  We will have a scenario where the profitable areas of water provision are hived off to Irish Water and the rest will be left with the local authorities to handle as they see fit.  It is clearly going to be an incredibly unsatisfactory situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">I take issue with the Minister on a couple of points.  The first point, that we are the only country that does not charge for water services, is totally and utterly false.  The Minister has some neck to come to the House and accuse the Irish people of getting something for nothing when it is recognised in the European Union that we have a derogation on water because we have paid for it through our central taxation and indirect taxation – the highest indirect taxation throughout Europe.  The fact that the Government has chosen to take some of the money we have paid and use it to pay the private debts of banks, which is not really our problem, and to come back and ask us to pay again under the guise of water conservation is quite simply a con that Irish people are not going to fall for.  The reason we are not is because we can demonstrate factually – Engineers Ireland and others will back us up in that regard – that the Minister's statement that significant reductions take place where water meters are installed is quite frankly absolute and utter rubbish which does not stand up to any independent scrutiny whatsoever.  It has been demonstrated that domestic water meters can at best initially reduce consumption by on average 10%.  Comparisons between Ireland and Britain where water is metered reveal a reduction of closer to 6%.  Domestic water consumption is 16% of the total water used in society.  Therefore, 6% of 16% is a reduction of less than 1%.  The Minister proposes to spend more than €1 billion of taxpayers money which he then wants to impose on us in installation charges on our bills to save less than 1% of the water supply when one has a system in operation where, on average, 41% of the water supply leaks back into the ground.  If this reform was about conservation the Minister would be fixing the pipes, dealing with the water that is unaccounted for and implementing rainwater harvesting programmes in schools and public buildings.  That is not what the game is about; this is about a stealth tax.  The Minister has not learned the lessons of the household tax.  We can guarantee him that if he thought the opposition to the household tax was significant then he has seen absolutely nothing yet with this one.</p>

I am surprised that there are no officials accompanying the Minister.  I do not know what is going on in the Department.  The Minister does not know himself.  The officials are rarely seen with him.  He is a one-man show.  His backbench colleagues told me some months ago that he was the man; that he would introduce a household charge and a septic tank charge.  He had it all done, but now instead of being called the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, he would be more aptly described as the Minister for confusion, persecution of homeowners and disbandment of local government.  The Minister has had a long and distinguished career in the Dáil, much longer than I have, but he seems to want to change the world and to create confusion.  He also seems to want to sabotage Labour Party conferences because the leaks that emerged that weekend caused huge angst to his so-called colleagues in government.  He does not respect them.  How could he when he does not respect anyone?  I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, is present because he has been on programmes and he has come across as sane, civil – I do not say the Minister is not sane – I am not suggesting that-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1345">Has the Minister ever heard of proper planning involving rainwater harvesting?  That is what the Minister should be looking at in the Department.  It was part of the plans envisaged by the former Minister, Mr. Gormley, that rainwater would be harvested in tanks and used by households and schools.  A retrofit programme is required to harvest rainwater for two and three classroom schools so that all the water could be kept, except for drinking water.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">I know what it costs to produce water.  I am not against charging for water.  It is a huge cost to provide clean, uncontaminated and fully treated water.  It should not be used for washing cars, yards, roofs or other such things.  We must have regard and respect for water.  Metering will probably help the situation in that regard.  However, I object to the money involved and to handing over responsibility to Bord Gáis.  I thank my own local authority area, South Tipperary County Council, for its excellent submission to the Department.  I hope the Minister has read it.  He probably has not given that he did not take the submissions on the septic tank issue.  However, it did make a submission to him.  I thank the county council also for the way in which it maintains the water system, provides water and fixes leaks.  There is an excellent team led in recent years by Aidan Fennessey.  From my days on the county council I understand that a meter has been fitted for the past 12 years for every new water connection or every time there is a water leak.  Are they all going to be dumped now?  What kind of backwards-thinking country do we have that they could not be modified and made suitable?</p>
          <p eId="para_1347">I wish I had much more time.  Bord na Móna and Bord Gáis were lobbying strongly for the administration of the water service.  Why does it have to be the preserve of such people?  I wish to see ordinary people, contractors and plumbers getting the work on the ground, not big conglomerates who might be friends of the Minister that he might meet on golf courses.  I do not frequent such places.  I refer to the K Club and other such places and some place in Kerry where the Minister was caught for intemperate language.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348">This is a fine mess the Minister has created again.  We should call him the messy Minister because what he is doing is not necessary.  I agree with water metering but I object to the Minister's cavalier attitude.  An important referendum is coming up.  I said to the Taoiseach the other day that he should send the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to a foreign country on a six week long trip to return when the referendum is over, otherwise it will be lost because they annoy the people.  They are like a nest of wasps which one wants to kick out of one's way.  They belittle the people.  It ill behoves the Minister, Deputy Hogan, who has been in the House for a long time.  He is elected by the people of Kilkenny whom I am sure we will meet on the hurling field before the year is out and we will play them fair and square.  The Minister does not play fair and square here.  He uses bully-boy tactics which are unacceptable to me.  While I am here I will be keeping watch on the Minister.

          <p eId="para_1352">Unfortunately five minutes will not be enough.  Ireland has more than 5,000 lakes, 7,000 km of coastline, a network of rivers and streams spanning the country and high levels of rainfall with an average of 150 days of rainfall in the east and south east and an average of 225 days of rainfall in parts of the west.  This should result in an abundance of easily sourced and available clean water.  What people do not understand is why we have not harvested this.  Local authorities are constantly stuck with water shortages in winter and summer and water quality issues.  The local authorities in the greater Dublin region propose to extract water from the Shannon and pump it to the Dublin region.  We are told the water levels in the region are on a knife edge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">According to figures sourced from the All-Island Research Observatory at NUI Maynooth in my constituency, 42.4% of supplied water in Ireland is unaccounted for.  The average figure in developing countries is 35%; in the UK it is 19.2%; and in European countries it is 15%.  Our best local authority is South Dublin County Council which manages to lose only 20.89% while in Kerry, which is the worst, the figure is 59.81%.  This is expensive treated water.  The figure for my county of Kildare is 28% which is the fourth best.  Our drinking water quality is far from perfect with the Environmental Protection Agency indicating that 15.3% of groundwater is of poor quality, 10.4% of rivers are of poor or bad quality and 24% of lakes are of poor or bad quality.  It is extremely unlikely that we will comply with the water framework directive in 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">It is a matter of fact that many of our pipelines contain asbestos and lead which is unbelievable.

          <p eId="para_1358">It is not hard to see why people would be opposed to the installation of meters for a system that wastes 42% of the product it is supposed to deliver.  This means 42% never gets to a tap.  We are discussing establishing an agency that will operate as a business and will be allowed to bill people and which will inherit this level of wastage.  Would the Minister of State pay for something if this was the quality of service?  One can understand why people feel aggrieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359">I support the idea of conserving water but the way the Government has gone about it is backwards.  It is exactly the same as the household charge.  Essentially the Government will start the same war with the local authorities as was the case in the 1980s and 1990s and I know what that was like.  Week after week water was cut off.  I know what this means and it takes years to repair the damage with a public agency when this approach is taken.  It looks like we will establish HSE 2 and there will be a layer of Teflon between the Government and the delivery agency.  The regulator will be the one to decide on the free allowance.  I am not opposed to charging for waste but it must be those who are wasting water who are charged or penalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360">Will the Minister of State give us a guarantee that if we end up out of the bailouts in 2018 or 2019 and must begin paying €5 billion a year to the lenders and they start scratching around looking for something saleable that this will not be for sale?  I do not believe the Minister of State can give such a guarantee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">We need to reach a point where we have a proper local government system.  We have damaged the prospect of this with the household charge.  We need to have a rational debate on the provision of water.  Many local authorities have collected development levies.  They have liabilities.  How will these be handled if there is a transfer?  Large amounts of money in development contributions cannot be spent at local government level.  Deputies Clare Daly and Luke Flanagan and I are members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht and we have been trying to put together a report and meet experts in a range of fields.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government  (Deputy Fergus O’Dowd)</from>
          <p eId="para_1365">This is a very important debate.  We are arranging for the implementation programme to be debated by the committee as soon as it is available so that every member of the Oireachtas who wishes will have an opportunity to go through all of the issues in an open-ended way.  There will be no time limit on that debate such as there is on this one.  It is important to discuss the issues and answer all of the questions Deputies have and to put questions to them also on value for money, on whether we want to conserve our water as Deputy Murphy rightly and properly argued and on the vision the Minister, Deputy Hogan, has for the future of our water services and the country's capacity and ability to be the best in Europe in terms of reducing waste water.  We must repair the leaks and pipes and get water to the greater Dublin area so the region has the ability to meet future domestic and commercial demands.</p>
          <p eId="para_1366">The recent census report for the north-east where I live shows Drogheda is the biggest town in the country with Dundalk being slightly smaller.  There has been massive growth in the region north of the greater Dublin area.  If we are to sustain this we must have the infrastructure in place.  Our vision is to be the best in Europe.  We are not standing back or resiling from this.  We want to ensure we have the capacity to deliver water.  Water intensive industries such as agriculture and pharmaceutical and chemical industries are coming to this country.  They need water and we want to be the best place to supply it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367">Within the past month I was in England where there is a drought in the Anglia area.  We have significant advantages in terms of being water rich if we can stop the waste and ensure places that do not have the capacity to deliver the water required by 2020 will have it as a result of what we do.  This is about the big picture and the big issues we must face.  Deputy Murphy's home county of Kildare has the lowest charge for commercial water in the country at €1.50.</p>

          <p eId="para_1369">I know.  My point is that in the county beside it the same volume of water costs €3.52.  We need to address all of these issues and have a uniform system of charging that is acceptable to everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_1370">It would make no sense if water in Wicklow was twice as expensive as water in Kildare.  In terms of value for money, the average cost nationally of 1,000 litres of water is €2.52.  Members will be aware that it costs €2.50 for one litre, or less, of water in a pub or hotel.  Households and places of business are currently provided with 1,000 litres of water for the same amount.</p>
          <p eId="para_1371">I want now to reply to some of the issues raised.  I refer Members to an article in the <i> Irish Independent </i> of Friday 11 December 2009 which reports the late Brian Lenihan as saying that domestic water fees would apply from 2011 and that work in this regard would cost €600 million over two years.  There is nothing new for Fianna Fáil in what the Government is doing.  This must be and will be done, but it will be fair.  The price will be set by the regulator and the free allowance will be decided by Government.  </p>

This will cost €600 million over the next number of years.  We will ensure that every county and town has the volume of water it requires.  The recent Environmental Protection Agency report identified a number of areas where waste water - about which we have not yet spoken - is a problem, in respect of which we are incurring significant costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1395">The Government will ensure transparency in this process.  There will be no charge, in terms of cost of water to home, until 2014 and a free allowance, to be decided by Government, will be provided.  We will ensure that we have the best water infrastructure and that - I have a commitment on this - when the implementation programme is to hand, possibly six to eight weeks time, there will be a full and proper debate on this issue at the committee on the environment in an effort to satisfy, in as much as it is possible to satisfy, all arguments in an open and transparent manner.  We will take on board any constructive views offered.  This debate is the start of that process.</p>

          <p eId="para_1399">I would like to make a few brief observations on the recent debacle on this issue.  Previous speakers have outlined their concerns in regard to the manner in which the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government handled the introduction of previous charges, including the household and septic tank charges, both of which were a total fiasco.  As such, there are grave reservations in terms of its ability to handle the introduction of this charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1400">I welcome that the Government conceded to a debate on this issue.  If this were really about water conservation we would be talking about capital investment to upgrade the water network countrywide.  The majority of water lost is not lost on route to households rather it is lost in the network.  We should be discussing rain water harvesting in public buildings, schools, hotels and so on.  This water charge is another opportunity for Government to generate finance.  The Government is, in terms of its proposed appointment of a regulator to oversee this service, abdicating its responsibility.  Who will decide the free allowance and what charges will be paid?</p>
          <p eId="para_1401">Before imposing further charges on hard pressed families the Government should be looking at where cost savings can be achieved.  The McCarthy report has been lying on a Minister's desk for the past couple of years without action.  The Government could achieve its €500 million savings by implementing the McCarthy report rather than imposing further charges on hard pressed families.  Families cannot handle any more charges.  We do not know what the charge will be or who will set the rate?  I hope this will be done by Government, the members of which have been democratically elected by the people.  I abhor that this and the previous Government handed over the decision making process to bureaucratic regulators.  We must put a halt to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1402">The Croke Park Agreement provides that there can be no compulsory redundancies in the public sector.  The Minister of State referred earlier to the 4,000 exceptionally skilled personnel working in the water services throughout the length and breadth of this country.  What will happen to these staff when the new entity takes over?  I call on the Government to implement the McCarthy report in order to achieve the savings required.</p>

          <p eId="para_1403">I thank Deputy Troy for sharing time with me.  It is obvious the Government is trying to hide behind Bord Gáis and the new water board.  In the past, the HSE was established to allow the Government to hide behind that organisation.  No member of the Government has referred to the excellent service that has been given by water men throughout this country over the years.  I am not talking about the suit-wearing engineers inside in their offices when I talk about the tradition of excellent service.  I am talking about the men who go out on Christmas Day or at Easter time to fix water leaks.  These men go out during the holidays and on Sundays.  They know exactly where every pipe is.  They know the network inside out.  Are we going to rob ourselves of that type of expertise?</p>

If they want to conserve water, as they suggest, why do they not ensure the leaks are fixed before anything else is done?  For every gallon of water that goes into a house, half a gallon is probably lost through leaks.  Is it not obvious?  When we talk about this whole debacle, we have to reflect on the uncertainty, misinformation and confusion associated with it.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, who is in charge of it, is fumbling from one disaster to another.  The Government put the wrong man in charge of this project.  The Minister should be taken away from it.  If he touched gold, it would turn to dust.  I want to voice my complete opposition to what the Government is doing.  It is making a mess of our water service.  It is changing something that was not actually broken.  All that is wrong with the delivery of water in Ireland is that there are too many leaks.  If they are fixed, everything else will be fine.</p>

          <p eId="para_1412">When the Government parties were in opposition, I agreed with them when they spoke about the regulators in this country.  They said there were too many quangos of one kind or another, but now they have decided to give responsibility for this system to a regulator.  We need to look at what the regulator will do.  According to the Minister of State, the regulator will decide on the rate and the Government, in turn, will set the charge.  When the regulator considers the costs, it will find that 40% of treated water - twice the OECD average - is going to waste.  The regulator will learn that this country invested €2 billion in the water system between 2000 and 2010.  One can take it that 40% of the €2 billion that was invested has gone to waste.  There is no mapping system outside Dublin in terms of the pipes and so on.  We know the system itself is not fit for purpose.  Unless money is provided for infrastructure, the regulator will have to consider the cost of upgrading and ensuring treated water does not go to waste to the current extent.  The Minister mentioned what happens in County Wicklow.</p>

I would like a business plan to be put in place.  The Government should evaluate the profitability or otherwise of a €3 rate per cubic metre of water, based on the "water in, water out" principle.

They will have to go after, in a very aggressive way, those in the commercial world who are using water.  By extension, they will have to go after the householders who do not pay.  That leads one to ask who will be cut off.  Bord Gáis has cut off the supply of more customers more than most companies.</p>

When the legislation is published and the service agreement with Bord Gáis or the new company is drawn up, I will be looking to see the Government's policy in relation to the regulator.  The manner in which that policy will be applied to the domestic situation in this country will be critical when the deal is being done.  The Government might argue that the household charge is just €2 a week, but we all know people who are in such dire straits they cannot afford it.  How far has the Government gone in its discussions with the staff involved?  The Minister of State said 4,000 people are working in this area.  According to the report, the figure is 3,600.  It is broken down into different grades.</p>

          <p eId="para_1424">They cannot be moved on.  Will those who do not want to leave the county councils be put back into that system in some other way?  That is a critical aspect of all this because such an approach would add further costs to a local government system that has already been badly costed and represents poor value for money.  That is the issue.  Deputy Troy asked why the current Government and previous Governments have always gone after taxpayers and householders aggressively.  Governments are not keen to apply the same aggression to achieving a reduction in the costs on the other side, in this instance, the cost of local government.  If the Government implements the McCarthy report, it will save approximately €520 million and will not need to collect the €160 million it is looking for under the household scheme, for example.  I appreciate they are two different issues, but the principle is the same.  The Government simply will not go after the inefficiencies in the system.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanFarrell" eId="spk_525">
          <from>Deputy Alan Farrell</from>
          <p eId="para_1425">I welcome the Government's decision to provide for an early discussion on this matter.  In light of some of the scaremongering tactics of recent weeks, it is relevant for us to debate this issue, get information into the public domain and begin this long-term process.  It is readily acknowledged that it will take months, if not years, to roll out this system.  The enormity of the task facing the Government will not stand in the way of its ambition to provide for considerable investment in this infrastructure and this long-term project, which will need to be worked out on a phased basis.  It is a marathon, not a sprint.  As a nation, we need to acknowledge the reality that a great deal of information will emerge at different stages between now and 2014, so that we are prepared to handle the emerging details in a constructive and balanced fashion.  We would love to have the all the answers here and now.  I agree with some of what other speakers have said about information.  One of the difficulties faced by this Government is that it has to deal with agreements that were made by the previous Administration.  In many cases, nothing happened after the agreement was reached and before this Government took office in March 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_1426">In light of the substantial changes that have to be made on a societal level, it is not too early to start bringing people on board with regard to this issue.  Up to this point, most of our people have never been asked to pay for water on a utility basis.  Paying for water usage is no different from paying for a utility such as gas or electricity so we can light and heat our homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1427">However, this is an extraordinary development, taking place in extraordinary times.  I do not take this enormous shift in the perspective of the people for granted.  I am very confident that my constituents in Dublin North are, in no uncertain terms, fully aware of the impact of the failure of successive Governments to invest in the water service network.  This week alone, I have received numerous emails from Fingal County Council regarding water shut-downs in the area.  From a consumer perspective, this is an enormous problem.  From the taxpayer's perspective, it is completely unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1428">During the election campaign, it was quite clear that water charges were coming down the line.  Charging was in our party's manifesto, and had already been agreed to in the national recovery plan and troika agreement laid out by the former Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government.  However, we acknowledge this is perhaps the most difficult time to introduce a discussion on a new utility bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1429">If this economic crisis has taught us anything, it is not to take anything for granted.  If we identify waste, we must address it.  We cannot just turn a blind eye because that is the easy thing to do.  Taxpayers have forked out over a billion annually for a substandard water system.  As well documented, 40% of the water we pay for is lost through leaks.  If this were true for the gas, oil or electricity network, we would be making international headlines.</p>
          <p eId="para_1430">Ireland is the last country in the eurozone to take responsibility for its usage of the water resource.  It is one of the many wasteful legacies of the Celtic tiger, during which we allowed our money to be poured down the drain on bad infrastructure when we had the means to invest in something for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1431">Let me refer to an email I received this afternoon from a senior staff officer in Fingal County Council with regard to three areas in Dublin North.  The issue affects approximately 20,000 homes.  The email states that, on Rath Lane in the Swords area, water was to be restored in seven minutes but has been unavailable since early morning.  In the Baldolyle area, in Stapolin , Grange Park, Castlerosse and Red Arches – I refer to a part of the Dublin North-East constituency which is still in Fingal – the water was restored at 3.30 p.m. this afternoon having been unavailable for almost six hours.  In Ballough, in the northern Lusk area and north of Swords, a very large area was without water for most of the morning due to the third or fourth breach in the mains in as many weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1432"><b>  </b>As it stands, there are 36 different approaches to the provision of water in this country, that is, one in each local authority.  If we are to justify such vast expenditure, we must change our approach to a unified, financially efficient process.  The industry must become a properly regulated industry in respect of which the end user, the customer, can have legitimate expectations regarding service quality and delivery.  Thus, if there are extenuating circumstances leading to water stoppages in years to come, the consumer can, in conjunction with the regulator, call for services to be restored.</p>
          <p eId="para_1433">There was a system failure on the part of the previous Government in that it failed to invest in water infrastructure.  It is not helpful to use scare tactics and misleading figures continually.  Deputy Collins used a number of figures for water charges, ranging widely from €100 to €700 or €800.  I cannot imagine these charges being incurred in a home in which people are conscious they have to pay for water exceeding a certain generous quota, as has been stated repeatedly by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, for over a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1434">Under the Fine Gael-Labour Government, we are attempting to reinvent the State.  The provision of a unified and efficient water network is a significant shift that will reflect a new era of infrastructure, one that is responsible for its usage, mindful of our environmental impact and respectful of the value of its resources.  Irish Water, or Uisce Éireann, will be established with this ethos in mind.  It is one of the infrastructural developments undertaken by this Government and will create up to 2,000 jobs per annum, attract investment and bring us into line with our European counterparts.  This will be a commodity company that will work for homes, businesses and the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1435">The previous Administration entered into an agreement but it failed abysmally to honour it on behalf of the State.  As repeated by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, we want the best water system in Europe.  There is no reason we cannot achieve that.  We are the best in the world at so many things that there is no reason we cannot aspire to this also.</p>
          <p eId="para_1436">We cannot continue to live with a substandard water network, reliant on fragmented structures unable to achieve economies of scale.  I am happy I can say to my constituents, who put up with water shortages three or four times a year, that this Government has, in a relatively short period since taking office, started the ball rolling in an attempt to address this problem.  That is more than the previous Administrations ever achieved in their lifetimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1437">We have no choice but to do this in the most effective and resourceful way possible.  It is a mammoth challenge for both householders and the Government.  I call on the Department to provide the public with as much information as possible throughout this entire process over the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1438">Water meters will be a reality, regardless of unhelpful scaremongering that creates anxiety for householders and endorses the same wasteful practices that have brought us to this point.  I hope practical policies will win out over those seeking political gain.</p>
          <p eId="para_1439">Water is essential and we are not in the business of cutting off vital services to those who cannot afford it.  Bord Gáis has been selected as the provider of the new service due to its proven record dealing with customers in financial difficulty.  If we are to clarify one thing at this point, it is that there is an important distinction between those who cannot pay and who will not pay.  Those who cannot pay will not be left without water.  Those who can afford the bill and choose not to pay will be addressed accordingly and this is the right approach if we are to respect those who pay their bills and obey the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1440">When I was a councillor in the Malahide electoral ward of Fingal County Council, I was on the audit committee of the local authority for two years, having been Mayor of Fingal in 2007 and 2008.  One of the startling figures that was presented to the audit committee was that Fingal had 300 km of pipes that required replacement.  We should bear in mind that Fingal is a very new area by comparison with towns without a large number of new houses.  Some 300 km of piping required replacement.  It cost Fingal County Council approximately €30 million to replace 10 km of the water network in the preceding five years.  My figures are based on recollection.  If they are correct, it would take decades to replace the network that needs to be replaced, never mind pipes that fail in the meantime, the asbestos pipes that were installed in the 1970s or wooden pipes that were found in the Swords area two or three years ago.  That is the scale of the difficulty we face.</p>

          <p eId="para_1441">Water is one of the most vital resources and we are obliged to ensure its protection.  Sinn Féin is opposed to the introduction of water charges as a solution.  Charging will only act as an extra tax.  This comes at a time when so many families are struggling on a daily basis to ensure they can feed and clothe their children.  They simply cannot afford to pay yet another unjust tax with no guarantee that the revenue gathered will be directed towards the water supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_1442">The question arises as to why the water infrastructure was allowed to fall into such a bad state during the Celtic tiger years when money seemed to be available for everything.  This State had the revenue to undertake the necessary capital works to ensure water infrastructure was modernised, yet this did not happen.  During the general election, the Labour Party Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, said his party was entirely opposed to water charges.  Today, however, the Labour Party is backing this new tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_1443">A national strategy is required to deal with the need to increase capacity, the need to improve water quality and the need to repair the creaking water infrastructure that has been in place for many years.  Evidence has shown that approximately 40% of water is lost through leaks in our water system.  We fully understand the vital importance of conserving water and have made submissions on the introduction of dual flushing which, according to reports, would reduce consumption by 20 litres a day per household.  We have made several recommendations on the issue of water provision including the introduction of district metering.  This would allow for local authorities to monitor water usage and leakage at neighbourhood level.  We are opposed to household charging and, therefore, metering as a means to measure usage on this basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1444">It is evident this Government is out of touch with the public.  Citizens simply cannot afford to pay yet another charge on their household.  We in Sinn Féin believe that if this planned introduction of water meters goes ahead, it is more about the privatisation of the water sector and nothing to do with water conservation.  We will resist this unjust tax all the way.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis</from>
          <p eId="para_1445">It is clear people are struggling through a myriad of taxes, be they stealth or otherwise, which have been introduced over the past several budgets.  The previous crowd, as the Minister calls the previous Government, was also responsible for this.  The Minister's own partners in government, the Labour Party, opposed water charges right up until they entered office.  When I was on my local authority, my Labour Party colleagues made it very clear over the years that they were opposed to water charges.  People are paying enough already through taxes, VAT, PRSI and the universal social charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1446">I accept water is a precious commodity and we need to ensure adequate and safer supplies.  The leakage of water varies across the country.  An investment programme tackling this would provide a better means of preservation and job creation.  The €500 million the Government proposes to borrow from the National Pensions Reserve Fund will be paid back over several years by ordinary people through installation of water meters.  This will only add more pain to an already struggling population.</p>
          <p eId="para_1447">The move from local authority to a new semi-State company, the proposed Irish Water, is a retrograde step.  All the expertise accumulated over the years in local authorities, the ease of access to services and points of contact will all be lost.  They will be replaced by a new bureaucratic system with only some sort of a freefone service for people to access.  Water should remain in public ownership through the local authorities.  Why are we running down our local authorities?  We are taking powers away from local authorities and, in turn, local councillors will pay a price down the road.  This will lead to privatisation.  In Dublin City Council, I remember the whole argument over bin charges.  When the waiver was introduced, we were told it would stop the privatisation of bin collections.  It did not.  The allocations of water to each family will be whittled down over time.  When the Minister's party is no longer in government------</p>

          <p eId="para_1451">Dublin city will face problems with water supply.  From what everyone is saying, it will have to be sourced from the Shannon.  This will involve significant costs and the expertise with the local authorities.</p>

In the absence of any clarity from the Government, that is bound to happen.  We have had no clarity on the funding model, the charges, the free allowance or even the criteria to be used to ascertain the free allowance.  The Minister referred to a conservative estimate of a 10% reduction in water usage.  He has, however, provided no research to back this up.  If he has, I have certainly not seen it.  In his speech, the only research he could produce to justify that 10% estimate was in a reference to RTE's "The Consumer Show" in which a family of five reduced its water usage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1453">Ireland compares to Manchester in population size.  Water meters have been in place in Manchester for over 20 years and 152 litres per person per day is used there.

          <from>Deputy Kevin Humphreys</from>
          <p eId="para_1466">It is a pity Deputy Ellis has left the House, as I remember debating in favour of water charges while I was a member of Dublin City Council.  He has a selective memory.  He should also remember he did not pay his bin charges, a decision that probably led to the privatisation of the city's bin services.  Recently, he informed the House he still has not paid them despite his enormous salary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1467">I welcome the establishment of Irish Water and the Minister's clear commitment to the effect that it will be a semi-State company on a statutory footing and will not be privatised.  Building up a proper water infrastructure is crucial to Ireland.  Deputy McGuinness described a level of investment, but there was underinvestment for 15 years.  Our water services are disastrous.  Doing nothing is not an option.  It is unfortunate the Deputy has departed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1468">Much of this situation has to do with the abolition of rates and the lack of strategic planning for a proper service.  We have ended up with a patchwork system that has not received enough investment or been subject to proper planning.  This is the legacy with which we have been left.  Consider the most recent two winters when many areas of Dublin went without water for weeks.  This situation is no longer viable.  The capital and the Dublin region operate on a 1% margin.  In fact, they run a deficit from Monday to Friday and build up a surplus at the weekend.  City regions are drivers of employment and investment and we will not be able to attract foreign direct investment, FDI, if we do not invest in this regard.  We need a sustainable investment model.  Supply shortages in Dublin must be addressed soon.  Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned how County Kildare was a high usage area.  Even if we wanted to attract another Intel to the Dublin region, we would not have the requisite water supply.  Consider the thousands of jobs involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1469">People refer to austerity, but we need a sustainable infrastructure to provide jobs.  We must adopt a strategic approach to water.  The development of a properly regulated and resourced new utility company is the best and cheapest approach.  Irish Water will be a sustainable model.</p>
          <p eId="para_1470">Deputy Troy mentioned how we did not know how much leakage there was between the mains and the door, but we do.  It is 18%.  This is on record.  If we fix every leak in the country without addressing that problem, we will still lose 18%.  When every mains pipe in a small area in the Dublin region - the Merrion Road area - was replaced, there was still a high leakage rate.  The cause was subjected to further investigation and is now on record.  Two or three houses were using up to ten or 15 times the average amount of water.  This problem was addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1471">We must work in partnership with residents when addressing leaks.  Given that we are considering metering and upgrading the infrastructure, it may be possible to give grants to fix leaks while workers are in the area.  The possibility of 2,000 jobs has been mentioned.  These should be given to young people.  Under EU regulations, sectors with high rates of unemployment can be targeted, and there is a high rate among young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1472">Doing nothing is not an option.  Every Deputy who has contributed agrees we cannot continue as we have been.  However, we cannot use all the money to fix the leaks.  If we do not set up a sustainable method of funding that work, we will revert to the same position in ten or 15 years time because of the lack of constant servicing.  There needs to be a revenue stream as well as ongoing infrastructural repairs, upgrades and investments.  Water gives us an economic advantage and we need to make the best we can out of it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin</from>
          <p eId="para_1473">The announcement of a new water body came as no surprise.  As a Deputy, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government communicated to me about a consultation period that would end on 24 February and would seek submissions from the public.  I engaged with my constituents and received a number of submissions.  Until recently, there has been a conversation with the public concerning the potential of a water charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1474">This debate gives the House an opportunity to discuss water conservation and reinvestment in water infrastructure.  It also gives us an opportunity to have a new maturity in Ireland about the connectivity between taxation and local services.  As Deputy Kevin Humphreys correctly stated, this connectivity was broken in 1977.  Since then, people have not seen any connectivity between the taxes they pay and the services they receive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1475">We need a level of vision.  People will not accept it if we tell them they will pay for something that will not improve.  There is a significant water pressure problem in my constituency.  For two winters in a row, many areas in Dublin suffered water shortages due to freezing temperatures.  There have been boil notices in places like Galway and Ennis.  Everyone knows about the system's level of leakages.</p>
          <p eId="para_1476">As Deputy Kevin Humphreys stated, it is difficult to attract FDI to my city while this situation persists.  How can people be convinced to spend a weekend break in Dublin at Christmas if they cannot be assured of getting water from taps?  The local authority system has depended almost completely on the commercial sector and schools to pay water rates.  This is not sustainable and I welcome the proposal of a more realistic model, which we will be able to discuss for two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1477">I have always favoured water rates, but there is a natural nervousness among those who are not in a position to pay.  We have a responsibility to them.  Where they have high levels of domestic water usage, there must be a generous free allowance.  There must also be a recognition of areas with poor water supplies and pressures.  However, it would be crazy to stand over a system in which up to 44% of treated water is lost within the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1478">Connectivity is important.  With the best will in the world one can have all the advertisements and public information campaigns on water conservation one likes.  Unfortunately, it will not be until water is metered that conservation is likely to occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_1479">I have never believed in flat taxation on anything, be it in the form of bin charges or water rates.  I am delighted this has not been the suggestion in this instance and that there will be no upfront charge.  I also welcome that Irish Water will be a publicly owned body.</p>
          <p eId="para_1480">We must tell people we have had difficulties with the water system and this new system is a unique opportunity to get past those difficulties and to make the water system dependable and quality-assured.  People state they pay taxes for wasteful and inefficient services they do not trust.  We need to show a vision and point to this as a fantastic opportunity.  Although it stems from the memorandum of understanding, from a social democratic perspective in a mature society the imposition of a water charge is progressive because it is environmentally minded and is aimed at conserving water.</p>
          <p eId="para_1481">Connectivity between taxation and services is required.  As I believe in the public provision of essential services, including water, I would support the imposition of a charge.  If it ensures that we never have a water shortage again, that leaks are fixed and that areas of my constituency which have had diabolical water pressure for the last 100 years will finally get the water service they deserve, I will support it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1482">At its most elementary this measure is about charging people for water.  Solid arguments have been made for charging people for water but 1.6 million people in this country live in households that are left with less than €100 per month.  They are on the edge.  The Cabinet handbook states that a poverty impact assessment must be carried before implementing a measure of this nature.  However, when I tabled a parliamentary question to ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government whether an assessment had been carried, he ignored the question.</p>

          <p eId="para_1486">The Taoiseach stated he does not know the level at which the charge will be set and this morning the Minister spoke about referring the question to the regulator.  During Leaders' Questions the Taoiseach indicated that asking how much the Government planned to charge was as preposterous as announcing metro north and expecting to know the fares.  I have put together financial models for large capital projects.  The first number that one calculates is the fare and from that basis one calculates how much money should be allocated in up-front capital expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1487">Considerable confusion has arisen around Irish Water.  I welcome its creation but it will be a massive utility company employing up to 4,000 people.  We need to ensure it delivers a high quality service that provides value for money.  What do we know about it?  Instead of a competitive tendering process there was a strange, loose application and private sector entities were not given an opportunity to bid for the entire contract or even for elements of the project, such as maintenance of reservoirs or billing.  The applications from the semi-State companies do not appear to have been independently assessed.  An interdepartmental group reviewed the submissions but the Minister has refused to share the submissions from Bord Gáis and Bord na Móna with the Oireachtas.  I asked to see them but was refused on the grounds of commercial sensitivity.  If a State body is running a monopoly contract from which the private sector is explicitly excluded, there is no commercial sensitivity.  I suggest the officials are hiding behind commercial sensitivity to prevent their work from being investigated by Members of this House.  I am deeply concerned about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1488">With regard to the semi-States and whether they are the best and only bodies for this project, PwC carried out an independent assessment which found:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1489">There is limited experience of water services being combined with other utilities or roads provision... [O]n balance, PwC see no compelling reason to assign responsibility for water services provision to another State agency... PwC expect that public procurement considerations will dictate that the partner would have to be selected through a public tendering process open to the private sector as well as the State agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1490">These findings have been ignored.  I am not advocating that private sector entities should run our water company but they should at least be allowed to apply to maintain reservoirs, fix the pipes or run the call centres at a certain level of quality for a certain amount of money.  We should be able to compare what they would charge with Bord Gáis's estimates.  However, the Government will not even reveal the latter's estimate because it is supposed to be commercially sensitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1491">It is nuts to spend approximately €1 billion on meters in the current economic context.  It might make sense in a few years' time but it is crazy at present.  Labour Party Deputies made good points about conservation, water scarcity and infrastructure for job creation but I respectfully suggest that a better way of conserving water is to build additional capacity and fix the leaks rather than invest €1 billion in the ability to charge people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1492">These proposals have not been subjected to a poverty impact analysis or proper financial modelling.  There was an inhouse process without external inputs.  There is a lack of joined up thinking in terms of developing synergies between ESB's smart metering and water metering.  The absence of transparency is disappointing and in blatantly ignoring reasonable questions, the Minister has revealed a lack of accountability.</p>

          <p eId="para_1493">I believe the polluter should pay, although that depends on how one defines a polluter.  In trying to be completely holistic I am not even going to use paper in this debate so I do not damage the environment.  Other Deputies will be punished for what they have done but I will not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1494">One should start paying after one pollutes.  It appears that people will not be charged until their usage goes above a reasonable level.  This way one ensures conservation.  However, the Government is making a mistake in introducing a standing charge.  As Deputy Donnelly noted, people are put to the pin of their collars when it comes to their household budgets.  They have only €100 left at the end of the month and with increases in fuel prices and the cost of living they will not even have that much in two years' time.  The Government has a clear roadmap for preventing pollution and waste but it will scupper its own plans if it introduces a charge for those who cannot afford it regardless of whether they are polluting.  We are already paying for water through our general taxes.  Clearly the entire cost of supplying water will not be covered by the savings generated through ensuring people do not go above a certain limit but the shortfall should be made up by higher earners rather than the weak, who will otherwise be threatened with having their water turned off.</p>
          <p eId="para_1495">It was pointed out earlier that 85% of the water supplied across the European Union is administered by local authorities.  That is the best system for delivering water to end users but it will not work in Ireland as long as local government is unaccountable.  I have not heard anyone suggest that we could reduce water leakage by changing the local authority system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1496">I have had the experience of attempting to get a water leak fixed under this flawed local authority system.  As councillors have no power and the people they approach to get leaks fixed do not have to listen, a water leak approximately seven miles from my house ran like a bath for seven years.</p>

          <speech by="#AnnPhelan" eId="spk_550">
            <from>Deputy Ann Phelan</from>
            <p eId="para_1497">As this is an issue which appears to have gone below the radar, I welcome the opportunity to raise it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1498">What is the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Data Protection Commissioner and his wish to destroy all the heel-prick data cards that are older than 11 years?  This important test, in which blood is taken from the heel and stored on a card, is carried out on all babies born in Ireland.  It is used to detect six inherited disorders, including cystic fibrosis.  The test is carried out using a sample of the baby’s blood taken from the heel.  The information from these tests could be invaluable in the future identification and treatment of many diseases that have so far eluded detection.  The information stored on these cards could help isolate the reason for previously unexplained deaths, including sudden arrhythmic death syndrome which has already taken its toll on young people in this country.  It seems the Data Protection Commissioner is concerned that some data held on babies may be compromised.  This information has been collected, by means of a small blood test from newborn babies, since 1966 and has been stored, in confidence, in Temple St Hospital until July of last year.  Why were these records moved?  Who authorised moving them and where are they now?</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">The issue appears to relate to consent.  From 1966 consent was verbal and later written.  However, the storage of the screening cards was not explicitly referred to as part of consenting to the screening programme.  A review carried out in 2009 by the Data Protection Commissioner indicated that those newborn screening cards which are currently stored without explicit consent should now be disposed of.  Further, it was believed that this might breach European law on data protection.  It is now the view that these cards should be destroyed.  However, I believe there may be another approach.  If a person, whose data are stored on one of these cards, does not wish it to be viewed by anyone under any circumstances, then perhaps it should be destroyed.  However, the opposite position might apply.  Another person might believe his or her card might contain useful information and may therefore wish it to continue to be stored.  That should be the default position.  People, who do not want their details kept on record, should make it known, but for those who are happy with the current situation, the information should be kept on record, but still under the proper protections.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500">If we destroy all the information it will be gone forever.  However, if we store it within the bounds of data protection legislation with consent,  it could be accessed by those who are entitled to do so and could be used to great effect.  As this information could save lives why should we throw that away?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health  (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
            <p eId="para_1501">Following the receipt of a complaint regarding the retention of newborn screening cards, NSCs, also known as Guthrie cards, the Data Protection Commissioner, DPC, found that the retention of the NSCs without consent constituted a breach of the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003.  Following numerous meetings between the deputy Data Protection Commissioner, representatives of the Department of Health, the HSE, Cork University Hospital and Temple Street Hospital, it was agreed the NSCs older than ten years would be destroyed.  Retention for ten years was deemed appropriate for the purposes of checking an initial diagnosis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1502">The Minister, Deputy Reilly, requested the HSE to conduct a review of this decision.  The review examined the legal and ethical basis for retention of NSCs and the potential use of the existing cards for research purposes.  The report and recommendations of the review group were submitted to the Minister in January 2012.  Having carefully considered the issue, the Minister accepted the recommendation of the review group, that in order to meet our legal and ethical obligations, particularly under the Data Protection Acts, newborn screening cards older than ten years should be destroyed.  However, the Minister recognises the potential value of the material for research purposes, which was why the review group was tasked with exploring ways in which the material could be made available to the research community in a way that is compatible with our ethical and legal obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1503">The HSE will mount an information campaign offering members of the public the opportunity to have their screening cards returned to them, prior to any destruction of the cards taking place.  This will ensure that people who wish to donate their or their children's NSCs to research will be afforded the opportunity to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1504">The Minister wishes to reassure the Deputy that the cards have been always stored in Temple Street Hospital and continue to be stored there.  They have not been moved.  The proposed course of action seeks to ensure public trust and a continued willingness to participate in the national newborn screening programme, a vital public health measure for children and their families.  I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.</p>

These cards contain extremely valuable information that has been collected for years.  I would regard it as the forerunner to a volunteer database that could be very useful.  I draw the attention of the House to the importance of keeping such samples.  While I cannot give the exact detail, I recall that a number of years ago a very astute garda held on to samples from a murder scene because he believed that DNA evidence would at some stage be able to help solve crimes.  His actions resulted in that crime being solved and led to a conviction.  We need to be able to see beyond ten years and need to look much further into the future.  I thank the Minister of State for her clarification.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_1507">The Minister of State will be aware that the Prison Officers Association, whose annual conference is taking place at the moment, has drawn attention to the difficulties caused by the activities of gangland figures in prison where they are replicating many of the activities in which they have been involved on the outside.  This has very real consequences for the compliant prison population who are living in a climate of fear and for the victims of crime on the outside in the following way.  I know of cases of compliant prisoners being compelled by threats to bring in drugs, weaponry and mobile phones.  I am aware of cases where following threats against themselves and their families on the outside, they have been forced to secret some of these materials in their cells.</p>
            <p eId="para_1508">This climate of fear and intimidation is enabling people to be involved in crime while still in prison.  They are enabled, particularly by the availability of mobile phones, to be able organise activities outside while they are supposed to be in prison.  I know of cases where very serious crimes were committed up to and including murder, which were largely organised within prison walls.</p>
            <p eId="para_1509">Since many of these gangs are feuding with each other, segregation is now necessary in most prisons.  At the moment nearly 400 prisoners are locked up for periods of up to 23 hours a day.  More than 900 prisoners are in protective custody.  Those numbers represent an enormous proportion of the prison population as a whole - possibly the highest in the world.  These people need such special treatment because of the gangland situation inside the prison walls.</p>
            <p eId="para_1510">This has created enormous logistical problems for the prison staff.  There is no single way of dealing with it; every chief officer is left to his or her own devices.  It is an <i>ad hoc</i> system.  As the representative of the Prison Officers’ Association said at its recent conference, this is both unsafe and unfair.</p>
            <p eId="para_1511">I am not raising this to gain political points.  I mention it on behalf of families of prisoners who have come to me to say their family member, who simply wants to serve out his sentence, is being subjected to a campaign of intimidation, threats and terror and is living in daily fear of violent physical assault.  I am also raising the issue on behalf of a number of prison officers, who tell me it is impossible in the present overcrowded conditions to organise the prisons properly.  I am fully aware the current Minister is not the first who has presided over this situation, but due to the successes of the Garda, for which I congratulate it, there are now many more gangland figures behind prison walls, so the problem has grown in scale.  I am aware of the statement by the representative of the Irish Prison Service today, but I must be conscious of what prison officers - the people who are trying to use the system on the ground - are saying, and I must be particularly conscious of what the families of prisoners are saying.  I am aware of the Government's financial difficulties with regard to the provision of extra prison space and so on, but I ask the Minister of State to convey to her colleague that something needs to be done to alleviate those concerns.</p>

            <p eId="para_1512">I am conscious that I may not have time to read out the whole reply, but I agree this is an important issue and I thank the Deputy for raising it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1513">I am here on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who unfortunately cannot be present, as he is attending a meeting of the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council in Luxembourg where his presence is required.  I thank Deputy O'Dea for raising this matter and for the opportunity to speak on this important issue, which has been a topic of discussion already today.  I can assure the Deputy that tackling serious and organised crime and bringing to justice those involved is a key priority for the Government.  The implementation of specific operational measures to deal with criminal gangs and their activities is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  In this context, the Commissioner has stressed on many occasions that the necessary resources have been made available and will continue to be made available.  The Minister has also made it clear to the Garda Commissioner that he is open to making additional changes to the law which the Garda believes would be helpful in tackling the activities of organised criminals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1514">The House will appreciate that the growth of organised criminal gangs outside prison has obvious consequences within the prison system itself.  The manner in which these groups operate on the outside is now being mirrored on the inside.  Rivalries and feuds which develop on the outside continue inside prison.  Prison managements must ensure the various factions are kept apart and, as far as possible, that gang members do not have influence over other prisoners or criminal activities outside the prisons.  Having attended the annual conference of the Prison Officers' Association earlier today, I am all too aware of the difficulties this causes for prison management and staff on a daily basis, as I heard it at first hand this morning.  I listened carefully to what was said and heard about what can unfortunately happen, and I understand the difficulties for everyone involved.  I also appreciate the efforts made by prison management and staff to deal with this issue on a daily basis.  We all know and appreciate that theirs is a difficult job, and we must do all we can to support them.  I am informed by the Minister for Justice and Equality that the management and staff of our prisons do an excellent job in this regard and act according to the intelligence and information acquired through the monitoring process.  This may involve keeping different prisoners or groups of prisoners separate, moving prisoners from one location in the prison to another, or transferring them to another prison.  All of this is part and parcel of the day-to-day business of running a prison system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1515">The problems associated with gangs are not unique to Ireland; prisons everywhere must deal with this issue every day.  Unfortunately, Ireland is no different from anywhere else, but I assure the House that the Irish Prison Service has long been taking considerable steps to tackle and manage this issue, and has built up considerable experience in this regard.  The House can be also assured that the director general of the Irish Prison Service will take whatever steps are necessary to deal with any problems that may arise.  Much has been done already and much continues to be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_1516">A number of initiatives have been introduced with a view to preventing identified gang leaders from conducting criminal activities while in custody, and to prevent them from exerting inappropriate influence over others.  The security initiatives undertaken by the operational security group, OSG, within the Irish Prison Service have made it more difficult for prisoners to engage in illegal activities while in prison.  These initiatives include the introduction of passive and active drug detection dogs and the installation of airport-style security, including scanners and X-ray machines.  The core functions of this group include gathering and collating intelligence information regarding the behaviour of criminal gang members in custody, carrying out intelligence-led searches and preventing the flow of contraband, including mobile phones, into prisons.  In addition, there is regular contact between the Irish Prison Service and the Garda Síochána to discuss security issues, including the operation of criminal gangs.  Gardaí are also provided with reports detailing the release dates of this category of prisoner.  Furthermore, the risk management of offenders group within the Irish Prison Service, which is comprised of the governors of all closed prisons and the governor of the OSG, meet on a regular basis to share intelligence and to decide in a strategic and collaborative fashion on the placement of leading gang members across the prison estate, having regard to the associated protection issues.  An unfortunate by-product of the gang culture in prisons is the increasing number of prisoners who need to be put on protection.  However, it is also an indication of the steps taken to ensure prisoners are kept safe as well as secure within the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1517">I thank the Deputy for providing me with an opportunity to address the House on this issue.  On behalf of the Minister, I assure him that every effort will continue to be made to deal with this issue in our prisons.  I can also assure him that the management and staff of the Irish Prison Service will have the full support of the Minister in taking all necessary steps to ensure this is done.</p>

            <p eId="para_1518">I thank the Minister of State for her reply, and I understand why the Minister for Justice and Equality cannot be here.  While I appreciate the work being done by prison staff and the experience they have built up, the Minister will understand that at the moment we are dealing with a particularly volatile situation.  The prisons are crammed.  I can understand the reason for that; I do not make any political point about it.  For whatever reason, the prisons are full to bursting.  In addition, there are now record numbers of gang members behind bars, and in Mountjoy Prison, one in every five prisoners is segregated or under some sort of protection, including 23-hour lock-up.  Putting together those three factors, we have a combustible situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1519">The Prison Officers' Association has recommended that an independent review be carried out to determine whether a cohesive approach can be taken.  As the Minister of State is aware, the problem is being dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis; it is down to every prison officer or prison chief to handle each situation as he or she sees fit.  I appreciate that there must be a certain amount of flexibility, but will the Government consider accepting the recommendation of the Prison Officers’ Association that an independent review be carried out to bring some cohesion to the management of these problems within the prisons?</p>

            <p eId="para_1520">There is a cohesive project in place which brings all prison governors together, and they meet regularly with the people who are charged with the security and management of the service.  These prison officers are front-line staff; we can never dismiss what they tell us, and we will always have to take account of it.  During my address today to the Prison Officers' Association, I announced that a new prison is to be built in Cork.  Cork Prison, as people know, is grossly overcrowded.  It is hoped the new prison will be up and running within the next two years.  That will happen.  There will be accommodation not only for the people who are already in that prison but also for additional numbers.  In addition, the capital building programme in the area of justice has received significant additional moneys this year.  As long as we are successful in incarcerating gangs, gang members and their leaders, we will have this problem.  I accept what the POA has said and what the Deputy stated in regard to how we manage this situation.  We must keep a very close eye on it.  I agreed with the president of the POA today that I would convey to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, three of the association's demands, including for an ombudsman and for an independent monitor to examine how action might be better co-ordinated.  I will do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_1521">I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the current position of Inver national school, afford DEIS status to the school and stop the existing discrimination against its pupils.  From his educational data, the Minister of State will know well that this primary school is situated in an area of severe educational disadvantage that is thus designated.  This position is supported by the INTO which has highlighted the challenges experienced on a daily basis on this account.</p>
            <p eId="para_1522">It is on the record that the process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of the Minister of State's Department.  The identification process for qualifying schools was based on a survey sent out by the ERC in May 2005 which examined socio-economic conditions underpinning schools.  The fact is that a completed survey form was never received from Inver national school, in spite of numerous communications to the school.  As a result the school could not be assessed and, in consequence, it is not part of DEIS.  Every other school in the Erris area has obtained DEIS status.  Since 2005 some temporary supports were given in acknowledgment of the situation in which this school found itself but to date it has not been given the DEIS status it clearly deserves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1523">It is well-known to the Minister of State that the principal of the school at the time - and whosoever else was in charge - have done an unbelievable disservice to pupils and the community of Inver.  The blame lies on whomsoever was in charge.  The present position is due to the incompetence of this person and there is considerable distress within the school, among the teaching staff and the parents.  Due to its exclusion, this school does not receive the same funding or book grant that every other primary school in the Erris area receives and it has been excluded from applying for certain grants such as for IT grants, etc.  The school has already lost a teacher.  The lack of DEIS status has also precluded the school from applying for community funding that was available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1524">I attach no blame of any kind to the Minister of State.  I urge him, however, to treat this as a special case because it is one.  Why should the pupils be left to pay the price because of the incompetence of an individual who had other things on her mind?  There is no need for me to put the name of this person on the record of the House.  She is well-known to the Minister of State and to the people in the community of Inver.  I appeal to the Minister of State to make an allowance in this very special case.  This community has suffered enough on account of local events in recent years.  I ask him to please give the people a break.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills  (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
            <p eId="para_1525">A key priority for my Department is to prioritise and target resources in schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.  That challenge is significant given the current economic climate and the target to reduce overall public expenditure. This limits the capacity for any additionality in the DEIS programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1526">The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the inspectorate.  In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried out by the ERC in May 2005.  The analysis of the survey returns from primary schools by the ERC identified the socio-economic variables that collectively best predict achievement.  These variables were then used to identify schools for participation in DEIS.  As the Deputy noted, notwithstanding repeated communications to the school referred to by the Deputy, a completed survey form was not received from the school in question and therefore it could not be assessed at the time for participation in DEIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">Many representations have been made to my Department and to my predecessors by and on behalf of Inver national school, seeking its inclusion in DEIS.  These representations were unsuccessful.  It should be noted that none of those schools in the country which were unsuccessful in the initial identification and subsequent review processes were ever admitted to the DEIS programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1528">I again ask the Minister of State not to add insult to injury to this community.  In his response he referred to the incompetence within the school in returning a survey form.  Every other small school in the area has DEIS status and this does not stack up.  I do not believe we can stand over it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">I was disappointed that the school was not included in the review of DEIS schools.  Above all others, this is a very special case and the Minister of State is aware of other details I have not mentioned.  I ask him to speak to the Minister, Deputy Quinn.  We cannot stand over this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1530">As all Members are aware, we are in a very difficult budgetary situation.  Like every other Department, the Department of Education and Skills has to find significant savings.  The Minister referred to these in the Chamber only a few days ago, stating that we had to achieve savings of the order of €70 million this year, another €70 million next year and more than €100 million in the final year of the period, 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">A third of all public sector employees work in this sector.  Unlike many other countries, and fortunately, in one sense, for us, our school-going population is rising rapidly.  The current economic climate and the challenge to meet significant targets and reduce that expenditure means there is no capacity at present to add to the DEIS programme.  There are a number of schools which did not participate in the orginal survey in 2005.  Others that were not part of the survey process have tried on numerous occasions since then to gain DEIS status.  This was not possible at the time and is impossible at present.  That is not to say that at some point in the future when things are better from a financial and fiscal point of view that we will not reopen the possibility of additionality to the DEIS programme.  The only honest or frank position one can adopt at this point is to tell the school at Inver, and many others like it, that change of status is impossible now but may become possible at some point in the future.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</from>
            <p eId="para_1533">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving us this opportunity.  I speak on behalf of Jimmy Flannery, Tom Hand and all the boatmen who try to make a modest living taking passengers out into Dingle Bay, in particular to see Fungie the dolphin.  These people have provided a great service in our tourism sector throughout the years and people have enjoyed these trips.</p>
            <p eId="para_1534">At present, however, these people are struggling with the cost of diesel and the increased charges they already have to pay.  I shall give an example of what the proposed new charges will mean.  The fishing boat is exactly the same as the passenger boat.  The proposed annual charges would mean a charge of €1,215 for a fishing boat but €6,290 for a passenger boat.  We must make a clear distinction here today.  These people are trying to make their living in what may be as little as a three or four week period whereas passenger boats in other parts of the country are not only subsidised but have all-year-round business.  These people have a very short and narrow window of opportunity.  If July or August is bad they may have a very bad season and end by losing money.</p>
            <p eId="para_1535">I spoke to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, in recent weeks about this matter.  I plead with him to make a special category or section to ensure that these kind of boats will be recognised for what they do.    I compliment the Government if it is trying to create new jobs in other sectors and wish it well in that work.  I plead with the Government to look at the jobs we have and to try to help people continue in their work.  This is a typical example.  The people operating in Dingle do not want anything from anyone except fair play and to be left alone to make their living.  I ask the Minister not to increase the harbour charges on these men and hunt them out of business and onto the dole queue.  The Government should think about its mantra about jobs and change it slightly to protect the jobs we have.  These people are minding their own business and providing an invaluable, safe service to those who visit County Kerry.  I want them to be able to continue and, in the years after we leave this House, I want their families to continue the proud tradition of seeing after our visitors and taking them onto the sea in a safe and happy fashion.  I plead with the Minister to help them out in this regard.  I am relying on the Minister.</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanGriffinFG" eId="spk_564">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Griffin</from>
            <p eId="para_1536">I am grateful to speak on this matter with my colleagues from Kerry, Deputies Healy-Rae and Martin Ferris.  I understand other Kerry Deputies have made representations to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coveney, as I have.  I have held meetings with a number of delegations in Dingle and they expressed concern at the Fishery Harbour Centres (Rates and Charges) Order 2012.  This affects not just tour operators operating boats to see Fungi but also people who have yachts in the marina and commercial fishermen.  All groups are concerned about potential increases in charges to use Dingle Harbour.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">At a time when the State needs to do everything possible to assist business and those contributing to economic activity in the locality and creating employment, we should not increase fees.  Some people are paying €2,000 and will potentially have to pay three or four times that amount.  If we were to suggest to any business owner that rates could increase by that amount, we would be told where to go.  I ask the Minister to consider carefully the submissions made to the Department before the deadline of 20 April.  The Minister should carefully consider the submissions and not just go with the draft prepared by officials in his Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">I thank the Minister for engaging with me on this matter.  He gave me a commitment to examine this carefully.  I hope he will come up with a common sense solution to this problem.  The people who come to Dingle to see Fungi are dependent on the service, as are the fishermen and the yachts that come into Dingle.  If the charges increase, we will jeopardise all three categories.  Yachts will not come into Dingle, fishermen will find it impossible to operate and one of the oldest and most successful attractions in west Kerry will be jeopardised.  I am not prepared to stand over that and I hope common sense will apply.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_565">
            <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
            <p eId="para_1539">This is a co-ordinated approach by the three Kerry Deputies present to highlight a huge injustice.  Dingle has traditionally been dependent on fishing and, in recent years, on passenger tourism through yachts and sailing boats coming to the area.  The knock-on effect contributes greatly to the economy.  In current circumstances, the major downturn in the economy is caused by a lack of spending power.  In its stupidity, the Government is trying to take more money out of the community's pocket.  It affects not just boat owners on their passenger boats but also the spending this generates through the number of people who travel out to see Fungi.  That has been a huge tourist attraction on the west Kerry peninsula since 1994.  This decision is taking spending power out of the community and, by doing so, putting more people on the live register.  More are condemned to the scourge of emigration.  A small amount of common sense is needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1540">How can any Minister justify the increase from €2,000 or €2,400 to €8,000 or €9,000?  It is an increase of 300% and will take €100 out of each boat every week.  One must also bear in mind the major increase in fuel and diesel charges, the increase in insurance charges and the ancillary charges for water and refuse.  The Government talks about creating jobs but if it is serious about maintaining jobs, it should revisit this decision.  The 2003 order was reasonable.  In hard times, the passenger boat people continue to work.  There are very few commercial fishermen left in Dingle but they continue to work and they bring money to the local economy.  It is ludicrous to take money out of a struggling economy.</p>

          <speech by="#CiaranCannon" eId="spk_566" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Skills">
            <from>Deputy Ciarán Cannon</from>
            <p eId="para_1541">I am responding to this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Simon Coveney.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to deal with, and provide some clarity on, the concerns raised by Deputies Martin Ferris, Griffin and Healy-Rae.  The Deputies referred to the draft new rates and charges order for the six fishery harbour centres.  The recently published draft new rates and charges order sets out the first proposed changes in almost a decade to the fee schedule for the use of the facilities at each of the six fishery harbour centres, located at Dingle, Castletownbere, Dunmore East, Howth, Killybegs and Rossaveel.  The draft was published following an extensive review of the existing rates and charges order for the fishery harbour centres that came into effect in 2003.  The 21 day period for public consultation closed on Friday, 20 April.  Some 85 submissions were made, of which six were from fishermen's representative groups, two from individual fishermen, 18 from the tourism and marine leisure sector, 12 from passenger vessel operators, one from a local authority, 15 from marine business interests in the fishery harbour centres, six from harbour users groups and islanders, and 25 from private individuals.  This is a significant response from a wide range of stakeholders in our fishery harbour centres and the Minister is gratified to see the level of interest and commitment they represent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">The responses will be examined closely by the Department and all submissions will be given full consideration before the new order is finalised.  It is important to stress the public consultation process provides a valuable opportunity for the Minister and the Department to hear and consider the concerns of our customers.  No decision on the final text of the new rates and charges order will be taken until all submissions made by the stakeholders have been fully considered and evaluated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1543">It may be useful at this stage to explain the background to the funding mechanism involved in the day-to-day management of the six fishery harbour centres.  The Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1968 sets out the mechanism to be employed in funding the day-to-day operational costs of the six fishery harbour centres.  All income received at each of the six fishery harbour centres is effectively lodged to what is known as the fishery harbour centres fund.  All the day-to-day running costs of each fishery harbour centre are in turn financed from the fishery harbour centres fund.  It is the only source of income available to fund the day-to-day operational and management expenditure at the fishery harbour centres.  Examples of regular expenditure include harbour master and staff salaries, electricity, lighting, water and fuel costs, cleaning and maintenance, etc.  It is important to reiterate that all income lodged to the fishery harbour centres fund is invested directly in fishery harbour centres to the benefit of harbour users.</p>
            <p eId="para_1544">The rates and charges order is the legal instrument that enables charges to be levied that provide the income necessary for the provision of the various services at the fishery harbour centres.  There have been no increases in rates and charges since the current charges were set almost ten years ago in 2003.  I am fully aware of the need not to increase costs unduly for the industry at this time.  At the same time it is important the proposed new rates and charges are set at a level sufficient to provide adequately for the costs involved while balancing the need to finance the management of the harbours with the needs of the various harbour customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1545">I will highlight some of the features of the proposed new charges which were prepared in response to requests from industry.  General fish landing tonnage charges set for all whitefish and fishmeal have not been increased in the draft order.  A new single entry charge has been introduced as an alternative to the annual multiple entry charge structure in place since 2003.  To facilitate operators, an alternative €400 single entry charge has been provided in the draft order.  This new charge is to be available as an alternative, at the discretion of the operator, to the other annual multiple entry charge for fish landings outlined in the draft order.  It is not an additional charge, as has been suggested by some, but is an alternative to facilitate operators who may find this more satisfactory for their operations.  Charges for syncrolift use have been the subject of complaints from users for some time and in recognition of that, the charge for prolonged use has been halved, from €400 per day to €200 per day.  Also to ensure the charge is fair, the Minister has introduced an exception to facilitate an inspection by a government body, for example, where a vessel is awaiting inspection by the Marine Survey Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1546">The consultation process seeks to provide a platform to ensure as fair and equitable a levying of charges as is possible.  The Department will, as I have said, consider all submissions made by the public and they are willing to meet with interested parties to discuss the draft rates and charges order, to provide any necessary clarification and to listen to and consider alternative suggestions to the individual charges included in the draft order.  It is only then, when the Minister has reflected on all the matters raised in the consultation process that he will finalise a new rates and charges order for the harbours.</p>

            <p eId="para_1547">I want to take the Minister up on the offer of his officials meeting with representatives from Dingle as soon as possible to discuss their submission.  At a time when they are struggling to manage their finances, we cannot impose increases.  Their fuel bill is now double what it was a couple of years ago.  How can they manage to pay more?  They cannot do it.  I will rely on the Minister as he is one of the few people in the House who would have sailed a boat into Dingle harbour on many occasions.  He knows where he is talking about and I appreciate that.  I hope common sense will apply and a special consideration will be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">On the issue of the yachts, this problem could lead to a dangerous situation.  People who might have pulled into Dingle harbour may now decide to stop away from the pier and use small pontoons to come in rather than come into the safety of the harbour.  This could be dangerous.  It should be remembered that it is better to get a small amount of money from people than to get no money or to stop them coming in altogether.  That would rob our town of business.  Also, further taxes would be accrued were people to spend money in the town.  Dingle has worked very hard to get to where it is today.  I do not want the Government to do anything that would pull Dingle down, cost jobs and money and take people out of viable valuable work and put them on the dole queues.  We do not want that.</p>

            <p eId="para_1549">I thank the Minister of State for his response and I welcome the commitment to ensure that all submissions will be closely examined and considered.  As a resident of the Dingle peninsula, I know that the people who have made submissions will be grateful that they will be considered carefully and, hopefully, acted on.</p>
            <p eId="para_1550">I welcome some of the positive aspects of the draft plan and I acknowledge that progressive steps have been taken.  Unfortunately, the charges are a major issue.  It was one of the first issues I raised here following my election in April last year.  I raised the issue that the existing charges were so high and that any further increase would be completely unacceptable.  I too welcome the offer to arrange a meeting between officials and concerned parties from Dingle.  I have contacted the Minister's office and asked him to meet with some of the individuals involved and hopefully that will happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">This is a very important issue for the people of Dingle.  It may not be a big issue in the overall scheme of things as far as the Department is concerned.  However, it is very important in west Kerry.  Fungi is a very important attraction in west Kerry.  He does not have a voice for himself and we need to speak on his behalf.  The fishing industry is hugely important to Dingle, as is the business generated from it and from yachts coming into Dingle.  We need to protect that and to do everything possible to protect the jobs associated with it.  I ask that everything possible is done to accommodate the requests and submissions made by the various parties.</p>

            <p eId="para_1552">I thank the Minister of State for his response.  One only has to look at the number of submissions, 85, to get an indication of how seriously people view the situation in the Dingle and west Kerry peninsula area and further afield.  The point made by Deputy Healy-Rae about boats anchoring outside the harbour and the dangers that presents should not be ignored.  Even people with yachts now find things more difficult, because everybody is hurting at this point.  I am glad Department officials will meet the local community and fishermen.  That is a positive move and I welcome it.  There is a role for us as public representatives to ensure that comes about.</p>
            <p eId="para_1553">On a lighter note, some years ago on 1 April a report was broadcast on the news that Fungi had been shot by someone from Dublin.  If these charges go ahead, the Minister will be held responsible for getting rid of Fungi.</p>

            <p eId="para_1554">As Deputies may know, I come from a county that also relies heavily on its maritime tradition, one that brings many benefits to the local economy, and I am more than aware of the sensitivities that surround this issue in Kerry.  My only participation in marine leisure activities has been as a windsurfer, but I do not envisage sailing into Dingle any time soon on my sail board.  That would be a bit of a trek.</p>
            <p eId="para_1555">The Minister was very anxious to point out in his response that he is more than willing to consider seriously all of the submissions received and to meet with those who made those submissions in order to hear their concerns and suggestions as to how best the negative effects of the proposed charges can be ameliorated.  I suggest that the Deputies begin that process of arranging a meeting and get the process of consultation under way.  I am confident the outcome of those negotiations and discussions will be very positive.</p>

            <p eId="para_1557">Recommendations and awards of these institutions may concern either industrial relations or employment rights issues.  I will deal with each separately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntarist in nature.  The State provides a framework and the institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper.  It is expected that the parties to a dispute come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the recommendations made.  It should be noted, however, that either party to a dispute may reject such recommendations.  I am not aware of an increasing disregard from employers to the recommendations of these institutions.  Accordingly, I have no plans to make any changes to alter this voluntarist principle.  It has been tried and tested over a long period and has proved robust in dealing with many difficult disputes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">Employment rights awards may be enforced, depending on the legislation, usually by application to the Circuit or District Courts.  I would not normally be aware of the enforcement history of a particular award.  However, as Minister, I may sometimes make an application to the courts on behalf of a claimant.  Through these cases and a recent consultation process I undertook, I am aware of increasing concerns with regard to situations where employers fail or refuse to comply with awards of rights commissioners, the EAT or the Labour Court with regard to awards under employments rights legislation.   It is my intention this autumn, in the forthcoming workplace relations Bill, to develop new and more effective ways of enforcing such awards.  I have already sought the views of all interested parties as part of the workplace relations reform programme on how to improve this system.  I am open to all positive suggestions and advice on the design of a better system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1560">I welcome what the Minister has said with regard to the forthcoming legislation in the autumn.  We look forward to seeing what improvements he can manage to bring about in the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561">I would like to bring the Minister back to the situation under the industrial relations legislation.  Is he aware that in 2010, the last year for which we have figures, no less than 543 cases were referred to the Labour Court under the industrial relations legislation?  However, the Labour Court could issue a binding recommendation in only nine of them, less than 2% of the cases.  To put it another way, in over 98% of cases that went to the Labour Court, if the employer chose to ignore the Labour Court recommendation, the employee was in no position to vindicate his or her rights.  The figures for 2009 are somewhat similar with ten out of 606 cases.  Will the Minister agree that this is very unfair, that it needs to be given careful and serious consideration and that the Connolly Shoes case, with which he would be familiar, is a classic example of what happens when employers fail to engage meaningfully with employment rights bodies?</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_1562">I agree there have been difficulties with the resolution of many industrial disputes.  However, legal mandatory rulings have not been a feature of our industrial relations scenery and they create a very different approach to industrial relations.  Our industrial relations machinery has evolved on the basis of seeking to be conciliatory and to bring parties together.  Ultimately solutions have to be found from between the two sides and seeking to have binding legal obligations in respect of a dispute of this nature has never favoured.  One would need to consider long and hard before imposing mandatory solutions producing binding decisions which affect workers or employers without them having the opportunity to take a different view.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">The Deputy is suggesting a very profound shift in the type of industrial relations approach in this country.  Our record of low industrial strife points to the success of the system.  I recognise there are always some cases which prove the exception to the rule and I am always ready to listen to suggestions.  However, the bigger problem is in the area of employment rights.  Just as we have a more efficient system the awards should be enforceable and this is an area where I plan to direct more of my energies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1564">I agree with the Minister on his last point.  I refer the Minister to a letter he wrote to the Mandate trade union dated 1 March 2012 in which he advised the union that he would consider, " vindication of employees' rights and the minimisation of the cost to employees in the context of the forthcoming reform of the State's employment rights and industrial relations structures and procedures".  Will the Minister give the House a commitment that he will review those procedures and legislation in a way that will assist in the speedy resolution of industrial relations disputes in cases where the employer refuses to engage with the industrial relations institutions of the country?</p>

            <p eId="para_1567">Section 132 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009, which provides for the abolition of upward-only rent reviews in commercial leases, became operative on 28 February 2010.  The two enterprise agencies which report to my Department and have significant property portfolios, namely IDA Ireland and Shannon Development, have acted in accordance with the provisions of section 132 of the 2009 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">IDA Ireland has informed me that it currently has 73 occupational leases across its private finance building portfolio.  Sixty-four of the leases were granted prior to 28 Feb 2010, at which time all IDA Ireland building leases would have contained upward-only rent reviews.  From 28 February 2010, IDA Ireland's leases are linked to market rent and there are currently nine leases which were granted after 28 Feb 2010.  Shannon Development has 48 long-term leases, 43 of which contain the upward-only rent review clause as they were entered into prior to February 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">Both agencies have confirmed that where businesses are in difficulties, they have, on a case by case basis, responded to and facilitated requests from companies for reduced rent and they will continue to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_1570">The Government made a strong pledge in its programme for Government and even on Grafton Street that it would get rid of upward-only rents.  The State spends €53 million on upward-only rent contracts.  The State would save at least €8 million if it got rid of upward-only rents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">The retail sector has fallen off a cliff and 50,000 people have lost their jobs in that sector in the past four or five years and a further 30,000 jobs are in jeopardy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">The Minister states that those upward-only rents clauses were contracted prior to the 2010 date and the Government is reducing those rents on a case-by-case basis down to market levels.  Will the Minister confirm there have been no further upward-only rent contracts are being used by the agencies under his remit?  I have been informed that businesses continue to suffer under upward-only rent contracts on properties owned by departmental agencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1573">It is my understanding that there has been no increase in rents by those agencies.  However, I will seek further clarification and confirmation for the Deputy.  He raises the wider issue of the Government's intention to seek to do away with upward-only rents.  This matter is the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality but the advice of the Attorney General is that it was not possible to do away with these rents without the State or the taxpayer paying compensation to those who would be adversely affected.</p>

            <p eId="para_1582">The achievement of balanced regional development continues to be a core objective of this Government.  The enterprise agencies under the remit of my Department, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Kerry County Enterprise Board work continuously to encourage the establishment and the development of industry in the county.  Between them the client companies of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the Kerry County Enterprise Board employ almost 6,300 people in the county.</p>
            <p eId="para_1583">Following the announcement by Aetna to close its facility at Castleisland, IDA Ireland was successful in attracting JRI America Incorporated, to establish a software development operation in Tralee, which will create up to 100 highly skilled positions over the next number of years. Recruitment is already under way for a number of positions.  The vacant Aetna building is the property of that company and it is the company's decision to put the building on the market.  At the time of the announcement of the company closure, there were local reports that the building should be given over to the State or local development interests but no such decision was ever agreed to or proposed by the company.</p>
            <p eId="para_1584">As regards the Pretty Polly site, this building is not in the ownership of the IDA.  The building itself was formerly a manufacturing facility which means that the opportunity to source a prospective tenant for this building may be limited in its current layout.  Both the IDA and the CEO of Kerry CEB have had engagement with Killarney Town Council on the matter and both remain available to provide assistance regarding potential uses for the building.</p>

            <p eId="para_1585">With respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, the reply is a repeat of one I received from the Minister, Deputy Bruton, last November.  The reply contains much rhetoric and gobbledygook and is repetitive of one I received six months ago.  In the south-west region we are the poor relations in terms of employment and the attraction of viable jobs into this country.  We are being totally overlooked.</p>
            <p eId="para_1586">This morning it was welcome to hear the announcement of a significant number of jobs in Dún Laoghaire.  I would be the first person to compliment the Government on the efforts it is making.  We have heard a plethora of announcements in the past 12 months.  Excellent efforts are being made.  The Government is striving to attract foreign direct investment and also supporting local businesses as much as possible but on a geographic level we are being treated in a reckless manner.  I will be honest about it.  It is not just this Government but successive Governments have allowed Kerry to become an industrial wasteland, which is currently epitomised by the vacant Pretty Polly plant in Killarney in recent years.  Absolutely nothing is happening there although the premises was given to the State for free.  It is also epitomised at the moment by the Aetna company premises in Castleisland which has been vacant since last December when the final lot of employees vacated the premises.  The company has relocated its financial services operations to Asia.  Its premises was also to be given to the State. A senior executive of the Aetna company assured me 12 months ago that it would, at the time of the announcement of the closure when I asked him whether the plant would be donated to the State in a similar way as the Pretty Polly plant.  He said it would be also available to another employer.  The situation was in the affirmative at that particular time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1588">I brought the issue to the attention of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, six months ago.  It is a devastating blow to see a "For Sale" sign on the building for the past two months.  The premises is state-of-the-art and comprises approximately 16,000 sq. ft.  It is located in a town that has been devastated in an area of County Kerry that has been totally neglected.  Many of the 120 staff who are capable and skilled people are not in any way confident about gaining work in the near future.  Some of them have left this country.  I urge the Minister to intervene at this late stage because I got positive statements last November about the IDA placing suitable industry in the vacant premises.  I am most disappointed with what I have heard this evening.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">I raised the matter in the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education with Mr. Barry O'Leary the chief executive of the IDA.  I am most disappointed because he was supposed to come back to me with a report on the matter but he never did.</p>
            <p eId="para_1590">On the Pretty Polly plant in Killarney, I compliment the mayor of Killarney, Sean Counihan, and his fellow councillors, who are like a band of IDA representatives themselves.  They have to go out alone to seek suitable employment in the fine premises in Killarney.  It is very sad that we are being let down by the State agencies.  We have been let down by the Government.  I do not wish to point the finger at any Minister but it is time to buck up and grasp the nettle and give us fair play in County Kerry.</p>

            <p eId="para_1592">Before we move on I wish to say in reply that Enterprise Ireland in County Kerry is focused on the creation of new jobs.  In 2011, a total of 3,602 people were employed in 124 enterprise client companies in County Kerry with 170 of those jobs created during that year.  Equally, Enterprise Ireland has also provided funding of more than €2.2 million, as well as other supports for the development of incubation facilities at the Institute of Technology, Tralee.  It is important that I put this on the record for Deputy Fleming.  The Tom Crean business centre also provides an incubation space for Enterprise Ireland client companies in start-up phase.</p>

The IDA strategy for Kerry is to achieve development in globally traded business.  The IDA promotes Kerry as part of an integrated region.  The county has a population of 145,000.

            <p eId="para_1624">The latest quarterly national household survey published by the Central Statistics Office in March shows that in the final quarter of 2011 there were 142,500 people under the age of 25 in employment.  This compares to 157,000 in that age cohort who were in employment at the end of 2010.  The quarterly national household survey also shows that in the final quarter of 2011, 59,700 people under 25 years of age were unemployed compared to 63,500 at the end of 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1625">There are two major elements to the Government's response to tackling unemployment in general.  These are the action plan for jobs and Pathways to Work.  The goal of the action plan for jobs is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs in the economy by 2016, while the aim of Pathways to Work is to help ensure as many of those jobs as possible are filled by people on the live register.  Under Pathways to Work, the Department of Social Protection is committed to supporting more than 85,000 beneficiaries in job placement, work experience and back to education schemes in 2012.  The Department of Education and Skills will also provide more than 457,000 training and education places including provision for early school leavers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1627">That is jolly decent of you.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">The question is focused on youth unemployment.  I recall that when in opposition Fine Gael produced a policy document on youth unemployment.  During Question Time on 19 January 2011 Deputy Bruton expressed great concern about people under the age of 25 who were unemployed and who were emigrating.  I find it strange that the Government has no specific plan for youth unemployment.  I understand it has a national action plan for combating unemployment with 270 proposals but I can find only a glancing reference to youth unemployment, which is the greatest focus of unemployment in the country with more than 40% unemployment among people aged between 15 to 19 and 26.5% among people aged between 19 and 24.  There is no particular focus on youth unemployment, just one glancing reference.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">In his response the Minister mentioned Pathways to Work.  Pathways to Work makes no reference to youth unemployment.  In view of the alarming numbers of people under the age of 25 who are unemployed, the drop in the number of people under the age of 25 who are at work and the significant continuing increase in emigration of which there is considerable anecdotal evidence, does the Minister intend to formulate a plan to deal specifically with the unemployment of people under the age of 25 and will it be reflected in the rolling national action plan for employment?</p>

            <p eId="para_1630">My direct responsibility is for enterprise policy and we support people establishing enterprise and employment regardless of age.  Many of the new opportunities being made available through decisions of companies to expand mean the recruitment of young, well-educated people.  The issue about which the Deputy is concerned is younger people who perhaps have a skill mismatch or who have come out of college and need work experience.  It is not my area of responsibility but as the Deputy knows the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, introduced the JobBridge scheme which specifically targets people who leave college and need to get work experience.  I understand there has been a high take-up of it and it has almost achieved its target participation level.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, also examined the specific needs of young people who perhaps left education and went into construction or another sector.  He has introduced schemes such as Springboard to target their need to switch.  A number of interventions have been made.  Deputy Burton's initiative is examining long-term unemployment and the risk profile of people who become unemployed.  Young people with a risk profile will get support through her interventions.  If the Deputies wish to get into the detail of this I advise them to table a question to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, who has at her fingertips information on the structures and approach she has adopted.</p>

            <p eId="para_1631">I appreciate that but I am speaking to the Minister in his capacity as a member of the relevant Cabinet committee.  He mentioned the JobBridge scheme.  In many cases it is being treated as a means of cheap labour by employers.  I take the Minister's point that the thinking behind the JobBridge scheme, which in principle is a good scheme, is to enable people to enter employment so they can acquire some experience.  Unfortunately in many cases the employer looks at it from the opposite point of view, which is as a means to acquire cheap labour, and in too many cases the people being taken on are those with experience.  I suggest to the Minister that he suggests to the Cabinet subcommittee, in particular to the Minister, Deputy Burton, that there is value in considering altering the JobBridge scheme to focus on people under the age of 25 so it can genuinely help those it was originally designed to help.</p>
            <p eId="para_1632">Will the Minister consider the recommendation made today by the National Youth Council to commission a feasibility study on how a youth guarantee scheme along the lines of the scheme operating in the UK would work here?</p>

I know many very good companies which are putting a lot of effort into it and creating genuine training opportunities.  No new scheme will be perfect and the Minister will be open to modifying and developing it and responding to the Deputy's concerns.</p>

            <p eId="para_1640">The development of a world-class all-island economy is of strategic importance and strongly complements our mission to accelerate the development of world-class Irish companies.  There is a long history of co-operative action between North-South enterprise agencies to achieve mutual benefits.  Close co-operation has been established between Invest NI and Enterprise Ireland.  Since 2006 clients of both agencies can access market services, trade missions, overseas offices, trade fairs, seminars and market development programmes provided by each agency.  In 2011, two Northern Ireland companies participated in two Enterprise Ireland trade events and 23 in six client knowledge forum events.</p>
            <p eId="para_1641">The all-island innovation voucher initiative, jointly launched by Enterprise Ireland and Invest NI, provides Irish SMEs with access to a further ten knowledge providers based in the North, and allows Northern Ireland based SMEs use Invest NI innovation vouchers to access expertise in research institutions based in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1642">The Acumen programme is an all-island business development programme managed by InterTradeIreland and supported by Enterprise Ireland, Invest NI, FÁS, Údarás, and county enterprise boards and is designed to stimulate cross-Border sales and co-ordinate development among SMEs North and South to establish and build market presence in the other jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1643">The IDA and Invest NI have been involved in areas of mutual interest which have centred on improvements in infrastructure, such as roads, airports and electricity and creating centres of critical mass such as in Letterkenny and Derry.  The agency has participated in the north-west cross-Border gateway initiative through the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  The focus has been on a range of various elements of Government policy and planning.  I am confident there is strong co-operation between these enterprise development bodies which is contributing worthwhile cross-Border benefits.</p>

            <p eId="para_1644">The issue of competition for investment and jobs is nonsense.  That this island would have a plethora of enterprise organisations such as Enterprise Ireland, InterTradeIreland and Invest NI does not make sense.  We also have the Northern Ireland Bureau and embassies across the planet, all of which are duplicating work.  While there has been some improvements in this area, we have not achieved very much since InterTradeIreland was established in 1998, which is almost 20 years ago.  For example, in California, the eighth the largest economy in the world, we have seven IDA staff, five Enterprise Ireland staff and nine Invest Northern Ireland staff.  Why the duplication there?  In China, a massive emerging market, we have 15 IDA and Enterprise Ireland staff and three INI staff.  These organisations are competing with each other to get investment to Ireland.  Given the economic climate is this duplication making sense or is it time for the Government parties to step outside the ideological box in this regard and try to understand that one all Ireland investment and enterprise development agency is long overdue?</p>

            <p eId="para_1647">It is 14 years old.  Key InterTradeIreland initiatives include the Acumen programme which stimulates cross-Border trade by assisting individual SMEs, as does the Fusion programme.  Some 19,000 SMEs have benefited from cross-Border information and 2,400 have taken part in all-island programmes.  Some €600 million worth of trade and business development has been generated and 1,300 new jobs have been created.  On the joint North-South agencies initiative, Enterprise Ireland, Invest Northern Ireland and InterTradeIreland have teamed up to host Bridging the Border seminars, which have been very effective.  Information is also provided on agencies support as well as one-to-one meetings.  The Promoting Entrepreneurship Programme has also been equally effective.  I recently attended the Halo Business Angels Network which has been very successful.  The North West Business and Technology Zone, NWBTZ, Initiative in Letterkenny has equally been successful.  Part of IDA's contribution to the NWBTZ project involved incorporating its three separate business parks in Letterkenny into a 44 ha state-of-the-art business and technology park which matches international standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1648">Invest Northern Ireland's contribution has been spread between three geographical sites.  There are many events taking place under the north west partnership.  Enterprise Ireland has in the North-South context focused on two areas, liaising with cross-Border bodies such as the Ireland Fund, Joint Business Council and, increasingly, Invest Northern Ireland and InterTradeIreland on specific project issues.  This has been very effective, as has been the Seventh Framework Programme on funding.  The Students Enterprise Award and All-Ireland Innovation Voucher schemes have been effective in terms of a sharing of resources.  A huge level of funding is being provided through INTERREG and the Peace Fund, which funding has benefited companies on both sides.</p>

Would it create two Departments and two Administrations and duplicate the process?  If the Government's only objective is to develop enterprise again, would the Government slap a border in the middle of it, create two Departments, two Administrations and two international office networks?  It would not.  I have worked for InterTrade Ireland.  It was one of the projects which Sinn Féin pushed for in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1650">I am asking the Minister what this Government has done to push the issue forward.  I do not want him to cite agencies created 14 years ago.  I would ask that he leave his script aside and speak to this directly.  This is an issue on which both of us could be on the same page.  It is something that could reduce the cost to the State and increase the level of enterprise development.  Will the Minister use the North-South Ministerial body - we have an open ear in terms of our party in the North of Ireland - to not alone express platitudes or to quote history on this issue but to push hard for this development?</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_1657">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 18 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1658">The latest Central Bank Quarterly Bulletin contains an article on the statistical implications of the corporate structures of multinational companies.  The decision of a multinational company to locate headquarters in Ireland can have a very substantial impact on reported direct foreign investment.  Its balance sheet, its lending activities to subsidiaries and its corporate earnings all affect the Irish balance of payments and the Irish recorded foreign assets.  The author points to the limited usefulness of this direct investment data for analytical purposes as a result.  This must be borne in mind in interpreting the data.  The article indicates that this data shows Bermuda as a source of significant inward investment to Ireland and a focus for outward investment.  There are a number of reasons for this.  First, Bermuda is an internationally recognised centre for the global insurance industry.  Many of the world's leading insurers and reinsurance companies have operations there.  As a result, IDA Ireland regularly visits Bermuda to engage with these companies to encourage them to establish a presence in Ireland to serve their European customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1659">Second, the data in the quarterly bulletin captures, in part, the normal flow of investment capital from these Bermudan companies to their Irish operations and from their Irish operations to Bermuda.  This is a standard feature of international trade and of intra-corporate capital flows.  Following increasing international scrutiny of corporate tax arrangements, several companies based in Bermuda, which has a 0% rate of corporate tax, decided to re-domicile and establish offices in jurisdictions that actually charge corporate tax.  A number of these companies selected Ireland for its transparent, internationally recognised and competitive 12.5% corporate tax rate.  Bermuda is recognised as a global centre for insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">IDA goes to Bermuda every year to encourage companies to set up offices in Ireland and has been successful in that many such companies have set up here in Ireland.  IDA stresses that these are companies employing staff and not "brass plate" operations.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_642">
            <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
            <p eId="para_1661">The Minister must admit that some companies do funnel money through the country.  This is borne out in the figures.  The pharmaceutical industry, accounts for 34% of our total exports - which is just short of €57 billion - and employs only 2.6% of our workforce, which works out at €1.2 million per worker of export sales.  If this were a reality, it would be magnificent.  It would mean our workers were super human.  The three largest multinationals here, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Microsoft and Google export €24 billion between them but only employ 0.3% of our workforce.  I welcome that they are creating employment here.</p>
            <p eId="para_1662">The Government continually says that the creation of jobs and tackling unemployment is its priority.  The Minister must admit that until the Government addresses the problems of the domestic economy, wherein most people, 68% in SMEs alone, are employed there will be no resolution of the unemployment crisis.  There are huge problems to be addressed.  Things have not really improved much.  Deputy Tóibín mentioned the Government received legal advice to the effect it could not touch upward-only rents, despite its promise to do so, because of contract law.  I know the banks do not want upward-only rents to be touched because most commercial rents are now going directly to the banks.  Will the Government consider the introduction of a special tax on upward-only rents that would allow the moneys in question to work their way back to the tenants who are affected by such rents?  That might help to keep the tenants' companies alive.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_643" as="#Minister_for_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation">
            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_1663">The Deputy has raised a number of points.  While aggregate sales from foreign-owned companies are very large, it has to be recognised that the impact of such companies on the Irish economy is also very large.  Even though the wage percentage might be small, total foreign direct investment accounts for almost 250,000 jobs in the economy.  The companies in question spend €19 billion on Irish-sourced goods and services and have a €7 billion payroll.  They have a substantial impact on the Irish economy.  They have helped us to develop clusters of expertise.  The presence in Ireland of companies like Microsoft, which was mentioned by the Deputy, has helped to create an ecosystem, as it is described in California, in which many other small information technology companies have developed.  Ireland is the envy of many countries for its success in building clusters in areas like pharmaceuticals, information and communications technology and medical devices.  These clusters are playing an important part in driving both the foreign-owned and indigenous export recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_1664">I fully recognise there are issues in the domestic economy.  Most of the initiatives on which we are focusing in the action plan for jobs relate to the needs of domestic companies.  I refer, for example, to initiatives relating to access to finance, various elements of the cost base, various development capital needs, mentoring and supports of different kinds.  There is a recognition that this country needs a strong international economy in which foreign and indigenous companies can complement each other.  It is not a case of one or the other.  We need to use that to develop a stronger domestic economy as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_1665">I agree we need both.  I suggest the domestic economy needs more help than the other side mentioned by the Minister.  I was interested to read what the Nevin Economic Research Institute had to say about this matter the other day:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1666">The current levels of unemployment are unacceptable and constitute a serious threat to social cohesion and not just the sustainability of future public finances.  Failure to make serious inroads on the level of unemployment will cost more in the long-run than any short-term savings in public expenditure arising from further fiscal austerity.  The biggest single obstacle to creating employment is the depressed state of the domestic economy in both parts of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1667">I accept it is not easy to drive the domestic economy.  I know from my own business that access to money continues to be a problem.  The fact the banks are practically closed for many people is killing demand.  The fundamental lack of demand is a serious issue across the domestic economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1668">I will give an example.  I have a site with planning permission for 28 houses.  I cannot sell it for €15,000 per unit at the moment.  Not only is there a lack of demand, but there is also a lack of access to money for anyone who might want to buy such a site.  Planning fees are almost as high as current site values.  I do not think we have seen the bottom of it.  When people ask me whether prices have reached the bottom, I tell them I do not think they have.  They will not reach the bottom until we tackle some of these serious problems.  Similarly, house prices will continue to fall until we deal with the mortgage crisis.  If someone asks me tomorrow whether they should buy a house, I will tell them to wait for another while because prices will continue to fall until these issues have been dealt with.</p>

            <p eId="para_1669">The Deputy is raising issues that go well beyond the subject of his question.  The Government is acutely aware of the problems in the banking system.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, has been engaged in a roadshow with the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, Mr. John Moran.  Deputy Wallace is aware the Department of Finance has received a commitment from each of the two pillar banks to lend €3.5 billion to small and medium-sized enterprises over the coming year.  The Department is taking that commitment seriously and holding the banks to account in that regard.  As part of the roadshow, we want to get closer to business and identify where problems are arising.  We are seeking to equip businesses when they submit applications to banks and ensure the banks are in a position to act as bankers to business rather than as bankers to the property sector as they were in the recent past.  Enterprise Ireland is working with us on the latter issue.  The Deputy is aware the Credit Review Office, which was established by the previous Government, offers a valuable service.  People whose credit applications have been turned down have the right to appeal to the office.  A number of initiatives, such as the microfinance and loan guarantee scheme, are being developed.  Legislation on those initiatives will be presented to the Oireachtas soon.  We are acutely aware of the problems associated with access to finance and we are seeking to resolve them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1671">Ireland has built a strong reputation for quality and efficiency in a range of areas of the manufacturing sector, which employs more than 158,000 people in direct full-time jobs and the same number again in indirect employment.  This sector is a key part of our economic recovery, growth and job creation strategies.  Manufacturing in Ireland spans a wide range of sectors.  We have particular strengths and advantages in some sectors, such as food and drink, information and communications technology hardware, medical technologies, pharmaceutical bioprocessing, engineering and industrial products, including green and cleantech products.  Ireland is and can continue to be competitive in these high value manufacturing sectors, especially in terms of exports, expenditure in the economy and jobs.  The manufacturing sector is increasingly dynamic, sophisticated and innovative.  It invests hugely in research and development and drives productivity.  It is moving further towards integrating services into its business models.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672">For these reasons, the action plan for jobs has a clear sectoral focus on manufacturing.  It sets out a range of specific actions, to be pursued across Government in the current year, that will build on the sector's strengths and support employment growth.  Challenges addressed in the action plan for jobs include issues around scale and increasing productivity, the need for specific upskilling and management development and the need to develop the sector's capacity further to engage in research, development and innovation.  A key deliverable for my Department in the second quarter of this year is to articulate the Government's clear commitment to manufacturing in Ireland.  The Department will elaborate on the range of initiatives and supports that are to be put in place to demonstrate this commitment.  We are also committed to establishing a manufacturing development forum to assist the Government in identifying the needs of manufacturing enterprises and to progress a transformation agenda in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1673">Manufacturing, particularly advanced manufacturing, is crucial to the future of the economy.  As the Minister indicated in his reply, in terms of direct employment, manufacturing is responsible for less than 10% of all employment but more than 30% of gross domestic product.  I appreciate that the Government has specifically recognised the importance of manufacturing by devoting a considerable section of its action plan for jobs to the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">I want to ask the Minister about two specific commitments in the action plan.  He will be aware a general report on future skills needs in the economy has been published.  The Government has given a commitment to the production of a detailed assessment of manufacturing skills needs.  It has also committed to putting in place a strategic plan for manufacturing.  When can we expect those two initiatives to be taken?  What is the timeline for them?</p>

            <p eId="para_1675">A number of immediate actions are being taken.  We have commissioned a report from Forfás on the manufacturing sector which will focus specifically on the issues that have been raised by the Deputy, including future skills deficits, research and development needs and the adequacy of our technological support.  When we prioritised research expenditure, we identified the segments of high value manufacturing where we believe the best opportunities lie.  The Department is working with Science Foundation Ireland on the refocusing of priorities.  As I mentioned in my reply, we are setting up a forum of manufacturers to work with the Government to identify the areas in which we can build and to bring to the table their experience of existing limitations.  There is a sense among some manufacturers that theirs is a forgotten sector.  Perhaps it was such during the boom, during which period those who would normally have gone into manufacturing entered other sectors.  There is a need to refocus on manufacturing.  The future skills report to which the Deputy referred identified some of the areas in which we need to develop stronger traineeships and focus on specific opportunities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1676">The Government has focused on particular sectors, as is proper, but, as has been said, there is a pressing need to focus on manufacturing because of its benefits.  Approximately 2.5 jobs come with every manufacturing job and 0.7 jobs with every service job.  The Minister referred to competitiveness being regained by the State <i>vis-à-vis</i> other states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">Deputy Wallace claimed the State is very much focused on computer services and pharmaceuticals with regard to exports.  If these two sectors were removed, it would change the balance of payments in a massive way.  The imbalance creates vulnerability for the State.  We had an economy built on one sector in the past and when that sector collapsed, the economy collapsed.  What strategy has the Government to ensure diversification from computer services and pharmaceuticals?</p>

            <p eId="para_1678">The Deputy is not correct.  There are always elements of sectors that rise and fall.  If the Deputy is pronouncing the end of ICT as a driver of change in our economy, I could not agree with him.  The IT sector is here to stay and there are huge opportunities therein.  There are massive skills shortages and job opportunities that could be availed of.  The IT sector is one in which Ireland has a competitive edge, and this is recognised.  We should not take the view that a sector in which we have been singularly successful is one regarding which we should get cold feet.  Some of the most ambitious and exciting companies are picking Ireland as the location of preference in which to develop information technology.  It is a very important sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">The same can be said of pharmaceuticals.  While products come and go and patents expire, there are considerable opportunities in the health sector.  Increasingly, there is a convergence regarding pharmaceutical, medical and ICT devices.  This is where we have an edge because we have strength in all the relevant sectors.  There is an opportunity to future-proof all those sectors by being the test bed for the converging technologies.  We have future-proofed the sectors by being at the cutting edge rather than getting nervous about the balance.  I am just stating the counterargument to that of the Deputy.  The sectors in question are very important to us and we have a competitive edge therein.  We need to maintain and improve that edge.</p>

            <p eId="para_1681">Absolutely.  Manufacturing comprises a sector.  All the sectors have a mix of indigenous and foreign-owned companies, which is very often their strength.  The medical devices sector comprises a perfect example.  We have some wonderful international manufacturing companies but, equally, we have built a seedbed with NUIG around Galway that is developing many young indigenous companies at the leading edge.  The mix is what really creates a cluster of strength.  It is not a question of being anti-indigenous and in favour of multinationals; it is a question of balanced sectoral expansion in the relevant areas.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_1684">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 19 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1685">The Taoiseach, Tánaiste and I were able to report last Friday, in the first quarterly progress report on the implementation of the action plan for jobs, that 96%, or 80 out of 83 measures which were scheduled to be completed in quarter 1, were delivered.  I regard this as a significant achievement for the Government and an indication of its success in dealing with the issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1686">Some important deliverables already achieved under the Action Plan include the development of the partial credit guarantee scheme and the publication of legislation to bring it into effect, the launch of the Succeed in Ireland initiative, the design and launch of Enterprise Ireland's development capital scheme, the enactment of pro-jobs measures in the Finance Bill and the establishment of a new education and training fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">Only three of the 83 measures were not fully completed, and these relate to the launch of a new women-in-business start-up drive, the development of an approach and a programme to support industry-led clustering, and the development of a cloud-computing strategy for the public service.  While these three measures were not fully completed on schedule, significant progress has been made on them, and I fully expect them to be finalised during the second quarter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">The Government is committed to ongoing monitoring of the action plan.  A monitoring committee, comprising representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department and Forfás, has been established to track the progress of each of the quarterly targets to be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1689">Targets are designed to be realistic but ambitious.  They are being pursued vigorously and rigorously monitored.  Those who are assigned responsibility are expected to overcome obstacles and will have to account to the Taoiseach with quarterly reporting dates to maintain momentum.  This is the central priority of Government and each Minister has bought into the central national importance of this process.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_654">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_1690">Would it not be a good idea to have external monitoring of the Government's success?  The Government sets itself up as its own examiner and gives itself an A+.  Despite the claimed success rate, 97%, the unemployment rate remains stuck at 14.6%.  The Minister referred in his reply to the credit guarantee scheme.  The scheme is not yet in place and is a long way from being so.  Not only have we to pass the legislation, we must also put in place a mechanism.  The micro-finance scheme is not yet in operation and commercial rates have not been tackled.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has written a letter to local authorities which, from the feedback I am getting, certainly will not have very much impact.  There were further promises that were to be fulfilled by now.  For example, prioritising places on the further education scheme specifically for those on the live register for 12 months or more was not achieved.  The one-stop shop for micro-business support structures has not been put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1691">From now on, will the Government agree to external monitoring so we can really see what is happening?  One should bear in mind the fundamental legal principle, "<i>Nemo iudex in sua causa</i>.”, which translates as, “Nobody should be judge in his own cause.”</p>

            <p eId="para_1694">We are seeking to mobilise the public service across government.  Fifteen Departments and 36 agencies have contributed.  Not only have they said they would take action but they are willing to put their names up in lights and state they will be held to account for what they are doing.  This is new for the public service.  In the numerous strategies published in the past, including the health strategy, the decentralisation strategy and the national spatial strategy, which were published like confetti, there was never a statement to the effect that X, Y and Z would be delivered by such a date.  This is a new discipline demonstrating that the public service is stepping up to the plate.  There is accountability and data are on the website.  One can read what was said and what has been delivered.</p>

            <p eId="para_1696">The Deputy is free to look at it.  The implementation of a particular initiative has stages.  With regard to the partial loan guarantee, one publishes a Bill on a certain date and has it passed on a certain date.  We are willing to commit to the publication date of the Bill and we commit to delivering by quarters.  The Deputy, who has been around this House for nearly as long as I have, will realise the number of times Bills are not published for four years after the date on which they are due to be published.  In the interests of an employment strategy, Departments will stick to them and be held accountable for them.  This is a significant change in the approach to delivering public service.  The Deputy should be good enough to recognise that this a fresh and different approach.  Clearly, we have to be accountable.</p>

            <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín</from>
            <p eId="para_1697">One of the problems is the timescales.  In March 2011, the European progress microfinance facility became available.  Since then, at least 2,000 companies have become insolvent, never mind the number of sole traders.  Yet, we still do not have a start date for this programme.  There is also the issue of accountability.  The Taoiseach himself said he would hold Ministers to account yet we have the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government floundering from one crisis to another.</p>
            <p eId="para_1698">With regard to industry-led clustering, as has been said by other Deputies, there has been an uneven delivery of enterprise across the State both geographically and socio-economically.  What principles will the Minister use with industry-led clustering to ensure better geographical and socio-economic distribution?  How will he ensure disadvantaged areas get the businesses and the jobs to which they are entitled?</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_1701">The State cannot draw that down.  It must set up an independent arm to draw it down which is the microfinance proposal we are developing.  In the action plan for jobs we have committed for a date for it going live.  We have also made a commitment on when the heads of the Bill and the subsequent legislation will be published.  The Government is fronting up and stating these are target dates which it hopes to achieve which is a new approach.  I, along with my officials, will be moving might and main to meet those targets.  They are stretching targets and it will not be easy to meet all those that have been set.  We have missed some and in the future will miss others.  If we did not miss some, then they would not be real targets.  It cannot be like election results in some countries that I will not name.</p>
            <p eId="para_1702">The geographical spread will be a real challenge.  We have set a target of 50%, as had the previous Government, for industrial development outside Dublin and Cork.  I am pleased this year so far that we have delivered on that target, particularly as it had not happened last year.  I hope that it will be easier to get regional spread on companies in the Succeed in Ireland programme, which targets lower sized companies to pick Ireland because they are not seeking deep labour pools that are only available in cities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1703">If the Deputy has any further suggestions, by all means, he should send them our way.  There will be an action plan 2013 just as there was one in 2012.  We seek to make new approaches within the resources available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1704">I appreciate the Government has set targets and I am not going to be critical of it for missing certain ones.  No one expects any Government to meet every single target it sets.  However, it is a question of interpretation.  Is it not reasonable to suggest there is some outside evaluation of these targets and that the Government does not decide whether it met its targets itself?  This is particularly apt in view of the fact the Taoiseach has been very clear that Ministers, senior civil servants, senior officials and the plethora of bodies which are supposed to deliver A, B and C, should be held accountable for non-performance.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
            <p eId="para_1705">The Taoiseach is at the centre of this.  He chairs the Cabinet sub-committee and has a unit in his Department that monitors progress.  If the Taoiseach asks a Minister or a senior official why they have not delivered on a programme or target to which they are committed, they tend to respond.  They say biting with the president's teeth.  The most effective accountability, as we have seen in other countries, is when public servants, including Ministers, are brought to account by their political leader on why they have not delivered on a commitment.  That is the most effective monitoring and accountability one can have in our system.  It works.</p>

            <p eId="para_1707">Mentoring has traditionally formed part of the suite of supports offered by Enterprise Ireland to its client companies.  The existing mentor network, which is refreshed regularly, was established to help companies identify and overcome obstacles to growth, provide guidance and support and build management capability.  Mentors are senior executives, drawn from the private sector, with a proven track record in business.  They act as a confidential sounding board, advising companies on key operational and strategic issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">A mentoring assignment consists of ten visits over 12 months.  Companies choose mentors from a short-list with relevant experience.  The goals and objectives are jointly agreed at the start of the assignment.  Mentors sign a strict confidentiality agreement with Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland currently has 291 active mentors on its mentor network nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">On foot of the action plan for jobs, and building on the existing mentor offering, Enterprise Ireland has commenced development of an international mentor-adviser programme.  This involved targeting a survey at potential domestic and overseas mentors including those in the Global Irish Network, GIN.  By the closing date of 18 April, 100 responses had been received, which indicates a great willingness on the part of GIN members to assist companies in developing their business strategy and making introductions.

            <p eId="para_1717">Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland will come back with a clear plan of action for the mentoring and networking supports for smaller companies.  This will be in the review of the action plan for jobs.  It is important we do not just pay lip-service to this.  There is much potential with mentors from across the globe offering their services, as well as their contacts bases.  There is immense potential this year to add jobs through encouraging indigenous HPSUs to grow their businesses and expand into export markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has targeted 1,800 new companies to encourage them to export.  Multinationals will work with that cohort to expand their business through export-led growth, which is the way to create jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1719">It is estimated that multinationals in Ireland source approximately 15% of their materials in this country whereas the figure in Europe is 80% on average.  Not all of the materials needed by multinationals are available in Ireland, but would it be possible to pressure them to source more materials in this country?  That would filter into the domestic economy and be a great help.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
            <p eId="para_1720">Many Irish companies are also using international supply chains.  I understand Deputy Wallace's point about growing capable, indigenous companies.  Multinationals' domestic demand depends on timeframes and companies' ability to supply them.  The Taoiseach is determined to examine the €14 billion that is spent annually on public procurement in terms of small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, and the rest of the private sector.  We can create opportunities for SMEs to participate in the procurement process.  A number of seminars were held across the region so that buyers could meet and agree contracts with potential customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1721">The IDA is anxious to ensure multinationals do more business with SMEs that have the capacity to supply them.  The Government would encourage such a development, as it would also create indirect jobs.  IDA companies employ 140,000 people and one indirect job is created for every direct job.  The same applies in the case of the 135,000 people working in Enterprise Ireland companies.  This is a factor to consider when supplying to multinationals.</p>

            <p eId="para_1726">IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are the only economic development agencies for which I have responsibility who have offices outside of the island of Ireland.  Shannon Development and County Enterprise Boards have domestic offices only.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">Each of these Agencies publishes an Annual Report and Accounts which outline the income and expenditure of the Agencies and give breakdowns of their various costs and expenses. This document is posted on each of the Agencies' websites and is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Each of the Agencies report on their finances in a slightly different fashion so it is not easy to provide an exact comparasion on an agency to agency basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">In an effort to assist the Deputy, I have asked each of the agencies to provide me with a breakdown of their figures for 2011 and I am informed as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1729">The total administrative costs, including staffing costs, associated with the running of Enterprise Ireland in 2011 was €89.4m of which €19.8m was for the overseas offices and €69.6m for domestic offices, while, in IDA, the comparable figures were €40.1m, of which  €10.5m was for the overseas offices and €29.6m for domestic costs.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1730">The total administrative costs, including staffing costs associated with the running of Shannon Development, including its tourism arm, was €12.6m in 2011.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1731">The total administrative costs, including staffing costs, associated with the running of the 35 County Enterprise Boards was €11.9m in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1732">The Agency staff whose pay is included in these figures are primarily not part of the administration cost of those agencies but are employed full time on the delivery of core programmes such as winning FDI projects, engaging with and advising client companies or promoting exports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">I will arrrange to forward to the Deputy a series of tables, one  in respect of each agency, showing a breakdown of these costs into remuneration, advertising, rents, rates, service charges, travelling expenses, printing, postage, light, heating, cleaning, consultancy fees etc.</p>

            <p eId="para_1735">In July 2011 the Government approved the draft heads of the Consumer and Competition Bill giving, <i>inter alia</i>, effect to the recommendations of the Advisory Group in full with two amendments: </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1736">one sees the change in relevant Minister for such public interest considerations from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the Minster for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1737">the other relates to designating the relevant Joint Oireachtas Committee as a notifiable body when the Minister is considering proposed media mergers from the public interest aspect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">The recommendations of the Advisory Group are aimed at strengthening the public interest test in respect of media mergers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">While the Advisory Group on Media Mergers reported to the then Minister in 2008, no final decision was reached as to where responsibility for the public interest should lie until this Government approved draft Heads of the Bill in July 2011. This draft is currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">Priority has had to be given in the implementation of our legislative programme to other areas of competition law, particularly the need to meet EU/IMF commitments that have been incorporated in the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">I see no benefit in progressing a stand-alone piece of legislation, to be followed in due course by a more comprehensive package of reforms.  The consolidation of the various element of consumer and competition law into a single Act is entirely in keeping with the principles of better regulation and with the trend within Government to consolidate and simplify legislation for ease of reference for all users.</p>

            <p eId="para_1743">The Competition Authority is the statutory body responsible for the enforcement of competition law in the State.  Section 29(3) of the Competition Act 2002 provides that the Authority is independent in the performance of its functions.  Under section 30(1)(<i>b</i>) of that Act, the Competition Authority is responsible for investigating alleged breaches of the Act.  As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the Authority, I have no direct function in these matters.  </p>
            <p eId="para_1744">In its 2011 Annual Report the Competition Authority acknowledges that allegations of anti-competitive activities in the concrete and cement industries are being investigated by it on foot of information received.  Furthermore I am aware from media coverage that private court proceedings in this area are on-going.  In these circumstances it is inappropriate for me to request the Authority to carry out a market study in this area or to comment further on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1745">Under section 30 subsection (1) of the 2002 Act, the Authority can study and analyse any practice or method of competition affecting the supply and distribution of goods or the provision of services or any other matter relating to competition.  Availing of this provision the Authority has carried out a number of in-depth market studies in various sectors of the economy including professions, banking, transport, private health insurance and the grocery sector.  The Authority has published its reports into these sectors and made recommendations aimed at improving competition in these areas.  This work can involve a detailed economic analysis of a sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1746">Under section 30 subsection (2), I can request the Competition Authority to carry out a study or analysis of any practice or method of competition affecting the supply and distribution of goods or the provision of services.  Such a request however is not a request to carry out an investigation into alleged criminal behaviour.  One exercise involves an in-depth economic analysis of a market; the other involves a criminal investigation into alleged breaches of the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">In the context of the Action Plan for Jobs, I have requested the Authority to identify any sheltered areas of the economy where competition is restricted and commission studies on such areas where appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1749">Supporting new and existing indigenous and foreign-owned businesses, across all regions, is central to our plans for recovery, growth and jobs.  The Action Plan for Jobs contains a number of measures which are aimed specifically at the facilitation and incentivisation of national enterprise development from start-ups to growth companies.  It also sets out measures that will enhance linkages between foreign owned multi-national and indigenous Irish companies through for example, enhanced sub-supply opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1750">The Plan is a whole Government plan with a national focus across all regions.  In addition to a continued focus on supporting and growing enterprise, the Action Plan for Jobs sets out an ambitious plan for developing employment initiatives within communities. The range of actions set out in the plan recognises that while it is Government who will create the right operating environment for business growth and job creation, it is the local entrepreneurs who will create the jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1751">The Enterprise Development agencies will be at the forefront of implementing the Action Plan for Jobs across all regions and will ensure that local enterprises can maximise their contribution to economic and jobs growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1752">In terms of the specific supports delivered, a total of €15m was approved to indigenous companies in the Midland and Western Regions in 2011, supporting more than 18,000 jobs.  Additionally, IDA-supported companies employed over 17,500 people between the two regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1753">From the beginning of 2011 to date, IDA Ireland has announced the creation of more than 900 jobs across the two regions in locations including Galway, Tullamore, Athlone and Castlerea Co. Roscommon.  Of the 92 High Potential Start-ups assisted by Enterprise Ireland throughout the country in 2011, four are based in the Midlands region and eight in the West.</p>

            <p eId="para_1758">Vodafone Ireland announced on 22 March that it had completed a review of the company's contracted mobile call-centre operations.  As a result of this review, the company adopted a new model for its mobile customer care, resulting in a move to a new provider, Teleperformance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">Vodafone Ireland and Rigney Dolphin have entered a six-week consultation process with employee representatives.  With effect from 8 May, 27 Vodafone roles and 290 Rigney Dolphin contract roles will transfer to Teleperformance.  Rigney Dolphin will remain a provider to Vodafone for other purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">I have been assured by Vodafone Ireland that the transfer of service will observe the Transfer of Undertakings — Protection of Employees (European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003) Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">I recently met with Vodafone Ireland and the company has confirmed that it is likely that work will move to the Teleperformance site in Newry. I also met representatives of the workers their Union and local public representatives. I understand this transfer process will be a matter for Teleperformance, although Vodafone will continue to participate in the consultation period.  I understand that Vodafone has agreed with Teleperformance that in the event of a move to Newry, all affected Vodafone and Rigney Dolphin employees will have the option to transfer to Newry when their role relocates.  Teleperformance have guaranteed that terms and conditions will carry forward to Newry for those who choose to move, and alternatives for those who choose not to transfer will be discussed through the consultation process.  While the situation that has arisen on this occasion is regrettable, it is nevertheless reflective of the competitive forces that affect the sector concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1762">In my meeting with Vodafone, the company made it clear that this decision has been taken for commercial reasons and they are not in a position to reverse it. The company have indicated that the work which they have on fixed line customer service is not under review and is performing well.</p>

            <p eId="para_1766">Work on the Microfinance Loan Fund is being progressed rapidly to achieve an early launch. The Fund will stimulate lending to sustainable microenterprises and is targeted at start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises across all industry sectors, employing not more than 10 people.  It will provide loans of up to €25,000 for commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1767">Heads of a Bill to give effect to the Microfinance Fund have been agreed by Government and the Bill is due for publication in Quarter 2 2012. The Fund will be managed and controlled by the Social Finance Foundation (SFF).</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">Funding of €10m has been allocated as seed capital for the Fund in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation's Vote for 2012. It is anticipated that this €10m will be supplemented by leveraging further funding from private sources, including the banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">The €10m allocation, supplemented by a further €15m raised from private sources over the short to medium term should generate €40m or so in increased lending to microenterprises, creating up to 4,000 jobs over a 5 year period. This is based on an estimated €9 million of loan demand annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">Extrapolating further, the same model should generate between €90m-€100m in additional lending, finance 5,500 microenterprise loans and generate some 8,000 jobs over a 10 year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1771">Initial engagement has taken place with the EIF in relation to the EU Progress Microfinance Guarantee Facility.   A rigorous due diligence process is required to secure EIF accreditation which will continue in Quarter 2.  Following EIF approval of the guarantee facility, and subject to completion of the statutory process it is anticipated that the Loan Fund will commence lending in late Summer.</p>

            <p eId="para_1773">Industrial action by 110 workers at the Irish Cement production plants at Platin, Co. Meath and Castlemungret, Co. Limerick began on 3rd April last.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">I understand that the Labour Court's most recent Recommendation of January 2012 in relation to this dispute was the culmination of a protracted dialogue between the company and the group of unions representing the workers on restructuring issues that had already involved three successive Labour Court Recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1775">The Labour Court noted in its Recommendation of last January that it was not in a position, on the basis of the information provided through a report of a Financial Assessor undertaken following agreement between the parties, to make a definitive recommendation on an adjustment of pay rates and pay structures for the future. The Labour Court had, accordingly, urged the parties to engage with each other regarding the total cost base of the company.</p>
            <p eId="para_1776">The Labour Relations Commission was subsequently closely involved in facilitating talks between the company and the group of unions which were aimed at finding an agreed solution to the matters in dispute. That process of dialogue proceeded to the stage at which proposals for a settlement of the dispute were rejected by the trade unions concerned and a work stoppage commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">I would urge the parties involved in this dispute to have regard to the continuing availability of the industrial relations dispute resolution bodies to assist them in seeking a settlement and in addressing the underlying challenge of a major restructuring of the company in the face of the dramatic changes in the building industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_1779">Enterprise Ireland has an established Performance Development system for all staff working in the agency and as part of this process objectives are set out for staff to be achieved in their specific role and in an agreed timeframe.

            <p eId="para_1780">The key organisational metrics and targets, including those set by Government, are allocated to each Division in Enterprise Ireland and cascaded down to individual staff in the organisation.

            <p eId="para_1781">The Board monitors the key organisational targets of the agency against the tailored and comprehensive suite of metrics, which reflect the strategic and public policy objectives of the agency (e.g. targets for exports, high potential start-up support, and job creation). Achievement of these targets is driven by Senior Management working with each relevant Business Unit in Enterprise Ireland.  In addition to rigorous monitoring of the Agency's performance by the Board, Enterprise Ireland is also closely monitored and assessed against agreed metrics by my Department.  Liaison meetings between officials from my Department and Enterprise Ireland take place on a bi-monthly basis to discuss progress against objectives.  This process will be strengthened with the introduction of a Service Level Agreement between the Department and the Agency which is currently being drafted.</p>

            <p eId="para_1783">There are two major elements to the Government's response to unemployment — the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i> and <i>Pathways to Work</i>.  The goal of the Action Plan for Jobs is to support the creation of new jobs in the economy, while the aim of Pathways to Work is to help to ensure that as many of those jobs as possible are filled by people from the Live Register.  Both documents are fundamentally linked and recognise the need to reform our policies and our structures to secure long-term and lasting results for our enterprise base and for job-seekers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">The aim of Pathways to Work is to develop a new approach in engaging with people on the Live Register.  It contains a number of targets, including the objective of ensuring that at least 75,000 of those currently long-term unemployed will move into employment by 2015, and to reduce the average time spent on the Live Register from 21 months to less than 12 months by the end of 2015.  The public employment services are being reformed to provide better targeted services to both job seekers and employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">The "Action Plan for Jobs" and "Pathways to Work" both recognise the need to ensure that training provided to jobseekers is consistent with the needs of the labour market.

            <p eId="para_1788">Water metering and water charges for business have been in place for a number of years.  The process enables businesses to contribute towards the cost of water provision, as well as providing them with a mechanism to monitor and control their water usage and reduce waste of the resource.</p>
            <p eId="para_1789">Current proposals in relation to the introduction of domestic water metering should not impact negatively on business.  If anything, broadening the base of water charges to include a contribution from domestic users should help businesses by spreading the burden of contributions, further reducing wastage and enabling the relevant water authority to use increased revenue to upgrade supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_1790">It is important that we reduce the costs of doing business in every way possible in order to improve the competitiveness of the economy and support jobs.  I have recently written to all of my Ministerial colleagues, with a view to identifying charges to business which can be reduced or frozen over the next two years.  Their responses are being collated and I will make a further announcement shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1800">Innovation Fund Ireland (IFI) is a key pillar of support for dynamic new industries, and investments through the Fund will facilitate job creation in innovative export focused sectors as well as providing a return to the exchequer over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1801">€250 million was made available to the Fund to make commitments. This funding runs along two parallel tracks.  The first comprises a €125 million pool of funds provided by the Exchequer and managed by Enterprise Ireland. The second is for a similar amount and designed to allow Ireland's National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) to make a similar level of commercial investments assuming its criteria are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">Following the first call for expressions of interest in September 2010, a large number of responses were received from a sectorally and geographically diverse group of companies.  Enterprise Ireland made a number of commitments alongside the NPRF and the first investment by Enterprise Ireland was the commitment of $25m from Enterprise Ireland, along with $12.5m from the NPRF, to Sofinnova SVP VIII, announced in March this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">As well as its investment in Sofinnova Ventures, the NPRF have made three other investments.  The first investments were in DJF Esprit and DFJ Venture Capital resulting in a partner being hired on the ground in Ireland to invest in Irish companies. The other NPRF investment is in Polaris which has resulted in the establishment of the first Dogpatch Incubator Lab outside of the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">The Government looks forward to announcing the other commitments as the fund managers' process of fundraising is completed. Irish investment activity will be announced by the fund managers over the lifetime of the fund. Due to commercial sensitivities, Enterprise Ireland does not disclose individual drawdowns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1805">Under the Scheme, Enterprise Ireland requires the VC to establish an office in Ireland and to invest the equivalent of the Enterprise Ireland commitment in Irish companies or companies with significant operations in Ireland. Aside from these conditions, Enterprise Ireland invests on the same terms as the private sector sharing the risk and the rewards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1806">Following a commitment made in the Action Plan for Jobs a second call for proposals was issued last month following the announcement of the first investment under the first call for expressions of interest. Both Enterprise Ireland and the NPRF are actively marketing this second call at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_1808">Arising from our commitments under the Good Friday Agreement, my Department and its agencies play a strong role in promoting the development of the all-island economy through involvement in cross-border enterprise initiatives, which have resulted in benefits to both parts of the island.  A key development has been the establishment of Inter <i>Trade</i>  Ireland (ITI), one of the North/South Implementation Bodies, established under the Good Friday Agreement.  This Agency is jointly funded by my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland with a budget of approx. €10m. </p>

            <p eId="para_1810">In summary, the following overall achievements have been recorded by ITI to date—</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1811">19,000SMEs have benefited from its cross-border information activities, 2,400 have taken part in their all-island programmes, £600 million worth of trade and business development has been generated, 1,300 new jobs have been created.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">Last year alone, almost 3,000 companies used its services. The Agency has a range of performance targets in its Business Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">In addition, close co-operation has been established in particular between Invest NI and Enterprise Ireland. Since 2006, clients of both agencies can access market services, trade missions, overseas offices, trade fairs, seminars, market development programmes etc., provided by each agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1814">An example of close agency cooperation is the Acumen Programme, a key all-island business development programme managed by InterTradeIreland and supported by Enterprise Ireland, Invest NI, FAS, Udaras, and the County Enterprise Boards. The Programme is designed to stimulate cross-border sales and coordinate development amongst SMEs, North and South, to establish and build market presence in the other jurisdiction. This is an excellent example of all relevant bodies coming together to drive enterprise development in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">My Department, along with the enterprise development agencies, will continue to work diligently with our Northern Ireland counterparts and their agencies to increase the economic benefits accruing from cross-border co-operation, as well as through the work of the North South Bodies, and the North South Ministerial Trade and Business Development Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">I am satisfied that there is strong ongoing cooperation between the enterprise development agencies, North and South, which makes a valuable and tangible contribution to the cross-border region.</p>

            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_1818">I have commenced a reform process to deliver world-class workplace relations service.  My aim is to provide a simple, independent, effective, impartial, cost effective and workable means of redress and enforcement, within a reasonable period of time.  Enforcing the awards of the Workplace Relations Bodies will be an important element of this reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1819">It is my intention to develop a new and more effective method of enforcing awards of the bodies.  I propose to deal with this matter in the Workplace Relations Bill which I aim to have enacted in the autumn of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1820">The new Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court will deal with both industrial relations and employment rights.  It is important to differentiate between recommendations delivered as part of the voluntarist industrial relations systems and awards made under employment rights legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1821">The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntarist in nature.  The State provides a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper.  It is expected that the parties to a dispute come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the recommendations made. It should be noted however, that either party to a dispute may reject such recommendations. Accordingly I have no plans to make any changes to alter this voluntarist principle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1822">The mechanism for enforcing awards made under employment rights legislation by the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the Rights Commissioners or the Labour Court is prescribed in the relevant legislation under which the award was made.  Generally, this involves an application by, or on behalf of, the employee to the Circuit Court or District Court.  The Minister may also, on the request of the employee, take enforcement proceedings on the latter's behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_1823">I am aware from the cases in respect of which such requests were made to the Minister during the last twelve months and from the consultation process I undertook last autumn that there is increased concern regarding the number of employers who are failing or refusing to comply with awards of the bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">When I came into office last year I identified the need to reform the entire Workplace Relations structures and processes including the enforcement mechanisms.  The problems had been well documented and the issues had been extensively reviewed over many years.  The system was so complex that even practitioners had difficulty understanding and accessing it.  There were, and in some cases still are, long delays scheduling hearings and further delays in issuing decisions.  I did not believe that this was an acceptable level of service.  I have commenced a major process of reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure. I intend to have this legislation enacted by autumn this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">Substantial progress has already been made and a number of important priority actions that I identified last July have been successfully delivered within the target timescale. These include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1827">The establishment of a single contact portal called "Workplace Relations Customer Services" which provides a single point of entry into the system for workplace relations complaints and information.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1828">Complaints are now acknowledged and the employer is notified within, on average, five working days of the complaint being lodged which increases the likelihood of employers and employees resolving issues sooner and has substantially reduced the backlog for certain hearings.  This process was taking up to eight months in some cases prior to the reform.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1829">A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints and an interim website, workplacerelations.ie, were launched on the 4th of January this year.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1830">Delivery of a pilot Early Resolution Service has commenced.  This service, which will enter a pilot phase in early May this year, will assist parties to a dispute to resolve the issue themselves with the assistance of a Case Resolution Officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1831">I sought the views of all interested parties on how the system can be improved as part of the consultation last autumn and more recently in the Blueprint I published on April 5th this year.  This document sets out, in considerable detail, how reform of the workplace relations structures and processes will be achieved.  It also provides a further opportunity for interested parties to contribute comments and feedback on the future design of the State's workplace relations structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1832">In that regard views have been sought on how awards of the Workplace Relations bodies can better be enforced.  I am open to positive suggestions and advice in relation to how this can be achieved.</p>

          if he will clarify if the terms of reference of the copyright review committee established by him in May 2011 includes scope to directly examine the issue of copyright-holders recourse to seek injunctions against intermediaries whose customers and users may be infringing copyright; if this particular issue is planned to be addressed by means of new primary legislation on copyright in the lifetime of this Government; if so, when such legislation is expected to be prepared and tabled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Sean Sherlock)</from>
            <p eId="para_1834">I wish to point out that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Mr. Richard Bruton, T.D. established the independent Copyright Review Committee on 9th May, 2011 to examine the current Copyright legislative framework to identify any areas of the legislation that might be deemed to create barriers to innovation and to make recommendations to resolve any problems identified.  The terms of reference of the Copyright Review are as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1835">Examine the present national Copyright legislation and identify any areas that are perceived to create barriers to innovation.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1836">Identify solutions for removing these barriers and make recommendations as to how these solutions might be implemented through changes to national legislation.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1837">Examine the US style "fair use" doctrine to see if it would be appropriate in an Irish/EU context.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1838">If it transpires that national copyright legislation requires to be amended but cannot be amended, (bearing in mind that Irish copyright legislation is bound by the European Communities Directives on Copyright and Related Rights and other international obligations) make recommendations for changes to the EU Directives that will eliminate the barriers to innovation and optimise the balance between protecting creativity and promoting and facilitating innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1839">The Copyright Review Committee published a wide-ranging Consultation Paper on 29th February, 2012 which examines the current Copyright legislative framework to identify any areas of the legislation that might be deemed to create barriers to innovation.  The Consultation Paper is a discussion document which sets out issues and concerns which were expressed to the Committee in submissions from a broad spectrum of interested parties on foot of an initial consultation process held during the summer of 2011 (in the region of 100 submissions were received during the initial consultation process).</p>
            <p eId="para_1840">The fundamental aim of this Paper is to begin the process of sketching reforms to Irish copyright law to further innovation without denying protection to those who need copyright law to innovate.  I would specifically refer to Chapter 6 of the Review Committee's Consultation Paper which is concerned with intermediaries and it is stated that "One of the main questions for the present Review is whether the copyright balance between rights-holders and intermediaries now requires further amendment, in particular to incentivise innovation."  If any interested party has any concerns in this regard, I would suggest that they engage with this review process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1841">It should be noted that the Review Committee is carrying out the review of the existing Copyright legislation independently of the Department and/or Government.  The Review Committee will ultimately present a Report with a set of recommendations for legislative change.  It is anticipated that this Report will be completed by the end of 2012.  I wish to state that the recommendations for legislative change which are put forward in the Review Committee's final Report will be afforded careful consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_1853">The issue of access to credit is critical to support economic growth and encourage start-ups and entrepreneurship.  It is explicitly addressed in the Action Plan for Jobs in the context of the introduction of a Micro-enterprise Loan Fund, which has a significant entrepreneurship focus, the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme, and in the range of actions listed to encourage and measure new bank lending.</p>
            <p eId="para_1854">The Microfinance Loan Fund will provide small loans of up to €25,000 to start-up, newly established, and existing Microenterprises with under 10 employees, across all industry sectors.  The Government are allocating €10 million as seed capital for the Fund. It is anticipated that the Fund will supplement this seed capital by leveraging further funding from private sources, including the banks. The €10m allocation, supplemented by a further €15m raised from private sources over the short to medium term, should generate €40m or so in increased lending to microenterprises, creating up to 4,000 jobs over a 5 year period. This is based on an estimated €9 million of loan demand annually. Extrapolating further, the same model should generate between €90m-€100m in additional lending, finance 5,500 microenterprise loans and generate some 8,000 jobs over a 10 year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1855">The Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme will facilitate up to €150m of additional lending per annum to micro, small and medium enterprises who are on the margins of commercial lending decisions.  This Scheme will provide a 75% guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to both start-ups and existing businesses. The Scheme will facilitate new lending, encourage investment and company growth (scaling), save jobs and facilitate the creation of new jobs, and will boost trade. The benefits forecast to arise from this intervention in each year of operation, on the basis of each tranche of €150m of additional lending to SMEs, include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1856">Over 1,300 jobs created;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1857">Over €25m of exchequer benefits in tax revenues and welfare cost savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1858">These interventions will benefit enterprises by enabling them to access credit that they would not otherwise obtain, for various purposes such as improving cashflow, developing new products and markets, and job creation.  The Government's commitment to improve the financing environment and the key actions we are delivering under the Action Plan for Jobs will create new jobs, sustain existing jobs, and create economic opportunities for both new and existing businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">These targeted measures supplement the initiatives already taken by the Minister for Finance to restructure, re-capitalise, reorganise and deleverage the banking system to ensure a properly functioning banking system and stimulate an adequate flow of credit into the economy, thereby supporting economic growth for all business including indigenous SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1860">These Government initiatives are being implemented as a priority to ensure a properly functioning banking system and stimulate an adequate flow of credit into the economy, thereby supporting economic growth for all business including indigenous SMEs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1869">Job creation is at the top of the Government's agenda.  Since we came into office, we have been working hard to create the improved economic conditions which will support the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new ones.  Our objective is to put the country back on the road to economic recovery and full employment.  The Action Plan for Jobs, which I launched on 13 February, outlines the Government's plan to rebuild the economy and create jobs.  The plan includes measures aimed at exploiting sectoral opportunities, including those in the manufacturing and services sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1870">The measures planned include the establishment of a Manufacturing Development Forum (MDF) to assist the Government in identifying the needs of manufacturing enterprises and to progress a transformation agenda in this area.

            <p eId="para_1871">In terms of the services sector, the Action Plan outlines a range of sectoral initiatives, with particular focus on International Financial Services, Business Process Outsourcing/Shared Services, Education Services, Retail and Wholesale, Tourism, Construction Services and ICT Services.

            <p eId="para_1893">The achievement of balanced regional growth is a core objective of Government.  Promoting entrepreneurship, attracting inward investment and facilitating the key infrastructural needs of Irish enterprise across all regions is vital to ensuring a vigorous pipeline of new business leaders, new business ideas and entrepreneurial activity.  The Action Plan for jobs is a whole of Government, national strategy aimed at creating and sustaining jobs across all regions of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1894">The objective of balanced regional development is supported by the EU Commission's Regional Aid Guidelines, which recognise that some regions can face significant structural disadvantage.  The Guidelines permit member states to grant higher investment aid to these areas. Under Ireland's current Regional Aid Map, the highest rates are afforded to the Border, Midlands and West (BMW) region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1895">Under the Action Plan for jobs, the establishment of a one-stop-shop to provide micro enterprise support through the dissolution of the existing CEB offices and the creation of a new network of Local Enterprise offices (LEOs) will ensure an enhanced delivery of support to micro enterprises in the regions in question and nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1896">Specifically in relation to the regions in question, Enterprise Ireland's network of offices includes Sligo, Letterkenny and Dundalk.  This regional spread allows the agency to drive take-up of its services and supports such as entrepreneurship programmes focused on identifying new business opportunities, at a local level, thereby maximising take up and impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_1897">It is worth noting that over the last four years, Enterprise Ireland supported 64 High Potential Start Ups in the Border, Midland and West Regions region (17 in 2008; 16 in 2009; 13 in 2010 and 18 in 2011).</p>

            <p eId="para_1899">The sectors referred to by the Deputy are amongst those areas identified in the Action Plan for Jobs as sectors where Ireland can realise jobs growth.  The objective of the Action Plan is to support the creation of 100,000 net new jobs over the period 2012 to 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_1900">In general, specific targets have not been set for each of the individual sectors.  The Action Plan envisages that 20,000 new additional jobs can be created in manufacturing, and 30,000 in internationally traded services, over the next five years.  An additional 50,000 indirect spin-off jobs can be created over the same period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1901">However, various studies have identified the jobs potential in some key sectors.  For example, a study carried out by Goodbody Economic Consultants for Microsoft Ireland suggests that Cloud Computing has the potential to create more than 8,000 jobs within the ICT sector by 2014.  A Forfás study on Digital Games estimates that employment in this sector could double from 2,500 to 5,000 by the end of 2014.  The Strategy for the International Financial Services industry sets an objective to increase employment in this sector by 10,000 by 2016.  Employment in the construction and retail sectors has been particularly affected by global economic downturn.  However, Government investment in infrastructure under the Capital Programme will support in the region of 30,000 jobs in construction in the period to 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_1902">The Action Plan for Jobs sets out specific measures to realise the jobs potential in each of these sectors.  However, the challenges facing each sector are also identified.  Ensuring that all of the measures in the 2012 Action Plan — and in the Action Plans for subsequent years — are implemented will provide the best means of ensuring that employment opportunities are maximised in each sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1904">In the context of regional and all-island economic development, and recognising the opportunity to pursue mutually beneficial cross border co-operation on aspects of economic policy and infrastructure/spatial planning, IDA Ireland cooperates on a number of initiatives with Invest Northern Ireland.  Both agencies also share a strategic focus on attracting companies from the targeted sectors of ICT, Financial Services and Clean technologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1905">IDA Ireland and Invest NI have jointly developed the North West Business and Technology Zone (NWBTZ).  The fundamental aim has been to capitalise on the combined strengths of Letterkenny and Derry City as an economic corridor, to develop compatible infrastructure and property solutions, which are now in place, and to make the region more attractive for investment.  Overall, the joint project has drawn down €10 million in EU Interreg IIIA funding (IDA €4M and Invest NI €6M) towards the development of cross border property solutions and research facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1906">The initiative has provided the catalyst for Eircom, Bytel and BT to invest independently in the telecoms infrastructure between Letterkenny and Derry.  Also, work undertaken by IDA and INI has led to the development of Project Kelvin, which is the first direct International Communications link of its kind into the North West of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1907">Another objective of the NWBTZ has been the facilitation of greater interaction between Third Level Institutions and Industry in the Letterkenny-Derry corridor in areas such as Collaborative R&amp;D and Industry relevant training programmes in sectors of strategic interest to both Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1908">The economies of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland both have a highly educated workforce and IDA Ireland highlights this competitive advantage to perspective investors.  IDA Ireland's target is to ensure that 50% of FDI projects secured between 2010 and 2014 will be located outside of Dublin and Cork.  The education and skills of the catchment area of a region is vital to the success of this strategic target.  The skills pool available, both north and south of the Border, is presented to potential investors as a key competitive advantage of investing in the Border region on the island of Ireland.  Up to 15% of IDA supported companies in the Border region employ staff living in Northern Ireland, increasing employment and prosperity in areas north of the Border.  A recent example of this is PayPal who chose to invest in Dundalk based on the pool of skilled staff it could recruit from the large catchment area incorporating both sides of the Border.</p>

            <p eId="para_1915">Public procurement affords an opportunity for SMEs to secure new business and grow employment; approximately €14 billion will be spent by public bodies this year in purchasing goods and services.  The Action Plan for Jobs sets out a series of measures to improve access to public procurement for SMEs.  My Department is working collaboratively with key players such as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the National Procurement Service (NPS), Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland to deliver the commitments in the Action Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1916">The National Procurement Service (NPS), Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland, collaboratively and separately, organise events on a regular basis to advise and train SMEs in the public procurement process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1917">The NPS organised or participated in 26 such events over the past 14 months, which were attended by over 2,700 people.  These included events to advise local SMEs on tendering for public sector contracts, training sessions for public sector buyers, workshops aimed at assisting SMEs to access the public procurement market, and — in conjunction with InterTradeIreland, Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland —"Meet the Buyer" events which bring together procuring authorities and potential suppliers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">Enterprise Ireland is assigning advisors and mentors to help client companies to prepare better for public procurement opportunities.  The agency also plays a key role in introducing procuring authorities to suitable innovative SMEs through workshops specially convened for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">InterTradeIreland organises two day training/workshops for SMEs, held north and south of the Border, followed by two days of "one to one" mentoring support.  The participating SMEs can also apply for an additional 3 days consultancy/mentoring thereafter to assist in actual tendering, scoping markets and tailored advice.  These workshops are often over-subscribed and more are planned to be held in 2012 to meet demand.</p>

The progress achieved in the first Quarter of 2012 is just the first stage in delivering on the 270 measures in this year's Action Plan.  The impact of the process in terms of jobs created will be measurable over a longer period.  However, I am encouraged by a number of recent significant job announcements which show an increased level of confidence from investors in the Irish economy and in the Government's policies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1933">When I came into office last year I identified the need to reform the State's workplace relations structures and procedures as a key priority.  The problems had been well documented and the issues had been extensively reviewed over many years.  The system was so complex that even practitioners had difficulty understanding and accessing it.  There were, and in some cases still are, long delays scheduling hearings and further delays in issuing decisions.  This is not an acceptable level of service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1934">The current situation with regard to the workplace relations bodies is as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1935">The National Employment Rights Authority has no inspection backlogs,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1936">The Rights Commissioner Service has no backlogs in respect of hearings,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1937">The Labour Court are now working within a reducing backlog of three months,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1938">The average waiting period for claims to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) to be heard is 76 weeks in Dublin and 80 weeks elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_1939">The EAT has been pro-active in dealing with the volume of cases presented.  The Tribunal has increased the number of cases finalised in 2011 by 11% against the previous year, this in itself being a 29% increase on 2009.  The number of claims being disposed of to end March 2012 continues to show an increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1940">While various short-term steps have been taken to address these delays, my long term objective is to deliver a world-class Workplace Relations service and framework that serves the needs of employers and employees and provides maximum value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_1941">The Reform Programme I have commenced will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC).  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1942">My aim is to provide a simple, independent, effective, impartial, cost effective and workable means of redress and enforcement, within a reasonable period of time.  The system must operate to the highest standards and earn the confidence of employers, employees and all who will use it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1943">All WRC hearings will be conducted by a single person.  The objective of the hearing will be to obtain a just, fair, speedy and efficient resolution of a dispute.  The system will be configured in a way that facilitates early resolution of disputes and should remove the risk of lengthy delays for hearings or other services developing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1944">Substantial progress has already been made and a number of important priority actions that I identified last July have been successfully delivered within the target timescale.  These include the establishment of a single contact portal called "Workplace Relations Customer Services" which provides a single point of entry into the system for workplace relations complaints and information.  Complaints are now acknowledged and the employer is notified within, on average, five working days of the complaint being lodged which increases the likelihood of employers and employees resolving issues sooner and has substantially reduced the backlog for certain hearings.  A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints and an interim website, workplacerelations.ie, were launched on the 4th of January this year.  In addition, delivery of a pilot Early Resolution Service has commenced.  This service, which will enter a pilot phase in early May this year, will assist parties to a dispute to resolve the issue themselves with the assistance of a Case Resolution Officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1945">Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.  I intend to have this legislation enacted by autumn this year.  On 5th April this year I published a Blueprint Document setting out a clear path for the delivery of the remainder of the Reform Programme.  I am inviting feedback on this document and I will consider any constructive advice or suggestions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1957">Calculations on the volume of additional SME borrowing proposals which would be supported by the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme, and estimations of take up are based on:</p>

            <p eId="para_1960">In addition, we recognise that there will be a cohort of discouraged borrowers who may be supported by the Scheme.

It is also anticipated that the introduction of the Scheme may result in an initial surge of pent-up demand from previously discouraged borrowers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1962">At this stage an average loan value of €80,000 is assumed, with an estimated 1,875 loans per annum provided to micro, small and medium enterprises.  These loans will be used for various purposes such as improving cashflow — one of the main constraints on growth by smaller businesses, — developing new products and markets, and expanding activities, thus assisting both job maintenance and creation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1963">Performance and take up will be closely monitored by the Operator on my behalf, and the Scheme will be subject to review by my Department after the first year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1965">My objective is to deliver a world-class Workplace Relations service and framework that serves the needs of employers and employees and provides maximum value for money. The Reform Programme will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission.  The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1966">Substantial progress has already been made and a number of important priority actions that I identified last July have been successfully delivered within the target timescale. These include the establishment of a single contact portal called "Workplace Relations Customer Services" which provides a single point of entry into the system for workplace relations complaints and information.  Complaints are now acknowledged and the employer is notified within, on average, five working days of the complaint being lodged which increases the likelihood of employers and employees resolving issues sooner and has substantially reduced the backlog for certain hearings.  A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints and an interim website, workplacerelations.ie, were launched on the 4th of January this year.  Finally, delivery of a pilot Early Resolution Service has commenced.  This service, which will enter a pilot phase in early May this year, will assist parties to a dispute to resolve the issue themselves with the assistance of a Case Resolution Officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1967">Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure. I intend to have this legislation enacted by autumn this year.  On 5th April this year I published a Blueprint Document setting out a clear path for the delivery of the remainder of the Reform Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1968">The implementation of the Reform Programme will necessarily impact on staff numbers, staff deployments, staff roles and competencies, organisational arrangements, facilities and accommodation and will deliver significant savings to the Exchequer in terms of both reductions in staff numbers and associated costs.  A detailed action plan to deliver change and associated savings will be drawn up on completion of the current consultation process at which time we will have greater certainty on the new structures and framework and on the organisational structures and associated staffing. This year we will spend around €20m of taxpayers' money on the five existing employment dispute resolution bodies.  My aim is to effect significant savings against this expenditure in future years while at the same time providing a greatly enhanced service.</p>

            <p eId="para_1970">The Government's commitment to supporting business is evident from the range of initiatives outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1971">The Plan tackles the issue of access to finance through a range of measures, such as the introduction of a microfinance fund to provide loans of up to €25,000 to micro-enterprises and the roll-out of the temporary partial credit guarantee scheme.  At a most practical level my Department and Enterprise Ireland (EI) will be working closely with the banking sector to assist them in achieving a cultural shift in lending practices towards those companies and sectors that are crucial to economic growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1972">Additionally, under Action Point 3.27, my Department and Small Business Representative organisations are, as part of the ongoing work of implementing the recommendations of the Report of the Advisory Group for Small Business, developing a one page guide, entitled, "Managing out of the Crisis".  This Guide will set out warning signs to encourage small businesses to ask for help and outline services available to help them to get through the current economic environment.  The Guide will be published shortly in accordance with the commitment in the Action Plan for Jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1973">The micro-enterprise supports in Ireland will also be reshaped to put in place an improved enterprise support structure for small businesses throughout Ireland.  EI will work with the Local Authorities to establish a new network of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in each Local Authority, which will combine the enterprise support service of the previous CEBs and the business support work of the Business Support Units in the Local Authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1974">I am also very encouraged by recent developments in the private sector such as the initiative launched by Chartered Accountants Ireland, which sees the its voluntary advice service extended nationwide. <i>www.charteredaccountants.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1975">I am confident that these types of private sector initiatives combined with the focus that this Government has brought to bear on the issues that are of particular concern for business, will yield real benefit to individual enterprises and the economy as a whole in the short to medium term.</p>

            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_1980">The costs of the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme arise in relation to the expenditure on the guarantees paid out when loans default and the operational cost of administering the scheme.  Costs will be partially offset by receipts of premiums paid by borrowers and recoveries achieved in respect of loan defaults.</p>
            <p eId="para_1981">It is important to note that the Scheme will facilitate new lending, encourage investment and company growth (scaling), save jobs and facilitate the creation of new jobs, and will boost trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_1982">The benefits forecast to arise from this intervention in each year of operation, on the basis of each tranche of €150m of additional lending to SMEs, include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1983">Over 1,300 jobs created;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1984">Over €25m of exchequer benefits in tax revenues and welfare cost savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1985">The net cost for an annual portfolio of €150 million of guaranteed lending is approximately €6.38 million, including estimated administration costs of €0.5m per annum.  The proposed three year temporary nature of the scheme caps the costs to the exchequer at approximately €19m.  Assuming that:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1986">1. The Scheme is open for three years (i.e. supports three distinct annual tranches of guaranteed lending),</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1987">2. That for each loan guaranteed the Guarantee is valid for three years (or the term of the loan if shorter) and,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1988">3. The maximum lag between a default occurring and a claim against the Guarantee being settled is two years,</p>
            <p eId="para_1989">then a delivery infrastructure will need to be in place for a total of eight years. The costs are broken down as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1990">Cost of Scheme Administration (estimated x 8 years) —€4.00m,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1991">Gross Cost of Scheme Claims —€33.75m,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1992">Premium Receipts —€18.60m,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1993">Net Cost of Scheme —€19.15m,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1994">Net Cost per €150m Annual Portfolio —€6.38m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1995">My Department does not have the inhouse infrastructure, capacity and skills resources required to operate the Scheme. Therefore, the Government have agreed that the operation of the initiative should be outsourced in order to maximise efficiency, ensure skills capacity and to manage relationships between the State and lenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1996">Having considered a range of possible combinations of guarantee rate and portfolio default limit which, when applied to the guaranteed portfolio, will deliver the desired overall risk share, a guarantee rate of 75% and a portfolio default limit of 10% has been agreed by the Government.  This sets the overall portfolio claim limit at 7.5% (75% x 10%). For a given portfolio of lending allocated to each bank, each loan in the portfolio would carry a 75% guarantee, but potential claims under the guarantee are capped by the 7.5% portfolio claim limit. Therefore, the actual default performance of a portfolio may in fact exceed the portfolio default limit. However, the extent to which the State covers overall losses is capped at the default rate of 10%, and any losses in excess of that must be borne by the Lender.</p>

            <p eId="para_1998">Cloud computing is a key target sector identified in the Action Plan for Jobs as offering major potential for Ireland, and establishing a Cloud Computing Technology Research Centre is one of the actions contained in the plan aimed at realising this potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_1999">Earlier this month, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Richard Bruton TD announced details of a €1.2million initial research programme in the Cloud Computing Technology Research Centre, aimed at helping to make Ireland a world leader in this fast-growing area, and at making a significant contribution to jobs and economic growth. The funding will be allocated over 12 months to a consortium of Higher Education Institutions (DCU, UCC and AIT with input from NUIM) to carry out the initial research programme of the Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_2000">This initiative involves collaboration between Enterprise Ireland and IDA and is led and strongly supported by Irish companies and multinational companies in Ireland.  The research will focus on cloud computing technology architecture, service management, business research and cloud security.  This initial research programme will last 12 months and is a significant step in the context of a Government funded 5 year investment in a Technology Centre for Cloud Computing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2001">A recent study by Goodbody Economic consultants projects that cloud computing sales by Irish firms could reach €9.5 billion per annum by 2014 and provide jobs for 8,600 people as current information technology activities migrate to the Cloud.

            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_2003">The Government are fully conscious of the importance of the Financial Services sector and the opportunities represented by that sector for job creation, especially to replace jobs lost. The <i>Action Plan for Jobs,</i> initiated by my Department last February, assessed the sector, among others and specified a suite of actions to be undertaken this year.  Work is underway on addressing these and, as set out in the progress report for Q1 2012, published last week, good progress has been made already on the relevant actions, in that a new Global Institution Group has been established by the IDA and this group has identified and is engaging with large global financial services groups and preparing an operational plan.  As set out in the <i>Plan,</i> a range of other actions to develop this sector will be pursued over the remainder of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2004">IDA Ireland is fully committed to the further development of this sector. The current IDA strategy is reflected in that Agency's overall strategy <i>“Horizon 2020</i>” published in 2010. At present, the active IDA Ireland International Financial Services portfolio comprises approximately 150 global companies which have more than 220 operations on the ground in Ireland and employ more than 20,000 people. These companies, comprising all of the leading firms, and the total industry in Ireland has more than 1,000 entities and employs more than 25,000. Examples of key IDA clients include:  Citigroup, Bank of New York Mellon, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, Fidelity, State Street, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley.  A number of international financial services companies are now among the largest multinational employers in the country — irrespective of sector — with both Citi and State Street employing more than approximately 2,000 staff each.</p>
            <p eId="para_2005">A number of new initiatives are underway as part of IDA's on-going development of the sector to encourage further inward investment and to support the continued development of their existing clients.  These include research and promotional initiatives, involving active promotion of the sector in both new markets, e.g. the Gulf region and also traditional centres, such as London, Frankfurt and New York.</p>
            <p eId="para_2006">This work has borne solid results. Significant announcements for the sector in 2011 and 2012 to date include Asset Control (50 jobs), Fidelity (100 Jobs), BNY Mellon (50 jobs), Butterfield Fulcrum (60 jobs), HedgeServ (300 jobs), Allianz World Wide Care (128 Jobs), Mastercard (130 jobs) and Blackrock (25 jobs). In addition to pursuing new projects, IDA's financial services team are actively engaged with existing client companies and potential new entrants both at home and overseas, to encourage expansion of existing business lines, win new mandates and attract fresh investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2007">A very welcome development over the last 20 years has been that the geographical footprint of the industry in Ireland has expanded beyond the IFSC to include some significant regional operations in Donegal, Sligo, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Kilkenny. The industry in Ireland now comprises a diverse range of activities including back, middle and front office operations and both regulated and non-regulated entities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2008">Collectively, these investments are significant achievements in view of the global crisis that has impacted the industry over the last two years and highlight Ireland's on-going attractiveness for investment and the Government's sustained commitment to the development of the sector.</p>

EI facilitates such networking through various industry events, seminars, workshops, trade missions and client management development programmes such as Leadership for Growth and International Selling.</p>
            <p eId="para_2011">The role of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) is to provide support to micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases.

It is my understanding that a number of CEBs have had varying levels of interaction with cooperatives over the years.</p>

Mr Al-Khawaja was sentenced to life imprisonment last June in a trial that did not meet international standards.

This delay is unfortunate but I very much hope that next week's hearing will result in some positive developments in relation to Mr Al-Khawaja's case.</p>
            <p eId="para_2016">I discussed this case with Danish Foreign Minister Sovndal at the Gymnich meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Copenhagen in March, and offered any assistance that the Government could provide to assist the Danish authorities in reaching an agreement with the Bahraini authorities in relation to the case of Mr Al-Khawaja, who is a dual Bahraini-Danish citizen.  Officials in my Department have remained in regular contact with the Danish authorities since as well as with other concerned international partners.  The case was also discussed by EU Foreign Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council earlier this week.  I fully support the statement of HR Ashton on 17 April which urged the Bahraini authorities to find a compassionate, pragmatic and humanitarian solution as a matter of urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_2017">My officials have also directly relayed my concerns to the Bahraini authorities, both to the Bahraini Ambassador in London and, through our Ambassador in Riyadh, to the Bahraini Chargé there urging positive consideration of the Danish request that Mr Al-Khawaja be released to Denmark for medical treatment.  I again impress on the Bahraini authorities the need to find a pragmatic and humanitarian solution at this critical juncture.</p>
            <p eId="para_2018">The overall human rights situation in Bahrain continues to give rise to concern and the demonstrations arising from last weekend's holding of the Formula 1 Grand Prix again underline the urgent need for follow-up to last November's Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry report.  I urge the Bahraini authorities and the opposition to engage genuinely and meaningfully in Bahrain's national reconciliation process.   A way must be found through dialogue to chart a new and inclusive future for Bahrain.</p>

            <p eId="para_2026">The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Treaty, was signed by Euro Area Member States on 2 February 2012. The original version of the Treaty was signed on 11 July 2011, but it has been modified to incorporate decisions taken by the Heads of State and Government (HoSG) of the Euro Area on 21 July, 9 December 2011 and 2 March aimed at improving the effectiveness of the mechanism.  These decisions included the agreement on the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (Stability Treaty) in the Economic and Monetary Union. The original ESM treaty, signed in July 2011, needed to be updated to take account of the additional flexibilities agreed by the Euro Area HoSG for the EFSF in late July 2011.  The recital, or preamble to the ESM Treaty provides at recital (5) that member states concerned must ratify the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, and implement the balanced budget rule as specified in that treaty within the agreed timeline (one year after entry into force).</p>
            <p eId="para_2027">The linkage between the ESM and Stability Treaty ratification was accepted in the interests of securing agreement on the ESM and its accelerated entry into force by July 2012.  In the negotiations, the Government sought to ensure that it was made clear that the link between ratification of the Stability Treaty and the ESM Treaty applied only to new applications for assistance under the ESM, and that it will not affect the transfer to the ESM of undisbursed amounts under the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) for Ireland and other programme countries.  The Government also sought to ensure that sufficient time was provided for ratification of the Stability Treaty before the link enters into effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_2028">The Stability Treaty is part of a broader package of measures aimed at improving confidence in the Euro Area, which include the ESM.  It is entirely logical and reasonable that a country receiving the support of its partners under the ESM should be prepared to run sensible budgetary policies as required under the new Treaty.  That is the basis of the linkage. We believe the linkage between the Treaties will further contribute to confidence, solidarity and financial stability in the euro area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2029">In accordance with the terms agreed under the ESM Treaty, the ESM will be established as an International Financial Institution under public international law and will be located in Luxembourg. As agreed by the HoSG on 9 December, Ireland is aiming to ratify the Treaty by July 2012.  Primary legislation will be required to enable Ireland to ratify the ESM Treaty and implement its provisions.</p>

        <b> Deputy Michael McGrath</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
         his plans for the future of the National Pensions Reserve Fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_721">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2072">The Government is committed to ensuring a continuing level of investment in Ireland in the interests of boosting economic activity and generating employment.  It believes that the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) can make a significant contribution to that objective through its involvement in the Strategic Investment Fund and through investment opportunities in Ireland such as the new Irish infrastructure investment fund, as well as through commercial investment in projects in this country, such as the €450 million the Fund has committed to finance the national roll out of domestic water meters, and the Fund's continuing participation in Innovation Fund Ireland.  The resulting greater concentration of investment in Ireland on the part of the NPRF is expected to require the amendment of the NPRF's investment policy, which is set out in the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000. Officials of my Department are liaising with the National Treasury Management Agency, as the Manager of the NPRF, in identifying and drafting the necessary amendments to the legislation and I expect to bring forward proposals for amending legislation as soon as possible once that work is completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2073">As background, I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency, as Manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), that the provisional total value of the Fund was €14.5 billion at 31 December 2011, comprising the Discretionary Portfolio, valued at €5.4 billion, and the Directed Portfolio, currently held at €9.1 billion pending completion of an independent valuation review of the Fund's investments in ordinary shares in Allied Irish Banks (provisionally valued at €0.01 per share) and in preference shares in Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2074">It should be noted that the funds in the Discretionary Portfolio are not all readily accessible. The NPRF Commission has legally committed €1.2 billion to various fund investments, of which over €800 million is for investment in Ireland. The €800 million includes a commitment to provide funding on a commercial basis for the roll-out of the water metering programme subject to certain pre-conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2075">The establishment of the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) was announced by the Government in September 2011. The SIF will channel commercial investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund towards productive investment in the Irish economy. As well as money from the NPRF, the Fund will seek matching commercial investment from private investors and target investment in areas of strategic significance to the future of the Irish economy. It will comprise a series of sub-funds targeted at commercial investment in critical areas of the Irish economy, including infrastructure, venture capital and provision of long-term capital for SMEs. The NPRF will take a lead role in the development and implementation of each sub-fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">The NPRF's investment in the SIF will, like its existing investments, be on a commercial basis. Accordingly, such investment will not be classified as General Government expenditure in statistical terms and there will be no implications for the continued achievement of the General Government Deficit targets we are committed to under the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support to Ireland. Further investment by the NPRF in Ireland on a strictly commercial basis does not represent a material change in the purpose of the NPRF.</p>
            <p eId="para_2077">The NPRF announced in November 2011 a commitment of €250 million to a new Irish infrastructure investment fund which is seeking up to €1 billion from institutional investors in Ireland and overseas and which will invest in infrastructure assets in Ireland, including assets designated for disposal by the Government and commercial State enterprises and also new infrastructure projects. Marketing of this fund in Ireland by Irish Life Investment Managers and abroad by AMP Capital commenced in the first quarter of 2012.  Normally the period from commencement of marketing of an investment fund targeting illiquid assets to closure of financial commitments by investors in such a fund can extend up to one year. In parallel, AMP Capital, the infrastructure manager of the fund, has commenced a process of building a pipeline of appropriate investment opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2078">The NPRF has also committed €450 million to finance the national roll out of domestic water meters.   In addition, the NPRF is actively supporting the development of the market for venture capital in Ireland through its continued participation in Innovation Fund Ireland in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.  On 15 March 2012, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation announced the commencement of the second call for expressions of interest from appropriately qualified international venture capital managers.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2084">State indemnity for personal injury and third party property damage is set out in the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act, 2000 where the management of personal injury and third party property damage claims against certain State authorities, and underlying risks, was delegated to the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).  When performing these functions, the NTMA is known as the State Claims Agency (SCA).  The principal objectives of the State Claims Agency are:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2085">To ensure that the State's liabilities in relation to personal injury claims, and the expenses of the SCA in relation to their management, are contained at the lowest achievable level;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2086">To implement its employer liability, public liability and clinical risk work programmes, including the minimisation of litigation risk factors in State authorities and healthcare enterprises, and the implementation and audit of risk management systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_2087">Where State indemnity applies the State does not purchase insurance for personal injury (employer's and public liability) and third party property damage and as such will not have to bear associated premium costs.  Indemnity works on a pay as you go basis so that all costs associated with personal injury and third party property damage claims are paid directly by the State through a reimbursement system operated by the SCA. Analysis has demonstrated that the States cost of dealing with claims directly is significantly lower than the premium cost of insuring the risk.  This has yielded significant annual savings as the State no longer has to pay insurance premiums for delegated classes of claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_2088">In order to maximise the savings the State must manage the claims made against it at the best possible cost.  In conjunction with the State the SCA has a strong track record in reducing the cost of managing claims under its remit.  For example during 2011 the SCA achieved significant savings on claims and related legal costs associated with the management of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme (CIS). An independent actuarial assessment projected that €106 million would be required to satisfy CIS claims and related costs in 2011. The outturn for the year was €81 million, representing a saving of €25 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2089">To date the SCA has managed over 10,000 personal injury (including clinical negligence claims) and third party property damage claims.  The SCA manages a claim from the point of claims notification through to final resolution. Claims are investigated in a thorough and timely fashion in order to facilitate early decision-making in relation to liability and strategy. The SCA uses panels of service providers, such as solicitors, medical consultants and engineers to provide expert advice on the State's behalf.  Each claim is allocated a notional estimated liability and this is updated as new medical and other expert information becomes available. The SCA then decides, in relation to each claim, whether it should be contested in the courts or whether settlement negotiations should begin and then manages the claim through to final resolution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2090">
              <i>Risk Management</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_2091">The SCA hosts a national electronic reporting system which facilitates the identification of clusters of adverse incidents and allows for root cause analysis of claims.  The lessons learned from this analysis support the improvement of employee, public and patient safety and contribute to the reduction of incidents and claims in delegated State Authorities.  When serious adverse events or trends are identified by the SCA, it responds by undertaking detailed analysis, providing advice and making recommendations. The SCA responds by undertaking detailed analysis and/or reviews/audits and providing advice and making recommendations.  Annually, the SCA plans and implements employers liability, public liability (including clinical risk) and third party property damage risk management work programmes in conjunction with State Authorities under its remit, based on claims and incident data trend analysis, legal requirements and precedents and recent developments in litigation risk management, nationally or internationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">Significant projects implemented in 2010 and 2011 included:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2093">Rollout of the new safety management system to all Irish Prison Service locations and certification of two locations to the international specification OHSAS 18001 — the first prison locations in Europe to receive this award;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2094">Training in general health and safety and field risk assessments to almost 400 staff in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and the Marine;</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2096">A self-assessment on-line survey of over 700 State buildings, including over 400 Garda Síochána locations, focussing on fire safety management.

            <p eId="para_2100">State Authorities who have actively engaged in these initiatives have shown significant reduction in numbers and costs of incidents and claims.  In addition to this, over 2,500 ad-hoc requests for advice and consultancy services are received annually. This includes insurance advice on contracts, licenses, schemes and tenders in circumstances where State indemnity applies or on insurances required where it does not apply.  This ensures that the State's liabilities are minimised in the most cost-effective manner.</p>

The Central Bank has advised me that in early 2011, loan loss assessments under conservative, base and stressed case scenarios were carried out on the loan books of four Irish credit institutions.  As part of the process, detailed loan level data covering residential mortgages was gathered on the credit portfolios of the institutions involved. Drawing from the data, the Central Bank assess that approximately 145,000 properties were in negative equity in the last quarter of 2010.</p>

However, in light of current competing demands on the Department’s capital budget, it is not possible at this time to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of this project to construction stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_2315">A 10% reduction in salary applies to new entrants to the public service, including teachers, who commenced employment for the first time on or after 1 January 2011. This is in accordance with the Budget 2011 decision taken by the previous administration.  Teachers appointed for the first time on or after 1 January 2011 also commence employment at the first point of the salary scale.  Incremental credit for the length of time in college training as a teacher is no longer reckonable.  The salary scales applicable to teachers who commenced employment for the first time on or after 1 January 2011 in posts funded by my Department are outlined in Circular 0040/2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2316">The Government announced as part of Budget 2012 that, pending completion of the public service-wide review of allowances, changes to teacher qualification allowances were being made with immediate effect.  These changes affect both existing teachers and new appointees in the future.  Under Budget 2012 teachers appointed before 5 December 2011 are not paid an allowance where they acquire further qualifications after that date.  Allowances for teachers first appointed between 5 December 2011 and 31 January 2012 are payable up to a maximum of €4,226 which was the rate applicable to Honours Primary Degree allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2317">Pending the outcome of the review of allowances and premium payments by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, allowances are not payable to new beneficiaries from 1 February 2012.  The only exceptions to this prohibition are principal and deputy principal allowances and, for a limited period of time, the assistant principal allowance.  These decisions were taken due to the upward pressure on the cost of teacher allowances.  These provisions are outlined in Circular 70/2011 and Circular 3/2012.  These measures are concerned with the sustainability of the public service pay bill and in particular the need to find payroll savings in the education vote.  Without immediate action, this upward pressure would have cancelled out the savings made elsewhere in the education system and would bring about even harsher adjustments to schools and services.  I am not in a position to comment further until the outcome of the review is known.</p>

            <p eId="para_2319">The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The relevant appointment and retention figures for mainstream staffing for the coming school year have been published on the Department's website. However, the staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of other budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process. The reform of the allocation process is designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools so there will inevitably be some schools that will lose posts and some schools that will gain posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2320">The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0007/2012.  The Primary Staffing Appeals Board met last week. A total of 367 schools submitted appeals to the Appeals Board. These appeals were considered in accordance with the appeals criteria set out in Department Staffing Circular 0007/2012.  205 schools had their appeals upheld by the Staffing Appeals Board. A summary outcome of the appeals is now published on my Department's website. Individual schools are being notified this week of the outcome of their appeals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2321">My Department's focus is on notifying schools of the outcome of their appeals and to implement the staffing arrangements for the coming school year.  The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the Autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed and all appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_2323">There is significant debate around the relative importance attached to rankings criteria and on their capacity to fully capture the quality of what is on offer in higher education institutions. The Times Higher Education World Reputation rankings are a new set of rankings in its second year and are based on reputational surveys only.  Despite some decline, Irish universities continue to figure prominently in world rankings. Irish institutions are featuring in the top 1% in the world. In 2011, two Irish institutions were in the top 200 and another three in the top 400 Times Higher Education World University ranked institutions out of some 15,000 universities worldwide. Moreover, the overall performance of the Irish system was highly ranked; 17th place overall and 6th place globally relative to our GDP.  Delivering high quality higher education for a growing proportion of our population within our current resources will mean that we need to maintain a clear focus on system performance overall rather than a narrower focus on individual institutional performance.</p>

It is not possible therefore to provide a definitive response to this question. I can confirm that in the six month period from November 2011 to 25 April 2012 my Department answered approximately 2000 Parliamentary Questions. It has been estimated by officials in my Department that approximately 60 Parliamentary Questions were initially submitted to my Department and transferred to other Departments during this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2357">The main reason for transferring a Parliamentary Question is when the subject matter of a particular question falls within the responsibility of another Minister. Questions are also transferred, in accordance with Standing Orders, when the subject matter has been addressed within the previous two weeks in the case of a question for written answer, or within the previous four months in the case of a PQ for oral answer (or in response to an issue raised under Standing Order 21).</p>

            <p eId="para_2373">The Deputy's question concerns a dispute between the company and 20 employees in relation to a claim for enhanced redundancy terms of four weeks pay per year of service in addition to statutory redundancy entitlements, following the acquisition of the company and the closure of its Dublin offices in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2374">The company rejected the workers' claim for enhanced redundancy terms and, following failure to resolve the dispute at local level, the matter was referred to the Labour Court for adjudication, in accordance with Section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1969.  A Labour Court recommendation under Section 20(1) is binding on the union, but not on the company.</p>
            <p eId="para_2375">A Labour Court hearing took place on 20 January, 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2376">Having considered the position of both sides the Labour Court recommended that the claimants should be paid an <i>ex gratia</i> redundancy payment equal to four weeks’ pay inclusive of the statutory payment already paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_2377">The Labour Court conducts hearings on trade disputes and issues recommendations setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it should be settled.  The Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process, and it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to give serious consideration to the Court's recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2378">However, the system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature and recommendations of the Labour Court are not legally binding.  Neither the Labour Court, nor I, can compel a company to comply with such recommendations.  Ultimately, responsibility for the settlement of a trade dispute rests with the parties to the dispute.</p>
            <p eId="para_2379">I understand that the company has complied with its obligations in respect of statutory redundancy payments and that a total of 35 redundancy rebate claims have been made to the Department of Social Protection in respect of the company concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_2383">Policy related to the development of skills for the economy is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.  However, the Government's Pathway to Work Policy on labour market activation commits to improved matching of skills with the needs of enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2384">The Department of Education and Skills will fund over 450,000 education and training places, this year, across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors.  The alignment of many FÁS training programmes with evolving labour market needs is evidence-based and is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2385">In a direct response to specific skills shortages in the ICT sector, earlier this year the Department of Education and Skills published a joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan aimed at building the supply of high level ICT graduates.  As part of the Plan, more than 750 places have been made available on new ICT skills conversion programmes which are being rolled out immediately in higher education institutes across the country. There has been extensive involvement with enterprise in the design and delivery of these programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2386">Additionally, under Springboard 2011, 4,305 people were supported to undertake courses in areas of identified skills needs such as ICT, Pharamachem and the Green Economy.  In February 2012, more than 500 additional places were made available and €10 million has been made available to support the roll-out of Springboard in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2387">With regard to average skill levels in jobs created over the last 12 months, my Department and its agencies do not monitor this type of information.  However, the structure of our economy, with our focus on export driven growth in high value added Manufacturing and International and Financial Services, demands high skill levels from its employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_2388">In 2011, the Enterprise Development Agencies created over 9,000 jobs in the Manufacturing Sector while over 11,000 jobs were created in the International and Financial Services Sectors.</p>

            <p eId="para_2390">Since taking office, my colleagues Minister Sherlock, Minister Perry and I, along with senior officials from my Department, have availed of every opportunity to engage with the EU institutions on policies of mutual concern regarding jobs, growth and investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2391">Bilateral meetings have been held at both official and Ministerial level with Commission and high ranking EU Officials, EU partners and like-minded Groups.  We have discussed with like-minded partners the prioritisation of EU initiatives under the Single Market Act, which, in particular, add value to the jobs, growth and investment agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_2392">We are continuing to work to analyse our strategic interests and funding possibilities under the EU's new Research Programme (Horizon 2020 —€80bn) and the proposed Programme for Competitiveness and SMEs (COSME —€2.5bn).  These Programmes are part of the EU's Multiannual Financial Framework Budget 2014-2020.  In that regard every opportunity will be taken to further Ireland's interests to ensure that we can secure the maximum benefit from the funding available under these Programmes, particularly in relation to maximising the scope for participation by SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2393">During my attendance at the informal Competitiveness Council in February last, I met with the Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, Neelie Kroes, where we discussed the Digital Single Market and in particular maximising the enterprise potential from e-commerce and the strategic digital services sectors.  On 19 April, I met with Vice-President and Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship, Antonio Tajani, where we discussed several key strategic initiatives of national importance for our competitiveness and jobs initiatives including the COSME Programme, access to finance for SMEs, internationalisation of SMEs, reduction in administrative burdens for business, and the pursuance of a free, fair and open trade agenda to further Ireland's export-led recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_2394">We will continue to work with our EU partners, the EU Commission and the EP to progress these policy instruments and associated measures through the various Council Working Groups and Committees including through the EU Competitiveness Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_2395">I will also continue to fully engage in the development of the EU's common commercial policies, which I believe provide a strong stimulus for growth and job creation.  This year may see the successful conclusion of the Free Trade Agreements with important markets for Ireland including India, Singapore and Canada.  This year should also see the mapping out of future trade and investment relations with the US in the context of the EU-US High Level Group and Jobs which is due to report before the end of 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_2399">Ireland has built a strong reputation in terms of quality and efficiency in a range of manufacturing and services sectors.  Notwithstanding challenges in areas such as costs and skills, Ireland is well positioned to exploit the advances in manufacturing technology and to build and maintain a strong base of manufacturing and services activity, particularly in the growth areas identified in the Action Plan for Jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2400">Manufacturing in Ireland spans a wide range of sectors including food and drink, ICT hardware, medical technologies, pharmaceutical bioprocessing, engineering and industrial products, including "green/cleantech" products.  These high value manufacturing sectors are the areas where Ireland is, and can continue to be, competitive, rather than in the high volume, low value-added production processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2401">The Action Plan for Jobs sets out a range of specific actions directed at the manufacturing sector to be undertaken by Government this year.  Together with a number of other measures set out in the Plan, these will support and grow employment in manufacturing.  Key measures include: The establishment of a Manufacturing Development Forum to assist the Government in identifying the immediate needs of manufacturing enterprise and also to assist in the development of a strategic long term plan for the sector, and The evaluation of existing support programmes to ensure they meet the needs of manufacturing enterprises and the exploration of additional financial supports that may be required to support the sector, within the context of EU State aid negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2402">Other measures in the Action Plan for Jobs which are designed to improve the competitiveness of the economy will benefit both manufacturers and service providers.  Details of the specific actions to be taken are set out in the Action Plan which is available on my Department's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_2424">It is an unfortunate reality that companies for a wide range of reasons find themselves in difficulty and early intervention is critically important.  For this reason, the Enterprise Development agencies operate an early warning system, which has been in place for over ten years.  When triggered, this mechanism brings the full capacity of the agency concerned to bear on whatever situation has arisen within the client company.</p>
            <p eId="para_2425">For example, when Enterprise Ireland is made aware of jobs at risk, it engages closely with those client companies reporting difficulties or potential job loses to determine what appropriate proactive measures can be put in place by the agency to prevent or minimise the job losses.  When IDA Ireland becomes aware of a company's intention to either downsize or cease operating in Ireland, it works with the client company to safeguard and minimise the number of job losses through offering to help the companies to improve competitiveness; enhance their use of technology; grow the skills of their employees; engage in research, development and innovation or develop their business processes.  Similarly, as soon as Shannon Development becomes aware of jobs at risk, it proactively engages with companies to offer whatever supports are available to minimise the impact as regards job losses.</p>
            <p eId="para_2426">There are many differing and complex factors that can influence a firm's decision to relocate in today's modern globalised economic environment.  Companies change location to address matters such as accessing new markets, moving production nearer to customers, meeting firm or market specific customer relationship issues, in addition to business takeovers and consolidations.  Recent jobs losses which have occurred in the FDI sector in Ireland are largely the result of the continuing restructuring process that is ongoing in Ireland and other developed economies, driven by competitive pressures and technological change.  This can result in jobs at the lower end of the value added scale being either phased out completely or relocated to lower cost locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2427">The early warning system is kept under review so as to ensure that it is fit for purpose.</p>

         the main factors likely to encourage foreign direct investment here; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [21134/12]

          <speech by="#RichardBruton" as="#Minister_for_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation" eId="spk_758">
            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_2429">The combined influence of Ireland's increased competitiveness in business costs, commitment to our 12.5% corporate tax rate, strong Government's commitment to research and technology, strong links between industry and third level institutions, a talented workforce, and a strong track record of foreign direct investment all contribute to make Ireland an attractive location for foreign direct investment (FDI).</p>
            <p eId="para_2430">On a global scale, Ireland scores extremely well in many of the key areas of importance to investors, helping drive FDI.  "<i>The IMD World Competiveness Yearbook, 2011”</i> ranks Ireland 1st in the world for corporate taxes, 1st for business legislation for foreign investors and 1st for the availability of skilled labour.  The same report also ranks Ireland 2nd in the world for consumer price inflation, 3rd for direct investment flows inward, 3rd for availability of finance skills, 4th in the world for labour productivity, and 4th for exports of commercial services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2431"><i>“The World Bank Doing Business Report, 2011”</i> ranks Ireland 1st in the Eurozone for ease of doing business, while Ireland is ranked 2nd most attractive country globally for Foreign Direct Investment by the “<i>NIB/FDI Intelligence Inward Investment Performance Monitor 2011.”</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_2432">Despite global turbulence, FDI in Ireland continues to grow.  2011 was the most successful year for many years in foreign direct investment in Ireland, with a record 148 investments secured (an increase of 17% on the previous year) and 13,000 new jobs created a 20% increase over the previous year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2433">The importance of foreign direct investment (FDI) to the Irish economy remains highly significant.  In addition to exports, FDI accounts for a total of 250,000 jobs (1 in every 7 jobs) in the Irish economy and €19 billion spend on Irish sourced goods and services including €6.9 billion in payroll.  Companies who have chosen Ireland as the location for their FDI operations include 9 of the top 10 global pharmaceutical companies, 8 of the top 10 US ICT companies, 17 of the top 25 medical device companies, more than 50% of the world's leading financial services firms, the top 10 ‘born on the internet' companies and 3 of the world's top 5 games companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2434">The parties in Government are working together to ensure that a stable political environment underpins its work to being about economic stability.  Our objective is to address the economic challenges that we face and to work towards making Ireland the best small country in which to do business.  On taking office this Government moved swiftly to complete the restructuring and re-capitalisation of the Banks and is taking action to enhance the flow of lending to small and medium enterprises.  We are meeting the fiscal targets set by our funding partners and have succeeded in securing improvements in the interest rates and maturities charged on lending from the European Financial Stability Fund.  The recent progress report on the Action Plan for Jobs underlies our determination to fully implement this initiative in order to get people back to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2435">The immediate outlook for Ireland's foreign investment portfolio is positive with a short term pipeline in place.  I am satisfied that the actions of this government and the work being done by IDA on the ground will continue to lead to new investment wins for Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_2444">As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, supporting balanced regional development and creating jobs in rural locations is a priority.  It is only through the creation of jobs in these locations that the issues highlighted can be addressed.  To this end, the Action Plan for Jobs sets out an ambitious plan for developing employment initiatives within communities.  The range of actions set out in the plan recognises that while it is Government who will create the right operating environment for business growth and job creation, it is the local entrepreneurs who will create the jobs.  To support these local entrepreneurs, it is crucial that enterprise supports are available locally.  The establishment of a one-stop-shop to provide microenterprise support through the dissolution of the existing CEB offices and the creation of a new network of Local Enterprise offices will ensure an enhanced delivery of support to microenterprises nationally, with a seamless progression, where appropriate, to further Enterprise Ireland supports.  Additionally, Enterprise Ireland's network of offices allows the agency to drive take-up of its services and supports such as entrepreneurship programmes focused on identifying new business opportunities, at a local level, thereby maximising take up and impact.  Enterprise Ireland has also provided €61.4m in support towards the establishment of 134 locally owned Community Enterprise Centres (CECs) across the country, the majority in rural areas, which have enabled entrepreneurs to establish, provide employment and to grow their businesses in their own locality.  Under the Action Plan for Jobs, a further programme of support is being rolled out for the maintenance or establishment of a strong business development function in the existing CECs.  This will see 30 centres benefit from a full-time business development function, providing a 50% grant towards eligible costs or €50,000 over two years.  Applications from eligible centres under this scheme are currently being assessed.</p>

            <p eId="para_2448">The question of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay, whereby employers would directly meet the costs of sick absence for an initial period of illness, is being considered in the context of the need to reform the social welfare system to bring it into line with practices in other countries in this area; the need to address the deficit in the social insurance fund; the need to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability; and in the wider context of enhancing the health of the workforce and addressing levels of absenteeism.  No decisions have yet been taken by Government on the introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme.  Before any decisions can be taken, there are a range of complex issues which need to be examined in detail.  In this regard, I hosted a consultative seminar on the feasibility and implications of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay on 20 February 2012.  This seminar was attended by a broad range of key stakeholders and afforded an initial opportunity to discuss the complex issues involved.  The issues raised in the correspondence referred to the Deputy were amongst the matters addressed.  Further consultations will be held with key stakeholders in order to further develop the debate on these issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_2458">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2459">As the Department currently funds approximately 40% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in a way that could increase rent prices for others, such as low paid workers and students.</p>
            <p eId="para_2460">New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 and are in place until June 2013.  These new limits are in line with the most up to date market data available. The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2461">The report referred to by the Deputy is available on the Department's website at the link <i>http://www.welfare.ie/EN/Policy/ResearchSurveysAndStatistics/Pages/rentreview2011.aspx</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_2462">For all counties, all major urban population centres were tested as part of the review to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access temporary housing arrangements whilst seeking employment opportunities. In County Louth, availability of rental property in Drogheda and Dundalk was tested during this analysis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2463">The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this point I have no plans to revise any of the existing rent limits.</p>

            <p eId="para_2493">Job protection and creation has been identified as a key priority of this Government and is central to Government policy. The Government has introduced a range of reforms and incentives to support, protect and create jobs, including through the Jobs Initiative in May 2011 which among other measures reduced VAT rates for labour intensive sectors such as tourism. It also halved the lower rate of PRSI until end-2013 on jobs that pay up to €356 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_2494">In February 2012 the Government published a comprehensive "Action Plan for Jobs". It has identified a range of specific actions to drive job creation under a range of headings. These actions are spread across numerous Departments and Agencies encompassing a whole of Government approach to protecting and creating jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2495">While Responsibility for employer incentives and job creation, in the main lies, with my colleague Richard Bruton TD, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, my Department also offers a number of supports to employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2496">The Employer (Job) PRSI Incentive scheme was launched in 2010 and has now been simplified and extended as part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2012. Under the scheme, if an employer takes on an additional member of staff in 2012, who has been unemployed and in receipt of an eligible payment for 6 months or more, they will be exempt from paying employers' PRSI for 18 months.  The job must be new and additional, be for at least 30 hours a week and last for at least six months. The exemption is available for new and additional employees up to 5% of employers existing workforce or, for smaller companies, a maximum of 5 new jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2497">The Government launched a National Internship Scheme, JobBridge in 2011. JobBridge provides work experience placements for interns for a 6 or 9 month period. This will operate for 2 years and provides 5,000 internship placements in the private, public and voluntary sectors. The aim of the national internship scheme is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills. The Host organisations complete an online application form to advertise placements which are then advertised on the Jobs Ireland website.  Interns receive an allowance of €50 per week on top of their existing social welfare entitlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2498">These incentives are available to all employers who take on additional staff or interns from the many well qualified people on the live register of various ages.</p>

            <p eId="para_2507">The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social welfare assistance or child benefit payments on arrival in Ireland. Each case received for a determination on the Habitual Residence Condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the legislation and guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case.</p>
            <p eId="para_2508">Decisions concerning habitual residence are subject to five factors which have been laid down by the European Court of Justice, and which are now incorporated into our domestic social welfare legislation.  The five factors are:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2509">(a) the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2510">(b) the length and purpose of any absence from the State;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2511">(c) the nature and pattern of the person's employment;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2512">(d) the person's main centre of interest, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2513">(e) the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2514">There is no discrimination on grounds of nationality in social welfare legislation and to introduce such a provision would be contrary to the equality principles that Ireland has adopted in its equality legislation, the Treaties of the European Community and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and other international conventions. Therefore the same conditions exist for UK nationals as nationals from any other country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2515">Any applicant who disagrees with the decision on a case has the right to request a review of that decision and/or appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>

            <p eId="para_2517">In the past, income support for people of working age, including lone parents, has been passive in nature, with little systematic engagement by the State with the customer.  This is now changing.  Long-term welfare dependency and passive income support to people of working age are not in the best interests of the recipient, of their children or of society. The long-term income support that the one-parent family payment (OFP) scheme provided to lone parents up to 2011, until their children were aged 18, or 22 if in full-time education, without any requirement for them to engage in employment, education or training, has proved to be ineffective in addressing the poverty and social exclusion experienced by some of these families.</p>
            <p eId="para_2518">The best route out of poverty and social exclusion is through paid employment.  Work, and especially full-time work, may not be an option for parents of young children.  However, supporting parents to participate in the labour market, once their children have reached an appropriate age, will improve both their own economic situation and the social well-being of themselves and of their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_2519">The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, 2012, introduces changes to the structure of the OFP payment and to the age of the youngest child at which the payment ceases.  These changes are being brought in over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2520">The reduction in the maximum age limit of the youngest child for receipt of the OFP is being applied to new and existing customers on a phased basis and will not affect existing customers until 2013.  For new recipients, from 3 May, 2012, the OFP payment will be made until the youngest child reaches the age of 12.  This will reduce further to age 10 in 2013 and to age 7 in 2014.  These additional reductions will be considered in the context of the further development of relevant activation and support services.  For existing recipients, there will be a tapered phasing-out period to enable them to access education and training and to prepare them for their return to the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2521">I have acknowledged that reforming the OFP will require a whole of Government response.  I will be engaging with both the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Education and Skills to have a co-ordinated, cross-Departmental approach to ensuring that the required level of services are in place to support lone parents as their youngest child reaches the relevant age thresholds.</p>
            <p eId="para_2522">At the same time, the development of the National Employment and Entitlement Service (NEES) and the profiling of jobseekers, which is already underway in my Department, will lead to a better identification and understanding of the supports that individual customers need and the extent to which these are available and affordable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2523">As part of this cross-Departmental approach, discussions have already been taking place between officials from my Department and from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs with regard to the development of a policy framework around after-school care, and, in the short-term, the assessment of the extent of the current provision of such care, the costs of such care to parents, and the demand for such services from lone parents.</p>

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_795">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_2592">RTÉ has built, owns and controls the SAORVIEW TV network and is also responsible for the coverage and operation of that SAORVIEW network.  In accordance with Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, the development of the RTÉ network is an operational matter for RTÉ and not one in which I, as Minister, have a function.</p>
            <p eId="para_2593">I have, however, had enquiries made in regard to the situation in West Cork as raised by the Deputy and can now provide the following information.</p>
            <p eId="para_2594">The Broadcasting Act 2009 Act provides that RTÉ must roll out SAORVIEW to the same extent as its existing analogue network.  In this regard, I understand from RTÉ that the analogue network covers 98% of the population and the SAORVIEW network will also provide 98% population coverage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2595">In addition to SAORVIEW, RTÉ has developed SAORSAT, a new "free-to-air" satellite service unique to Ireland to ensure the RTÉ TV services are available to the remaining 2% of the population.  Currently, SAORSAT provides access to the RTÉ channels.  TG4 will be available shortly.  TV3 has not yet made a decision as to their carriage on the service.  RTÉ is not obliged to provide a satellite service and is doing so on its own initiative.  I am informed that, with this satellite service Ireland will have a national TV network covering 100% of the population, for the first time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2596">In relation to areas of West Cork, I have been informed by RTÉNL that community deflector systems are not being replaced or upgraded by RTÉNL.  Community deflector systems are managed by communities and not RTÉ. Also, it is my understanding that ComReg has indicated that the analogue licenses for these systems will cease at the end of 2012.  Homes that currently receive television signals from these systems will have to adjust their aerials to point to a SAORVIEW transmission site and some homes may need to use SAORSAT.  Should the Deputy have further questions about specific areas, I am happy to pass them to RTÉ on his behalf for direct reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_2597">I am very much aware of the challenges digital switchover brings, in particular for households that are reliant on the existing "free to air" analogue TV network.  We have chosen to use outreach and marketing schemes to provide the assistance and support necessary for people to make the switch.  As I have stated in previous questions, we have not and do not propose to introduce grant schemes for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_2598">Experience from other European countries indicates that the cost of set top boxes and other digital receivers reduces as the date for digital switchover approaches, and there is increased competition in the market.  There is clear evidence that this is now happening in Ireland with affordable set top boxes that meet the SAORVIEW standard on the market, as well as a range of suitable digital televisions.  In addition, experience from other European countries also shows that the availability of accurate and reliable information and the provision of practical assistance is the most effective approach towards assisting people in making the switch to digital television.</p>
            <p eId="para_2599">In this regard, therefore, to overcome the challenges that digital switchover brings, I have undertaken to deliver a substantial information campaign providing households with information on the digital switchover and on their options for going digital.  This information campaign commenced in quarter four 2011.  There are a number of strands to the campaign including a national telephone helpline and a national advertising and public relations campaign.  An information booklet will also be delivered to every house in the country.  The campaign will run up to the end of 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2600">In conjunction with this, my Department has been working to address the particular information and assistance needs of vulnerable households as they prepare to go digital.  On January 10th 2012 I signed an agreement with a national voluntary organisation, the Wheel, to develop and operate a nationwide community outreach digital switchover programme (Outreach Programme).</p>
            <p eId="para_2601">Community umbrella group — The Wheel, in conjunction with voluntary and community organisations throughout the country, has begun to roll out a countrywide Outreach Programme in April/May 2012, which will provide additional assistance and advice at community level to those who may find the move to digital TV difficult.  The aim of the Outreach Programme is to ensure that everybody is made aware of the switchover and that no TV viewers are left without a TV service once the national analogue TV service switches off on October 24th 2012.   A press release issued on the Outreach Programme and is available on the dedicated digital switchover website <i>www.goingdidital.ie</i> as is the list of local champions referred to above.</p>

            <p eId="para_2615">Yesterday I announced a number of changes to the RDP which will address some of the issues experienced to date in the context of the delivery of the Programme. Previously, the rates of grant aid available to private promoters in the context of supporting enterprise activity in rural areas, was 50% with some higher rates available for specific activities such as Training (100%) and Analysis and Development (90%). In the current economic climate, it has been difficult for private individuals to obtain the matched funding required in order to avail of this support level, particularly for larger projects. This suite of programme changes will allow for the provision of a 75% rate of aid for private promoters; this will decrease the matched funding and credit required for enterprise start ups in rural areas. I anticipate a significant increase in project commitments as a result of this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_2616">One of the more significant programme changes announced yesterday emerged from the need to have a more flexible approach to the achievement of the aims and objectives of the individual Local Development Strategies (LDS) of the Local Development Companies delivering the RDP. The change will allow for an extra allocation of €10 million to the Basic Services measure of the RDP. This measure has seen a very high level of demand to date and all indications are that there are still a large number of potential projects eligible under this measure that will be facilitated with this programme change.</p>
            <p eId="para_2617">Other changes to the programme include the implementation of a measure under Axis 1 of the Programme, using the LEADER approach. This follows my announcement in March 2012 of a €5 million fund to support the Agri-food sector; the measure will provide support for the development of projects, primarily processing of artisan foods, formerly supported under Axis 3 of the RDP.</p>
            <p eId="para_2618">Also as a result of the changes I am making, from now on, local authorities will be permitted to act as project promoters accessing funds directly from the RDP.  Working in cooperation with community groups local authorities will be eligible to apply for the community rate of aid under the Village Renewal and Conservation measures of the RDP. I anticipate that this change will result in communities moving forward with projects they would otherwise not have considered due to the workload involved and the detailed plans required for some projects of a very complex nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_2619">My Department's budget allocation for the RDP includes €96 million for 2012 and €96 million for 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_2625">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge by 31 March 2012, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  There are a number of exemptions and waivers from payment of the household charge under the legislation.  In particular, section 4(2) of the Act provides an exemption from liability to pay the household charge for the year in which that liability date falls if, on that date, the owner of a residential property, which was that person's main or sole residence, is not residing in that property by reason of his or her having had to vacate the property due to long term mental or physical infirmity and that person is residing in another property that he/she does not own.</p>
            <p eId="para_2626">Section 4(6) of the Act defines the meaning of "long term mental or physical infirmity" as that which required the person to vacate the property in which he/she had been dwelling for a continuous period of more than 12 months and provides that such an infirmity must be certified by a registered medical practitioner.  As such, a person would have had to vacate the property in question by 31 December, 2010 to be entitled to claim a waiver from payment of the household charge in 2012.</p>

The list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012.  A revised list of estates will be prescribed for 2013 after which time the waiver for unfinished housing developments will end.

The planning authority must then carry out an investigation and where it establishes, following such an investigation, that unauthorised development has been or is being carried out and the person who has carried out or is carrying out the development has not proceeded to remedy the position, the planning authority must issue an enforcement notice or make an application for a court order unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so.

            <p eId="para_2656">The implementation of the Water Framework Directive requires an integrated approach to the management of our water resources.  The Directive requires the achievement of good ecological status in all our surface and ground waters and inspection and monitoring activities are a critical element in the efforts to protect and improve water quality.  Primary responsibility for water quality inspections lies with the EPA and with the local authorities.  The EPA, for example, is responsible for the implementation and enforcement of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Regulations, the Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations and the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations.  Local authorities are charged with implementing a diverse range of environmental legislation for the protection of water including the issue of discharge permits in accordance with the Water Pollution Acts, the supervision of drinking water group schemes and maintaining the quality of bathing waters.</p>
            <p eId="para_2657">However, pressures on water quality are diverse and stem from many different sectors and activities and, where appropriate, other agencies such as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine also play a key role.  The EPA co-ordinates a national Environmental Enforcement Network (EEN) which oversees enforcement priorities.  The aim of the network is to promote a consistent, coordinated approach to enforcement in order to improve overall compliance.  It brings together my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the local authorities, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Health Services Executive and its activities include, <i>inter alia</i>, the promotion of best practice through guidance and training as well as the coordination of inspection and enforcement activities.  The EPA also promotes a risk-based approach to the enforcement of environmental legislation including in the area of wastewater discharge authorisations and drinking water quality.  Such an approach optimises the use of resources on the ground, facilitates the prioritisation of enforcement effort and improves outcome delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_2658">The role of Irish Water will be to undertake a range of water services functions that are currently the responsibility of local authorities.  An implementation strategy for Irish Water is being developed and this will address matters such as the boundary between Irish Water functions and those remaining with local authorities, as well as activities which will be carried out through service level agreements.</p>

The selection and approval of individual group scheme proposals for funding and advancement under the programme, within the overall priorities set by my Department and subject to the block grant allocation provided, is therefore a matter for the water services authorities.  The 2012 allocation for the Rural Water Programme is €40 million, of which over €20 million was notified to local authorities last month by way of block grant allocations towards group water schemes.  In addition, group water schemes can qualify for subsidy funding towards their operational costs.

            <p eId="para_2665">The registration facilities, both on-line and paper-based, are currently being developed by the Local Government Management Agency and I expect that they will be available shortly.  When registration commences, a reduced fee of €5 will be payable for the initial three months and a fee of €50 will apply thereafter. Ample time will be provided for householders to comply with the requirement to register their on-site waste water treatment systems.  My Department will ensure that a comprehensive public information campaign, including details of how and when to register, will be carried out in advance.  My Department is in consultation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to ensure that all data protection requirements are complied with.  I have previously given a commitment to keep under consideration all options to provide financial support to house-holders whose systems are deemed, following inspection, to require substantial remediation or upgrading. Any such support will have regard to the overall budgetary situation and to the financial position of individual households.</p>

            <p eId="para_2667">The Walks Scheme was launched in March 2008 on the recommendation of Comhairle na Tuaithe (The Countryside Council).  It represented an innovative response to the need to develop additional quality walking trails and to addressing the long-standing impasse regarding access to private lands for recreational purposes.  Many trails have now been developed with the permission of private land-holders and farmers.  The key point of the Scheme is that it brings in land-holders as key participants in the provision of high quality walking trails, by contracting them to undertake maintenance work on the trails in line with agreed work plans.  The average Walk Scheme payment is €1,057 per participant per annum.  In 2011 payments to these land-holders amounted to €1,909,468.  The Walks Scheme is currently operating on 40 trails being managed by 16 Local Development Companies around the country. There are now 1,805 landowners participating in the scheme.  The full year cost of implementing the Walk Scheme in 2012 is €2.6m. Due to funding constraints, it will not be possible to add any new participants to the scheme in 2012.  Any future expansion of the Walks Scheme will depend on the availability of additional funding.</p>

There are an estimated 220,500 household charge declarations which have been made through the post and over the counter in local authority offices that are being processed.  These declarations are not included in this table as a county/city breakdown is not yet available in respect of them.  In addition, 15,159 declarations have been received where a waiver from payment of the household charge is claimed and these declarations are not included in the figures.  This gives a total number of 921,101 household charge declarations made.  Against an estimate of some 1.62 million residential properties liable to the household charge, this represents a registration rate of some 57%.</p>

            <p eId="para_2851">The primary purpose of the Directive is to break down technical barriers to trade in order to ensure the free movement of construction products across Member States within the European Union.  It does this by harmonising those elements which previously led to barriers by providing for:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2852">a system of harmonised technical specifications,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2853">an agreed system of attestation of conformity for each product family (as set out in the technical specifications),</p>

            <p eId="para_2864">The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has responsibility for the detection and investigation of illegal diesel laundries.  It is clear from recent seizures that this illegal activity has grown significantly in recent years. A by product from these illegal laundries is a hazardous waste sludge which tends to be abandoned or dumped by the side of the road.  Local authorities have responsibility for the management and safe disposal of this abandoned residue and, until recently, this has been happening primarily in the border counties of Louth and Monaghan but is now occurring also in other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2865">Dealing effectively with the underlying diesel laundering activity involves a multi-agency effort, involving other agencies including the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda Síochána and initiatives are underway, led by  the Revenue Commissioners,  aimed at better targeting enforcement efforts.  While my Department does not collate information on the costs incurred by local authorities in dealing with waste arising from illegal oil laundering activities, in recognition of the costs involved in cases brought to my Department's attention, 100% grant assistance to date has been given for all costs claimed by the relevant local authorities.  In 2010, €303,894.82 in grant assistance was paid and in 2011, €1,028,902.84 was recouped to the affected local authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_2870">Under the Limerick Regeneration Programme there has been a requirement to move households within and from the regeneration areas to improve their living conditions and/or to facilitate development projects.  This need will remain as the implementation plans are delivered, albeit at a much reduced level and mainly where the relocations will support construction projects elsewhere.  It is in this context that the Office for Regeneration has been considering options for strategic purchases and development opportunities that support the regeneration communities and contribute to the delivery of the regeneration plans. It is intended that the acquisition of houses and sites at Waller's Well will support this objective.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2875">I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 to 181, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2876">The Pyrite Panel which I set up in September, 2011 is due to report to me shortly.  On receipt of the report I will give careful consideration to any recommendations it may contain in relation to the adequacy of existing standards in relation to the end use of aggregates, including the sufficiency of SR21 and the need for any new standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2877">A strong statutory framework for the regulation of construction activity already exists under the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007 and relevant European standards.  The Building Regulations set out the legal requirements for the design and construction of buildings, including houses and extensions. Related Technical Guidance Documents (TGD) provide technical guidance on how compliance with the regulations can be achieved in practice. Work carried out in accordance with the guidance provided in the TGDs is considered prima facie evidence of compliance with the Building Regulations.  The key requirements relevant to the use of hardcore material for buildings are set out in Part C (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) and Part D (Materials and Workmanship) of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations. The Building Regulations and related TGDs are subject to on-going review.</p>
            <p eId="para_2878">The Construction Products Directive provides for a system of harmonised technical specifications for construction products.  There is a suite of European Standards and Guidance Documents for the use of aggregates including their use in concrete, bituminous mixtures, mortar etc.   The standards and guidance documents set out testing requirements for the aggregates depending on their end use.  Quarries are required to have in place a testing regime to ensure compliance with the requisite standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2879">IS EN 13242:2002 is a harmonised European Product Standard for "Aggregates for unbound and hydraulically bound materials" for use in civil engineering work and road construction.   IS EN 13242:2002 was published by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NASI) in 2002 and came into effect in January, 2003.  Standard Recommendation (SR) 21, published by NSAI in 2004, provides guidance on the use of IS EN 13242:2002.   It was revised in 2007 to give additional specific guidance on reducing the risk of reactive forms of pyrite being present in material fill for use under concrete floors in dwellings and buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2880">While IS EN 13242:2002 limits the total sulphur content for aggregates to 1%, there is a requirement for on-going testing where the initial results are between 0.1% and 1%.    If the value of total sulphur content during initial testing is less than 0.1% no further testing is required unless there is a significant change in the quarry deposit.  If the result is between 0.1 and 1% there is a risk of swelling from pyrite and it is advised that a suitably experienced petrographer carry out a detailed mineralogical examination to ascertain the material's suitability for end use, and establish an appropriate testing frequency for total sulphur from an assessment of the variability of the quarry deposit.</p>

            <p eId="para_2903">I do not propose to comment on the detail of this case involving as it does sensitive private matters of the individuals in question. However, as a matter of general practice, the provision of DNA evidence while not mandatory is often suggested to visa applicants as definitive supporting evidence for the claim of parentage.  In a number of cases, visa applications involving parentage of children have not been pursued when supplementary evidence of parentage, such as DNA evidence, is sought from the applicant.  If DNA evidence is not supplied, a decision will be based on other evidence of parentage supplied by the applicant. While DNA evidence can offer conclusive proof of the family relationship claimed and support a positive decision on the visa application, no direct, negative inference will be drawn from the fact that the applicant does not wish to undergo DNA testing.</p>

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_2926">I should say however that in respect of cases of domestic violence, where the victim is seeking immigration status independent of that of the perpetrator, the current system places no legal impediment in the way of dealing with such issues in a sympathetic manner and in fact this is what happens in practice. In that respect I refer the Deputy to my earlier reply to PQs numbers 71 and 82 of 13th March 2012 on this specific issue.</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2928">
              <i>The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department operates a flexible, pragmatic and humane approach to the status of non-EEA nationals (both men and women) who are in situations  of domestic violence.  Any person in such a situation can approach INIS either directly or through an Garda Síochána or a  non-governmental organisation and their case will be examined with sensitivity.  All cases are addressed on a individual basis and independent status is granted where the known circumstances of the case warrant it.  In considering the circumstances of each such application every effort is made to ensure that the most appropriate permission stamp is granted consistent with overall public policy and the requirement to ensure that the integrity of the immigration system is upheld.</i>
            </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2929">
              <i>I am advised that very few non-EEA nationals who have experienced domestic violence have applied to my Department for independent status.  There have been no more than a dozen such permissions granted.  I would point out that not every victim of domestic violence will require a new residence permission.  It is possible that a victim might be resident with their own independent status.  However, where applications were made and the persons concerned were able to substantiate their claim with appropriate reports, an immigration status was granted which allowed them to access the labour force and to apply for State aid where required.</i>
            </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2930">
              <i>An Garda Síochána and non-governmental organisations working in the immigration area and those who offer services to victims of domestic violence are fully aware of the process and have acknowledged that INIS will deal sensitively with domestic violence issues,  I am satisfied that this system addresses the immigration requirements of non-EEA nationals who find themselves in such a terrible situation. I would add that the primary concern for victims of domestic violence,  whether they are Irish citizens or foreign nationals is their physical safety.  This concern is a primary focus of Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence.</i>

            <p eId="para_2932">All monies collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau are returned to the Exchequer in accordance with the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 and 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2933">Such funds are paid into the Government's Central Fund, from which the Government draws for expenditure on all necessary public services and investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2934">From time to time,  it is has been suggested that such monies should be used to fund community programmes in those areas considered worst affected by certain criminal activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2935">However, while this is a matter on which my Department has previously consulted with the Department of Finance and it has been accepted that there may be some symbolic value in the suggestion, it is considered problematic and raises a number of practical difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_2936">A policy of ringfencing monies obtained by the Exchequer and the reallocation of same for a specific purpose runs contrary to the normal Estimates process.   While allowing for a very small number of very specific targeted exceptions, it is believed that earmarking revenues for a specific expenditure programme would, in general, constrain the Government in the implementation of its overall expenditure policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2937">In addition, given the variable and uncertain nature of the value of the assets seized by the Bureau in any given year,  in addition to the potential delays through the possibility of legal challenge to court disposal orders,  the provision of ongoing funds to community projects would be problematic. Such a revenue source would not facilitate the proper planning of such projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2938">I can inform the Deputy that there is currently no plan to change the existing arrangements concerning monies accumulated by the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>

         if in the context of a report by the office of the Ombudsman, dated 13 February 2007, whereby it was indicated, that the Ombudsman concluded that his Department’s record keeping practice in this particular instance had been less than commendable, and whereby the lack of records in this case was mainly contributed to the difficulty that arose in relation to the personal complaint, if he will now indicate if this matter was raised in the Ombudsman’s report has now been addressed and if this person (details supplied) in County Westmeath may now be considered for appropriate payments, in view of the fact that they have been denied same for the past ten years or more; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2966">The processing of the applications of the person named was fully investigated by an official of my Department, who concluded that proper procedures had been followed in all respects. The person named was notified of the outcome of this review and advised of his right of appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office, should he wish to pursue matters further. The person named subsequently chose to avail of this option; that Office, having fully considered the grounds of his appeal and all the circumstances of the case, decided to disallow the appeal. A subsequent appeal by the person named to the Office of the Ombudsman proved similarly unsuccessful. I can confirm that Department officials fully co-operated with the investigations of both the Agriculture Appeals Office and the Office of the Ombudsman in their review of the case of the person named, in line with standard procedure. I can also confirm that the person named has received full payments in recent years in respect of the applications lodged under the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2968">My Department's policy on sea lice controls in relation to farmed salmon is strictly evidence based.  The control protocols are operated by the Marine Institute on behalf of the State and are more advanced that those operated in other jurisdictions for the following reasons:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2969">the inspection regime is totally independent of the industry;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2970">data obtained as a result of inspections is published;</p>

            <p eId="para_2973">An important longitudinal study by the Marine Institute into the impact of infestation of outwardly migrating salmon smolts from a number of rivers on Ireland's south and west coasts has recently been published.  This study took place over a period of ten years and concluded that infestation by sea lice was a minor component of the overall marine mortality of the stocks studied (Jackson et al published in the journal "Aquaculture" September 2011).</p>
            <p eId="para_2974">I assume the reference by the Deputy to hydros relates to hydroelectric schemes on rivers and their potential impact on wild salmon.

            <p eId="para_2982">The overall value of the RDP is approx. €5bn over a seven year period and it includes such schemes as the farm investment schemes, the Less Favoured Areas (LFAs) Scheme, the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) and the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS).</p>

This aspect of the programme is delivered through the Leader approach and recognises the importance for rural areas of support for new business creation, tourism and recreation facilities. My colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government delivers this part of the Programme through a network of 36 LEADER/Local Action Groups. I would be happy to engage with the new coalition when it has been launched.</p>

The HSE's aim is to ensure that all children with life limiting conditions would receive services on an equitable basis and through a standardised approach.  This is reflected, for example, through the national policy "Palliative Care for Children with Life Limiting Conditions in Ireland" and the appointment in recent times of Ireland's first Paediatric Palliative Care Consultant and 8 outreach nurses nationally to support the care of children in the home.  Given the multi-disciplinary and other relevant factors, funding for Paediatric Palliative Care is incorporated in the overall Palliative Care provision in the agreed HSE Service Plan.
