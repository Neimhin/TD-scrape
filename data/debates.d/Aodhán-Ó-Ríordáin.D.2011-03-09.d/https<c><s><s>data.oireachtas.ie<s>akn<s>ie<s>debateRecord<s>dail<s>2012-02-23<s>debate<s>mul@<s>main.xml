          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_1">We heard with surprise and shock this morning about the decision of An Bord Pleanála to refuse planning permission for the national children's hospital which is needed more urgently than ever in view of the serious crisis in the existing pediatric hospitals.  The refusal of An Bord Pleanála means one can only appeal to the High Court on a point of law.  Otherwise, one must start again on the tortuous road of seeking permission from the local authority and then going back to An Bord Pleanála.  The children of Ireland should not be asked to wait such a protracted period for the provision of the national children's hospital that was envisaged.  As the hospital is critical national infrastructure, will consideration be given to proposing an immediate amendment to the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act whereby it could be defined as critical infrastructure?  It would be a very simple change.  This would avoid having to take the long road back and an interactive process could be entered into with An Bord Pleanála to resolve the issues it has with the planning application.  It would expedite the urgent provision of a national children's hospital for the children of Ireland.</p>

          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_2">I agree with the Deputy that there is an urgent need to build a national children's hospital.  It is a great pity that so many years were wasted in the preparation of the plans for the hospital and their submission to the planning authorities and that the project was put at risk by the fact that the previous Government had not provided sufficient funding for it.  I wish to make it clear that the Government will build a national children's hospital.  The children of the country deserve no less.  There are huge problems in the paediatric hospitals and a crying need for such a hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">It is disappointing that An Bord Pleanála has made the decision to refuse planning permission.  I have just seen the decision and the reasons for it given by the board which is, of course, an independent body.  We have an independent planning system which we must respect.  The Government will now have to consider what options are open to it in the light of the decision.  From my initial reading of it, the principal reasons for refusing permission appear to relate to the height and scale of the proposed development.  This will have to be looked at to see if some changes can be made that would satisfy An Bord Pleanála in a subsequent application.  The issue of an alternative site might have to be examined and the approach recommended by the Deputy might also have be considered.  We will have to reflect on the available options.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The Government has identified the source of funding for the national children's hospital, even in these difficult times when we have had to scale back on capital projects.  We have made it absolutely clear that we intend to proceed with building the hospital.  It is unfortunate that we must now deal with the outcome of An Bord Pleanála's decision, but we will reflect on it, deal with it and advance the project.</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_8">The Government decided to proceed with the project on the Mater Hospital site last July after reviewing it.  The concept behind the critical infrastructure Act is to remove the uncertainties, whereby one might lose a very good project owing to a practicality, and make it possible to interact with An Bord Pleanála, rather than simply applying and receiving a "Yes" or a "No" answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I urge the Tánaiste to give serious consideration to the proposal I have made.  If there ever was a piece of critical infrastructure that was necessary and should not be held up by minor issues, this is it.  The matter should be resolved through discussion with An Bord Pleanála, but this cannot occur under the current arrangement; however, it could be by acting on my suggestion.  It would also avoid having to go back to the local authority.  Will the Tánaiste give urgent consideration to this proposal today and, perhaps, returning to the House tomorrow with real legislation which we will agree to pass to make a minor, one line amendment to the critical infrastructure Act to facilitate the hospital being defined as critical infrastructure to ensure a speedy decision?  This would ensure the children of Ireland would have the hospital within the agreed timeframe of 2015-16, as promised.</p>

          <p eId="para_10">The Government will consider the suggestion made by Deputy and will consider any other from any other quarter about how we can move this forward in current circumstances.  Our priority and concern is to move forward as quickly as possible with the construction of a national children's hospital.  However, the Deputy should not be daft about this.  He knows as well as I do that this consideration cannot be turned around overnight.  We will consider what must be done following An Bord Pleanála's decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">There is no point in accusing me of being partisan on this issue.  The reality is that a great deal of time has been lost and wasted in the preparation of plans for the national children's hospital.  A great deal of time which could have been used more productively was spent on decisions about which sites should and should not be selected.  Then there were issues surrounding the planning and design of the hospital.  There were also issues about the pool of money available to build it.  The Government has decided, clearly and without ambiguity, that it will build a national children's hospital.  We decided to proceed with the project on the Mater Hospital site because they were the plans we inherited and we believed it was the quickest route to take.  We will now have to deal with An Bord Pleanála's decision.  We have identified how we will finance the hospital and will go ahead with the project.  We will consider the outcome of An Bord Pleanála's decision and then decide the best route to take.  Let there be no doubt about it - the Government is determined to build a national children's hospital.  We believe the project is urgent and the children of the country deserve no less.</p>

They reflect the disappointment of many who voted for the Labour Party in the general election.  Why is the Labour Party proposing this sell-off?  Why are successful, self-financing State companies, such a positive in the economy, to be disposed of?  How can the Labour Party claim that infrastructure, particularly energy infrastructure, is anything but strategic, necessary and a vital lever for the State and the Government in the economic recovery we all wish to see?</p>

The troika looked for €5 billion because Fianna Fáil had agreed €5 billion.  We have succeeded in two respects.  There will be a target of €3 billion and €1 billion of that will be used for reinvestment in the economy to create jobs and get people back to work.  Those are the facts.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">The decision by An Bord Pleanála not to proceed with the national children's hospital represents a bad day for sick children, for their families, for the nurses, doctors and staff, and for jobs and capital investment on the north-side of Dublin.  Once again, it shows that sick children are paying the price for the gross incompetence of others.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">Today, I raise another important health issue, the urgent need for more facilities for cystic fibrosis patients.  In the past, I raised this matter, with a strong emphasis on a 34-bed unit for cystic fibrosis patients at St. Vincent's Hospital, and we were promised action by the Government on it.  Is the Tánaiste aware that yesterday in St. Vincent's Hospital there were 83 persons in the accident and emergency complex and 40 were waiting for a bed?  Seven cystic fibrosis patients had to stay at home while they waited for a bed because of their fear of cross-infection.  Is that acceptable in this day and age?  Is the Tánaiste aware of the danger of cross-infections for cystic fibrosis patients?  Is it acceptable that staff, who are overstretched and brilliant, had to move other patients out of their beds to accommodate one cystic fibrosis patient?  Can the Tánaiste give me a commitment today in the Dáil that the new cystic fibrosis wing will be completed on time as these patients now need their 34<i>en suite</i> bedrooms as a matter of priority?</p>

          <p eId="para_72">On the national children's hospital, I make it clear that the Government is determined to go ahead with the building of the national children's hospital.  Obviously, we must consider the outcome of An Bord Pleanála's decision and we have provided the funding for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">It is not acceptable that anybody must wait for medical treatment or that anybody, in particular, cystic fibrosis patients, would have to stay at home.  It is not acceptable that patients must wait on trolleys in a hospital or that the type of arrangements of which Deputy Finian McGrath spoke must be made on an emergency basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">That is why the Government, first, in respect of hospital services for children, is determined to go ahead with the building of the national children's hospital.  That is why the Government is determined to press ahead with the reform we have initiated in the health service to get it to operate more efficiently and in the best interests of patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">The Government is committed to the cystic fibrosis unit in St. Vincent's Hospital.  There is a target for completion of that and the Government is committed to that target.</p>

          <p eId="para_76">I take the Tánaiste's point that people do not want to see cystic fibrosis patients hanging around accident and emergency wards, but there have been repeated delays.  As evidenced in this morning's debate on the national children's hospital, many people are getting fed up and angry with the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">On the cystic fibrosis unit, can the Tánaiste confirm to the Dáil - I note he did not confirm when I asked about the 34 beds - that when the new wing at St. Vincent's Hospital which has 100 beds is completed, 34<i>en suite</i> bedrooms will be kept for cystic fibrosis patients?  I want him to put this on the Dáil record.  Is he aware that there are in the region of 340 cystic fibrosis patients who use St. Vincent’s Hospital and the figure of 34 beds comes from 10% of those who use it fairly regularly.  That is the important matter, if the Government can deliver on this.  Does he understand the hurt and frustration experienced by these families when they hear the Ministers promising a reduction in waiting lists or special delivery units?  Will the Tánaiste request the Minister to send in one of those special delivery units or, at least, turn St. Vincent’s Hospital into a safe environment for cystic fibrosis patients?</p>

          <p eId="para_79">When we looked at the capital budget for this year for all of the various things we might do, whether building roads, providing transport or developing all of the other infrastructural development of the capital programme, the one area the Government decided to prioritise and ensure that the funding for it was protected was the hospital system and the health services to ensure that we can provide services, including those for cystic fibrosis patients.  To be clear about it, the Government is committed to work through this to ensure that the services are provided and that we will reduce the waiting time and the difficulties being experienced by people, including by cystic fibrosis patients.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">Last week I asked the Tánaiste to ensure that there would be no guillotine on Committee Stage or on Report Stage of the Finance Bill, a Bill that is technical and heavy in detail and one that will impact hard on the ordinary people across the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">The Tánaiste has suggested that the House agree to a guillotine on all sections of Committee Stage of this Bill.  If one looks deeper at what is in the Bill, the first group, sections 1 to 17, includes probably the most controversial sections which allow for SARP, the tax write-down for those who will come in here from abroad, and other issues such as the pensions.  It deals with the universal social charge and many other issues.  In that group of sections, to which the Government is allocating three hours, there are 76 amendments tabled for Committee Stage.  There are three hours for 76 amendments and yet for all the other sections, which make up 14.5 hours of debate, there are only 41 amendments tabled.  This is a typical ploy, used by Government time and again, where the most controversial issues are guillotined.  It is completely unfair and makes no sense that three hours would be given to debate 76 amendments and 14.5 hours to debate 41 amendments.  I ask the Tánaiste to withdraw this motion to allow the Select Sub-Committee on Finance, which meets at 2 o'clock, to discuss how best to deal with this legislation in Committee.  If the Government truly values having proper participation on all Stages of this legislation, it will lift the guillotine and lift this motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">It was bad enough when the Labour and Fine Gael Government went back on its previous and many declarations in opposition to guillotines in this Chamber.  Now, it is bringing the guillotine into the committee room.  These issues need as much debate as the members of the finance committee, which is a substantial committee in terms of its membership, deem to be necessary.  Therefore, this is not acceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">There is a time limit on the period in which the Finance Bill has to be enacted.  It is not an open-ended situation.  What is being proposed here is an arrangement for time as between different sections of the Bill.  First, those who apply themselves to Committee Stage work are well aware it very often happens that they can start on a Bill but debate bogs down in the early sections and the later sections are not reached.  Therefore, it is a sensible arrangement that there should be a time allocation for different chunks of the Bill.  Second, as we know, many of the amendments are related.  Members will find that, in practice, the committee will debate a number of the amendments together.  The Government is satisfied that the time arrangements are adequate and generous.</p>

        <speech by="#RobertDowds" eId="spk_87">
          <from>Deputy Robert Dowds</from>
          <p eId="para_301">In my earlier remarks I stated that while many aspects of it are good I am concerned that it could lead to decreased competition and increased costs.  One of the issues I addressed in my previous contribution was the provision of legal services to NAMA, tenders for which precluded firms with a turnover below €25 million, which, in effect, restricts to a few the number of firms eligible.  This issue is not addressed in the Bill.  This measure undermines the fundamental principle under which barristers operate.  In other words, their first duty is to the court.  Currently, barristers work for a wide range of solicitors firms and are not normally dependant on any one employer.  Under the new regime, where a conflict arises, the barrister must weigh up his or her concern for his or her job, duty towards employer and duty to the court.  A number of barristers do <i>pro bono</i> work, which as self employed practitioners, they are free to do.  An example is the work done by President Mary Robinson who, when acting as a barrister, took a case to the European Court of Human Rights on behalf of a separated woman denied a legal separation because she could not afford access to the courts.  </p>
          <p eId="para_302">It is worrying that in the aftermath of the Enron scandal and the United States in particular shying away from multidisciplinary practices and the conflicts of interests they inevitably generate, we are rushing into establishing such practices.  The Bill proposes to split the Bar, which will inevitably increase costs, particularly for younger members.  Currently, junior members pay reduced but considerable fees to the Bar Council for access to the facilities of the Law Library.  If more senior barristers leave to form partnerships, join multidisciplinary practices or firms in-house, this will inevitably result in increases in fees for junior members who remain practising at the Law Library.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Access to the Bar was for many years a closed shop.  However, this changed considerably during the past decades, with people from every walk of life now practising at the Bar.  This legislation may result in access to the profession once again becoming the preserve of the elite.  The reality for anyone wishing to work as a barrister is four or five years in college, a year studying at the King's Inns and a minimum of one-year unpaid pupilage.  Young barristers are lucky to earn even the minimum wage in the first five years of practise.  Given the current economic climate, many will struggle to make a living long after that.  The introduction of partnerships may result in a reduction in the number of pupilages available.  For example, of the 1,850 people in the UK who qualified as barristers in 2011 only 460 obtained pupilages which allowed them to practise.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">The Bill proposes to introduce five new regulatory bodies which will have to be paid for by the profession, three of which, the legal services regulatory authority, the complaints committee and legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal will consist of 43 appointed members, with the regulatory authority having a chief executive and a substantial staff to perform its functions.  Barristers will be levied to pay for the new bodies, which will add another layer of costs, thus forcing many younger members out of the profession.  New entrants will have to be from a well heeled background if they are to survive long enough to establish a practice.  This problem also occurs in other areas of life, including working with NGOs.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">The number of complaints against barristers as compared with solicitors is small, in the main because barristers do not handle clients' money.  There are usually between 30 and 40 complaints per year against barristers.  Approximately one in four complaints are from colleagues at the Bar.  I am not against independent regulation.  However, the structure proposed in the Bill appears unnecessarily bureaucratic and costly.  The Competition Authority recommended independent oversight regulation.  Is there any reason this cannot be tried first?  The Bill has created uncertainty at the Bar and among those considering joining the profession.  Neither the Competition Authority nor the troika have recommended the changes to the profession outlined in the Bill.  In those circumstances, would it not be worthwhile carrying out an independent analysis of the implications of this Bill for the profession and the general public before proceeding further?</p>
          <p eId="para_306">I would appreciate if some of the points raised in my contribution can be considered in terms of improving the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_307">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the broad debate on this Bill.  I hope the Minister will listen to the genuine concerns of citizens of this State and members of the legal profession who have served this country well.  We are honoured to have had many great and visionary people serve in the legal profession.  While a small minority of people have damaged its good name, the vast majority have done an excellent job.  Some people involved in the legal profession in Northern Ireland have paid the ultimate price, including Mr. Pat Finucane and Ms Rosemary Nelson who stood up for human rights and justice and suffered the consequences for doing so.  It is important that such people are remembered in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">Northside Community Law Centre, which is an independent law centre, has served its community for more than 36 years through the provision of free legal services to individuals and groups in the local community.  It, like me, recognises the need for changes to the legal profession to make it fit for purpose in the 21st century.  However, we are concerned that particular provisions of this Bill will adversely affect the independence of the legal profession, will result in decreased access to justice and will, in practice, lead to higher legal costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The independence of the legal profession is crucial.  Northside Community Law Centre is concerned that the provisions in this Bill allowing for ministerial-State control of the proposed new regulatory authority will result in a serious diminution of the independence of the legal profession.  An independent legal profession is an essential feature of any democratic State or nation which allows members of the legal profession to challenge the organs of State to ensure fair and just exercise of executive and legislative functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I am concerned about the proposed provisions in regard to the selection and appointment of members of the authority and the control which the Minister will have in regard to many of its functions.  I am also concerned that these will provide the Minister for Justice and Equality with too great a reach into the regulation and oversight of the activities of the profession and may be vulnerable to abuse.  I am further concerned about the costs of the authority and the system of regulation provided under the Bill to the profession and, ultimately, to clients.  It is important to note that any measures that result in further costs being passed on to clients will adversely affect access to justice, in particular for those on low incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">I am concerned that the partnerships and multidisciplinary partnerships to be introduced by the Minister on foot of proposals from the authority will seriously affect access to justice for people on low incomes.  Partnerships of barristers and of solicitors and barristers and multidisciplinary practices, MDPs, will destroy the independent referral bar and would be contrary to the best interests of the public and the administration of and access to justice and competition.  They are likely to lead to an increase in costs and conflicts of interest and to affect adversely the ability of disadvantaged clients to access the counsel of their choice, which they can have under the current system.  Moreover, the so-called cab rank rule will go and the ability of independent law centres such as the Northside Community Law Centre, Coolock, to instruct counsel to take on cases at no cost to clients who cannot afford to pay will be seriously eroded.  This will damage access to justice and I also am concerned that partnerships of whatever kind will not lead to a reduction in costs.  These are the major concerns expressed by the Northside Community Law Centre, Coolock.  I take this opportunity to thank and commend Colin Daly and his staff there on the excellent work they have done right across the north side of Dublin and in the broader community, as they have served us well.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">When one considers the details of the legislation, one notes the Bill provides for the establishment of a new regulatory authority, a complaints procedure and a legal costs adjudicator.  The new authority will have 11 members and will report directly to the Minister and relevant committees.  The law governing legal services has been reformed at regular intervals since 1954 but as this Bill presents one of the most far-reaching and important attempts, it therefore is critically important for the Minister to get it right.  For the first time, barristers will be covered and organised by specific legislation as heretofore legislation has concentrated on solicitors.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">The memorandum of understanding between the Government and the EU and IMF commits to removing protections to sheltered sectors and this applies to the legal profession.  When the previous Government met to establish a deal with the EU and IMF, there was some surprise at the specific wishes from the troika in this regard.  It later transpired that the EU Directorate General for Competition, DG COMP, was given specific briefings by the Irish Competition Authority with regard to its wishes for competition across sectors and this was pushed through to the troika by the relevant officials.  It would appear the Government is behind schedule on this issue as reforms were to have been in place by the last quarter of 2011.  However, the Bill had only been published at this time and the Government is likely to come under pressure to speed up this element.  It should be noted, however, that the current Bill goes far beyond the requests of the troika and the Competition Authority in respect of the establishment of authorities and numerous practices.  Therefore, it is important to note the most controversial elements of the Bill are included at the Government's behest as opposed to outside influence.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">The Bill also contains progressive elements as regards training and access to the profession by ending the monopoly currently enjoyed by the King's Inns on the training of barristers.  I welcome such sections and do not make that point lightly.  I strongly welcome the sensible measures included in this legislation and this provision opens up more opportunities for others to study and access courses leading to qualification.  However, on closer inspection, elements of the Bill have been poorly structured.  The Government was obliged to take the unusual step of issuing an erratum slip due to confusion and omission in respect of sections 77 and 78.  It also should be noted that the table of laws to be repealed by the Bill is incomplete at this must be corrected at a later time.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">As for opposition to the Bill, it has been evident since the outset of the debate that the Bar Council of Ireland and a number of leading law firms have expressed grave doubts about the Bill and its objectives.  This is a legitimate concern which should be listened to.  There are questions over the separation of powers.  The Oireachtas, the Executive and the Judiciary-legal profession are the three pillars of the State.  Great care always has been taken to ensure these operate independently of one other and without fear or favour to another pillar, which is essential.  While the Competition Authority and the troika suggested an independent regulator to oversee the current work carried out by the Law Society of Ireland, the Bill proposes to set up a completely new authority that reports to the Minister.  This suggests that Irish law firms or barristers are not entirely independent of the State.  A Minister may be considered to hold authority over this board and its decisions may be reflective of the desires of the Government.  The fear exists that this will in the first instance reduce the willingness of the legal profession to take action against a Minister or the State and second, may encourage multinational firms to seek law firms operating out of the United Kingdom to handle any cases in which the State is to be challenged.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">I will provide a list of key issues regarding independence for the Minister's benefit.  First, the Minister will appoint the authority.  Second, the Minister will sign off on any advisers to the authority.  Third, remuneration and expenses of the authority are to be decided by the Government.  Fourth, the strategic plan of the authority must be approved by the Minister.  Fifth, the Minister must approve any code of practice or amendments to same and sixth, the Minister may examine the accounts of the authority at any time.  The Government argues that this question does not arise as the Minister only has control in a reporting capacity and will not be in a position to exert influence over the profession at large.  While it is possible to see the Government's point of view, the Bill presupposes that all Ministers always will act in good faith.  The Bill opens the door to potential abuse should a Minister in the future choose to do so.  It might be argued that a solicitor seeking to question a Minister about activities - Members should think of former Ministers for Justice such as Ray Burke or Sean Doherty or back to other parts of our history - might find himself or herself open to additional investigation and red tape from a body that is controlled by a Minister and populated by people appointed by that Minister.  Therefore, the issue cannot be entirely disregarded.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">In respect of the cost of the authority, the new authority undoubtedly will incur significant costs to run.  The Government had promised to reduce the number of State bodies and authorities but this in effect will see the establishment of a new and large authority.  The cost of running the authority is to be passed on to the legal profession.  However, in reality this cost will be passed on to the consumer and could mean higher legal costs will ensue, which is the precise opposite of what the Bill is intended to achieve.  The authority itself appears to be an unwieldy body and it can safely be assumed that staff currently performing a similar function in the Law Society of Ireland will be transferred to the new authority.  Further new staff also will be required and as a result, compliance costs are set to rise significantly - some estimates suggest by between €10 million and €20 million.  A simple and effective solution for the Government would be to propose a statutory cap on compliance costs to ensure the new system costs no more in compliance than the current regime.  By doing so, the authority automatically would be incentivised to keep down costs but in its absence, there is no real reason for the new authority to control compliance costs.  Although efficiency will be a major concern for the new body, it is clear that with 11 board members and in excess of a further 30 members of committees, this will be a body of many layers but not a lean or highly efficient one.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">As for the legal costs adjudicator, this new role will replace the former High Court Taxing Masters in respect of the issue of costs.  However, under the Bill the function of the adjudicator will be broadly the same and it is difficult to discern how the adjudicator will differ on decisions from the sometimes exorbitant costs that were perceived to be a problem under the regime of the High Court Taxing Masters.  It also is intended that meetings before the adjudicator will be held in private and some would question this from a transparency perspective.  In respect of solicitors' costs, the Bill provides that once a solicitor has been engaged, he or she must provide a client with a detailed set of costs.  This is a positive step that will allow clients to plan for the costs involved.  However, this will only occur once the solicitor actually is engaged.  While this is not a problem for clients with some resources, most ordinary people will need an accurate prediction of costs before they can decide to engage a solicitor.  Therefore, the Bill may fail to improve access for many citizens or allow them make an informed choice on the best solicitor or the cost of an action.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">As for the State legal services, I note one of the biggest consumers of legal services is the State itself.  Costs are a direct consequence of what a legal professional considers to be a fair market rate and therefore, the level of fees the State is willing to pay to engage legal services has a direct trickle-down impact on the cost of all services.  A major problem exists in that the Government still does not tender for a large proportion of this work and without doing so there must be serious concerns with regard to value for money.  That is a legitimate point in respect of State legal services.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">New business structures are proposed by the Bill in the form of legal partnerships and multidisciplinary practices.  These new structures tend to work against small firms or single solicitor practices and will only benefit the larger firms.  The big boys and girls rule again.  One of the problems Irish law firms face is the idea of current partnership rules.  As things stand, partners to a law firm have unlimited liability for that firm.  For this reason, most partners in firms ensure the family house is in the name of a spouse rather than their own and so on.  This has been dealt with in other countries by the introduction of limited liability partnerships.  Most English law firms currently selling services into Ireland operate on this basis and find it an attractive means to recruit new partners and emerging talent.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">The idea of a multidisciplinary practice does not hold much weight as there would be serious questions as to why an engineer, for example, would want to partner a solicitor who has unlimited liability.  Given the circumstances from which Ireland has just emerged, it is equally reasonable to question the wisdom of promoting such multidisciplinary practices.  Independence within professions provides a certain amount of ongoing oversight for clients.  However, would it have been wise during the housing boom to have a solicitor, engineer and auctioneer form a multidisciplinary practice?  The aim of transparency, as contained in the Bill, could find itself lost if such practices were to emerge on a large scale and the consumer were to be severely limited when making choices on who to engage for what services.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">These are my concerns in respect of this Bill.  I will listen to my colleagues when I make my final decision on the Bill.  It is important we have a comprehensive discussion on the Bill, and I welcome some of the main sections in it.  However, I urge the Minister to listen to the constructive views of many of my Independent colleagues in this House who have spoken on the legislation.  We have listened to all sides.  I have an open mind on the issue.  I just want to ensure we have a quality legal profession in this country that serves the interests of the State and its citizens.</p>

          <from>Deputy Derek Nolan</from>
          <p eId="para_325">I am sure he is representing them quite well.  The legal profession is one that does not deserve sympathy, in my view, but it is certainly one that requires understanding.  I entered Blackhall Place in 2009 and I hope to graduate at some stage this year, delayed a little bit by my election to this House.  I therefore have a small but insightful view into the legal profession, although not as cumulative as that of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Of those who entered Blackhall Place with me in 2009, the majority will be qualifying this year and then joining the dole.  The legal profession has taken a huge hit over recent years, and people who have spent years after their degrees studying for FE1 examinations and going through Blackhall Place will be looking at a very difficult legal and professional landscape.  That preponderance of unemployed legal professionals will probably do more to increase competition in the legal profession than this Bill will ever do on its own.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Several issues have been raised since the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 was published.  The tone of the debate from the beginning has probably been a little bit unfair and has not been very conducive to a constructive debate in many instances.  Some of the criticisms of the independence of the proposed regulatory authority may be based on facts, but comparing it to totalitarian regimes was not very constructive.  The Minister has pointed out that he is open to amendments on the issue and he is certainly open to looking at it correctly.  The problem with the authority, along with so much else in the public sphere, is related to perception.  If it is not seen to be right, public confidence in it can be undermined.  I take the Minister's word that he is open to amendments and I thank him for that.  I expect a satisfactory conclusion can be reached on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">From my time in a solicitor's office, I know well that a referral to the Law Society was treated extremely seriously.  It was not seen as an easy option whereby a lawyer went before his friends in the network, who then let him off.  It was something a person did not want to happen.  From a public representative point of view, however, people have come to my constituency offices and told me that they think the Law Society is absolutely incapable of being a fair adjudicator on people's disputes against solicitors, and that they would be loath to report a solicitor to his own profession for guidance.  We are again going back to the issue of perception.  The Law Society has recently acknowledged that public perception and has changed its view on regulation.  It is now of the opinion that an independent regulatory authority should be the body to deal with complaints.  I welcome that because it will only help to enhance the reputation of the solicitor profession and will enhance public confidence in the legal profession generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">The issue of costs in the Bill has received widespread welcome across all the professions and from those commenting on the Bill.  A new office of legal costs adjudication is to be set up which will provide a new level of transparency, supervision and scrutiny, which again is vital.  If people complain about solicitors or barristers, it is invariably about costs.  There is a lack of understanding about the way in which costs are calculated, the hourly rates charged, the issues in respect of section 68 letters, and the work done behind the scenes about which the customer does not know.  There is a complete lack of trust in some instances between the practitioner and the client.  I think this new body, which will be independent and which will adjudicate on costs, represents a very welcome step.  It creates a formal structure whereby it will be seen that both sides are getting a fair hearing.  It will certainly enhance the reputation of the legal profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">There has been a bit of an overreaction to the issue of multidisciplinary practices.  We really have to see it in operation before we can see how it will affect the legal system.  Deputy Finian McGrath spoke about an auctioneer, engineer and solicitor working together.  I think it is a highly unlikely probability that this would be the example, but we have to see it in operation.  A solicitor and barrister working together in a multidisciplinary practice does not seem to be an issue, but I note that over the years, there has been a gradual erosion of the distinction between barristers and solicitors.  I know that many solicitors are entitled to audiences in front of any court.  In fact, the Minister himself is an example of those solicitors who have often exercised that right.  There really is no necessity now in law for the existence of two separate professions.  By working together, we could see a blending of the roles.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">Section 30 calls for a number of reports to be prepared by the new regulatory authority, one of which is on that issue of the unification of the barrister and solicitor professions.  The Minister will certainly get an interesting reaction from the two professions when that report is issued.  We will really see a fuss if the proposal is to merge the two professions.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I also welcome the report into the education and training of legal practitioners.  I could not fault the training I received in Blackhall Place, but it was the only option I had and there was no other alternative to become a solicitor.  There was only one authority and it was a very expensive privilege to go there.  In fact, I am still paying off my education costs from Blackhall Place.  It will be interesting to see whether there is a way of making that more affordable and easier for people to get through.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">As a public representative, I am aware that one of the issues which most frustrates people relates not necessarily to those who practise law but rather the law itself and the way it is administered.  Citizens are put off by the fact that it can take so long to exercise remedies granted by the Dáil or pursue legal opportunities for redress.  Delays in this regard can be enormous and one can spend years waiting for a decision.  If one is seeking a financial settlement, one can be obliged to wait a number of years before a judgment is handed down and then one can be obliged to enter into an entirely new legal battle in order to have it enforced.  Many cannot understand the long, drawn out process which obtains.  In ways, it does more to hamper people in having their rights vindicated.  More than the efforts of any legal practitioner, it also affects their confidence in the legal system.  The issues of enforcement, cost and delay which arise in vindicating rights granted by the Oireachtas are worthy of further consideration at a later date.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The work of the Courts Service is still very much paper-based and involves old methods of operating such as filing, stamping, etc.  So much of this work could be done by electronic means.  I was not that old when I took up a position in a solicitor's office and was certainly of the view that it would be quicker and more efficient to do the work to which I refer either online or by other electronic means.  The modernisation of the administration of the court system and also justice would go a long way towards reducing costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">I thank the Minister for his attention and being present in the House to take the Second Stage debate on the Bill.  I look forward to the Committee Stage debate, particularly to discussing the amendments that will be brought forward.</p>

        <speech by="#AodhanORiordan" eId="spk_92">
          <from>Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin</from>
          <p eId="para_336">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill and thank the Minister for being in attendance in order that he might take on board the points being raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Having a properly constituted legal profession is a must in any republic.  People need to be confident that the Judiciary and the legal system are even-handed and representative of them and can be trusted.  We did not need to be informed by the troika that there were problems with our legal services.  I congratulate the Minister on his reforming zeal in this regard.  Among those who do not come from legal backgrounds, there is a perception that the law is practised by an elite, the members of which attended certain schools, possess a particular mindset and flex their muscles when anyone suggests there is a need for reform in the way in which they do their business.  This was brought into stark focus late last year when, approximately one week before a referendum on the holding of Oireachtas inquiries was due to take place, a letter was sent to <i>The Irish Times</i> by a number of former Attorneys General.  The individuals in question became very excited about this matter and indicated that granting the powers being sought to the Oireachtas would interfere with the independence of the Judiciary.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">If we in this republic are serious about reform, there cannot be any sacred cows.  Everything must be tested and investigated and capable of being renewed or reformed.  I hope the Judiciary and the legal profession will understand that what the Government is doing represents an attempt to bring the profession into the 21st century, make it more accountable and ensure it is more real to the people.  The profession must be rooted in society and should not be the preserve of those who come from particular backgrounds or were educated in certain schools.  Such individuals tend to dominate the corridors of the Four Courts and other courts throughout the country and are of the view that they are the only citizens who have authority in discussing these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">A previous speaker referred to the Northside Community Law Centre.  Many Deputies have engaged in consultations on the Bill and a number of concerns have been expressed which I know the Minister will take on board.  It is only reasonable that we should ensure that anything we enshrine into law in this House will not need to be corrected at a later date.  The common criticism of any attempt to reform the legal profession relates to its independence.  In that context, concerns have been expressed about the independence of the proposed new regulatory authority, the way in which members of the authority will be appointed and the control the Minister will have in respect of many of its functions.  If there is a myth in this regard, it must be exposed because we do not want accusations, suggestions or arguments not based in reality to be made.  There is a need to deal definitively with the position of the proposed regulatory authority which will have overarching responsibility in this area.  If there are concerns, they must be dealt with.  In addition, if there are questions on the independence of the authority, they must be addressed.  We cannot be seen in introducing reforms to be creating further problems.  There is certainly a need for further consideration of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Previous speakers referred to access to justice and the establishment of multidisciplinary practices.  Concerns have been expressed to the effect that such practices will not lead to an opening up of the legal profession but will, in fact, result in it becoming even more closed off.  Access to the law and justice and fair representation is crucial in any republic, as is the concept of citizens being considered equal under the law.  If one walks into the Four Courts, essentially what one will see is people wearing pinstripe suits being responsible for individuals in tracksuits being sent down.  The grotesque reality is that the greatest crime one can commit in the State is to be poor.  Poverty is the only thing we ever seem to criminalise; the statistics from any of the major prisons bear this out.  Statistics for literacy levels among those who inhabit penal institutions also underpin what I am saying.  All that we ever seem to become excited about are crimes committed by those who come from certain backgrounds or who are in certain desperate situations.  Access to law and legal representation is, therefore, key in the matters to which I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">I ask the Minister to re-examine the position on multidisciplinary practices to determine whether they will improve access for those of lesser means or of if they will create an unintentional barrier to such access.  I do not believe there is an option in terms of waiting to see how it all works out.  Access to the law and legal representation is so fragile that there is an acute perception among those in certain parts of society that they cannot obtain justice, that justice does not serve them and that this republic does not cater for their needs.  If we are seen to introduce a new strand to the legal profession which, essentially, will compound that perception, the reform being attempted in the Bill will only make matters worse.  As a result, people's views on their ability to obtain fair play will be completely undermined.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">While I congratulate the Minister on what he is trying to do - he is certainly taking on certain vested interests which, as we have seen, do not like to be challenged - it is of paramount importance to ensure we do not do anything which could undermine the overall objective of the Bill.  We must also ensure the independence of the proposed new regulatory authority cannot be questioned and that the multidisciplinary practices, if they are to be established, will be constituted in a way which will not inhibit access for those of lesser means to proper representation.  That is the least anybody could expect in a modern republic.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_93">
          <from>Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_343">I do not come from a legal background, but certain aspects of the Bill are extremely controversial.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">In the Programme for National Recovery the Government set out to reform the legal services market, establish independent regulation of the legal profession, improve access and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints and all of these are laudable.  Like other Deputies, I have been contacted by members of the legal profession with their concerns.  They feel many provisions of the Bill in its current form would be detrimental to the judicial system not only for those working in it but for those who avail of it before the courts.  I am not sure so I come to this wondering how I will end up thinking about it in the long run.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The Bill proposes a regulatory model which is far more expensive than necessary.  The Law Society points out that at a time of economic distress and when in excess of 1,000 solicitors are unemployed, the cost will inevitably be passed on to the client.  It states that it will be deeply ironic if a legislative measure designed to reduce costs to the consumer actually increases them.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">Criticism has also been made of the unacceptable level of control the Government would have.  I know the Minister disagrees with this, but it is stated that Ireland would be unique in Europe.  The proposed regulatory authority would be Government controlled, with Government control over entry, training and discipline, and there is a perception the authority would be subservient to the Government.  There are also concerns that this measure is not democratic and will not contribute to democracy, and that there will be a negative impact on the rule of law in Ireland and the independence of the legal profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">Opinions on the Bill vary from one extreme to the other.  Dr. Mark Ellis has stated it is one of the most extensive and far-reaching attempts by a Government to control the legal profession, and that the Law Society and the Bar Council will find themselves no longer truly independent.  In the article I read he examined international similarities with what has been proposed and referred to countries such as China, Iran, Gambia and Vietnam.  All four countries appear to have a similar mechanism to the one proposed in the Bill.  Essentially, their governments control the legal profession.  He also comments on the unilateral and arbitrary exclusive discretionary authority the Minister for Justice and Equality has identified for himself and himself alone, and on the fact that the Minister's approval and consent would be needed for every aspect of the governance provided in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">Lawyers will tell us the Competition Authority's report failed to unearth any anti-competitive practices, so they claim the Bill and the model proposed in it is fundamentally different from that in the report.  The Law Society states that the Bill constitutes a significant threat to its independence as the ultimate decision maker.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Does it go against the core principles of the European legal profession and international norms?  I read what former Chief Justice, Mr. Ronan Keane, had to say.  He welcomed many aspects of the Bill but expressed misgivings.  He accepted the need for regulation but stated that it should not take a form that would damage the profession and be damaging to the interests of those availing of legal services.  He also raised the question of how truly independent the authority will be in carrying out its work.  The Bar Council claims consultation with it was very limited with no meaningful discussion with the Minister.  The Minister says otherwise.  Where do the requirements of the troika come in?  Is it being used inappropriately as a big stick?</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Reading through all of this makes it difficult to establish the truth.  Other speakers mentioned perception and how lawyers and the legal profession are viewed in the country.  Generally they are not held in high esteem.  This is due to the obscene salaries a certain number of them receive from tribunals of inquiry.  They also seem to speak a language different to that which we speak.  Exorbitant rates are charged and cases are delayed which means more money.  There is an aspect of looking at the profession almost as a necessary evil.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The roles of solicitors and barristers cause confusion.  Having worked as a guidance counsellor I know how daunting it was for students working their way through the various entry processes, dealing with the changes that occurred over the years and the length of time before qualification.  There is also the otherworldly air conveyed by the legal profession.  Its members are seen as the high rollers of society.  Unlike other professions only certain sections of society come in touch with them, whereas everybody will come in touch with a teacher.  I am not maligning them; I am examining how they are viewed by many people in Ireland.  We know there are people who have not been best served by the law or the legal profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">I commend the work of the criminal legal aid scheme.  These lawyers must be distinguished from those advising the Government or working for the likes of NAMA at very excessive salaries.  I have been told the high fees attributed to individual legal aid solicitors are actually those earned by an entire firm and not an individual.  The legal aid scheme is suffering and has experienced cuts of more than 30% over the past two years.  There is a real danger, as has been expressed by people in the legal profession, that as with health a two tier system may evolve for those who can afford to pay and properly finance their defence and representation and those dependent on a shoestring legal aid budget.  There has been a considerable increase in the demand for legal aid services due to the economic downturn.  There is a greater need for them and there will be longer waiting times with additional costs.  I commend New Beginning for the work it does and has offered to do for those in mortgage distress.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">I have spoken to people at the lower end of the profession.  They exist on a pittance and find it very difficult to continue with their training.  These young trainees wait for hours hoping work will come their way and they certainly are not making vast sums of money.  I hope their role and issues can be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">I tabled a priority question on the community courts and I remember the answer given by the Minister.  I still find it hard to get my head around the fact that funding will not be diverted towards a system of community courts which has been found to work and prevent the revolving door for certain sections of society and certain crimes.  However funding still goes to a system which does not produce results and does not keep people out of courts and jail.  Green Street Courthouse is sitting idle.  I know the Minister agrees with the idea of restorative justice and he has spoken about it.  Community service is in place and this is the last piece of the puzzle.  I am not calling for extra funding but rather a diversion of funding from what does not work to a system that has been shown to work in other places.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">To return to the independence issue, the legal profession accepts that it must be independently regulated.  This means regulated independently of the profession and of the Government.  Looking at it from the outside, it appears that what is being proposed is not strictly independent.  It was described as one of the Minister's creatures; I do not know.  The Government will be solely responsible for the appointment of the majority of the 11 members of the authority, at least seven, with no specific qualifications required for these seven.  The Bar Council will nominate four which the Minister has discretion to accept.</p>

          <p eId="para_358">The Minister will have an officer at the meetings.  There is no doubt the new system concentrates much control and power in the Minister.  I acknowledge what he stated about the Government appointment of judges not undermining their independence.  He also stresses that the Bill clearly prescribes that the regulatory body must act as an independent authority.  However, here we have had much experience of Government appointees to various bodies and the way this has been abused.  We have had people with multiple appointments with the accompanying multiple allowances and expenses.  I fear - I hope I am completely wrong - that this could be a lucrative number for Government appointees.  I do not want to take from some of the very excellent appointments that have been made, for example former Senator Martin Mansergh with regard to the Justice for Magdalenes case.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The Minister stated the Bar Council and the Law Society have been rather silent on the benefits and opportunities which the Bill would extend to their members and instead have spent their time persuading barristers and solicitors to oppose it to maintain this privilege of self-regulation.  In his speech the Minister stated he has been contacted by others who have many positive things to say about the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">I am very much in favour of oversight of solicitors and barristers.  I am in favour of an independent complaints system, but it should be independent of the profession and the Government of the day; it should be truly independent regulation.  Above all there should be a properly regulated scheme of fees that is fair and transparent.  There should also be transparency in how fees are agreed.  There are positive aspects to the legal costs regime.  These include the new office of the legal costs adjudicator, the way increases in costs will be relayed to the client, time given to the client to consider this, the way the bill of costs is provided, the explanation to the client of the procedures and the provision for a written agreement between the client and the legal practitioner on the amount and the manner of payment.  The Law Society and the Bar fear they are losing power but that might not be a bad thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">There is a further aspect in need of reform, namely, the inordinate delay in cases coming to court, with cases stretching on for years.  Again, there is a perception of time wasting.  So much time can be spent in court yet parties can then come to a agreement which might have been avoided in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Deputy Ó Ríordáin mentioned the pin-stripes and the track suits.  He worked in the area I represent so I am very much aware of that.  Some young people seem to know the law inside out in ways they should not.  One would prefer to see them using that knowledge into a more positive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">There remain questions on the independent aspect and I hope they will be addressed.  There are positive points in the Bill and there is no doubt our legal profession must come into the 21st century.</p>

        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_96">
          <from>Deputy Liam Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_364">I am sharing time with Deputy Tom Hayes.  During the course of this debate some members of the Opposition have acted as advocates of the legal profession without really questioning what has been said to them by these practitioners.  They should stand back for a while and ask themselves what the public perception of the legal profession is at this point.  Phrases such as "too costly", "closed shop" and "not accountable enough" would have been said to them before this legislation was published.  Members of the Opposition may become blinded when they want to attack the Minister and the Government and they take what is said to them as gospel.  What this Government is constantly striving to achieve, and what people constantly look for in all aspects of public life, not only from the legal profession but in the health and education services and Government itself, is greater transparency and accountability, and better efficiencies.  One must ask oneself whether these three cardinal points of what we are doing in government are blocked or in any way obstructed by what the Minister is doing in this legislation.  Clearly, they are not.  We should support this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">I have heard words being thrown around by members of the legal profession to the effect that we are somehow obstructing constitutional freedoms.  That is rubbish.  We are not interfering in any way with people's constitutional rights in this legislation.  I pose two questions.  Are people confident right now that if they complain about a member of the legal profession they will get a fair hearing?  Let us bear that in mind.  Will the new legislation improve that confidence?  That is difficult to answer.  As both representatives of the people and as ordinary citizens these critics may believe they would get a fair hearing at present.  Some people do not have much confidence in how the system works but they would like to give the Minister the benefit of the doubt in order to see whether the new system will improve matters.  However, we know that members of this profession, like those in any profession, will say "No" to this legislation because there is a fear of change.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">There is enormous resistance to change in any profession.  I do not say this to have a go at the legal profession.  In 2006 the Medical Practitioners Act was introduced to change the way the Medical Council worked, making it into a lay council rather than one dominated by the medical profession.  All the arguments I now hear coming from the legal profession I heard five and six years ago coming from my own profession.  There is the same muddying of the waters, attempting to link an independent judicial approach to self-regulation.  We have had self-regulation in recent years but people still believe the system has not served them as well as it might have.  For that reason we must ensure this legislation is as strong as possible in order to fulfil the cardinal rules by which we stand - transparency, accountability and efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">I have read the same reports members of the Opposition mentioned.  Most of what I heard quoted comes from the <i>Law Society Gazette,</i> arising from a conference that was held on this issue.  It is disgraceful to have statements included that claim the Minister was “not accountable to any other”.  If members of the legal profession can state the Minister is accountable to nobody they clearly have no understanding of democracy.  The Minister is accountable to the Cabinet and the Oireachtas.  That makes him more accountable to the people of this country than many of those who speak of the so-called lack of accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Prior to this, being self-regulating, the legal profession was accountable to itself.  All the charges its members now make against the Minister might have been made against their own body during that time, namely, they would look after themselves, it was a closed shop, and all those other points.  From the point of view of having openness, transparency and accountability this legislation will improve matters because the Minister cannot act like a dictator; he is accountable.  Some of the charges I have read, made by contributors in the <i>Law Society Gazette</i>, claim that the constitutional checks and balances which characterise a democracy will be shut down because of this legislation.  The writers claim the Minister will control education, licensing, rules of conduct and adequate practice of law.  I ask those members of the legal profession, who controls all those issues now.  They need to look in the mirror because it is they who control education, licensing, rules of conduct and adequate practice of law.  Do they remark to themselves this is unconstitutional and undemocratic?  Of course they do not.  The Minister will not control these matters.  He is setting up a new regulatory body that will take those responsibilities away from the current self-regulating regime and give them to a more democratic forum.  That is the way to look at it.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">The legal profession must be more open-minded about what is going on in this regard.  I am disappointed in the way the attacks have been mounted and by some of the comments I have heard.  I am surprised to hear members of the Opposition parrot many of these points freely in this Chamber without questioning what has been said to them.  That is not what one would expect to happen in this democratic Chamber.  The concerns, fears and anxieties expressed by the legal profession about constitutional checks and balances are exactly the same as those that were expressed by non-legal professionals.  That is what we must deal with in this Chamber.  I do not believe for a moment this is undemocratic.  That being granted, in a debate in a Chamber such as this one can take on board what is being said and ask whether one can improve matters.  That is the entire point of the way we deal with legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">For example, the Minister could make appointments to the board for a longer period, perhaps five or six years, because if people were to serve longer they might not be interested in serving twice or three times and might be more independent in how they operate.  The Minister should place a report on the competency of the members of the regulatory body before the appropriate Oireachtas committee for consideration.  There is no need to drag the actual individuals in but a report on their competency would be useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">Other statements made in this Chamber were simply wrong.  The Competition Authority did not state this legislation was wrong and we need to put that on record.  A Member of the House stated the United Kingdom had looked at the same type of legislation and had rejected it.  It did not.  We may share the same system of common law but the UK has nine different regulatory bodies with an ombudsman to oversee all.  What we propose is one regulatory body that would oversee all members of the legal profession in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Members of the legal profession brought in experts from the United States, the UK and Europe but in their criticisms the experts do not make a case for their accusations.  They state their opinions but do not give the background detail one would expect for the stand they make.  That concerns me.  It is a little like a doctor saying one has some problem but when one asks the reason one is told, "That is why".  People expect a little more than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">On multidisciplinary issues and groups coming together, this is happening in many other jurisdictions.  Different groupings of the legal professions with different expertise come together and work in practices and this arrangement appears to work well in those countries.  Even some of those who come from other jurisdictions who have criticised this legislation would recognise that access to the legal profession in their countries is difficult and expensive.  The Minister has taken the right approach, and given what he has said all along, he will try to improve the transparency of the legislation.  We are heading in the right direction to improve access to the profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Deputy Finian McGrath stated the multidisciplinary approach was wrong during the Celtic tiger era.  The problem then, however, was that barristers and solicitors were representing both sides in cases.  For example, solicitors acted for the sellers and buyers in the sale of houses.  That is when things went wrong because due diligence was often not carried out.  That has nothing to with the multidisciplinary concept provided for in the Bill.  The Deputy has used the wrong argument to criticise the Minister.  If Members think this approach will not work, they need to be specific about why they think that.  I believe it will improve the law because many people do not understand the complexity of the law.  It is a much better approach to get more complex legal issues dealt with in a one-stop-shop.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">It is rubbish to suggest rural solicitors will be wiped off the map because they deal with simpler, run of the mill issues.  The general practice of the legal profession is dealt with by them.  People are confident in their local solicitors and the group practice approach will not affect that.  The multidisciplinary approach could help people involved in business or those who need to undertake complex cases because they would prefer to access all the necessary expertise in the one location.</p>

        <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_97">
          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_376">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important legislation which will impact on one of the oldest and most influential professions in the country.  The Bill will overhaul the current regulation of legal practitioners.  This regulatory reform comes as part of our commitment to the EU and IMF and I broadly welcome the legislation as a huge step forward for this profession.  The need for this reform comes as a result of the restrictive and costly nature of our legal profession.  For many years, groups, both national and international, have criticised the costs of the profession and have called on governments to act.  I am happy the Government and the Minister have finally decided to tackle this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">This Bill will establish a new legal services regulatory authority, a legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal and an office of the legal costs adjudicator.  These new offices are being established in an effort to tackle the main problems facing the legal profession, including the handling of complaints, restrictive entry mechanisms, rigid business structures and, perhaps most important, lack of transparency.  The legislation has caused a great deal of debate among legal bodies as well as among legal practitioners themselves.  A number have strong views but I am sure the Minister is well aware of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Given the importance of this legislation, it is worth acknowledging the extensive time that has been provided to debate this legislation.  At the very least, it demonstrates the Government's willingness to listen and to allow various views to be debated.  I am happy that reform in the areas of costs adjudication and the streamlining of the complaints system have been widely welcomed by professional bodies and practitioners alike.  This Bill will not only increase competition in this sector but it will provide for a fairer and more transparent complaints system.  Many people have been sceptical about the closed off, self-implemented complaints handling system over the years but I have no doubt that changes provided for in the legislation will increase belief and confidence in the legal profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">However, parts of the legislation have proved more controversial, in particular, the establishment of the legal services regulatory authority and the level of involvement of the Minister in appointing members to the authority.  Opponents have argued that this level of involvement could compromise the independence of the profession.  Whether that is true or not, I am concerned about the international criticism of this section of the legislation, notably by the American Bar Association, the International Bar Association, and the Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe.  Given the nature of our economy and the delicate nature of our recovery, I have concerns that this aspect of our international reputation could impact on foreign direct investment, which the State badly needs, as it begins to improve and expand again.  Many companies, when seeking to invest overseas, generally look for stable democracies where they can enforce their rights and, if needs be, enforce their rights against the state.  If these companies are under the impression that the state is in a position to manipulate the legal system, significant doubts could be raised about investment and the Minister needs to clarify the changes he proposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">I have no interest in harping on about the way in which the authority is being established.  The Minister is well aware of the criticisms in this area but I would like a provision inserted in this Bill that would reassure those overseas that the authority will operate independently and will not be influenced unduly by the Minister or his office.  This is important because I believe this reassurance is needed truly to protect our international reputation as one of the best small countries in the world to do business.  We should be proud of this and we prove week in, week out that this is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">I welcome the accreditation of other bodies aside from the Law Society and the King's Inns in the education and training of legal practitioners.  The current monopoly on education and training removes incentives to innovate and minimise costs and severely restricts the numbers qualifying each year.  This increase in competition will reduce costs, which are crippling many students looking to enter the profession.  Those wishing to train as a solicitor face annual fees as high as €8,500, while those looking to become a barrister face an enormous annual fee of almost €13,000.  These charges are a massive barrier to a large number of highly educated and enthusiastic young graduates looking to practise law.  Both the OECD and the Competition Authority have called for changes in this area and I have no doubt that what has been proposed by the Minister will satisfy their requests accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The reform of the complaints and disciplinary system is another vital element of this legislation.  This aspect of the legal profession has been too secretive and closed off to the public for too long.  The reforms introduced by the Minister in this area will make the process more transparent, which is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">I broadly welcome the Bill.  I hope the Minister will take on board the concerns I mentioned.  I also ask that he give consideration to the possibility of proposing a draft list of amendments in advance of Committee Stage to provide committee members and professional bodies with the appropriate time to analyse them.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">I thank the Minister for the time he has given to the preparation of this Bill.  It has cleared up many of the inaccuracies that have been stated.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PeterFitzpatrick" eId="spk_98">
          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick</from>
          <p eId="para_385">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Legal Services Regulation Bill.  It was published on 12 October 2011 and is designed to overhaul the regulation of legal practitioners in Ireland.  It implements a commitment under the EU-IMF agreement to remove restrictions to trade and competition in the legal profession.  It establishes a new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, a Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal and an Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">The organisation of the legal profession and the costs associated with legal services in Ireland have been subject to continuous criticism by successive official reports.  The IMF-EU agreement contains a commitment to implement the recommendations of these reports, which have found that restrictive practices within the profession have stymied competition, thereby increasing costs for clients.  Problematic elements include the handling of complaints, restrictive entry mechanisms, rigid business structures and a lack of transparency in the adjudication of legal costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">This partly stems from the organisation of legal services in Ireland between two professions, barristers and solicitors, which are restricted in the way they can organise themselves.  Both professions are self-regulated by their representative bodies, the Law Society and the Bar Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">This Bill seeks to overcome these problems along five dimensions: the regulation of legal services, education and training, new business structures, new complaints-handling procedures and a new costs adjudication mechanism.  Some of these, such as the reform of costs adjudication and a streamlined complaints system, are uncontroversial and have been widely welcomed by stakeholders, including the legal profession.  Others, such as the proposed legal services regulatory authority and the introduction of new business structures, are controversial.  The Bill includes a requirement that further policy examination be carried out by the authority on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The Bill prescribes substantial reform, which takes account of the recommendations of the reports of the Competition Authority and the legal costs working group.  As mentioned, the commitment to reform the legal services market is an integral part of our EU-IMF commitments.  However, it is also a pledge that the Government made in its five-year Programme for National Recovery.  That pledge is to establish independent regulation of the legal profession, improve access to justice and competition, make legal costs more transparent and ensure adequate procedures for addressing consumer complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">In particular, the Bill establishes a new legal services regulatory authority which will have an armoury of functions and powers that will enable it to engage in comprehensive regulation of the legal profession and the legal services market.  It creates an independent complaints procedure whereby consumers will no longer have to complain directly to the Law Society or to the Bar Council to obtain redress.  It sets out the principles that will guide the assessment of legal costs, the key principle being reasonable costs for appropriate work done.  It requires legal practitioners to notify clients in a more detailed and intelligible way about legal costs - this is an ongoing requirement and legal practitioners are required to notify clients of any matters that may increase legal costs.  The Bill establishes a new office of the legal costs adjudicator to provide a modern and transparent legal costs adjudication service.  It promotes alternative dispute resolution to save costs, and it lays the groundwork for the establishment and operation in the State of new business models for providing legal services by means of legal partnerships and multidisciplinary practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">Yet again the Government is delivering on its promises and commitments.  This Bill is in part fulfilling our pledge in the Programme for National Recovery as well as our EU-IMF commitments.  As a result I have no hesitation in commending it to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnthonyLawlor" eId="spk_99">
          <from>Deputy Anthony Lawlor</from>
          <p eId="para_392">I welcome this Bill.  It is probably the first innovative legislation to deal with legal services in a long number of years.  Those of us who watch television would have seen the legal drama, Garrow's Law, a few months ago which was about a 17th century barrister.  One wonders if there has been any change since that time in the way legal proceedings are conducted.  We still see the wearing of wigs and gowns.  There has been no real change to the structure of the legal system in almost 200 years.  I welcome this Bill.  I also welcome the fact that it is modern, flexible and forward thinking.  It is a review of the Irish legal system, bringing it from the 19th century into the 21st century to deal with a more modern economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I also welcome that the Bill will introduce much more transparency.  Some members of the legal profession are concerned about the change in regard to the body that supervises them, which is made up of legal people, to which the Minister will now make his own appointments.  They are concerned that those appointments may be contaminated, as it were, but who is to say that their own board is not contaminated?  We read in the newspapers regularly of solicitors who have been brought before their own board and have lost their robes, as one might say, because of improper practices.  I welcome what the Minister is trying to do with regard to the regulatory body.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">The Bill is very consumer friendly.  We, as consumers, have been nervous about dealing with the legal profession because its members spoke in a language many of us did not understand.  This brings me to the main thrust of what I want say about the Bill and it is an issue about which I feel strongly.  The Minister is very much a reforming one but he also needs to grasp the nettle and take account of the language in which the Bill has been produced.  It has been produced by legal people for legal people and not for ordinary consumers.  I cite the example of section 39, which I will not read because when I read it previously by the time I got to the end of it I was half asleep.  There are 217 words in it, in one sentence.  I attended a media course recently at which I was told that I should never use a sentence that is longer than eight words.  How can anyone possibly understand a sentence of 217 words?  I will bring this Bill to bed and fall asleep half way through the first sentence, so it will take me a long time to read it.  I know the Minister is very much a reforming Minister and I implore him to examine the language used in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">When I talk to business people, they tell me the core factor with regard to legislation is that it takes them a long time to understand it.  I am grateful that when I came in here I learned there was an explanatory memorandum.  I call it the Ladybird version of the Bill.  It is extremely helpful.  I ask the Minister to examine if the language used in the legislation could be made more user friendly for ordinary consumers in order that we can understand it and not have the legal profession dominate in terms of the legal jargon used.  When I was away I heard words used to describe something said in a language that the Minister probably would not understand.  The words were: "<i>wan bokis we it guc whit toot mo blac toot tim yu kilem hemi sing out</i>”, which means a piano.  If we could incorporate more user friendly language into our legislation it would be a real sign that we are trying to reform and it would help people to understand it.  I welcome what the Minister is trying to do but let us go a little bit further.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_100">
          <from>Deputy John Paul Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_396">I wish to make a few points on this legislation.  I agree with the previous speaker's comments on the jargon and terminology that is often used by lawyers, but it will be difficult to frame laws in terms that are not legal.  There might be great difficulty in simplifying some of the terms used in legislation.  I compliment the Minister for Justice and Equality on his handling of this debate.  There has been plenty of time for discussion.  He has been present in the Chamber for most if not all of the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I am struck by the fact that many of the previous contributors have referred to the somewhat hysterical coverage in the legal press about the potential implications of this legislation.  To say that some of it - in fact, most of it - is over the top would not be an exaggeration.  This Bill, and the whole area of reform of legal services in this country, has been on the agenda for many years, and I commend the Minister on grasping the nettle and trying to introduce reform.  The centre-piece of reform of the legal system must be concern for the people who consume legal services, those who need to contact a solicitor or barrister for whatever reason.  That is at the core of what the Minister is trying to do.  This legislation implements the Competition Authority report that was published at the end of 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">It is natural that the professions themselves are somewhat resistant to change.  As somebody who aspires to be a member of one of those professions, I come across a number of people who are strongly resistant to change, but there are many legal practitioners, particularly of the younger variety, who are quite supportive of large tracts of this legislation, although they may not be in a position to express that support forcefully.  I think it was Deputy Hayes and Deputy Twomey who spoke about the need in 2012 to ensure no profession is self-regulated.  Both strands of the legal profession are self-regulated, but there can be no place for self-regulation as we progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Another criticism of the legislation is that somehow the Minister, or some future holder of that position, could manipulate the legal system and that he and his successors are not accountable.  Not only is the Minister accountable to the Cabinet, but also any holder of that position is accountable, ultimately, to the electorate.  He is far more accountable than any of the people who currently occupy positions of regulation within the legal professions.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The basis for the introduction of this new legislation is an attempt to reduce legal costs, which was part of the memorandum of understanding with the troika.  Legal costs in this country are particularly high, and any legislation that seeks to reduce those costs is certainly to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I believe improvements can be made in a couple of areas of the legislation as it is currently drafted.  The first of these is the appointment of the board of the regulatory authority.  Considerable criticism has been voiced that too many of the appointments will be made directly by the Minister, whoever the Minister happens to be.  There is a mechanism that exists at present - the Public Appointments Commission - to appoint board members and fill other positions in regulatory and State authorities.  That mechanism should be used to appoint people to the board of the legal services regulatory authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I have spoken to the Minister and others about the issue of barristers' fees.  I am quite friendly with many young, qualified barristers who find it hard to break into the profession and hard to make a living from it.  This is one criticism I would level at the bodies that govern the legal profession at present.  They correctly point out that there are no barriers to entry to the profession in that people can apply and be accepted, but there are real barriers when it comes to the practice of law.  One of the fundamental barriers for newly qualified barristers is actually getting paid for the work they do.  There is no shortage of work but there is certainly a shortage of pay, from what I can see.  I ask the Minister whether it might be appropriate to insert a provision in the legislation to allow barristers to sue for their fees.  A more suitable way of dealing with this might be to have the regulatory authority itself establish a mechanism whereby some sort of arbitration can be arranged between solicitors and barristers with regard to fees and the non-payment of fees.  That might be a better way of handling it.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">There is a concern, which I hope the Minister can address, that this legislation will introduce an additional layer of costs for practitioners.  This could have a detrimental impact, particularly on small solicitors' practices in provincial Ireland, and ultimately those practices may have to pass on the costs to consumers or may not be in a position to continue trading.  This is a fear that exists.  I ask the Minister to address this issue when summing up.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">On the whole, I thoroughly commend the Minister on the way he has engaged in this debate in the House.  We have had plenty of time for discussion and he has been present for virtually all of it.  He has made a good intervention in reforming the way our legal professions operate and how they will operate in the future, and I commend him on that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnneFerris" eId="spk_101">
          <from>Deputy Anne Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_405">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Legal Services Regulation Bill.  This Bill will significantly reform our legal system, and the overall effects of its measures should be examined.  The Bill has received criticism for being rushed through with little time for consultation.  This is understandable given the timetable of the EU-IMF programme which required the introduction of the Bill in the third quarter of last year.  I am satisfied we now have time to discuss the proposals in depth.  These proposals will affect everything from how legal costs are decided to how barristers and solicitors conduct their business, and I am hopeful they will have a positive effect for consumers.  There are, however, a number of issues that have not been addressed, including that of competitive tendering for State contracts, and others that require amendment.  I know the Minister is open to constructive amendments and I welcome the process of engagement that is to occur on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Legal services in this country are often perceived to operate in the form of a cartel, with excessive fees charged by a small elite group of barristers and dominant law firms that kill competition.  This view was reinforced in the years of the Celtic tiger and the tribunals.  In an age of austerity, however, people are less willing to accept the <i>status quo</i>, and this Bill challenges it.  The changes proposed may be feared by those whose interests are threatened.  Indeed, there are many who would do anything to ensure that nothing changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">In seeking change, the interests of the public must be put to the forefront of debate.  The needs of the consumer and of society are consistent with an independent legal system free from interference from Government and from the self-interest of those whom it is supposed to regulate.  I highlighted previously the fact that up to last year, not one barrister had ever been discharged in the history of the State.  This was a fact I found quite surprising.  People simply do not have faith in the professions to regulate themselves.  While I welcome the end of self-regulation, the mechanism that is to be put in its place must be consistent with independence.  I know this is the Minister's intention and that, in ensuring this, certain amendments will be necessary for the sake of clarity.  For instance, I welcome the removal of the Minister's consent requirement for a code of practice for the Bar Council.  I would also welcome clarity on how the new regulatory authority is to be appointed, and I would certainly like to see the values of diversity and gender balance reflected in it.  The process by which a person can be removed from the authority must also be examined.  The Minister will consider these issues and I welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">The Bill is quite strong on the issue of costs, as it should and must be.  Justice, after all, has not always been blind.  Her eyes have been open to manipulation, money and greed.  For that reason I welcome the transparency to be brought to the costs structure.  This issue comes to the fore all too often when one hears of the excessive fees charged to the State and to the private individual.  Fees affect access to justice.  The wealthy can hire whomever they please to attack or defend a position of interest; the same access is not necessarily afforded to the less well off.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Only last week I read about the National Consumer Agency's survey on solicitor's fees.  The results were quite disappointing.  The survey highlighted significant disparities in fee charges, vagueness as to what was included within a charge and an overall lack of clarity on the ability of a consumer to compare and contrast quotes on certain matters.  I understand that the National Consumer Agency has called for more work to be carried out to enable people to make a fully informed decision before hiring a solicitor and I support this call.  However, while I am very critical of many aspects of the profession, I certainly do not refer to all firms, solicitors and barristers.  I am well aware of the great work carried out <i>pro bono</i> and of the support that organisations such as the free legal aid centres give to a wide variety of individuals.  Unfortunately, when one reads about the Taxing Master having to reduce incredible fee charges, it becomes difficult to defend a system that allows this to happen.  It is also a bit rich to hear certain barristers and solicitors speak on social justice and equity of access.  Their “deep concern” for their fellow man is quite touching.  I compliment them on their golden hearts and brazen necks.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The sheer volume of money that some lawyers make is quite obscene.  If reduced fees were charged, perhaps more money could be made available for the courts system generally.  Although this would not be a comprehensive answer to the question of properly resourcing the courts, I am sure it would help.  The courts system needs to be properly resourced.  In my constituency of Wicklow, family law cases are being significantly delayed and court buildings such as the Wicklow courthouse are not being used because they are in desperate need of refurbishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">It is a symptom of a wider problem.  A number of court registrar positions remain vacant and I note that a recommendation of the legal costs working group has not been included in this Bill.  There has been failure to increase the civil jurisdictional limits since 1991 and that has led to a situation where more and more cases are unnecessarily heard in the higher courts, with attendant increased legal costs.  However, this could be dealt with as a separate matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">On the subject of the courts system, I welcome the Government's decision to introduce legislation this year on the establishment of a judicial council.  I also call for the establishment of the permanent civil court of appeal that is promised in the programme for Government.  In a reply to a parliamentary question from me, the Minister said he did not envisage a referendum on this issue taking place before the autumn of this year.  He also stated that it was his intention to finalise examination of the detail and to progress the matter at the earliest suitable opportunity.  Perhaps he would give us a more certain date as to when he expects to proceed on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Another issue that is strangely absent from this Bill is competitive tendering.  This subject was examined by the Competition Authority but it does not appear to be addressed by this legislation.  The State is the biggest customer of legal services.  It spends almost €500 million on legal fees, according to studies from the legal costs working group and the Committee of Public Accounts.  The bizarre situation has arisen whereby the State is not statutorily obliged to engage in competitive tendering for these lucrative contracts.  While directions are issued by Departments within a circular, these do not have legally binding force.  It is not clear why this was not included in the legislation.  I understand that a reduction in the legal spend was achieved last year but, while this is welcome, it is not a reason for not introducing competitive tendering.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Furthermore, the European Commission has issued a proposal for a new EU public procurement directive.  The results of the evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of EU public procurement legislation state that legal services ought to be included in the full application of the directive.  It is strange therefore, given that this legislation will likely come into force in 2014, that this is not incorporated in the Bill.  It would benefit the consumer and, perhaps, younger lawyers who might be able to avail of contracts therein.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">While I have criticisms of the Bill and of areas outside its reference, I hope the matters I have raised will be dealt with comprehensively.  The legal system is archaic and while its criers and ushers may now be part of the recent past, more needs to be done.  In a submission to the justice, defence and equality committee, the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, put forward its views on the Bill.  I support some of its recommendations, including the changes it proposes on the objectives through the addition of the word "diverse" to the objective that looks to "encouraging an independent, strong and effective legal profession".  I also support the incorporation of the UN's basic principles on the role of lawyers and the additional function for the proposed legal services regulatory authority of the promotion of understanding of law and the legal system.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">I largely support the general principles outlined in the Bill but I am anxious that the scales of justice be rebalanced carefully so that the benefit to the public can be realised.  Like other Deputies, I thank the Minister for being present to listen to all the contributions to the debate.  I am very hopeful about the conclusions he will reach.</p>

        <speech by="#DaraMurphy" eId="spk_102">
          <from>Deputy Dara Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_417">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I compliment the Minister on his attendance throughout this debate, if one can call it a debate.  It must be pointed out that for almost two hours no Member from Sinn Féin or Fianna Fáil has been present and no Member from the Technical Group has been present for the past hour and a half.  This is unprecedented.  Yesterday, when I spoke on the motor taxation Bill the sitting had to be suspended for an hour and a half because no Member of the Opposition was present.  I am a new Deputy and I was told that in the last Dáil the Fine Gael Party made it its business to be a responsible opposition party.  Its Members were always present in the House for debates.  All debates are important but this is crucial legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Yesterday was a bad day for the Opposition with the announcement of 1,000 jobs for the north east.  There has also been significant progress on the programme for Government over the past 11 months.  However, it is remarkable to see the Opposition throwing in the towel before the first anniversary of the formation of the new Government.  Outside the House, Members of the Opposition are more than capable of endeavouring to curry favour with various groups, the legal profession in this instance, making commitments and pledges, trying to suggest they would act differently and saying they are making their voices heard in the House.  The reality is that there is no such attempt.  As they did when they were in government, they are misleading the people.  Fianna Fáil, in particular, is showing itself to be a party that is only interested in its own self-interest.  When it comes to matters of legislation, its members have no interest in trying to assist debate.  It is unprecedented.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">However, that significantly reduces the possibility of me being heckled in the course of my contribution.  I will endeavour to enjoy that experience.  One of the most significant events in the past couple of hundred years of our history has probably been the loss of our economic sovereignty.  That happened more than a year ago with the introduction of the EU-IMF programme, which we are working through.  It is important to acknowledge that large elements of that programme were, and should have been, included in any new Government's programme to change our country for the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The Bill is long overdue and most welcome.  Like others, I have received many representations from members of the legal profession.  Many of them are friends and, for the most part, their arguments have been extremely measured.  One must acknowledge that representative bodies - in this case the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council of Ireland - have an obligation to make arguments that best serve their members.  Governments and Ministers for Justice have an entirely different mandate, which is to represent all of the people and work for the common good.  In that regard, the objectives of the Bill clearly work towards looking after citizens.  Many of the fears expressed by members of the legal profession will prove to be exaggerated as the benefits of the Bill work through.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The programme for the restoration of economic sovereignty is made up of many small parts coming together.  No one could suggest, given the economic position we are in, that the Legal Services Regulation Bill in itself will make a great difference in restoring our economic sovereignty, but the cumulative effect of many measures will allow the economy to recover.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">There are many areas in which costs affect competitiveness, but legal costs are among the more vague.  People involved in business cannot determine how they will accumulate.  There is no doubt that when people are seeking to establish a business, or to maintain a business and give employment, any barrier must be removed or amended and the process made as straightforward as possible.  In the past 12 months we have seen a significant improvement in our competitiveness across a broad range of areas.  I hope the Bill will allow a far greater degree of transparency in pricing.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Members of the legal profession deal with people at their most vulnerable.  Medical professionals deal with people who are ill, but clients of that profession are, largely, covered by the health care system or private insurance and the issue of cost does not, generally, stray across the more serious medical procedures.  This may not be true to the same extent for dentistry or general practice.  In my constituency office I frequently meet people who are going through difficulties and their most frequently asked question about engagement with the legal profession is how much the process will cost.  I know the National Consumer Agency has strongly advocated pricing display for the legal profession.  The exact determination of a legal process can be difficult, given that the outcomes vary so greatly, but more progress should be made on the issue of legal costs to the client.  To get an up-front quote for legal work by a junior or senior counsel is extremely difficult.  There is often a polite suggestion the quote will be forthcoming and that costs will be determined, but I have never seen anything approaching a price list.  Consumers, particularly more vulnerable persons who may feel intimidated in other ways by the high degree of technical knowledge and skill required by lawyers, need this process to be more straightforward.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">On his recent very successful visit to the United States the Taoiseach remarked that the factor that most influenced a country's rating by rating agencies was stability of government and the degree to which government was willing to tackle areas that caused difficulty.  In this regard, the Bill is welcome.  Three of the four previous speakers, in commending the Minister, used the expression, "grasping the nettle".  The Minister may have felt the sensation of a sting from members of his own profession, but he is to be commended for allowing this reform in one of the many  areas in which reform is long overdue.  He is to be commended, particularly in the light of some concerns expressed by his own profession.  He has dealt with the matter urgently and transparently.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_428">Boiled, stewed and drank, rather than grasped.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">A proper functioning democracy needs a legal profession.  We inherited one and it is probably 200 years since its structure was looked at.  The problems associated with the image of the legal profession are not unique to Ireland.  Wherever one goes, one finds certain perceptions about barristers, lawyers and other members of the legal profession, some fanciful and some well founded.  Attempts to reform the profession, as the Minister is endeavouring to do, are bound to ruffle feathers, which may not be a bad thing.  However, I have spoken to colleagues and friends in the profession who broadly welcome the Bill, as no one could argue with the need to reform it.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">An independent regulatory authority needs to be established and the profession should be competitive.  Not everyone agrees, however, that there should be a schedule of costs.  There should be and it should be transparent.  If it is our intention to sell the country as a place in which it is good and easy to do business, we must realise that how the legal system works and how legal costs are structured are important aspects of doing business.  People who come to invest in Ireland, as well as our own people, deserve a legal structure that does not complicate matters for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">While it is accepted that it will not give the Minister power to interfere directly with the legal profession or the Judiciary, the structure for appointing people to the regulatory authority has caused concern among members of the profession.  The regulatory body for it will differ from that for the medical profession.  The structure by which the Medical Council was established keeps a complete separation between the authority to approve nominations and the Minister.  At no time could a Minister with a particular bias influence the composition of the medical regulatory authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">There are a couple of other areas that I would mention.  On costs and tendering, one of the matters that have disbarred many talented young barristers from embarking on a career as lawyers has been that they have had to spend a great deal of money in the first instance to train and then spend a long number of years working virtually for nothing, devilling on behalf of others and gaining experience, at a time when in most other professions people are earning and on a pathway to an improved income.  That has proved to be a serious impediment to those who have tried to embark on that type of career.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">As regards the tribunal, it, no more than the regulatory authority, must be seen to be totally independent so that when a complaints procedure process is initiated, neither the State nor the legal profession can have any influence on it at all and the legal profession has its own channels of representation to defend, or otherwise, its position.  On having a structure in place, much of it, in fairness, centres around costs.  Sometimes it centres around double representation and a conflict of interest.  If the Bill does all it can to separate those potential problems, then it will do good work.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The second obligation of this Bill is, as some others have stated, to comply with the EU-IMF working programme on reducing costs.  As others have also stated, this will not affect the balance of payments significantly but it does have an impact on potential start-up businesses and potential investors if they see that the legal costs system is not prohibitive and that it is easy to navigate.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">I would broadly welcome the Bill.  As I stated at the outset, any Bill that contains so many fundamental reforms is bound to upset people for a while, but it is a matter of people coming to terms with it.  The intention and spirit of the Bill is to reform the matter and make it more fit for purpose for the 21st century.  I heard somebody else - it might have been the Acting Chairman, Deputy Tom Hayes - suggest publishing a list of amendments in advance of Committee Stage, and I think that is a really good idea.  It would give Members time to consider them in order that when we get to Committee Stage, Bills are not merely rushed through.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelCreed" eId="spk_106">
          <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
          <p eId="para_436">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words about this legislation, which I substantially welcome.  It is overdue in the sense that a review of the structures under which the legal profession operates and under which citizens consume legal services is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">This Bill is not about the Minister for Justice and Equality or a future Minister.  It is not really about solicitors or lawyers either or about judges.  It is about consumers and citizens.  By and large, the Bill, with the promised amendments to which the Minister alluded, will serve the citizens of this country better than they have been served to date by the current structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The rationale for the legislation is widely understood.  There are commitments in the programme for Government about greater regulation of the profession, greater transparency with regard to costs, complaints, etc.  That is logical enough and I will refer to that in more detail later.  However, there is also a background in respect of the terms and conditions of the troika bailout and there was, previous to that, the reports of the Competition Authority and the legal costs working group about the affordability of legal services to consumers.  In that sense, the Bill is understandable in its rationale and, clearly, is a welcome step with the amendments that the Minister has promised.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">The truth, I suppose, for the legal profession today is that many practitioners at various levels, be they solicitors or barristers, like all other sectors of the economy are feeling the chill winds of the economic downturn.  Many have seen their businesses collapse.  There is an exodus from the profession and large numbers in the profession are unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">I suppose, like in other areas of society, the profession is to some degree tarnished by the excessive greed of a minority of practitioners and by the criminality of some of the practitioners as well.  In that area, the issue of regulation comes centre stage.  I welcome the fact that the regulation of the profession in future will not be a self-regulatory model and that there will be in the new regulatory authority with a majority of non-legal persons.  The point made by one of the previous speakers, Deputy John Paul Phelan, about the requirement for dealing with it at arms length and using the public appointments commission is something upon which the Minister might reflect.  It would address some of the concerns about the excessive reach of the Minister for Justice and Equality and his capacity to interfere in the regulatory process.  However, the Bill is overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The point was made by previous speakers that in the history of the profession of barristers, not one has been debarred under their self-regulatory model.  This strikes one as somewhat unusual in the history of the profession.  All of us are familiar with complaints from constituents about feeling short-changed by the legal practitioners, and I welcome this model of regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">On the issue of competition, I hold the fundamental view that the surest way of guaranteeing real competition is for there to be easy access to the profession in terms of qualification.  The current model is bedevilled by the fact that there are too many gatekeepers along the way.  There is not an opportunity for seamless progression, from entry into studies to qualifying, as the case may be, as a solicitor or barrister without the good will of existing practitioners, be they solicitors' offices or barristers.  That is something that needs to be addressed.  Regrettably, it is not addressed in the Bill in its current format.  That is a weakness we must explore on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">The colleges are packed with law students.  There are thousands of qualified law graduates who, through no fault of their own, cannot proceed to practise law because they cannot get an apprenticeship.  I understand the economic downturn and that if one takes on an apprentice, one must pay him or her, but that is a weakness in the training system that must be addressed.  If we entice persons into pursuing a legal career by going to college to study law, we must be able to guarantee them a seamless progression from that date of entry to a point where they can practise law.  That is not there at present.  It is a significant weakness in terms of competition because real competition is guaranteed by new blood coming into the profession and, as I stated, there are too many gatekeepers in the profession at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">I am conscious that I make this point in the presence of a barrister but I think the opportunity has been lost for real reform, to have a unitary profession and do away with what is, by and large, a self-serving distinction between solicitors and barristers.  In essence, it is about speciality.  One advocates well in court and the other, the solicitor, draws up a will or does conveyancing.  It is a self-serving differentiation.  By and large, they are similarly legally qualified in terms of their basic training.  In terms of barristers, there are junior counsel and senior counsel, and I am not sure these archaic distinctions are worthy of continuance in a legislative proposal that seeks to be radical and reforming and to embrace changed circumstances in the country.  In some respects, opportunities were lost in terms of where the legislation could go.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">I get the distinct impression from engaging with the representative bodies that they are not entirely comfortable with the idea of debating and making their point with politicians.  It strikes me as something of a superiority complex.  I must comment on the discussion on this legislation in the <i> Law Society Gazette</i>, which bordered on hysteria, did a disservice to the national interest in terms of the critical economic times we are in and damaged the society’s case, given it has some points which are worthy of consideration.  However, the manner in which it flagged these issues to an international audience, and compared us with jurisdictions that have a tenuous grasp of democracy and of democratic legal systems, over-egged its case and reflects very poorly on the Law Society.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">I have concerns about a number of specific aspects of the Bill.  Coming from provincial Ireland as I do, I am concerned about the proposal to provide for multidisciplinary practices and legal partnerships.  Although I may be subject to correction, provision for this was made previously but it was not enacted under existing legislation at the Minister's discretion, but it is proposed in this Bill to enable such multidisciplinary practices.  What I understand from this is that the best legal firms in this city and the larger cities will have partnership arrangements with the best barristers.  If I am a client seeking legal services in provincial Ireland, my home town solicitor may not be in a position to access the best advice on my behalf from a barrister because barristers will be tied by virtue of a commercial arrangement with other solicitors' practices.  That is fundamentally uncompetitive in a Bill that talks about introducing greater competitiveness to the profession.  It is an issue which causes me great concern and which I look forward to taking up with the Minister at a later stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I wish to raise two other issues which are not dealt with in the Bill but which are a cause of concern.  I noted in recent media coverage that, notwithstanding the best efforts of this Minister and the previous Minister, it has proved to be virtually impossible to rein in the runaway costs of the legal aid system.  I understand the constitutional requirement that everybody is entitled to legal representation and people of low income must have that provided for them by the legal aid system.  That is as it should be.  However, that system being abused by repeat offenders <i>ad nauseam</i> is grossly offensive to taxpayers.  The Minister needs to address this issue, obviously in consultation with the Attorney General, because it is a runaway cost.  I note from recent media coverage that the best efforts of the Minister have again been thwarted in respect of his endeavours to bring that cost under control.  He might deal with this in his response.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">A related matter is the State's own requirement for legal services and the fact a closed shop exists at present.  When the State seeks legal services, we know automatically it will be one of three or four large solicitor practices in this city that will provide them.  That is not as it should be in a competitive environment and in the context of legislation that is focused on greater value for money for the State and consumers and taking costs out of business.  This matter needs to be addressed.  There should be tendering for legal advice, perhaps involving a panel of practices which would pre-qualify.  This area should be opened to greater competition, in particular competition outside of this city.  There are many fine practitioners across the length and breadth of the country who would be equally capable of doing a good job for the State at a very competitive rate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcNamara" eId="spk_107">
          <from>Deputy Michael McNamara</from>
          <p eId="para_449">At the outset, I wish to state that I am a member of the Law Library and a barrister-at-law.  However, I also wish to state categorically that I appear today on behalf of my constituents in Clare, not on behalf of the Bar Council or of barristers.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I commend much of what Deputy Creed said.  There are undoubtedly many problems with legal services in this State, including problems with how the solicitor profession is run and problems down at the Law Library.  These are problems which previous Governments for decades, generations and even perhaps centuries have shied away from dealing with.  I commend the Minister for dealing with this issue head-on.  However, there are elements in the Bill about which I have grave concerns as a representative of the constituents of Clare.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">There was a report last week in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> which stated a price survey by the National Consumer Agency shows that some solicitors are charging up to six times more than others for the same basic services.  That is a matter of great concern to me, as I am sure it is for my constituents and the Minister.  At the end of the reform process which is envisaged in the Bill, will it be the solicitors who charge six times more or those who charge six times less who will still be operating?  It is unclear from the Bill which it will be, and I fear it will be the solicitors who charge six times more.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">As Deputy Creed said, there are many solicitors in small-town Ireland who operate with very low legal overheads.  On the other hand, there are large solicitors' firms, predominantly in Dublin but also to a lesser extent in Cork, Limerick and Galway, which operate with far greater overheads, and which, by and large, charge a lot more per hour for the same work.  That is why the great majority of people go to very small firms rather than the "big five" with their legal problems, such as conveyancing.  I fear the proposal to allow multidisciplinary bodies will force those small firms out of operation because, when a complex case is brought to them in, say, Scarriff, Kilrush or Ennistymon, they will not have access to former Attorneys General at the Bar or to senior counsel.  Instead, a person with a complex case will have to go to one of the big commercial firms and pay the large overheads.  While I acknowledge something has to be urgently done about the fact some solicitors' firms charge six times more for the same work than others, I fear the Bill as it stands does not address the problem and does not make clear that small firms will be able to survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Undoubtedly, fees paid to counsel over the years, particularly counsel engaged in tribunal work, have cast the legal profession, in particular the Bar, in a very bad light.  Nobody in this House, and very few even in the Law Library, other than of course those who receive those fees, could stand over them.  That does not change the fact there are many barristers who do not earn as much and in fact earn very little.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Even in places like Clare, there are people who wish to become barristers.  Even in places like Clare, there are people whose ancestors and family are not of the legal profession but who believe they can and would like to become barristers or lawyers, and who believe they have the right to do so.  I fear the Bill, in introducing multidisciplinary teams, will actually privilege the children of privilege.  What determines how one gets into one of these great multidisciplinary teams?  I believe it is the same factors that determine who gets into chambers in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">Do we wish to return to the days before the foundation of the State - in fact, up to very recently - where only persons of privilege could aspire to becoming barristers and senior counsel?  I do not suggest for a moment that this is the Minister's intention.  However, my former Labour Party colleague, who is also my colleague at the Law Library, Deputy Willie Penrose, spoke from these benches about his personal experience of becoming a barrister notwithstanding his, by his own proclamation, humble background.  People like Deputy Penrose and me are quite rare at the Law Library.  It is rare to sit in court in Limerick and hear a working class Limerick accent other than in the dock or giving evidence.  It is certainly very rare to hear somebody with that accent addressing the court from the barrister's benches.  The same is true in Clare and in Cork.  This Bill does nothing to address that, even though it is an issue we would all agree should be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">A recent report in <i>The Irish Times</i> noted that the number of barristers leaving the Law Library is increasing, with a further sharp increase expected this year.  However, it is not the children of privilege who are departing.  The people whose families can provide them with the independent means to survive the first five to ten years before they begin earning a decent income, and subsequently perhaps too great an income, are not leaving.  Rather, it is those from ordinary families, who must make their own way in the world, who are being forced to leave the legal profession.  That is not healthy for the profession, no more than it is healthy for society.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">Contributors from both sides of the House spoke of the importance of the independent referral Bar.  Members may not be aware that there is a group of lawyers who do not operate the taxi rank rule, namely, those lawyers who represent the Minister for Justice and Equality in immigration cases.  They are not available to applicants because they represent the State and only the State.  In fact, they must undertake not to take work from applicants in order to work for the State.  I have grave problems with what that says about our immigration system.  The membership of the authority that will govern the combined professions will be appointed by the Government, albeit from non-legal backgrounds.  Moreover, the complaints committee, as proposed in section 50, will be appointed by the authority, the authority having been appointed by the Government, with the approval of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">If I or one of my constituents - there are barristers among my constituents, as there are among the Minister's - have the audacity to take a case against the Minister and fall foul of his chosen legal representatives, how will I or they achieve a fair hearing?  This potentially offends the most basic principles of justice. <i>Nemo iudex in causa sua</i>, or let nobody be a judge in his own case.  The Minister’s appointees could end up adjudicating in a dispute between the Minister’s chosen legal representatives and somebody who has the audacity to challenge them.  No professional is perfect, as the Minister would acknowledge.  That is a cause for concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">We have been told that the reforms envisaged in this Bill are necessary because of the bailout agreement with the troika.  That agreement states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_460">The Government will introduce legislative changes to remove restrictions to trade and competition in sheltered sections, including the legal profession, and establishing an independent regulator for the profession and implementing the recommendations of the legal costs working group and outstanding Competition Authority recommendations to reduce costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">I have no problem with an independent regulator, but I have serious concerns about a regulator that is dependent on the Government.  If the Minister wants to enhance competition in the profession, he could begin by looking closer to home.  For example, to operate in the criminal legal aid scheme, barristers must inform the Bar Council that they are willing to accept instructions, which notice is then conveyed by the council to the Minister's officials.  However, there are, both in this State and in the North, barristers who can practise without being members of the Law Library or being subject to the Bar Council.  That is a small anomaly which could be worked out.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">A similar scheme applies in regard to civil legal aid and is relevant even to competition law.  For instance, in a case involving the Netherlands, the European Court of Justice recognised the importance of properly taking into account considerations relating to the sound administration of justice in any competition law analysis of rules relating to the organisation of advocates and those providing legal services.  In Northern Ireland an independent referral Bar operates whereby any small town solicitor from Cookstown or elsewhere can go to the leading lights of the Bar Library in Belfast, just as any small town solicitor in this State can go to the leading lights of the inner Bar in Dublin.  The Bain report in the North recommended that allowing barristers to form associations would, by bringing them together in larger units, be a move away from this competitive model.  For example, barristers specialising in certain aspects of law in which there is a limited number of suppliers in the North could group together to form a local monopoly.  The same could happen in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The proposals in this legislation do not address the problems they seek to address and will instead create further problems.  The measures are being presented to the House as though they are necessary because of the bailout deal with the troika.  That is not the case.  Pitt the Younger once said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_464">Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom.  It is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I do not mean to suggest that the Minister is set upon a reign of tyranny.  However, this is not a personal matter and he will be succeeded in office by others.  The law must be framed for more than one scenario.  The legal profession should not be beholden to any Minister or enslaved to the meeting of targets, as larger legal firms are.  It is primarily smaller legal firms and independent barristers who take the <i>pro bono</i> cases on which our justice system relies.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_108">
          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</from>
          <p eId="para_466">I listened with great interest to Deputy Michael McNamara's contribution.  He gave a strong description of the role privilege plays within the legal profession and the difficulty for new entrants, particularly those not from a legal tradition, in breaking into the profession.  The Deputy will have more understanding and appreciation of this than I given his work in the area.  If even half of what he described of the culture of the legal sector is accurate, it offers a strong condemnation of the way in which this industry and section of society has developed and of the role of those involved in regulating it and making sure it operated in a transparent and fair manner.  If, as stated by Deputy McNamara, privilege plays a role in determining the jobs and prospects of people in and trying to access the profession then the current system must be changed.  Much of what is contained in this Bill aims to deliver this type of change.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Debate on the Bill has been over-heated and some of the commentary on it has been strong and expressed in a particularly definitive language.  That the Competition Authority felt obliged to comment on the Bill as being reasonable legislation of the type normally introduced in a democratic society indicates its view of the debate which took place.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I will comment on some of the issues touched on by other Deputies.  The Minister has already stated that he will bring forward amendments to the Bill during its passage through the Houses.  When on the Opposition benches, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, had extraordinary success in terms of having his ideas taken on board by the Government of the day and implemented through legislation.  I am sure he, as Minister, will show the same spirit having listened to what others have had to say on this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Concern has been expressed about the independence of the regulatory authority.  I was disturbed to read in a newspaper report this week the allegation that the Government was required to contact the IMF to provide a statement in regard to protecting the future independence of legal bodies.  I am certain that this Government would not bring forward a Bill which would seek to subvert that independence.  There is ample opportunity in the process to allow for clarification of provisions in this regard or to make that point explicitly clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">There is a clear difference between appointment of a person to a body and such person then being beholden to a Government.  If the Government of the day is not entitled to appoint people to perform functions for it, then who is?  What is the role of Government but to appoint people to perform functions which it believes are in the public interest and are set out in legislation.  That said, the Minister has signalled his intent to discuss this matter further as the Bill progresses through the Houses.  I am sure that where necessary, procedures and protocols in respect of how people are paid, appointed and can be dismissed, as required in the national interest, will be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">I will comment on a point made by Deputy McNamara in regard to implementation of multi-disciplinary teams.  As someone who spent 11 years working in such teams in other parts of our economy, I fail to understand why, if they work well in so many other different parts of our economy and society, they should be precluded from implementation in other areas.  The pooling of expertise and knowledge across industries and services works.  I cannot see why a similar model would not work in the legal profession.  However, we must ensure this does not act as a barrier to entry.  I acknowledge there is some weight in that concern.  One of the benefits of a market that is allegedly perfect in economic theory, which I am sure this one is not, is that it in theory allows freedom of entry.  Freedom of entry, even in theory, is of great benefit and should be protected and enhanced.  What I would not like to see happen is movement towards a system which would further weaken the real freedom of entry which we hope people enjoy.  I know, having worked in such teams for many years prior to my election to the Houses of the Oireachtas that they work well in many other parts of the economy.  They deliver entry and allow people of merit and value to gain work.  I am sure the same can happen in the legal profession.  We also need diversity of practice in our legal services in the future.  Alongside these multi-disciplinary teams we need to ensure there are, for want of a better phrase, sole traders who can provide a service to the State and citizens.  We need to ensure this type of diversity of practice is protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">On the cost of regulation here, there is no doubt but that the model of self regulation has not worked in crucial areas of our society.  We now need to move away from this model in every respect.  We also need to ensure that when that regulation is substantial, as will be the case in this regard, it does not generate an incentive for any cost to become an unreasonable cost which is then fed to the people in the industry who more often than not will pass it on to the those people availing of their services.  Many people have welcomed the greater clarity, procedure and protocols being put in place in relation to cost, certainty of cost and the components thereof and ensuring all of this is done in a transparent manner.  I am sure that the Minister would also want to ensure that as costs decrease and become more transparent there will not be an incentive for costs to increase further owing to implementation of regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">I heartily welcome this Bill.  The Minister will address all issues of concern.  The Minister and his officials must be complimented on the breadth of complex legislation which has emanated from the Department of Justice and Equality.  Setting the complexity and ambition of this Bill against what is also proposed in the area of personal insolvency, it is clear the Government's commitment to examine if practices are restrictive and need to be changed is being delivered on.  I look forward to further debate on this legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_109">
          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality  (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
          <p eId="para_474">I thank Deputies on all sides of the House for their contributions to the Second Stage debate on this important Bill.  The debate has provided us with an opportunity to consider the shape and content of the Bill in some detail, while taking account of the views of various stakeholders, including those of consumers and the legal profession as represented by the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">I regret some of the hysterical reaction to the Bill.  I find it extraordinary that people should suggest it has any intent other than to provide for independent regulation of the legal profession and that it should be suggested that there is some secret Government plot to take over the legal profession.  I practised as a lawyer for 35 years.  I spent many of my early years in free legal advice centres.  I was a director of the Crumlin centre and as chairman of the free legal advice centres campaigned for legal aid for civil cases when none existed.  I come from a law practice that over the years has taken on a substantial amount of work <i>pro bono</i>, some of it from the free legal advice centres.  Some of it resulted in constitutional actions or cases successfully taken against the State in the European Court.  Consequently, I come from a background in which I greatly cherish and recognise the importance of having an independent legal profession and the role it plays within society.  I also recognise the decency and honesty of the vast majority of members of the profession both within the solicitor’s profession and at the Bar, while also recognising there are small numbers of individuals who have besmirched its name.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">While this is from where I come, I also come from a position in which I believe the profession for many years has been in need of substantial reform, has been resistant to reform and used every means at its disposal to dissuade Governments from implementing any fundamental reform.  The Administration is determined to introduce essential reform as part of the programme for Government.  The legislation before Members today would have been introduced by the Government without the EU-IMF agreement.  While the Government might have had an additional few weeks in which to prepare it, it would have been brought forward because, as Minister for Justice and Equality, I am determined that the legal profession be modernised, that we will move from self-regulation to independent regulation, that we will have greater transparency in legal costs and that the consumer will be central to how we proceed, not simply the vested interests of the individual professions.  I make this point as a lawyer.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">I do not know, when my term as Minister for Justice and Equality concludes, whether I will find myself back engaging in legal practice.  While this is a matter I have not addressed, were I to do so, either as a rural or an urban solicitor, I would fear nothing contained in the Bill in the context of my independence in acting as a lawyer or with regard to the possibility of a legal practice being financially viable.  It is important is to make this point because many strange things have been said both about Government motives and the impact the Bill may have.  Somewhere along the route, some of those within the legal professions who have stridently opposed the Bill appear to have lost sight of the fact that self-interest does not always coincide with the public interest.  This is a crucial point to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">I have listened attentively to the contributions of Deputies and one certainly could not be in any doubt about the extent to which both legal professions have extensively lobbied Members of the House which is, of course, their right.  Nonetheless, I find it disappointing that a large number of Second Stage interventions neglected to seek or reflect alternative views such as those relating to the protection of consumers and other constituents who have no vested interest and are not an organised group.  Many of the speeches delivered were readily identifiable from the briefings widely distributed by the two professions to Members of the House.  While individual Deputies, of course, were entitled to rely on such briefings, where was the consumer in their considerations?  I refer to the consumer of legal services, the consumer who wishes to see greater competition, the consumer who seeks greater transparency in legal costs and the consumer who might benefit from a one-stop shop in which he or she could receive advice on a complex matter at a single location from perhaps his or her solicitor and accountant.  The consumer has been substantially absent from many of the contributions heard in the House on the Bill.  I state clearly this does not apply to all Deputies but an extraordinary number of Deputies entered the House, not having heard speeches delivered by other Members, and unknowingly repeated them from a brief that was readily identifiable to anyone who sat through the debate.  The consumer is central to how the Government will proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">I was interested in comments made concerning another group which is central to the debate.  Where do young lawyers stand in all of this?  I refer to those newly qualified solicitors and barristers who do not have a background in the legal profession.  They do not have daddies, mummies, uncles, aunts or cousins who are well known solicitors and barristers.  Many such individuals have qualified in recent years and the options open to them to practice are so limited that after a few years of starving, they are leaving the profession.  What consideration has been given by most Members of the House to the alternative mechanisms for delivering services the legislation will permit or the opportunities they provide for newly qualified young lawyers who, either themselves or their families, have spent large sums of money or may be in debt to qualify as legal practitioners but who currently have no outlet for their professional expertise?</p>
          <p eId="para_480">It is also remarkable how little attention was paid to the views of the Competition Authority.  While it was mentioned during the course of the debate today, it hardly featured outside otherwise.  The Competition Authority has declared its general support for the substantial provisions of the Bill.  It went to the trouble of making clear the reason it believed the Bill was in the interests of consumers.  I note its views, not merely the view it has expressed on the Bill but through its reports dating back many years that have sought reform of the legal profession, have hardly featured in this debate.  It is not its role to lobby Deputies and provide them with scripts; others clearly have done this.  However, the authority made recommendations in the interests of consumers in the protection of the public interest.  The Bill is focused on implementing those recommendations with merit, some of which had been studiously ignored by the legal profession, more particularly by the Bar than by the solicitors' profession which I acknowledge addressed a number of the issues raised by the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The perspectives brought forward by Deputies have served to vindicate the fact that the Bill provides a balance between public and professional interests and strike that balance in an appropriate manner.  The interests are iterated in the statutory objectives of the new legal services regulatory authority to be found in Part 2, section 9 of the Bill.  For the first time in national legislation, these objectives commit to supporting the proper and effective administration of justice, encouraging an independent, strong and effective legal profession and promoting and maintaining adherence to what are described as the professional principles.  Those who entered the Chamber to suggest the Bill threatened the independence of the legal profession appear to have missed the fact that this is the first legislation of which I am aware that gives statutory recognition to the importance of having an independent legal profession.  This is the first time this value and importance attached to the legal system in our democracy are fully and properly recognised in a major statute.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Similarly, the Bill commits to promoting and protecting the public interest and the interests of consumers in the provision of legal services, while also promoting competition in the provision of these services.  Members' discussion of the Bill has underscored the need to keep these objectives in balance.  In that light, I will take account of the exchanges in the House in fine-tuning the Bill.  I have never seen a Bill of this magnitude published by a Government and introduced to the House that did not require some fine-tuning and amendment.  That is part of the democratic process and what makes meaningful debate in the House.  I intend to bring forward timely and appropriate amendments on Committee Stage to address a number of issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">In working towards an appropriate balance of the professional and public interests in the delivery of legal services I have been greatly encouraged by the decision taken by the council of the Law Society of Ireland on 20 January, namely, that the Law Society of Ireland recognises that "it would be in the best interests of the public and the profession" if complaints were no longer to be dealt with by the society but by the new legal services regulatory authority to be established under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">When it was first published, the Law Society of Ireland clearly opposed this very important reform.  I commend it, having reconsidered its initial stance, for being willing to put aside the complaints procedures it has used and developed in the past 150 years in order that public perceptions of impartiality can be enhanced to the utmost degree.  That is the value of debating issues, reflecting on initial stances and re-evaluating what is in the public interest.  I thank the Law Society of Ireland and recognise that it has changed its perspective on the Bill.   What it has done is a recognition of the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">Unfortunately, I am not aware of the Bar Council of Ireland stating its position on this far-sighted step by the Law Society of Ireland, although it is my hope it will similarly embrace the independent complaints structures set out in the Bill.  I remain confident that the council will ultimately recognise the obvious merits of an independent complaints procedure which is not merely in the public interest but also in the interest of the professions.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The independent complaints procedure will uphold the highest standards of professional conduct and it should apply equally to and be accepted by barristers as well as solicitors.  Such an independent structure will enjoy a commensurate and the optimal level of confidence among the general public.  The current Bar Council of Ireland complaints structure, although administratively compartmentalised, cannot achieve these attributes to the desired degree, as they are operative within the council's own domain.  In their zeal to undermine the independence of the new legal services regulatory authority some have conveniently overlooked the reality that a representative body engaged in self-regulation tends not to be perceived as independent in carrying out its functions, as it essentially flies in the face of the well known legal principle, <i>nemo iudex in sua causa , </i>no one should be a judge in his or her own cause.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">It is curious that a body which has sought to undermine the provisions of the Bill, by an allegation that the legal services regulatory authority will not be sufficiently independent, remains blind to the fact that the general public does not regard as independent the disciplinary structures run by that same body.  That is why the debate which has taken place has been somewhat curious.  When it came to regulation, the position of both the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council of Ireland was essentially one in which they wished to retain self-regulation and instead they attacked the Bill on the basis that the legal services regulatory authority would not be independent.  They both seemed to lose sight of the fact that no one outside their hallowed corridors perceived their regulatory procedures to be independent.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">I hope the wisdom of the Law Society of Ireland travels in the direction of the Bar Council of Ireland and that the council will recognise it is in public interest to have an independent complaints and disciplinary system in which there can be public confidence.  There can be no perception that it is simply barristers adjudicating on barristers and solicitors adjudicating on solicitors when allegations of misconduct are made.  I would have thought the principle <i>nemo iudex in sua causa</i> was widely recognised, understood and utilised by both legal professions when representing their clients in court cases.  How they could be blind to the relevance of this principle with regard to their own complaints and disciplinary structure is difficult to fathom.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">I will be bringing forward amendments to the complaints process, as outlined in Part 5 of the Bill, with a view to providing greater clarity in respect of the appointment of members to the complaints committee and the legal petitioners disciplinary tribunal, as well as the manner in which complaints will be dealt with by the authority, the complaints committee and the disciplinary tribunal.  I see merit in having a greater role for the authority in settling complaints, as far as possible, by agreement between the parties or by mediation, particularly when the complaints do not relate to very serious matters but are clearly of concern to the complainant.  It is important that this facility be available before the more formal processes of the complaints committee and the disciplinary tribunal come into play.  This is in the public interest and the interests of those who believe their affairs have perhaps not been dealt with appropriately by a lawyer from whom they have sought assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Having welcomed the deepening consensus on the Bill's independent complaints procedure in cases involving professional misconduct, it is worth recalling that the modernised legal costs regime provided for under Part 9 of the Bill has been welcomed by both the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council of Ireland.  It has also met with the approval of Deputies across the House during the debate.  The Bill has been welcomed by the Competition Authority, the National Competitiveness Council, consumer groups and a number of legal academics.  When contributing to the debate in the House, I do not think a single Deputy made reference to the support expressed by the National Competitiveness Council, or by some legal academics, at least one of whom spoke at a conference organised to address issues relating to the Bill.   Therefore, we already have a solid basis for a working consensus on the Bill and two of its key provisions, namely, the modernised legal costs regime and the independent public complaints procedures.  I call on the Bar Council of Ireland to join in that consensus.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">Having recognised the virtuous balance between professional and public interests already realisable under the Bill in terms of its respective legal costs and complaints provisions, I would like to turn to the concerns expressed by Deputies and the professional bodies about the Bill's potential impact on the independence of the legal professions.  A number of these concerns have been directed at the impartiality of the new legal services regulatory authority and the modalities for its appointment, while others have been critical of the regulatory interface with the Government.  It has been contended by some that the Bill could augur an era of improper interference with the independence of the two legal professions.  As I mentioned at the outset of the debate, the objectives of the legal services regulatory authority are predicated, <i>inter alia</i>, on having “an independent, strong and effective legal profession” and adherence to “the professional principles” by legal practitioners who must act with independence and integrity, in the best interests of their clients and maintain proper standards of work.  Moreover, they must comply with the duties rightfully owed to the court and, subject to professional obligations, keep the affairs of their clients confidential.  These are all absolutes under the legislation.  There can be no Government interference in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">The legal services regulatory authority to be established under the Bill shall be "independent in the performance of its functions", having the necessary powers and functions to achieve this.  Its independence will be protected under the Bill.  This independence will be underpinned by the independent complaints regime and the independent legal practitioners' disciplinary tribunal.  All of these entities will be beyond Government interference.  Clearly, the guiding principles of independence permeate the Bill's key provisions, particularly those relating to the legal professions and the new regulatory architecture.  The inclusion of these independence principles and their related objectives at various points in the Bill would not have made sense if there were a hidden or ulterior motive to usurp or undermine the independence and integrity of the legal professions.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Under this Bill, every lawyer will remain an officer of the court who is free to exercise independent judgment in the performance of his or her professional service, to provide legal services and to represent anyone in court proceedings in the absence of any executive control or pressure.  All lawyers will remain completely free to champion fundamental rights under the Constitution and to sue the State before the courts without fear of executive disfavour, disadvantage or disapproval.  They will also be free to sue the State in courts outside this jurisdiction such as, for example, the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">One of the criteria for promotion to the status of senior counsel under the Bill is a record of professional independence.  What is interesting about the provision contained in the Bill in this regard is that not only will it implement a recommendation of the Competition Authority to facilitate the appointment of solicitors as senior counsel in the same way as solicitors in Northern Ireland and the remainder of the United Kingdom can be appointed Queen's counsel, it also - for the first time in statute - sets out a regulatory procedure for the appointment of senior counsel as opposed to having this based on something inherited from colonial times.  The latter system emerged centuries ago under the guise of the lawyer central to providing advice to the King or Queen of England in particular matters.  Essentially, there is nothing in the Bill which acts as a barrier of any description to a lawyer - be he or she a solicitor or barrister - representing an individual or a group of clients in respect of any matter relating to any legal issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">I was interested to hear it suggested - this is reflected in the submission from the Bar Council - that the Bill creates some huge barrier to members of the Bar, in particular, undertaking <i>pro bono</i> work.  The theory here is that barrister partnerships or multidisciplinary practices will not take on such work.  The strange thing is that there are solicitors’ practices throughout the entire country and the fact that solicitors can operate as partners has never acted as a barrier to their taking on <i>pro bono</i> work.  It is difficult, therefore, to fathom the logic how barristers acting in partnership would be prohibited from taking on this work.  If one is running a business and one wants to offer one’s services free of charge to a person one believes to be in need and whom one feels one has an obligation to help, it is a simple matter of one making a decision to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The independence of the Bar, the cab rank rule, etc., are all terribly important.  If solicitors in a legal practice operating as partners can undertake <i>pro bono</i> work, I do not understand why allowing barristers to operate in the same way would create some unique barrier in the context of their also undertaking such work.  Neither do I believe that the establishment of multidisciplinary practices will prevent people from taking on the type of work to which I refer.  If those who are members of multidisciplinary work wish to take on <i>pro bono</i> work then, hey presto, they can do so.  This is a voluntary thing and there is no mystery or magic attached to the fact of whether people are single practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The theory relating to the cab rank rule and members of the Bar being available to everyone, regardless of income, in respect of every type of legal case is interesting.  However, it does not reflect the reality in some instances.  The reality is that one cannot force people to take on cases if they do not wish to do so.  There is also the fact that individuals receive things such as retainers.  I have an abiding memory of what happened some years ago in respect of the tobacco industry when a number of litigants were considering suing that industry as a consequence of its concealing the dangers of developing cancer as a result of tobacco smoking.  Substantial litigation in respect of this matter was entered into in the United States where, incidentally, lawyers are not separated into solicitors and barristers, and much of it was done on a <i>pro bono</i> basis in the hope that it would be successful.  The fact that the lawyers involved were advocates and that they met their clients directly did not seem to inhibit them in the context of taking on <i>pro bono</i> work.  That is just be way of an aside.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">A great deal of the litigation pursued in the United States went extremely well.  However, we have a different legal system here.  Individuals were considering suing the tobacco companies here and the latter were in something of a panic about it all.  I well remember being informed that a number of prominent senior counsel in the Bar Library had been paid very large fees by way of retainer in the event that their services should be required by the tobacco industry and also in order to take them off the park in the event that some individual suffering from cancer who alleged that his or her condition was the result of tobacco smoking wanted to instruct one of them.  The cab rank rule does not quite dictate that every barrister in the Bar Library will be available to every litigant, regardless of his or her income.  Let us not be under any illusions about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">In my initial contribution to this debate on 16 December last, I reaffirmed that there is no hidden agenda in respect of ministerial functions or appointments under the Bill.  I also invited constructive suggestions which might enhance the Bill's regulatory framework in this regard, within the Government's stated policy objective of independent regulation.  I am more than happy to reiterate my invitation to all concerned to table constructive amendments, including in respect of the Bill's generic provision - based on legislative precedent - for a range of ministerial consents.  In December I indicated that I would be removing the need for ministerial approval for any codes of practice which the legal services regulatory authority proposes to apply to the legal profession.  I am actively considering other instances in the Bill where similar amendments might be made and where, having reflected on the contents of the Bill, I see no benefit or public interest in certain actions of the regulatory authority requiring ministerial consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">I have also confirmed publicly that I am considering possible amendments in the context of creating an appropriately independent procedure for the appointment of members of the legal services regulatory authority.  There are various models of reference by which this might be achieved.  One of these is the possibility of advertising through the Public Appointments Service and another relates to the option of drawing from a pool of nominating bodies in respect of appointments to the new authority.  I also intend to bring forward an amendment on Committee State in respect of section 8 in order to make provision to stagger the appointment of members of the authority.  This would be similar to the provision contained in section 10(7) of the Property Services Regulation Act 2011.  Such a measure would ensure continuity in the expertise and effectiveness of the authority, while safeguarding against the unilateral removal or roll-over of its entire membership in one sweep.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">I am also considering other aspects of the regulatory authority and its governance.  Although these aspects were made subject to standard legislative provisions on establishment, powers and functions in preparing the Bill, I am satisfied that they can be enhanced in order to allay any fears or perception regarding the possible imposition of any undue administrative, financial or other dependencies on the new regulatory authority.  Similarly, staff appointments would be better made by the regulatory authority itself under a public competition carried out by the Public Appointments Service rather than under the process of ministerial appointment which applies to civil servants generally.  The latter process would be inappropriate in this instance.  There is a useful precedent in this regard in the context of appointments to the Human Rights Commission and this will be reflected in the legislation we will be publishing in respect of the amalgamation of that commission and the Equality Authority into a single human rights and equality commission.  While I do not wish to downplay their current concerns about the future, it will be open to staff of the existing legal representative bodies - who would obviously possess the relevant skills and experience - to offer to apply for positions advertised by the new and independent legal services regulatory authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">I am also persuaded by the view that the power to supervise and inspect compliance with the regulations relating to solicitors' accounts should remain vested in the Law Society.  Under the Bill, the society will continue to have ultimate administrative and financial responsibility for the solicitors' compensation fund.  This refinement of the Law Society's proposed functions with regard to the fund can better incentivise compliance by solicitors in public and professional interests while avoiding the imposition of any burden on public resources.  If such work undertaken on behalf of the Law Society disclosed any misconduct this would be dealt with by the independent disciplinary system prescribed in the Bill.  If at a future stage the legal services regulatory authority were to recommend direct access to barristers for contentious business the issue of inspecting barristers' accounts would need to be considered and addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">A number of arguments have been put forward on the potential costs of the new regulatory authority and their possible imposition on consumers as an additional burden, and quite a number of Deputies referred to this.  Much of this argument has been fallacious in that it has studiously ignored the fact that legal practitioners already pay substantial fees in support of duplicative frameworks encompassing disciplinary committees and their attendant adjudication appeal and tribunal structures.  These costs are already being levied on legal practitioners as well as being passed on to consumers.  The Bill will transpose some existing supervisory and disciplinary structures, in the case of barristers for the first time in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">The relevant regulatory costs should logically transfer from the existing structures to the new regulatory architecture.  It seems many of the Deputies who contributed to the debate on this aspect of the matter were oblivious to the fact that it is estimated that €11.5 million is spent at present by the Law Society on its regulatory functions and this money is effectively levied from solicitors who no doubt have regard to it in determining levels of legal costs charged to their clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">With regard to legal costs generally it should be remembered the mere existence of downward pressure on legal costs due to the current economic recession does not in itself represent sustainable structural reform of what the EU, IMF and some Deputies have described as the sheltered professions.  The Bill recognises the need for a longer-term solution and puts the relevant change, transparency and redress measures in place so legal services can be provided in keeping with a modern, competitive, recovering and open economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">The negative campaigning against the Bill conducted at international level has merely provided a platform for external lawyers or other parties to undermine Irish legal practice and its international reputation in a way discouraging to potential foreign investors.  It is quite clear that some of those from outside the State who commented on the Bill have not carefully considered the full detail of the Bill prior to making the comments they made, nor have they managed to distinguish between the representative and regulatory functions exercised individually by the Law Society and the Bar Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">I remain conscious of the need to achieve greater competitiveness in tendering and procurement of legal services whether by the State or private enterprise.  This is an issue to which some Deputies correctly referred.  We must prevent from occurring again situations such as that experienced under NAMA where a prohibitive €25 million turnover criterion was applied in the procurement of legal and financial advisory services to the exclusion of many viable prospective providers and the exclusion of the vast majority of solicitors' firms throughout the State.  Such an approach was detrimental to the State and contrary to the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">The tendering for legal services by State bodies is, as Deputies are aware, under active review by the Committee of Public Accounts and by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  These are matters to which I may return on Committee Stage subject to developments.  Consideration was given in the preparation of the Bill to including express provisions to address the issue of tendering by the State and State bodies for legal services, and it is an issue that will be addressed in work being undertaken by me and the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  It is merely a question of the appropriate legislative mechanism by which we address it and the further work being undertaken by the Committee of Public Accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">At the broader sectoral level, the Bill provides greater flexibility and opportunity for the provision and consumption of legal services.  Therefore it can provide for legal partnerships as referred to earlier in which there is a mix of legal practitioners in a firm.  It can also provide for multidisciplinary practices in which there is a mix of professional legal practitioners - barristers and solicitors - and others such as tax consultants or accountants.  Such change is not something that can be rolled out instantly.  The Government recognises that prudential safeguards will need to be put in place for professionals and consumers.  Under section 75 of the Bill the authority will carry out a public consultation and evaluation process and then report to the Minister on the manner in which these models for delivery of legal services should be formed and operated.  It is only when this process has been completed that the relevant provisions by way of regulation or codes of practice or otherwise can be framed.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">I listened with great interest to what some Deputies stated about the threats posed by multidisciplinary practices.  Such practices are now being established in other jurisdictions, where a great deal of work has been done on how one deals with regulatory matters and ethical issues with regard to such practices.  No one in the legal profession should be threatened by the possibility of barrister partnerships, legal solicitor partnerships or multidisciplinary practices.  As many at the Bar are well aware, in the legal profession are what I describe as virtual partnerships between some members of the Bar and solicitors whereby some members of the Bar regularly get work from one or two identifiable practices on whom they are dependent for their income, and solicitors regularly interact with a very small number of members of the Bar.  This does not happen on all occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">A speaker today referred to the fact that not all members of the Bar are in the Law Library.  Barristers operate in group practices in parts of rural Ireland.  They cannot advertise that they do so, but to all intents and purposes they are partners save in name.  They can share expenses but not income.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">With regard to some young barristers who starve at the Bar, would their position not be far better secured, their economic future protected and the value of their education used in the public interest if they could be employed directly in a solicitors' firm or a barrister group practice which would give them a guaranteed income in a proper business model while ensuring through codes of practice and statute that everyone still had to comply with what we have described as the crucial principles applicable to the legal profession?  I have received substantial support from newly qualified members of the Bar, some of whom are desperate to try to keep themselves together financially, from newly qualified solicitors and a number of individuals who see new opportunities to use their expertise in the provision of legal services which are not available to them at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">A key point to be made about the legislation is that it does not prevent any solicitor operating a one-man or one-woman practice; it does not prevent members of the Bar continuing to operate as single practitioners out of the Law Library; and it does not prevent solicitors continuing to operate in partnerships.  The Bill does not prescribe whether we have a very large or very small law firms.  At present we have what are known as the big five solicitors' firms.  We also have middle-range firms, small partnerships and individual solicitors throughout the country.  They are consulted by clients and provide legal services.  The Bill simply creates additional models through which legal services can be delivered to the benefit of the public.  Ultimately they will benefit members of the legal profession, particularly those trying to find their way and earn a living, who do not have relations, parents or cousins who are members of the Bar or members of the profession.  I am not at all convinced by the stark proposition that the new business structures to be enabled under the Bill will wipe out existing legal practices as a result of cherry-picking by well-placed legal practitioners or specialists, thereby leading to a diminution of access to justice.  There are legal practitioners who would readily refute the contention that the current architecture of the legal profession is a flat paradigm, void of any circles of access or influence and with no dominating players in the field.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">I emphasise that although the Bill introduces change and permits new business models, it does not impede the existing practice models applicable to barristers or solicitors.  Barristers who wish to do so can continue to be self-employed and work from the Bar Library.  What is being proposed is an alternative structure in which legal services can be provided using the innovative business technologies now in play, with greater competitiveness and the support of early national economic recovery.  A substantial number of individual and partnered legal practices are already using these technologies, pushing out the traditional boundaries of the legal domain.  Across the common law jurisdiction, new legal business technologies are being rolled out under new laws providing new legal commercial opportunities and career options.  We in this country must respond to what is happening in the global environment.  We cannot continue to operate legal services as they were operated in the 19th century, with no change.  We cannot continue to be blind - as some would wish me to be - to developments that have taken place across the water in England against which law firms on this island are competing with regard to certain types of commercial work.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Our Second Stage debate has been useful in making up in part for the compressed timeframe in which this Bill has had to be promulgated by way of response to an acute economic crisis that is being addressed under the EU-IMF-ECB programme.  I reiterate the Bill would have been published, addressing all the reforming measures without its being party to the programme, but it was the timeframe detailed within the programme that required it to be published at such speed, within a short time of this Government taking up office.  The debate has also provided an opportunity to fine-tune our perspectives on the more generic legislative provisions which have been drawn from in preparing the Bill.  As outlined, and in light of my Department's ongoing work on the Bill, there will be a number of constructive amendments that can be put in train for Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">I also acknowledge and thank those bodies and individuals who furnished very detailed submissions to my Department with regard to possible amendments, changes and developments of the Bill to fine-tune its provisions, ensure we address all the important issues we wish to address, and ensure that when we establish the legal services authority, it will be competent and able to fulfil its duties, undertake its work and meet the onerous obligations imposed on it under the terms of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">As I signalled, there is an ongoing opportunity for Deputies to put forward constructive proposals, which I welcome.  Although a preliminary regulatory impact assessment had been in preparation for the Bill, because of the prescribed timeframe from the EU-IMF, it did not prove possible to complete it for publication when the Bill was published for this debate.  The development of that regulatory impact assessment is further advanced and will continue against the backdrop of the amendments I propose for the Bill.  It will be made available for timely consideration in advance of Committee Stage.  Deputies will be aware that the relevant guidelines specifically allow for regulatory impact assessment to follow a Bill in such exceptional circumstances as applied in this instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Substantial positive progress has already been made towards achieving an appropriate balance between the independence of the legal professions and the Government's stated policy objective of independent regulation.  At this juncture we have reached a point where we can realise the key reforms to be delivered under the Legal Services Regulation Bill.  Even though there is opposition from the professions to aspects of the Bill, it is interesting to note it now seems both the Law Society and the Bar accept independent regulation, as opposed to self-regulation.  The only matter at issue appears to be the modalities for the appointment of individuals to the new legal services regulatory authority.  The Bill provides for an independent legal services authority, an independent complaints framework and an independent legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal.  These are being buttressed by the functions and powers of a modernised office of the legal costs adjudicator, with the support of transparent legal cost principles and procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">I welcome and appreciate the engagement on Second Stage of the Bill and I look forward to Committee Stage.  I will make my proposed amendments to the Bill available to Deputies sufficiently in advance of Committee Stage to facilitate their due consideration.  It is clear from our exchanges and from what I stated this morning that the Government is well on the road to facilitating a workable convergence of the relevant, professional, consumer and other interests in regard to the new legal services architecture.  A number of key actors have chosen to reciprocate this approach, which remains open to all comers.  There are no remaining obstacles to the perfection of this Bill and its timely reforms other than that of opposition to the very idea of independent regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">I welcome that the majority of speakers in this House, even when they had issues with aspects of the Bill, appeared to support the concept of independent regulation.  This did not apply to all.  Some of the contributions showed ambiguity as to whether the speakers supported independent regulation and simply wanted to copperfasten that independence or whether they were harking back to self-regulation and their arguments were more of a Trojan horse to undermine the Bill.  The substantial majority support in this House was for the intent of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I thank Deputies for the detailed consideration they gave to the Bill.  I look forward to a constructive Committee Stage and hope we will see this legislation enacted during the course of this year, with the very important reforms that have been so badly needed for so many years in place, in the public interest, in the interest of consumers, and in the interests of the legal profession.</p>

          <heading>Services for People with Disabilities</heading>
          <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_112">
            <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_526">I thank the Minister of the State for taking this debate.  I wish to raise two issues regarding disability services.  I acknowledge the Government wants to protect them but the overall reduction in the budget allocation for these services is 3.7%, 2% of which is supposed to be achieved through efficiencies.  I am in favour of efficiencies and I accept that the headline salaries paid to the chief executive officers of so-called not-for-profit organisations are indefensible.  However, only a few service providers offer such salaries.  Most of the providers have pared back their costs as far as they can in the past four years of cutbacks.  It is inevitable that front-line services will be impacted on, if not devastated.</p>
            <p eId="para_527">One such organisation with which I am familiar is Cheeverstown.  Its budget for 2012 has been reduced by €1.5 million while last year it was reduced by €700,000.  The administrators are working within the confines of the recruitment ban, increments payable to all staff under the Croke Park agreement and an exceptional pensions bill.  The organisation will lose three of their four social workers to early retirement.  One of them at least will have to be replaced even though there is no budget for that position and Cheeverstown has to use the probation service to paint buildings.  They have no flexibility to achieve efficiencies.  The only way the new budget can be implemented is by cutting back on services.  Due to the cutbacks, for example, respite services have been reduced by 40% and they probably will be terminated altogether this year.  The Minister of State can imagine the impact this will have not only the disabled clients themselves but on their families who depend on respite care.  All disabled people and service providers cannot be penalised because of high salaries paid to a few chief executive officers.  For instance, hospitals are not penalised because consultants have high salaries, even though there is room for inefficiencies in this sector more than in the disability sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_528">The most urgent issue is the plight of disabled school leavers this year.  Normally, special provision is made for them but the service is being abolished.  No provision will be made for the 650 school leavers this year.  A number of the high performing clients will enter the education sector but those who are most handicapped depend on the health service and they will have no access to services.  If they are forgotten by the health service, they will be forgotten by all of society, which is unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_529">There was a misunderstanding about what was agreed between the HSE and service providers, which was regrettable, but no matter where the blame for this lies, it does not lie with 18 year old severely disabled children.  I cannot stand by while they and their families pay the price for this mistake.  If the Government decided to cut all third level education, there would be a revolution and we would not even consider it and, therefore, I do not know why we consider it for people who need our help most.  I can understand and accept cutbacks in the provision of transport, meals and so on.  Everybody understands we are in difficulty but condemning a cohort of children to lifelong incarceration without services from next summer is indefensible and unacceptable.  Many of these children are so disabled that they will not leave home again if they are abandoned now by the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_530">I plead with the Minister of State in conjunction with her senior ministerial colleague to examine the overall health budget and to find relief within it for this cohort of children.  Savings must be achievable in the overall health budget. The Minister does not have to single out this most disadvantaged group.</p>

          <speech by="#" eId="spk_113">
            <from>Deputy Minister of State at the Department of Health ( Róisín Shortall)</from>
            <p eId="para_531">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</p>
            <p eId="para_532">Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive, HSE, is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services, including disability services.  The HSE, through its occupational guidance service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education.  This process requires flexibility from disability service providers and the maximisation of additional capacity from within existing resources.  Some referrals are appropriate for rehabilitative training programmes and others are suitable for other disability and mainstream services.</p>
            <p eId="para_533">Where appropriate, the occupational guidance officer will refer and support the individual to access FÁS services in line with the operational protocols agreed between the HSE and FÁS at national level.  Referrals are also made to other services appropriate to the individual. The aim is to address the needs of individuals in one or more of the following ways: health funded rehabilitative training; health funded day services; FÁS funded rehabilitative training; FÁS funded vocational training; and approval to extend education placement for a specified time.  The plan for each individual is dependent on final decisions by service users where more than one service model may be considered; approval, if requested, to extend current educational placements; and capacity of providers to make best use of available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_534">The HSE monitors the outcome of this process to ensure that, in as far as possible, the needs of each individual young person with a disability leaving school are addressed.  The demand for services for school leavers continues to grow.  The planning process is under way to ensure all school leavers requiring services are considered and prioritised.  The HSE expects that approximately 600 school leavers will require services in 2012.  Other health funded day services are provided from the range of general day services provision for adults with disability.  While the executive makes every effort to provide day services to people over 18 on leaving school, this always has been dependent on the availability and location of appropriate places coupled with the needs of the individual school leaver.</p>
            <p eId="para_535">In the current year, the disability services will be required to cater for demographic pressures such as new services for school leavers and emergency residential placements, from within their existing budgets.  Meeting the needs of all school leavers with disabilities will be challenging.  However, both the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of available resources in a creative and flexible manner to be as responsive as possible to the needs that present.  There is evidence that an accelerated move towards a new model of individualised, person-centred service provision in the community can help to achieve efficiencies, particularly relating to services for those with mild or moderate intellectual disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_536">The emerging departmental policy direction - the value for money and policy review, coupled with recommendations from HSE national working groups on key service areas, including the forthcoming review of HSE funded adult day services, emphasise the need for a new model of service provision that, if agreed by Government, will further the independence of people with disabilities in an efficient and cost effective manner.  The adult day services review will be published in the coming weeks and will contain recommendations that will guide the reconfiguration and modernisation of services in this area.  I regret to say it is not an option to seek additional funding.  There are huge pressures on all our public services and for that reason a much higher level of flexibility and creativity is required.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_537">I am a little surprised to hear the planning process is under way to ensure the needs of school leavers will be considered and prioritised when one cannot prioritise something if no funding is being provided for it.  This is the first time ever there is no provision for such school leavers.  I understand the need for efficiencies and savings and I have no problems with the 2% savings, but to use disabled people to drive efficiencies in organisations is not fair.  It not the job of the disabled to drive efficiencies; it is the job of the Minister and the HSE to ensure there are efficiencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_538">The service provider are now being asked to provide services for additional people out of funding that is now 14% less then it was a few years ago.  It is not possible to effect the kind of efficiencies that will ensure there is no reduction in front line services.  I am talking specifically about the school leavers.  If there is no provision, there is no service.  I am not seeking the allocation of additional funding into the health service but that there must a reallocation of funding within the overall €14 billion.  In that €14,000 million surely it is possible to find even half of the meagre sum of €10 million which was allocated last year.  If they even got €5 million, at least it would ensure that those children who are leaving school would get out of the house sometime over the rest of their lives.</p>

            <p eId="para_539">It is not a case of using disabled people to drive efficiencies.  In the case of disability services, the plan provides for a 3.7% reduction in budgets but it makes it clear that there is scope for achieving a 2% saving on efficiencies, which brings it down to a 1.7% reduction.  In the current climate where everybody is under pressure in terms of budgets and is required to reduce their budgets, cut down on overheads and achieve efficiencies, I think that is a reasonable figure.  We want to ensure that people with disabilities do not take the hit in this regard.  We want to achieve savings through reducing overheads, adopting a better approach to the provision of services and a more realistic view in regard to salaries in this area and the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, is determined to achieve those efficiencies but not at a cost to the individuals concerned who are dependent on the services.  That is why this report is being brought forward and why there will shortly be recommendations on new models of care, which are more efficient and more responsive in terms of the people who need those services.</p>

          <heading>Ambulance Service</heading>
          <speech by="#BarryCowen" eId="spk_116">
            <from>Deputy Barry Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_540">In seeking to discuss the issue of the Offaly ambulance service, I want to focus particularly on Edenderry ambulance service, where the situation is causing grave concern and worry among staff and residents in the general locality and region.  Currently the staffing of the service comprises five full-time staff with five other staff available to cover at any time.  Up to November last year over a period of almost two years, the service carried out 650 call-outs covering an area of north Offaly, parts of Kildare and Meath.  It is particularly important to have this service and we want to have a quality service there given its rural nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_541">The ambulance bay was sought after a long number of years.  Following numerous representations and lobbying, the bay was put in place about two years ago.  Accommodation was provided in what used to be the matron's living quarters in Ofalia House, a community nursing unit in Edenderry, on the future of which we also seek clarification, considering the publication of the HSE Dublin-north Leinster region report this week, which refers to a €20 million cut across the regional community nursing care service.  The HSE had given a commitment in regard to facilities in Tullamore, Edenderry and Birr and I hope there will be consistency in that respect in the coming year despite the talk of cutbacks.</p>
            <p eId="para_542">In regard to this issue, the facilities consist of one room, a storage unit and one toilet to be used by male and female ambulance staff.  The facilities are not adequate.  Another example of their inadequacy is that after a call-out when an ambulance has to be cleaned, it must be transported to Tullamore hospital, which leaves north Offaly and parts of Meath and Kildare without an ambulance service.  This means lives are being put at risk whenever an ambulance needs to be cleaned.  The temporary accommodation for the ambulance service is totally unacceptable and it does not meet the standards required.  Permanent facilities are necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_543">The Minister, the HSE and the local authorities have been investigating the possibilities of co-sharing of facilities over a period of time.  In my most recent correspondence with the Minister, to be fair to him, he asked that I consult the HSE and the local authority with a view to examining if a facility at the new fire station, built three years ago, could be an option, and there could be a sharing of facilities in the interests of cost-savings but, unfortunately, having consulted the local authority that can no longer be considered an option.  It may have been the ideal location but when that fire station was built three years ago the local authority consulted the HSE and inquired if it had any wish to be part of or to take up an offer to locate a facility there and it was declined.  It is now deemed that option is unsuitable for a full-time ambulance service and a part-time fire service.</p>
            <p eId="para_544">The onus of responsibility now falls back on the Minister and we want him to maintain this full-time facility but we want him to take action to make sure the facility and service that is offered and provided is adequate, meets the standards required and meets the wishes of the locality and regions of north Offaly, Meath and Kildare.  To that extent, I ask the Minister to seek to either extend the area within Ofalia House for the use of the ambulance service or to examine the possibility of leasing a suitable vacant unit, of which there are plenty I am sure in the vicinity of Edenderry town.</p>
            <p eId="para_545">I ask the Minister of State to respond to this matter.  Having considered the Minister's response and all the parties having explored the potential in his response, unfortunately, the option cannot be progressed and the onus of responsibility now falls on the Minister and Government to put this situation right.</p>

          <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_117">
            <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
            <p eId="para_546">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I am responding on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Reilly.</p>
            <p eId="para_547">The national ambulance service provides pre-hospital emergency care and emergency transport to the health service.  Previously, each health board ran its own ambulance service, with little co-ordination of activities across board boundaries and no clear national leadership on pre-hospital care within the health service.  However, the national ambulance service works nationally and regionally, not locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_548">It deploys resources on a dynamic basis to meet surges in demand and ensure optimal spatial application of emergency cover.  Dynamic deployment of emergency services ensures the nearest appropriate resource is mobilised to the location of any incident.  Dynamic delivery, with resources moved around according to predicted demand, based on need and demand patterns, is more flexible and responsive, with better response times for patients and a better service.</p>
            <p eId="para_549">The NAS is committed to the provision of pre-hospital emergency services in Offaly, Westmeath, Laois and Longford.  There is a staff complement of 160, with seven ambulance stations and 17 emergency ambulances.  A command and control centre operates on a 24-hour basis.  Following a statistical and spatial analysis of the region in January 2011, the NAS made an evidence-based decision to decentralise resources to improve services in the area.  This clearly demonstrates the flexibility of public services to respond to local need.  Dynamic deployment in the Offaly and Laois areas is achieved by initial dispatch of crews from Birr, Tullamore, Edenderry and Portlaoise and dynamic dispatch of resources from surrounding stations, namely, Mullingar, Athlone, Tullamore, Naas, Maynooth or Navan.  Supporting this deployment model is an advanced medical priority dispatch system in control centres, which uses internationally recognised protocols and standards to ensure an immediate and appropriate response.  To provide a high quality ambulance service, the NAS operates with a range of statutory and voluntary and community organisations.  It has co-responder systems in place with the Laois and Offaly fire and rescue services and 32 community first responder schemes to provide first responder assistance in an emergency prior to the arrival of the NAS.  Last year, the NAS responded to approximately 650 emergency calls in the Offaly area.  The monthly percentages of category 1 "Echo" emergency calls responded to within a target timeframe of less than seven minutes and 59 seconds were some of the highest in the country in ten of the 12 months of 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_550">The Deputy raised the issue of ambulance facilities in Offaly.  I am aware that, as in any part of our health service, there are particular locations where the infrastructure may not be appropriate to the development of a modern service, and the NAS is moving to remedy this where possible.  However, in the current situation, it is clear that expectations must be adjusted and existing State capital assets must be fully optimised.  In particular, local fire service facilities offer an opportunity to provide solutions to inadequate or doubled-up facilities, in Offaly and elsewhere, where such solutions are feasible in maintaining and improving ambulance services.  The NAS will continue to engage with local authorities on this issue in order to secure the future of services in Offaly and other places.</p>
            <p eId="para_551">The NAS has undergone significant change to ensure quality, safety and value for money.  In line with other clinical areas, this process is ongoing as clinical needs and standards develop.  I believe these developments are in the best interests of patients and that they are a key part of the Government's work to ensure high quality emergency care.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</p>

          <speech by="#BarryCowen" eId="spk_118">
            <from>Deputy Barry Cowen</from>
            <p eId="para_552">I thank the Minister of State for her response.  However, it raises more questions.  I do not wish to be parochial with regard to this issue; I recognise the fact that we must spread across a region.  I do recognise that the base in Edenderry represents a region that covers not only north Offaly but also parts of Kildare and Meath.  The Minister of State mentioned the potential for doubling up of facilities.  As I said in my initial speech, this is something that has been explored to the nth degree in recent times with regard to the new fire station that was built three years ago in Edenderry.  Even during the initial phase of the design of that fire service, the HSE was asked by the local authority if it wished to avail of a facility within that complex, but it declined the offer, which left the local authority with no option but to design it to meet its own demands, which was that of a part-time fire service with two bays.  That looks after the local authority's requirements.  It cannot, unfortunately, provide the necessary accommodation or facilities to suit the ambulance service.  Thus, the responsibility falls firmly back on the HSE.  It must recognise, as I do and as the locality does, that the facilities and services within the complex in which they now operate are not suitable or practical and cannot meet the standards required.  The staff cannot continue to be expected to work in these conditions.  Not only is it detrimental to their daily working lives, it also poses a threat to the general population which puts lives at risk.  I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister to attack this issue urgently in order to provide either improved facilities at the present location or a new facility that can be accommodated at very reasonable cost.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_119">
            <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
            <p eId="para_553">As with the last issue, it is important to remind Members, lest they have forgotten, of the extremely difficult financial circumstances in which we are operating.  I am not going to go into the reasons for that; I am sure Deputy Cowen would not want me to do so.  The fact is that €750 million has been taken out of the health budget this year because of our extreme difficulties.  That poses enormous challenges within the health service in terms of maintaining an acceptable level of service where demand for services is growing.  That is the climate in which people are trying to function and, in fairness, staff are doing their utmost to plug the holes left by a lack of funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_554">As the Deputy has said, it is accepted that the current facilities are temporary and are not suitable, although it is recognised that the staff are nonetheless providing an excellent level of service in circumstances that are less than optimal.  There have been discussions with the fire service, and the NAS is of the view that the proposal it has advanced has potential.  It believes it is possible to accommodate the ambulance service within the fire station, and it has made proposals in this regard which are under consideration at the moment.  It is not realistic to think in terms of building a new centre at this point, but the NAS has put forward a proposal and it believes it is possible to reach agreement on a shared arrangement with the fire service.</p>

          <heading>Medical Cards</heading>
          <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_120">
            <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_555">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important topic for debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_556">Medical cards have dominated much of the debate in recent months in this House, but today I want to talk about a specific group of applicants.  In recent weeks, my office has seen an increasing number of cancer patients who have been waiting for extended periods for their medical card applications to be processed.  None of us wants those diagnosed with cancer to be put under any undue stress waiting for a medical card.  The reason I brought this to the attention of the Minister of State today is that I want to ask her to consider fast-tracking medical card applications for cancer patients and issuing medical cards automatically to those who are terminally ill.  Both of these suggestions should be implemented through a dedicated unit within the medical card section of the Department.  As the Minister of State is well aware, this call has been made by many on the front line in recent years.  I have been in touch with people such as social workers who deal with patients on a daily basis, and some of the stories I have heard are genuinely upsetting, such as patients who received their medical cards after passing away or had to go without wigs following their chemotherapy treatment because they simply could not afford to purchase them on their own.  No Member of the House, including the Minister of State, wishes to hear stories such as this, but that is the reality.</p>
            <p eId="para_557">Prior to the centralisation of the application process, emphasis was put on fast-tracking applications from cancer patients.  Staff at local level did this well and effectively, and it took many people out of difficulty.  However, that is no longer the case.  To make the problem worse, neither patients nor their social workers can speak personally to anybody, thus increasing the uncertainty.  Although some staff in the HSE try to help over the telephone, people are very dissatisfied with the current service.</p>
            <p eId="para_558">I urge the Minister of State to give serious consideration to these two categories of patients.  When a person is diagnosed with cancer, it is a point in their lives when they are under more stress and pressure than ever.  I have spoken to the Minister of State personally about this issue and know she understands the difficulties people are experiencing.  It would be a huge step forward if she could do something for them.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_121">
            <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
            <p eId="para_559">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I, too, am very dissatisfied at the level of service being provided for the public by the HSE in respect of medical cards, especially renewals.  I am engaging on an almost daily basis with the HSE to get to grips with the problem.  The indications are that as a result of changes made in recent weeks, there is an improvement, but there is still some way to go.  What has been happening in recent months is unacceptable and I hope it will come to an end shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_560">As the Deputy is aware, medical cards are provided for persons who, under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, are in the opinion of the HSE unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner, GP, services and other health services for themselves and their dependants.  The assessment for a medical card is, therefore, determined primarily by reference to the means, including income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  Under the legislation, there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with a specific illness such as cancer.  There is, however, a provision for discretion for the HSE to grant a medical card in cases of "undue hardship" in which the income guidelines are exceeded.  The HSE recently set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">With regard to the fast-tracking of medical card applications for certain categories, it is important to point out that the HSE already has a system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill or seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford.  Emergency medical cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant.  This can be initiated through the local health office by the office manager who has access to a dedicated fax and e-mail contact within the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS.  As a result, there are no plans to establish a new unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_562">While stressing that these arrangements are for cases of emergency only, it is necessary to better publicise these arrangements and I have asked the HSE to put together an information pack on these and other procedures for the public, health care professionals and Members of the Oireachtas in order that emergency cases can be dealt with properly and in good time.  I am not sure why social workers in the local offices would not be aware of this facility.  They certainly should be.</p>
            <p eId="para_563">With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency medical cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card.  As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months.  The arrangement is slightly different for persons with a terminal illness.  Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months.  Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure the person receives the medical card as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_564">If there are specific details in the case of patients with a terminal illness, it is important that they be brought to our attention.  As I said, there is a facility in place to deal with this issue, although it is not sufficiently well known.  I am insistent on there being a very fast turnaround in such circumstances.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_565">I thank the Minister of State who is committed to trying to help people who are in difficulty and to reforming the medical card system.  However, it must be brought home to officials in the Department that whatever system they have in place, it is still not working.  That is the issue I am raising.  When an oncologist says a person has cancer, there should be a facility whereby the person receives a medical card immediately - that does mean in days or weeks but within 24 hours.  As the Minister of State's heart is in the right place on the matter, I will not press her on it.  I genuinely believe she will solve the problem, but I hope it is solved sooner rather than later.  I urge her to continue her good work on the issue.</p>

When such applications are brought to the attention of the local health office, there will be a very fast turnaround.  If there is an issue with someone not being aware of this service, we will deal with it by publicising it in a more effective way.  There is a system in place and I want to be informed if it is not working properly.</p>

            <from>Deputy Simon Harris</from>
            <p eId="para_567">I am pleased to have the opportunity, with Deputy Alex White, to raise this important matter, although I am upset that it must be raised.  It concerns the widespread and appalling brutality in Syria.  Members will be aware of the reports of government forces in Syria firing mortar rounds and rockets and using heavy weaponry in civilian neighbourhoods.  The United Nations has found that the orders for these attacks are coming from what it has determined to be the highest levels of the army and government officials.  In a report to the UN Human Rights Council it states it has received credible and consistent evidence identifying both high and mid-ranking members of the armed forces who are ordering their subordinates to shoot at unarmed protesters, kill soldiers who refuse to obey such orders, arrest people without cause, mistreat detained persons and attack civilian neighbourhoods with indiscriminate tank and machine gun fire.  So far, thousands have died.</p>
            <p eId="para_568">Worryingly, Doctors Without Borders has issued a statement which refers to wounded patients and doctors being pursued.  It states they are risking torture and arrest at the hands of the security service.  Most of the wounded are no longer going to public hospitals.  Civilians are left dying on the street because they cannot be transported to safety.  Medical treatment must take place in secret and in makeshift and unsanitary operating theatres.</p>
            <p eId="para_569">This will appal any right thinking person in the developed world.  The frustration that many others and I feel is caused by the powerlessness of the international community to come to the aid of the people of Syria who are doing nothing more than peacefully seeking the liberty and freedom we enjoy in this country.  The question for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is at what point do we stand up and shout stop.  At what point does the developed world say enough is enough?  There is also the issue of the UN Security Council being in a position of stalemate, which is obviously a concern.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlexWhite" eId="spk_125">
            <from>Deputy Alex White</from>
            <p eId="para_570">The answer to the question posed by Deputy Harris is "Now".  This is the point at which the international community must say, "Stop".  Over 6,000 people have died in Syria since this time last year, an extraordinary and dreadful fact.  We have seen escalating violence in the past week or two which was clearly described by Deputy Harris.  Even in the last few days we have seen people whose job it is to report and be a witness of what happens in war situations and its impact on human beings, including young people, children and families, being attacked.  Marie Colvin of <i>The Sunday Times</i>, a journalist doing no more than her job of being that witness, was herself killed, with one of her colleagues, in the course of one of these shocking attacks.  She was a renowned journalist and a solid, reliable and robust witness to the impact of war in Syria and many other places where she had worked.</p>
            <p eId="para_571">The answer to the question has to be that now is the time for the international community to respond.  I know the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will attend a meeting in Tunis on Friday.  It is not directly related to Syria but I understand attempts will be made, whether at the margins or otherwise of that meeting, to address this pressing and shocking issue for the international community.</p>
            <p eId="para_572">We have much to preoccupy ourselves in this country, but it is essential we lift our heads from the challenges we face to see what is happening to ordinary human beings in another part of the world.  The international community must respond, perhaps by way of armed assistance to the opposition.  The opposition is fragmented but it is starting to indicate that it wants a clearer form of international intervention.  There must be a stepping up to the plate by Russia and China.  It is not acceptable for those two influential countries to maintain a veto on what the international community must do in that country.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_126">
            <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
            <p eId="para_573">I thank Deputies Simon Harris and Alex White for raising this issue.  I am responding on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, who regrets he is unable to be present.</p>
            <p eId="para_574">The situation in Syria is one of the utmost gravity which has attracted the almost universal condemnation of the international community.  It is appropriate that we should discuss this issue today.</p>
            <p eId="para_575">Because the Syrian authorities are not providing access, we do not have a clear picture of what is happening in Syria in terms of deaths, injuries, torture, rape and other abuses, but there is no doubting the scale of the suffering and the extent of human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law due to the actions of the Syrian regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_576">In the past month, the situation has deteriorated greatly.  The Syrian army has escalated its violent attacks, including indiscriminate and relentless bombings, against civilian areas in the city of Homs and the northern province of Idlib.  There are thousands of trapped civilians under merciless assault from their own government who urgently require protection and humanitarian assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_577">Ireland has been working intensively with the EU, the UN, the Arab League and other partners in the international community to compel the Syrian regime, through a series of robust economic, political and diplomatic measures, to cease its appalling attacks on the Syrian people.</p>
            <p eId="para_578">At EU level, the Foreign Affairs Council agreed, on 1 December and 23 January, additional measures related to the energy, financial, banking and trade sectors, as well as the listing of additional individuals and entities involved in the violence or supporting the regime.  The Government fully backs these measures.  They come on top of extensive existing EU sanctions, including a ban on oil imports from Syria.  Syria will also figure heavily on the agenda for the EU Foreign Affairs Council next Monday.  The Tánaiste will be attending this meeting where there will be consideration of how the EU can step up even further the already considerable international pressure on the Assad regime to change course.  This may include additional restrictive measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_579">At UN level, Ireland and all its EU partners voted in favour of a UN General Assembly resolution on 16 February which condemned human rights violations in Syria and which was supported by an overwhelming majority of UN member states.  The Tánaiste also outlined Ireland's serious concerns at the situation in Syria when he addressed the UN Security Council on 9 February.  In addition, the Tánaiste discussed Syria with the UN Secretary General at a meeting on the same day.</p>
            <p eId="para_580">The Government regrets very much that the Security Council, in failing to adopt on 4 February a draft resolution which commanded extensive support, has been unable so far to speak with a single voice on Syria.  A strongly worded Security Council resolution would be a uniquely powerful and resonant demonstration of concern on the part of the international community and would add significantly to the pressure on the Assad regime.  The Council's failure to date has instead provided a pretext for the Syrian regime to escalate its brutality against the civilian population.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">The Arab League, for its part, has been providing strong leadership in relation to the Syria crisis.  The peace plan which it outlined last November still provides the best basis for achieving a resolution.  The initial meeting of the Friends of Syria group in Tunisia tomorrow, which the Tánaiste will attend, is also likely to prove valuable in considering how to assist Syrian civilians and in endeavouring to bring together representatives of Syria's fragmented peaceful opposition.</p>

The fact that he will attend, on behalf of this country, the inaugural meeting of the Friends of Syria, in Tunisia tomorrow gives hope that this country can continue to do what it has always done, which is play its part in promoting human rights and protecting civilians from violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_583">The EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting of next week will be a crucial point for Europe to speak clearly with one voice and to leave our other international colleagues, particularly Russia and China, in no doubt as to exactly where the EU stands on this issue.  It is worrying for anyone who has confidence in the UN to see the UN's outdated structures unable to reach agreement on this matter.  The use of the veto by Russia and China has been extremely problematic.  The politics and power play that continually happen at the Security Council is disconcerting.</p>

The Government's response in the House and the evidence Deputy Shortall has given of the actions taken by the Government, particularly by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, is heartening.  It is no more than we expect but it is, nevertheless, extremely heartening and encouraging.</p>
            <p eId="para_586">Deputy Harris mentioned the clear rebuttal of the Syrian Government's argument that it is not responsible for attacking civilians.  Marie Colvin, the journalist who was killed earlier this week, was asked recently on CNN about the Syrian regime's claims that it did not target civilians.  She said, "It is a complete and utter lie that they are only going after terrorists.  The Syrian army is simply shelling a city of cold, starving civilians".</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn) (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_592">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 3 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_593">DEIS is one of the key measures to address the national target under the EU 2020 National Reform Programme.  Among the key issues and needs addressed by DEIS are targeted reductions in pupil-teacher ratios.  The reform of the teacher allocations process under budget 2012 includes no change to the mainstream staffing schedule for primary schools of a general average of 28 pupils to one teacher, including DEIS band 2 schools.  A dedicated staffing schedule for DEIS band 1 schools will preserve the favourable ratios of 20:1 and 24:1 for these schools, while additional support is being provided for DEIS post-primary schools through an improved staffing schedule of 18.25:1.</p>
            <p eId="para_594">The report on the net effect, in terms of posts, of budget measures on DEIS band 1 and band 2 urban primary schools that still had additional posts allocated under disadvantage schemes pre-dating DEIS was published earlier this week.</p>
            <p eId="para_595">On foot of the analysis in the report, the Government has now agreed to my proposal to retain a total of 235 posts, on a concessionary basis, in DEIS band 1 and DEIS band 2 schools.  As already announced, the withdrawal of 192 posts from primary schools outside DEIS bands 1 and 2 and from DEIS second level schools will proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_596">On the reallocation of posts under the general allocation model, GAM, I can now confirm that DEIS band 1 schools will be given an additional allocation of 0.2 of a post where the school has less than 200 pupils and 0.4 of a post where the school has 200 or more pupils.  We will continue to ensure that DEIS schools in the most disadvantaged areas are prioritised for targeted support, including preferential pupil-teacher ratios over and above mainstream schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_597">My Department replied to a recent freedom of information request on the withdrawal of certain posts under pre-DEIS schemes.  This request was refused under sections 19 and 20 of the Freedom of Information Act as the records in question were the subject of ongoing consideration at ministerial and official level at the time of the request.  This decision may be appealed under section 14(7) of the Act.</p>

I was not consulted about the decision of the Department to deny him the information.  It was an automatic decision because when the request came in, we were still discussing the changes.  In fact, the changes were discussed right up until just before the Cabinet meeting.  I am not sure when Deputy Smith's application under the Freedom of Information Acts was submitted, but I neither asked about nor intervened in it.

I wonder whether the Minister would agree that it is as a result of people protesting, and proving the efficacy of protesting, that there has been a reversal of these cuts which were targeted at the most vulnerable and disadvantaged schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_606">While that is a victory and an improvement, is it really acceptable that the cost will still be borne by the education system and school children's quality of education in general, particularly given that the schools that would suffer disproportionately from the reduction in the capitation grant funding will be precisely the disadvantaged schools, and they will be hit in another way?</p>
            <p eId="para_607">Of course, if one lives in a better-off area, if there are more well-off families who can afford bigger voluntary contributions, which they should not have to make in the first place as we should have a properly funded education system, at least there may be a little bit more of a buffer to make up the reductions in the grants.</p>

            <p eId="para_612">I would love to be in the position in which the Deputy thinks we all live, and in a world that does not exist as far as this country is concerned.  The fact is 17% of the entire current account budget of this Government, and of previous Governments, goes on education.  With the exception of social welfare, it is probably the biggest single expenditure item.  Some 80% of that budget goes to salaries and related employment costs.  Therefore, any adjustment that I must make comes within the 20% balance.  Indirectly, by removing teaching posts, I can theoretically reduce the costs but, in fact, anybody who is holding down a teaching post and is permanent does not lose his or her job, and will be redeployed elsewhere within the system, and the savings are quite limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_613">I regret that I must do what I must do.  I do not like it.  What I was doing, as Deputy Boyd Barrett might well be aware, was looking at DEIS band 1 and band 2 primary schools and those posts which were additional to the DEIS allocation, which had preceded the establishment of DEIS and which were known as legacy posts.  On the basis of the full impact, and following the discussions with politicians and Deputies on the Government side, and listening to what people were saying, I have decided to make this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_614">However, I stated on the day that I accepted I would have to review the position that any change that would take place would have to be financed from within the primary education budget within the Department, and that is what I have done.</p>

            <p eId="para_616">Public representatives on all sides were able to point to the success of DEIS and the research and evidence was there to demonstrate the importance of continuing DEIS.  I have still a worry when I am aware that 16 schools in rural areas are losing posts under the review that has taking place.</p>
            <p eId="para_617">It also concerns me that the measurement of poverty in a rural context may not be as accurate as it is for urban areas.  Persons in a rural area do not have access to a library and other facilities.  At times in the more crowded urban area the poverty is more apparent.  I have a concern that so many small rural schools are losing those particular posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">Do I take it from the Minister that his Department will accede to my request to release the information available, and it would appear that very little research was done in advance of the budgetary decision?</p>

            <p eId="para_619">Needless to say, I do not accept the necessity for education cuts.  It is simply extraordinary that we will pay €3.1 billion out at the end of this month for an Anglo Irish Bank promissory note while the Government thinks it is okay to cut education.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">I do not see, particularly in education, how the Government - I take the point that the Minister is put within certain limits - does not recognise that this is cutting off its nose to spite its face.  If there is one area that should be critical, both in terms of its vulnerability because it is our children and its strategic importance in terms of our future capacity to develop economically and socially, it is education.  If one cuts, as the Government is doing, at the quality of education for all the students, and there simply cannot be any doubt that such will be the result of these education cuts, then the effect at every single level for the future of our society will be negative.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">It simply undermines any reason to believe we can find a path to recovery or a way out of this crisis if we are cutting precisely the areas which would bring us out of the crisis, namely, our young people and our education system.</p>

            <p eId="para_622">Given many controversial things were said in and around the budget decision, I want to clarify the position.  There was no reduction in DEIS band 1 and band 2 primary schools in the normal course of events.  What was identified was that some DEIS schools had retained additional posts which had been allocated to them before DEIS was introduced in 2004, either under Breaking the Cycle or Giving Children An Even Break.  It was those additional posts that were identified and, on balance and having looked at the likely impact, I reflected on this and decided to leave them there because of the scale of the deprivation in some of those schools.  As a consequence of the change I have made, now two schools can be classified as DEIS band 1 with similar profiles in the community but one school will have more resources than the other because it happened to be allocated those resources in the past.</p>

            <p eId="para_627">The question may seem a little historical as I did not know when the report was to be published.  We all know the reasons DEIS was introduced, namely, to try to target and break down some of the barriers for children through the introduction of certain measures.  The point of my question, which follows on from the Minister's point on additional resources, is that I am aware of schools which, if given the opportunity today, would fit the criteria for DEIS.  While they are disadvantaged schools, the system itself is doubly disadvantaging those schools and the children within them.  The Minister will not want another review - God forbid - but is there any mechanism to look into this issue?  I accept what he says in regard to resources but we are doubly disadvantaging these children, which is wrong.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">DEIS was never about creating barriers or building walls, it was about pulling down walls and doing away with barriers.  The Minister says some schools will have more resources than others.  However, some schools are run alongside DEIS schools and fit all the criteria, including schools in my area, for example, in Inchicore and at St. Mary's in Tallaght, which has children from 26 countries as well as Traveller children, all affected by unemployment, social and economic change and so on.  The system needs to adapt.  What I ask is not unreasonable and the Minister should consider it.</p>

            <p eId="para_629">The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS in 2005 was managed by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, on behalf of the Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the inspectorate.  The ERC's overall approach was guided by the definition of educational disadvantage as set out in the Education Act 1998, which states: "the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools."  The Deputy is asking me, in effect, to look again at the whole categorisation of DEIS.  I am prepared to give that consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_631">With regard to the review of DEIS, particularly in regard to Breaking the Cycle, the Minister originally talked in terms of a pupil-teacher ratio of 15:1 and then 18:1, whereas the Department's website refers to 20:1.  While I may have taken it up wrong, has the ratio increased from 18:1 to 20:1?  There is a great deal of confusion about this.</p>
            <p eId="para_632">Some strange issues have come out of the review and there is a question of fairness.  People talk in terms of a drop in the number on school rolls.  This might be on the basis that the school is full to capacity.  I know of some schools in that situation where the Department will not provide funding for an extension so they are being penalised because they cannot expand or take in more children.

            <p eId="para_637">The modern languages in primary schools initiative has been a pilot scheme involving approximately 550 schools that has operated since 1998.  The decision to end the scheme took account of a 2008 report by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  The report identified serious issues with curricular overload at primary level.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">The NCCA's advice recommended that, for the present, modern languages should not be part of the primary school curriculum as an additional and separate subject.  The advice in regard to curriculum overload predated the wake-up call on literacy and numeracy triggered by the PISA results.  I am taking that advice on board with particular regard to the demands on time in school that will result from a heightened focus on literacy and numeracy.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">The primary curriculum is currently being reviewed by the NCCA in the context of the national literacy and numeracy strategy.  The €2.5 million in savings from this measure will go towards the cost of implementing the new national literacy and numeracy strategy.  The 17% of primary schools at present in the initiative, which have had even more time demands than others in a crowded curricular space, should as a result be better placed to deliver under the literacy and numeracy strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">Given the priority of literacy and numeracy, I have acted on the 2008 advice about overload and could not justify either the continuation of the initiative in the existing schools or its expansion to all schools, even if funding was not an issue.</p>

The only response we received was a copy of the NCCA report of 2008, a copy of the new national literacy and numeracy strategy and a Department official's summary of the 2008 NCCA report.  We have all praised the Minister's admirable initiative in regard to the literacy and numeracy strategy.  However, he seems to be sacrificing the modern languages programme in order to implement that strategy.  That defies logic.  Not only does the modern languages programme cost very little but one of the benefits in developing children's language skills is an associated improvement in literacy levels.  The Department is refusing to make the link between the two.</p>

            <p eId="para_643">The Deputy is correct that the modern languages initiative started life as a pilot scheme.  However, there was never a recommendation or decision by my predecessors to roll it out across the entire network of 3,200 primary schools.  Only 17% of that total benefited from the scheme.  As an Opposition Deputy I was appalled at the implications of the PISA findings in terms of literacy and numeracy standards among students.  Despite considerable increases in resources to the education system in the past 20 to 30 years under various Governments, illiteracy levels in certain sectors of our school population showed no improvement.  The correlation between greater resources and better incomes was not borne out in this particular instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">This is not a reflection on anybody.  Literacy begins in the home and these findings do not reflect in any way on teachers.  Nevertheless, literacy and numeracy are key predictors of future outcomes for children in the education system.  That is why I had to find €19 million from within my budget to finance all the components of the literacy and numeracy strategy, including the changes required in the primary teaching degree and the higher diploma in education, with the former extended from three years to four and the latter from one year to two.  The €2.5 million I saved by terminating the modern languages initiative was a significant component of that funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_645">The 2008 report was extremely complimentary of the modern languages initiative.  While it referred to possible overload, its recommendation was that the initiative should continue.  The Minister rightly points out that the programme was never rolled out to all schools.  In commentary attributed to him and to the Department there was a suggestion that a cap had been placed on an extension of the initiative.  That is not correct.  The cap was lifted in 2007, with an additional 200 schools joining the initiative in the meantime.  There has been ill informed commentary in regard to the extension of the programme and its value and a selective excising of one comment from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment report.  That report is outdated in any case given that the NCCA is currently working on a new report on language teaching in schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_646">All I can say is that there was no appetite among the professional educators in my Department, even before the PISA results were announced, to extend the initiative to all primary schools.  I raised the question of literacy and numeracy standards while in opposition.  The Deputy's former colleague, Mary Coughlan, as Minister for Education and Skills, responded to the PISA findings with an undertaking that the Department would take action.  A draft programme was published while the Deputy's party was still in government, which I was happy to support.  In June last year, when the national strategy was launched, I was more than happy to support it and to pledge that I would make the resources available to implement it.  That is what I am doing and why I took the decision that I did.</p>

The various initiatives to which the Minister referred to in his response today seem rather <i>ad hoc</i> in nature and are apparently confined to post-primary level.  Education on money management must begin at primary level.  I have suggested that it commence in fourth class so that children get a grounding in the subject at an early age.  Given the current financial and economic status of this country, it is about time that money management was included in the curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_651">Is there is any mechanism by which this matter can be reviewed?  For example, is there a curriculum review committee which could examine what needs to be done?  Personal money management and budgeting must be taught in a coherent and precise way, not in the current <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  I take note of what the Minister has said, but the current piecemeal and inadequate provision is unacceptable.</p>

            <p eId="para_652">I appreciate the Deputy's concern but do not share his opinion that money management should be a specific curriculum subject starting as early as fourth class.  There is certainly a need for it at transition year level when teenagers are becoming young adults and are much more open to the vagaries of advertising and the other issues associated with coming of age.  Home economics - a subject which I would like to see a much greater number of students, particularly boys, taking - includes a section within consumer studies that deals precisely with budgeting and management of personal income.  However, I am not prepared to include it as a specific curriculum subject.</p>

We must teach the practical aspects of finance rather than focusing exclusively on theory.  Two weeks ago the National Adult Literacy Agency, working in collaboration with the Educational Building Society, launched a website advising people on financial matters.  EBS is a commercial financial institution that was bailed out by taxpayers.  Its representatives will visit schools not because they want to teach children about financial management but in order to grow future business.  It is crazy to allow a bailed out bank that type of access on the pretence of helping to develop money management skills.  I am very apprehensive about having the EBS involved in this initiative, given its record.</p>

I have previously raised with him in parliamentary questions and at the committee the expressed concerns of the representative groups with which he met in July 2011 to discuss the remit of the statutory fund to ensure assistance would continue to be provided for the families and descendants of some of those who endured awful treatment in institutions.  I also raised this issue with him in the context of our processing of the residential institutions statutory fund Bill.  I am sure these concerns have also been outlined to him and other Oireachtas Members.  A number of the groups with which I spoke recently are concerned that the framework as envisaged will not adequately cater for the needs of particular individuals, particularly the children and grandchildren who have been availing of assistance through the education system.  The groups are concerned that this assistance will not be forthcoming under the new statutory fund.  It is hoped the Minister or his officials will engage with the groups which remain concerned about the extent of the assistance that will be available to the people concerned following enactment of the legislation.

I know that many of the victims-survivors have requested the provision of educational opportunities for their children and grandchildren, which is a worthwhile use of the money available.

The HEA presented an initial report to me last November. The report outlines the scale of recent reductions in funding and growth in student numbers and provides some evidence of the possible impacts on quality of provision.

            <p eId="para_666">I welcome the report and the Minister's statement that it is only a preliminary report.  The issue of sustainability is of huge importance.  The Minister has rightly mentioned the growth in numbers, which is a welcome development.  Even in these difficult and challenging economic times, undergraduate enrolments in the academic year 2010-11 increased by 4% on the figure for the previous year, which is also welcome.  Enrolments in the years from 2007 to the 2010-2011 academic year increased by 40%.  We all welcome the increased level of participation at third level and want to see it continue to increase.  We all want to see easy access for individuals.  However, we cannot have facilities spread all over the country in order to meet geographic demands.  We must also meet the demand for quality.  Is consideration being given to making better use of existing facilities?  There has been a dramatic improvement in recent years in existing accommodation and the provision of new colleges of further education and third level facilities.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, recently opened the new Trinity College Medical School.  All of this investment has been worthwhile and contributed to increased participation at third level.  Can we ensure better usage and occupancy of facilities?</p>

            <p eId="para_668">Members will be interested to hear that yesterday I met for the first time ever the presidents and chairpersons of the 14 institutions, including the DIT chairperson and president, Mr. Brian Norton, to discuss the landscape document issued recently to all third level institutions which asked that they examine ways by which they could come together to ensure greater efficiencies and a pooling of resources and that they form strategic alliances in order that there would be greater productivity and effectiveness in existing infrastructure.  I intend to meet the seven universities to engage in a similar exercise.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">Enrolments are to the credit of the institutions, as they have continued to increase at a time when their allocations from the Exchequer have been reduced.  Members will be aware that the level of funding was reduced by 2% this year and will be further reduced over a three year period by a maximum of 6%.  I share the analysis in the Hunt report that we need to look at the financing of third level education.  I am awaiting a response in this regard, but there is capacity to achieve greater efficiencies within the existing system and greater room for co-operation between colleges.</p>

These facilities have been put in place at great cost to the Exchequer in a worthwhile investment that will provide a good return to the taxpayer.  I emphasise we must maintain the quality of access to third level students in all parts of the country while at the same time appreciating one cannot have centres of excellence in specialist areas in each province either.  I refer to the important work entrusted to the Hunt group and its subsequent report, which was produced at the end of 2010.  This important work must receive further impetus to ensure the continuation of the valuable increase in participation in recent years.  All Members are aware of the importance of ensuring people have access to third level education both to develop an individual's potential for his or her betterment, as well as that of society, and from the perspective of employment creation and the economic stimulus that is needed.</p>

I believe in an all-Ireland strategy in respect of the maximised utilisation of third level education facilities.  In the case of Letterkenny Institute of Technology in particular, which is somewhat isolated, there is an obvious argument for collaboration with Derry and likewise between the University of Ulster and Dundalk Institute of Technology.  However, such collaboration should not be confined specifically to the Border areas and one must consider how to achieve collaboration in education on an all-Ireland basis.

However, the commencement of section 30, which is what the aforementioned Bill will do, will enable the Teaching Council to act as a professional body in a way that it has not been able to do previously.

Moreover, it is taking in approximately €5 million per year and the Minister could seek to recoup the initial advance of €5 million, which could go into a great many other services that are vitally needed in education.</p>

Even though the pupil-teacher ratio was increased slightly, all Members accept that fee-paying schools do not face the challenges faced by so many schools in disadvantaged areas in particular.  Is it true that such private schools take in €120 million in fees?  Is that general figure correct?  If particular changes are to be made, cognisance must be taken of the Protestant schools in which boarding is a necessity in many instances.  The Minister has heard me speak on the challenges facing many minority faith schools at primary level and has discussed this with me privately.  I also am concerned about the challenges facing boarding schools that are under the patronage of minority faiths.</p>

            <p eId="para_687">I believe the figure of €120 million is an estimate based on multiplying the number of pupils in each school by the demonstrated fees.  I understand that some schools have a mechanism for not charging fees, if the economic circumstances in a particular family deteriorate, to enable the child to finish school.  One should recall that all secondary schools charged fees until the period between 1966 and 1968, when Donogh O'Malley's scheme was being introduced.  The schools chose voluntarily to participate in a scheme whereby in return for not charging fees, they received a block grant from the State.  Out of 730 post-primary schools, 55 schools chose not to participate in the free voluntary scheme, of which 33 were of Catholic ethos, while the remainder predominantly were Protestant and they chose to remain outside the scheme for different reasons.  We asked for this detailed information because there is a wide discrepancy in the economic cohort of pupils in the different schools, particularly in the Protestant fee-paying schools.  When we get that information, we will be in a better place to see how we can provide additional help to some schools as opposed to others.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">Near the Deputy's own constituency, the Protestant Wilson's Hospital School caters for a large number of pupils from across the country as well as from the hinterland between Longford and Westmeath.  That school has managed to separate the operation of the educational school component of their activities and have opted to join the free scheme from that point of view.  They have a separate set of accounts for the residential and boarding component of the school and for the educational side of it.  That may be a model that can be adapted for some schools that I know are having difficulty at the moment.</p>

            <p eId="para_690">The school referred to by the Deputy is a two-teacher school with 19 pupils.  It will continue to be a two-teacher school in September 2012.  Based on its current enrolment it will remain a 2-teacher school in September 2013.   It may lose a teacher in September 2014.  However, it can avoid this if its overall enrolment increases in the previous September to 20 pupils. This gives a lead-in period of more than one year - to September 2013 - to increase its enrolment to 20 pupils.  Therefore, it is completely premature to say that the school concerned is at risk of closure.  The Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable for these difficult and challenging times.</p>

I presume it has an idea about the pupil numbers in that school for next year, which is why it is concerned about losing that second teacher.  The school has already been amalgamated and 27 out of the 31 Protestant schools in Donegal are all facing this.  That is replicated right across the country.  I have met representatives from schools in Clare, Cork and across the State.  They all say that the changes are affecting the Protestant minority schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">Can the Minister of State postpone these changes until the value for money report is completed?  We need to come up with some sort of alternative arrangement for these schools.  We are decimating them at a time when the Protestant population is getting smaller and smaller.  Many of these people left the State in the past but have a stake in these areas and want to stay there.  One of the things that keeps them in those areas is the school to which they can send their children.</p>

            <p eId="para_693">I have already made it clear that school communities should have no reason to feel that there will be a forced closure of their local school.  No school closes because it loses a teacher.  Small primary schools that had to close in recent years were those that were no longer viable due to falling enrolment.  The enrolment in such schools had typically fallen below a total of eight pupils for two consecutive school years.  The school to which the Deputy refers currently has 19 pupils.  I set out quite clearly at the beginning that if it continues to have numbers of that order, it will retain its second teacher for many years to come.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">For constitutional reasons, it is not possible to discriminate positively towards any particular religion or ethos, and the Department is obliged to operate the same staffing arrangements for Church of Ireland schools as any Catholic or any other type of school.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that his colleague in Northern Ireland is questioning the educational attainment and standards available in the small rural school network in Northern Ireland.  He has gone so far as to say that one would have to question the viability of any school operating with fewer than 100 pupils.  We are making no such statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_695">We also await the publication of the value for money report, which is due towards the end of next month.  We can then begin the conversation on how we sustain and build upon the excellent tradition of education in rural Ireland.  We must also look at how this challenge is being addressed in other jurisdictions, where we have similarly dispersed rural communities, such as Wales and Scotland.</p>

            <p eId="para_697">The problem is that we have already had an amalgamation here.  Representatives from another school in Ardara came to me and told me that the nearest school was 50 km away in one direction and 22 km in another direction.  We can only amalgamate so much, given the difficulties with transporting pupils from one place to another and so on.  We need to look at how we can resolve this.  I am open to looking at any solutions suggested.  These people feel under attack.  It is a slow attack, but it is undermining their ethos.</p>

            <p eId="para_698">An attack on schools in rural Ireland is the last thing this policy aims to achieve.  I come from rural Ireland and I attended a two-teacher school in rural Ireland.  My mother taught for 42 years in the same school.  I am not launching an attack on rural Ireland.  We are trying to ensure that the quality of the education provided in every institution, be it from the two-teacher school to the 15-teacher school, is of the same standard and that pupils emanating from that system have the best possible education made available to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">I do not agree with the Deputy that we have exhausted all the amalgamation opportunities at this stage.  Perhaps we may have done so in some communities, such as those he mentioned.  The publication of the value for money report will allow us to have that debate and discussion.  It is reasonable to suggest that one solution may work in one part of rural Ireland and may not be the solution for the other part of rural Ireland.

            <p eId="para_701">The Minister of State and the Minister may have seen a joint statement by Father John Joe Duffy and by Reverend John Deane in Donegal, which outlined their concerns about schools under the patronage of the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian church and the Roman Catholic Church in Donegal.

If we amalgamate a school with another school in a more populous area, the young people will be taken from that original area and they will not go back.  Sections of rural Ireland are being gradually depopulated by going down the road of amalgamation.  Amalgamation has been exhausted.  When amalgamation was brought in at the start, free transport was provided, but that is a thing of the past now.  In many areas, there is no transport at all.</p>

            <p eId="para_703">We have been anxious to point out from the very beginning that there will be no forced amalgamation of any rural schools or forced closure.  I do not agree that the amalgamation options have been exhausted yet.  I recall a colleague of mine saying in the Seanad last week that there were seven schools in his parish, consisting of an eight-teacher school, a smattering of two-teacher schools and a one-teacher school.  There are opportunities and if they are to be taken up, it will be with the willingness and at the behest of local communities.  That is something we stressed from the outset.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">Deputy Smith raised some concerns regarding Church of Ireland rural schools.  We are actively exploring opportunities with the Northern Ireland Minister with regard to discovering whether we might create a corridor along the Border so that students on both sides might traverse it to access the type of education which reflects the ethos in which they are being raised.  Discussions in that regard are ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">Exploration around all of these challenges will commence with the publication of the value for money report.  I am not trying to pre-empt the report - the detail of which I am not familiar with - but in general it will praise the standard of education that is being provide in rural areas.  In addition, it may offer some interesting solutions, which are not apparent at this point, in the context of how we should continue to provide this very high standard of education</p>

This is a significant and important development for the children to whom I refer.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">I sometimes feel that in respect of the matter to which I have just referred and in the context of others, the Minister has become a sort of prisoner of Marlborough Street.  He will recall that we had one or two meetings in respect of other matters at his office in the Department of Education and Skills and I am of the view that the culture which obtains in that institution has captured him.  The Minister just read out exactly the same reply which he gave to me on two previous occasions since this Dáil came into being.  I am not referring to information and communications technology, giving children laptops or making them familiar with computers, I am referring rather to computer science.  The chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, recently criticised the British education system and stated that the country which invented computers had lost sight of the fact that there is a need to embed computer-related subjects in the school curriculum.  I refer, here, to programming and analytical mathematics.  The Minister will be aware that one of Ireland's great mathematicians, Mr. William Rowan Hamilton, invented the quaternions that are used in computer gaming.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">There is evidence that from a very young age children can become interested in computers and there are even babies who can use iPads.  I am aware that the Minister is computer literate and I wish to impress on him the need to foster a situation whereby children might be exposed to computers right throughout primary level.  I have in my possession a very simple curriculum which includes subjects such as an introduction to programming, computing and data analysis, robotics and web design.  We need to familiarise children with these subjects and then include them on the curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">It was stated recently that there are approximately 5,000 vacancies in the ICT industry here and that these cannot be filled from among the ranks of our young people because they do not have the necessary skills.  The Minister referred earlier to the great Donogh O'Malley who introduced free second level education.  If the Minister is seeking a big idea, then perhaps it could revolve around enabling children to take computer science as a fully-fledged subject right the way up to leaving certificate level.  He should try to break free from the chains that have been put around him in Marlborough Street.</p>

However, the note with which I have been supplied states that it is not feasible to teach everything in school and that education policy is becoming increasingly focused on learning over the length of a person's life span.  Young people are learning how to use computers in the day-to-day environment of school.

There is a worldwide shortage of highly computer-literate people, which is why we are experiencing difficulties in filling vacancies.  In that context the Skillnets programme and the ICT action plan, which I recently launched, provide people with the opportunity to convert their skills.  Some 750 placements are available under the action plan.  I would be quite happy to raise this matter with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, to discover whether a specific module could be included in the new curriculum for junior certificate students.</p>

He will be aware that when he was leader of the Labour Party and I was one of its spokespersons, our ambition was to have a computer at every desk for every child all the way up through the education system.  We have now gone beyond that.  Those who work in this area have often referred to the example of people learning how to drive cars.  In this instance, we are discussing the engineering relating to cars and how cars are made.  Clearly this is an industry which is extremely important to our country and which has great potential in economic terms.</p>

I welcome the Minister's comment to the effect that he will raise this matter with the NCCA.</p>

In the context of digitalising the written word, Lord Puttnam argues that the use of computer technology is transforming the blackboard into the white board.  The use of ICT is transforming the way in which education and communication are delivered.  People face quite a major challenge in this regard, particularly those in the teaching profession.  It is, after all, teachers who we will ask to deliver in this area.  I will discuss with the NCCA the ideas Deputy Broughan has articulated.</p>

            <p eId="para_728">Following the Government decision in July 2011 to establish SOLAS, an implementation group was put in place to oversee the process.  This group includes representatives from FÁS, the further education sector, as well as from the Departments of Education and Skills and Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">Given the complex elements involved, including appropriate legislation to establish SOLAS and legislation providing for the establishment of education and training boards to replace the vocational education committees, VECs, it is not possible to give a precise timeframe for the transfer of staff.  This will have to be considered carefully by the implementation group in the context of all the elements involved, including the need to ensure continuity of provision of further education and training places.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">The composition of the board of SOLAS, the question of staff representation and other related matters will be considered as part of the ongoing implementation process.  As part of this work, a consultation process is being undertaken with all relevant stakeholders, which amount to more than 150.  It is envisaged there will be appropriate consultations with staff representatives on staff transfers.</p>

            <p eId="para_731">The key role of SOLAS concerns policy, strategy and funding adult and further education and training.  For these reasons, it is vital the entity have the skills and expertise necessary to execute these functions.  The skills and expertise must be drawn from the VEC and FÁS sectors if it is to be effective.  Therefore, it would be wise for the board of SOLAS to provide for equal representation for the VECs and FÁS, with the executive of SOLAS being staffed on a ratio of 50:50 by personnel from the VECs and FÁS.  Will the Minister of State confirm that the 200 staff employed at FÁS head office will be transferred to SOLAS?</p>

            <p eId="para_732">What we are involved in is the most far-reaching and fundamental reform of the further education and training sector the country has seen.  It is a gargantuan task in change management that requires the co-operation, willingness and enthusiasm of everybody involved in further education and training.  As chairman of the implementation group since last July, these are forthcoming.  We have representatives from the Irish Vocational Education Association, IVEA, at the table of the SOLAS implementation group.  We also have representatives from FÁS.  There is enthusiasm, energy, ambition and a willingness to provide the very best further education and training the country can provide and to put in place a system over which we can all stand and of which we can be proud.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">It is far too early to say 200 staff from FÁS will be transferring to SOLAS.  We will look at the resources available throughout the VEC sector and in FÁS and the constituent parts throughout the country to extract everything we need to put in place a world-class further education and training system.  We do not want to be too dogmatic or in any way prescriptive at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">The implementation process is ongoing.  I have asked for the opinions of more than 150 stakeholders on how we should make things happen.  They have submitted written contributions and at the end of next month we will bring them all together under one roof for what I hope will be a lively half-day conversation on how we can make SOLAS happen.  Any negativity or paranoia about the issues involved will be addressed in sitting down and speaking to one another and allowing everybody to understand that we are all setting out with the same ambition to achieve the same goal.</p>

            <p eId="para_735">The so-called negativity and paranoia, as described by the Minister of State, are down to uncertainty and the absence of a timeframe.  The Minister of State needs to put in place a timeframe and set out the parameters for when he hopes to have the process completed.  I fully understand he must seek the views of all stakeholders and that this is the proper way to do it.  However, he needs to put in place a system or structure, whereby the process can continue for only so long.  At the end of that timeframe he needs to make it clear that he intends to put it all together.</p>

            <p eId="para_736">The Deputy is correct.  We do need to have a definitive timeline to eliminate any misunderstanding or misinformation.  The SOLAS implementation group has achieved a great deal in the very short time it has been in existence.  On a paper basis, we have piloted the amalgamation of FÁS and the VECs in Cork and Dublin which has thrown up some very interesting results, some of them positive.  The legislation to bring SOLAS and the educational and training boards into being should pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas in record time by the end of the year.  SOLAS should come into existence early next year.  I am very confident that when the process is complete, everybody who works in the further education and training sector will be very proud of what will have been achieved.</p>

            <p eId="para_740">The policy of my Department is to promote the principle of inclusive education for children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">My Department, either directly or through the National Council for Special Education, provides for a range of supports in schools to enable them to cater for students with special educational needs.  This may include additional Resource Teachers, Special Needs Assistants and specialist equipment, depending on a child's level of assessed needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">I am advised by the NCSE that the majority of mainstream schools now enrol children with special educational needs and I am further advised by my Department's Inspectorate that the majority of children with physical disabilities, including cerebral palsy, now attend mainstream schools.  This is evidence that the policy of inclusion is operating successfully.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">Where children with special needs also require physical or sensory therapy supports, this support is provided by the Health Service Executive, and may be provided in schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_746">The new arrangements incorporate a long overdue updating of the GAM (learning support) allocation for all schools.  This inevitably involves changes to existing clustering arrangements whereby a teacher is shared between schools.  A further change is that schools in any locality are being empowered to cluster and arrange their GAM resources in a manner that best suits their local needs.  This should be completed by schools in March.  There are also new and separate arrangements for how resource hours for individual pupils are converted into teaching posts in schools.  The requirement for resource hours in a school varies from year to year depending on the number, if any, of its pupils with autism etc.  Small schools generally have a lower requirement for resource hours.  The new arrangements take account of the later timescale for the allocation of these hours necessitated by individual assessment by the NCSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">All of the changes are designed to enable a more efficient operation of the teacher redeployment and recruitment and to reduce the impact of travel time between schools where teachers are shared.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">My Department will be working with schools and the relevant education partners to ensure that the new arrangements operate as efficiently as possible.  As the process proceeds this work can take account of any appropriate local arrangements that might be made to further optimise travel arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_751">I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 21 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">The Report on the impact, in terms of posts, of Budget measures on DEIS Band 1 and Band 2 urban primary schools that still had additional posts allocated under disadvantage schemes, pre-dating DEIS was published earlier this week.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">The legacy disadvantage posts date back to programmes such as Giving Children an Even Break and Breaking the Cycle.  They were retained in a number of schools in addition to the normal posts and other supports that are allocated to all DEIS schools.  The retention of these older posts in some but not all DEIS schools created a degree of inequity in the system and that is one of the reasons they were considered for withdrawal.</p>
            <p eId="para_754">The Budget announcements followed on the Comprehensive Expenditure Review (CER) process.  The objectives of the CER were to provide the Government with a comprehensive set of decision options.  The approach taken by my Department in the CER process endeavoured to spread the adjustment burden equitably across different parts of the education system.  This would ensure that education and training priorities continued to be the focus of policy and allocations.  DEIS schools in disadvantaged areas would continue to be provided with targeted supports including preferential Pupil Teacher Ratios (PTRs) over and above mainstream schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_755">Ultimately, given the state of the country's finances, difficult and unpalatable decisions have to be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">I requested a report because conflicting and in some cases exaggerated numbers of posts were being reported as potentially lost to schools and it was necessary to obtain clarity with regard to the net effect of a range of factors on teacher allocations in these schools; for example, increasing and decreasing enrolments, the reforms to the existing teacher allocations process and up to date enrolments, all of which contribute to determining the staffing requirement for these schools for 2012/13 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_757">On foot of an analysis of the Report, the Government agreed to retain a total of 235 posts, on a concessionary basis, in DEIS Band 1 and DEIS Band 2 schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_758">My Department's Social Inclusion Unit will now be writing to the schools concerned and all DEIS Band 1 schools separately in relation to their staffing allocations for 2012/13 school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_847">Under Circular 70/2011 teachers who had been engaged in a public sector teaching post on or before 4 December 2011 are eligible to retain the qualification allowances they were entitled to be in receipt of on that date. Such teachers will not be paid any additional allowance where they acquire any further qualification on or after 5 December 2011.

            <p eId="para_848">Teachers who were appointed to teaching for the first time on or after 5 December 2011 but before 1 February 2012 are eligible for allowances on the basis of their qualifications at entry to the profession up to a maximum of the allowance applicable to an honours primary degree level.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">Circular 3/2012 provides that allowances are not payable to new beneficiaries; i.e. those who become eligible for receipt of the allowance in question on or after 1 February 2012. Examples of such allowances include any form of qualification allowance or the supervision and substitution payment paid to teachers, and the secretary to the Board of Management allowance paid to school principals.

Due to conflicting and, in some cases, exaggerated numbers of posts being reported as potentially lost to schools it was necessary to obtain clarity with regard to the net effect of a range of factors on teacher allocations in these schools; for example, increasing and decreasing enrolments, the reforms to the existing teacher allocations process and up to date enrolments, all of which contribute to determining the staffing requirement for these schools for 2012/13 school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_868">I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 57 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">There is no increase in the staffing schedule general average of 28:1 for the allocation of classroom teachers at primary level. However, there is a phased increase in the pupil threshold for the allocation of classroom teachers in small primary schools. As part of the Budget decisions announced, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014. The schools concerned are those with four or less classroom teachers. All schools are being treated equally irrespective of the type of patronage.  The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible. If amalgamations take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">This Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable for these difficult and challenging times.  I have already made clear to the House on a number of occasions that school communities should have no reason to feel that there will be a forced closure of their local school. No school closes because it loses a teacher. Schools close because of a loss of pupils. Small primary schools that have had to close in recent years are those that are no longer viable due to falling enrolments. The enrolment in such schools had typically fallen below a total of 8 pupils for two consecutive school years.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">My Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget measure.  They won't lose their classroom post if any of them are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.  The detailed arrangements are set out in the Department's Staffing Circular that is now published on my Department's website.  In relation to primary school transport, Budget 2012 changes were confined to primary school transport charges. Other changes to the primary scheme commencing this September were announced in Budget 2011 and derive from recommendations in the School Transport Value for Money review. Given the requirement to obtain savings under the four year national recovery plan there is no scope to review these changes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1975">I understand that the Deputy is referring to the <i>Times</i> Higher Education World Rankings published last October. International ranking systems and league tables of this nature need to be interpreted with caution as criteria between one set of rankings and another can have material differences on outcomes on different league tables. Furthermore, their focus on individual institutional performance does not reflect overall system quality.  We can continue to draw some encouragement from the fact that two Irish institutions are in the top 200 <i>Times</i> HE ranked institutions out of some 15,000 universities worldwide. Moreover, the overall performance of the Irish system remains highly ranked; 17th place overall and 6th relative to our GDP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1976">In terms of funding resources, the reality of the economic situation presents challenges right across the public sector, including higher education. Delivering high quality higher education for a growing proportion of our population will mean that we need to maintain a clear focus on system performance overall rather than a narrower focus on individual institutional performance.  In this regard, the National Strategy for Higher Education and recent proposals issued by the Higher Education Authority make a range of recommendations which seek to enhance the quality and efficiency of the Irish system.  In addition, the HEA are examining the future financial sustainability of the system, especially in light of projected growth in numbers over the next two decades. An initial report on the first phase of the study has been published.  The work, when complete, will inform decisions on policy options for future funding.</p>

            <p eId="para_1986">The Modern Languages in Primary Schools Initiative has been a pilot scheme involving approximately 550 schools that has operated since 1998.  The decision to end the scheme took account of a 2008 Report by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). The report identified serious issues with curricular overload at primary level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1987">The NCCA's advice recommended for the present modern languages should not be part of the Primary School Curriculum as an additional and separate subject. The advice in relation to curriculum overload predated the wake up call on literacy and numeracy triggered by the PISA results. I am taking that advice on board and with particular regard to the demands on time in school that will result from a heightened focus on literacy and numeracy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1988">The primary curriculum is currently being reviewed by the NCCA in the context of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy. The €2.5million in savings from this measure will go towards the cost of implementing the new National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy. The 17% of primary schools at present in the Initiative, who have had even more time demands than others in a crowded curricular space, should as a result be better placed to deliver under the strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1989">Given the priority of literacy and numeracy I have acted on the 2008 advice about overload and could not justify either the continuation of the initiative in the existing schools or its expansion to all schools even if funding was not an issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1997">The current economic climate requires difficult decisions to be made across all areas of public expenditure. However, given its centrality to future economic growth, the Government has sought to protect, in as far as possible, investment in research and development.  This year my Department is providing some €38 million to support research activities across a range of programmes, including schemes managed by the Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences (IRCHSS) and the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology (IRCSET). These schemes specifically focus on providing funding support to postgraduate students and early-career post doctoral fellows. It is anticipated that the Councils will make over 300 new postgraduate awards this year, which is an increase on the previous year.  These awards include funding for tuition fees and an annual stipend of €16,000. Funding is also available from other research funding agencies, including Science Foundation Ireland.  Additionally, places are being made available free-of-charge on postgraduate courses across the country to unemployed people under my Department's Springboard initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1998">It is also worth noting that the number of postgraduate students has increased from 18,807 in 2007/08 to 21,880 in the 2010/11 academic year.  In the context of measures announced in Budget 2012, new students entering postgraduate courses from the 2012/13 academic year onwards will not be entitled to any maintenance payment under the Student Grant Scheme. However, students who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant will be eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit under the Student Grant Scheme. The requirement to pay a fee is considered to be a greater obstacle to entry than lack of maintenance support at postgraduate level and this is why I opted to maintain the fee-payment ahead of maintenance payments for postgraduate students.  Additionally, a limited number of students who would previously have qualified under the standard grant thresholds will qualify to have a €2,000 contribution made towards the costs of their fees. The income threshold for this level of grant is currently being determined in the context of the formulation of the student grant scheme for the 2012/13 academic year. Tax relief is also available on postgraduate tuition fees. I believe this approach will continue to provide resources for a relatively wide number of post-graduate students.</p>

            <p eId="para_2003">The NCSE has now advised all mainstream schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, of their SNA allocation for the current school year, taking into account the care needs of qualifying pupils attending the school.

Should a school seek to have their SNA provision reviewed or make a new application, they should contact the NCSE in this regard. It is expected that schools, before requesting any review of their SNA provision, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect.</p>

            <p eId="para_2007">I published the National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy among Children and Young People 2011 to 2020 in July 2011.  The Strategy contains 41 actions and almost 180 sub-actions across 6 key areas.   A high level implementation advisory group has been established to monitor strategy implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2008">There has been significant progress in implementing the early actions of the Strategy and preparatory work is ongoing on medium and longer term actions.   Some of the key developments to date are set out as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2009">A team of 19 literacy and numeracy advisors have been appointed to support teachers and schools in implementing the Strategy and a national programme of professional development for primary and second level teachers is underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_2010">Over 1,250 primary teachers completed summer courses in mathematics in 2011. Programmes in literacy (including Irish) and mathematics accounted for almost half of all attendance at summer courses in 2011. There will be further development in this area in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2011">Initial proposals on revised entry standards for initial teacher education have been incorporated into the Teaching Council's Initial Teacher Education: Criteria and Guidelines for Programme Providers in relation to mathematics. The criteria also provide for an expansion of the primary Bachelor of Education from 3 to 4 years, and for an expansion of the Professional Diploma in Education to 2 years.</p>

            <p eId="para_2022">A key part of the Government's overall budgetary strategy is a requirement to reduce the public sector payroll. This will continue to be the case until we close the gap between what we spend as a country and what we take in through taxes. Given that one third of all public sector employees work in the Education sector it is simply not possible to completely exempt staffing levels in education from the Government's need to reduce expenditure. The Government has prioritised, as best as possible, the filling of front-line posts in the Education sector within the constraints of the Employment Control Framework. For example, schools are permitted to fill teaching vacancies that arise within their approved staffing allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2023">At a time of great strain in our public finances, we have to ensure that the very valuable but limited resources available for the education system are used in the best way possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_2043">The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were agreed by world leaders at the United Nations in 2000 as the framework for international development policy up to 2015.  They provide a clearly measurable way to track progress in the fight against global poverty.  The Goals are central to Ireland's overseas development programme, and to the Government's development policy.  On a global level, progress towards meeting the MDGs is tracked by the United Nations, which reports annually on progress by developing countries in meeting each of the eight Goals, as well as on ODA flows from donor to developing countries, including from Ireland.  I am firmly committed to keeping the Oireachtas, as well as the general public, fully informed of the important contribution that Ireland's ODA programme makes to the achievement of the MDGs.  Both the Tánaiste and my predecessor as Minister of State for Trade and Development, Jan O'Sullivan T.D. have met the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Joint Committee on European Affairs over the past year and have briefed them in detail on the work of Irish Aid.  I look forward to meeting and engaging with the Committees in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2044">The Irish Aid annual reports, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas library and on the Irish Aid website, provide a detailed overview of the Government's contribution to the achievement of the MDGs, and on the results being achieved by the aid programme.  In addition, in preparation for the MDG Review Summit in New York in September 2010, Irish Aid published a series of Fact Sheets which outlined Ireland's work in support of each of the eight MDGs and the challenges remaining to achieve each Goal by 2015.  I would hope that we will be in a position to produce a similar set of Fact Sheets in advance of the next MDG Review Summit, which is scheduled to take place in September 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_2045">The ongoing Review of the 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid provides a major opportunity to assess in detail how our ODA programme is contributing to eradicating poverty, hunger and exclusion, as well as to consider how effectively we are communicating the results of our work to the wider public.  We are consulting widely in the review process, with the public, the Oireachtas, civil society and our partner countries.  I would very much welcome the Deputy's engagement with and input into the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_2047">Ireland has a strong and internationally recognised development cooperation programme. This year we are delivering €639 million in Official Development Assistance (ODA) to improve lives in some of the world's poorest communities. This commitment to international development cooperation is central to our foreign policy and strongly reflects the values of the Irish people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2048">The Government recognises, however, that aid is only one part of the solution to underdevelopment.  There is now a renewed effort to ensure that aid provided is complemented by domestic and international policy agreements that can strengthen national revenue collection, utilise natural resources in a fair and just way, and increase trade and private sector investment in developing countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2049">This is an important issue for the Review of the 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid, which I am currently leading.  This Review is examining the changing context in which our aid programme is being implemented, and recognises that Ireland has an important role to play in the fight against hunger and extreme poverty — not just through the aid funding that we provide, but through a broader, comprehensive and holistic approach to development cooperation.  This includes actively engaging across Government Departments, the European Union and other inter-governmental bodies that Ireland belongs to, and ensuring policy approaches adopted are supportive of the interests of developing countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2050">A good example of this is the African Strategy which was recently launched by my Department. This Strategy aims to provide a framework for a coherent approach to Ireland's political, development, and business relations with African countries.  It articulates the priorities of Ireland in Africa and explores how these can better fit together and reinforce each other.  Whilst Ireland will continue to provide development aid to Africa to fight poverty and hunger, there is also a long-term aim to end dependency on aid and to build a new relationship with Africa based on politics, democracy and trade.  This is of benefit to our African partners. Closer economic ties and increased trade is also of benefit to Ireland.  Through the extensive consultations that are taking place for the Review of Irish Aid, I look forward to discussing these issues both here at home and in the countries where we work.  I also look forward to engaging with members of the Oireachtas in the coming weeks, and in particular, to discuss the Review of the White Paper on Irish Aid with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>

            <p eId="para_2054">The most important development in the law in recent years was the enactment of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2010, which strengthens the existing legislation relating to the prevention of corruption.

It is his intention to publish the heads of the Bill and to refer them to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality prior to the drafting of the Bill.

            <p eId="para_2058">The new Bill will make corruption legislation more accessible by replacing seven overlapping statutes with one.  It also affords an opportunity to review the legislation in this area, and to improve it in light of our experience as members of the international anti-corruption groups.</p>

            <p eId="para_2060">As the Deputy will be aware, I had been very concerned that Mr. Adnan's hunger strike was reaching the point where his health was likely to be seriously endangered. I have answered a number of Parliamentary Questions in the last two weeks in relation to our concerns about this case, and the principle of administrative detention.  An Irish diplomatic officer was present at the Israeli Supreme Court to attend Mr. Adnan's appeal on Tuesday, and was able to report instead that an understanding had been reached which led Mr. Adnan to immediately end his hunger strike at that point.  Under the agreement, time spent earlier in custody will be allowed against the current detention order, which will therefore expire on 17 April, a month earlier than originally ordered.  At that point, unless further evidence against Mr. Adnan has been found, the state has undertaken not to seek a renewal of the detention order.</p>

The <i>Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009</i>  came into force on 1 January 2010.  Only one officer of my Department aged under 50 years, a part-time Clerical Officer who was serving in the Corporate Services Division, has retired since 1 January 2010 and no further such retirements are anticipated before the end of February 2012.  Overall, by the end of February, Departmental permanent staff numbers will have reduced by approximately 180, or almost 12%, since the imposition of the moratorium on recruitment in March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2064">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade performs and provides a very diverse range of people-dependent functions and services: economic promotion; frontline citizen services (passport and consular); policy advice, programme management and representation and protection of the interests of the State and Irish citizens resident abroad through a network of mostly thinly populated offices across the globe.  Following a root and branch reappraisal of its operations, the Department is in the process of implementing the most far-reaching reorganisation of its Headquarters structures in more than a generation.  A number of our Missions have also been down-sized and, following a fundamental review of the network last year, a total of three offices are being closed this year.  Consideration is also being given to e-Government initiatives aimed at further enhancing staffing efficiencies in the Passport Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2065">These and other measures will build on the extensive reforms already implemented by the Department over the past three years in an effort to try to ensure that the Department remains in a position to fulfil the many and varied responsibilities conferred on it by the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_2072">I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 75 and 81 to 84, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2073">The questions raised by the Deputy in relation to the Campus Stadium Ireland Development, the National Aquatic Centre and Dublin Waterworld Ltd. are a matter for the Minister for Transport Tourism and Sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_2074">With regard to the application of VAT, the Minister for Finance and the Government decide tax policy and the Oireachtas enacts tax policy via the Finance Act process.  Administration of enacted tax legislation is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and I do not have a role in tax administration since this would undermine the independence of the Revenue Commissioners.  The matters referred to by the Deputy are ones of tax administration that are exclusively in the remit of Revenue.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that VAT is a self-assessment tax.  Persons registered for VAT, who are on the invoice basis of accounting, must issue an invoice in respect of taxable transactions and must remit to Revenue the VAT due on the foot of such invoices within 19 days from the end of the taxable period in which the invoice was issued.  The taxable person is required to remit the VAT even if he has not received payment in respect of the invoice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2075">Litigation in relation to the pursuit of commercial debts, which may include VAT, is a matter for the person who is owed the money and Revenue does not advise litigants in relation to legal proceedings.  I am informed that Revenue did not provide advice in the relation to the litigation referred to by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">Finally, in relation to the Deputy's question about the Valuation Office, the Valuation Office is the independent State property valuation agency, headed by the Commissioner of Valuation.  The Office provides statutory valuations under the provisions of the Valuation Act 2001.  It also provides a valuation consultancy service to Government departments and public bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2077">However, I have been informed by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform that on foot of a request from Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited (CSID), the Valuation Office provided a valuation for VAT purposes on the National Aquatic Centre, dated 25th October 2002.  The valuation for VAT purposes required an estimate of the unencumbered rent and the open market price.  The Office did not have all the documents relating to the lease but it was supplied with a considerable amount of information including details of the encumbrances attaching to the lease and it sought and obtained further information it required.  The Office is satisfied that it had sufficient information to enable it to decide on the most appropriate methodology to use in preparing the estimates of value to be made under the VAT legislation.  The Office has indicated that it stands over its valuations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2095">I would not agree with the conclusion outlined above. Ireland's Programme of external support, which is a three year programme designed to return us to market based financing, is on track.  We are meeting our targets under the Programme and continuing to do so is the best means of ensuring that we emerge successfully from this programme. A substantial number of actions — over 90 — have already been completed. The Budgetary outturn for 2011 was well within the target set by the Troika.  The 5th and most recent EU/IMF review mission of Ireland was completed successfully and I look forward to the successful completion of the overall review process.   The purpose of the EU/IMF Programme for Ireland is to provide the space necessary for economic and fiscal adjustment to take place. Based on current projections and assuming no market access, the State has access to sufficient funds for its needs well into the second half of 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_2096">As the Deputy is aware I have indicated that I am committed to reviewing the approach to the Promissory notes with a view to reducing the overall cost to the State of correcting the banking system. The Troika have agreed to engage in a process with Irish Officials to produce a common paper which will consider options for re-engineering the notes in terms of the maturity of the notes, the interest rate, the cash flows, etc. Work is on-going on this review. Additional detail on such proposals will be available when the on-going work is further advanced. However, given the nature of advocacy and the decision making process in the EU I would not expect this matter to be concluded in the short term.</p>
            <p eId="para_2097">Market sentiment toward Ireland has also improved. Irish bond yields have improved considerably. In recent days, the 10-year bond yield has gone below 7% which is a considerable reduction from the 14.1% peak in July 2011.  The National Treasury Management Agency has re-engaged with the bond market and extended some €3.5 billion of debt maturing just after the programme ends. This is a significant first step in terms of managing Ireland's post programme funding requirements. The bond switch helps smooth the maturity profile of Irish debt, lessens the refinancing requirement in the immediate aftermath of the conclusion of the EU/IMF Programme and is a reflection of the improved market sentiment for Irish Government paper. These developments can be directly related to our strong programme implementation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2099">The Government is acutely aware of the increasing financial stress that some households are facing arising from difficulty in meeting their mortgage commitments.  The Government, therefore, has established a Steering Group to oversee and drive the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears across Government.  The Inter-Departmental Group concluded that those people who can meet their mortgage obligations should do so but that appropriate measures need to be developed to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing real difficulty in meeting their repayments.  Significant progress has already been achieved in implementing the Group's recommendations.  For example, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence has published a draft Personal Insolvency Bill to provide a framework for the resolution of unsustainable personal debt, including mortgage debt, in a non judicial framework.  In addition, the Central Bank, as regulator, has required all mortgage lenders to develop strategies and implementation plans to deal with their individual mortgage arrears situations.  The Central Bank is currently reviewing these strategies and examining the plans of lenders to offer appropriate longer term solutions, such as those recommended in the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group report and other options that banks may develop themselves, for their customers who may have unsustainable mortgages.  The Central Bank will continue to engage with lenders on the further development and implementation of these plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_2100">However, the banks in Ireland, including those in which the State has a significant shareholding, are independent commercial entities and decisions on the handling of their mortgages and other loans, including distressed loans, are, in the first instance, a matter for the Boards and management of individual institutions in the exercise of their commercial and fiduciary responsibilities.  However, to the extent that borrowers and lenders are not in a position to reach individual agreements on stressed or unsustainable debt situations, the personal insolvency reforms outlined above will now provide an effective statutory framework for the consideration and resolution of such matters in a manner that will take account of all relevant factors and the legitimate interests of both the borrower and lenders.  Of course, to the extent that losses are incurred arising from the provision for or write down of impaired loans, this will deplete the capital base of banks, including the extensive capital provided by the taxpayer to the covered banks, so there is also a requirement to prudently manage that capital and avoid inappropriate write off of loans in the overall interest of the taxpayer.</p>

On the first five tranches, NAMA paid consideration of €26.363 billion for loans that are secured by property and other collateral which had a current market value of €26.653 billion using the November 2009 valuation methodology that underpins the value of all assets transferred to NAMA.   Information on the final consideration paid for all tranches and on the current market value of associated collateral is expected to be available at the end of the first quarter of 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2103">Since November 2009, property prices have fallen. For 2010, NAMA recorded an impairment provision of €1,485 million against its loans and receivables portfolio. I am informed by NAMA that due to the decline in property values during 2011, it also will have to make an impairment provision for 2011. The size of that impairment provision is not yet calculated as it is a complex exercise which is carried out under International Financial Reporting Rules (IFRS).</p>

The principles underpinning the Regulations are equal treatment, non-discrimination, mutual recognition, proportionality and transparency.  The results of NAMA's tenders are detailed on its website, <i>www.nama.ie</i>.  Where the Regulations do not apply — either because the value of the procurement is below the EU Thresholds or falls outside of the Regulations — NAMA adopts a competitive process designed to obtain the best value for money that can be achieved in a manner that is both fair and transparent. </p>

            <p eId="para_2112">Annual public spending, that is voted and non-voted spending, is set out in summary and aggregate form in the Finance Accounts. Likewise the Accounts show the revenues of the State, which are made up of taxes and non-tax income. Under Section 4 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, the Finance Accounts are compiled annually by my Department, audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and laid before Dail Eireann before 30 September in the year following the year to which the accounts relate. The Act defines the Finance Accounts as an account showing the payments into and out of the Central Fund and such other, if any, accounts and statements as the Minister for Finance considers appropriate and specifies to the Comptroller and Auditor General. The format of the Accounts was revised substantially in the late 1980s and there have been minor changes in presentation in recent years. The Budgetary and Economic Statistics, published annually on my Department's website, contains data showing the percentage changes in public spending and revenue. They also show GDP and GNP on a per capita basis. I have no plans to include statements, or information, in the Finance Accounts expressing data in terms of population statistics, though it is open to users of the Accounts to apply such statistics in order to derive data on a <i>per capita</i> basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_2114">The decision on whether or not to grant individual mortgages must remain a commercial decision for individual lending institutions. It is important that each lending institution is allowed to assess properly and independently the individual risks that it is considering accepting. Mortgage lending must be undertaken on a sustainable and prudential basis by financial institutions and conform fully with regulatory requirements both in relation to the financial institution itself and also the safeguarding of the consumer's interests.  The Central Bank has in place a Consumer Protection Code. This Code applies to all financial institutions regulated by the Central Bank (regulated entities). If a regulated entity is selling a financial product, including a mortgage, to a person who is a "personal consumer" for the purposes of the Code, then the regulated entity may only sell a mortgage product that is suitable for the consumer based on the information that has been supplied by the consumer.  Provision 5.9 of the Code requires that prior to offering, recommending, arranging, or providing a credit product to a personal consumer, a lender must carry out an assessment of affordability to ascertain the consumer's likely ability to repay the debt, over the duration of the agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2115">In the case of all mortgage products provided to personal consumers, the results of a test on the personal consumer's ability to repay the instalments, over the duration of the mortgage agreement, on the basis of a 2% interest rate increase, at a minimum, above the interest rate offered to the personal consumer must be ascertained.  This test does not apply to mortgages where the interest rate is fixed for a period of five years or more.</p>
            <p eId="para_2116">In addition, provision 5.13 requires that a regulated entity must take account of the affordability assessment when deciding whether a personal consumer is likely to be able to repay the debt for that amount and duration in the manner required under the credit agreement.   A copy of the Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code is available on the Central Bank's website <i>www.centralbank.ie.</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_2117">If a consumer feels that he or she has been improperly treated in relation to the processing of the application for a mortgage, or that he or she has grounds for complaint for some other reason, then a complaint may be made directly to the financial institution concerned. If the consumer is not satisfied with the response received from the institution, there may be grounds to forward the complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO), who has statutory powers to investigate complaints against financial service providers. The FSO will only consider a case once the internal complaints procedure within the financial institution concerned has been followed.  The Deputy should note however that the FSO will not deal with commercial decisions taken by a financial institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2118">The Deputy may also wish to note that small and medium sized enterprises, sole traders and farmers can apply to the Credit Review Office for a review where credit is refused, withdrawn or offered on unreasonable conditions by AIB or Bank of Ireland. These banks have set up formal internal review processes, which must first examine an appeal by a customer. Ulster Bank has also set up an internal appeal process.</p>

            <p eId="para_2122">A more detailed breakdown of the actions referenced in the table is presented in the document set out below.</p>
            <p eId="para_2123">With regard to the commencement of specific interventions to which eligible persons were referred by the EGF Construction Contact Centre, Table 4.2 of the current report provides figures on the status of the 452 individuals who contacted the EGF Construction Contact Centre up to the 27th January 2012. This table indicates that, on the 27th January 2012, a total of 38 individuals had either enrolled, started, or completed training courses with EGF support during the period 19th December 2011 to 27th January 2012. It also shows that, on the 27th January 2012, a further 257 individuals were being supported by the EGF Construction Contact Centre to access specific interventions but had, on that date, not yet commenced these interventions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2124">During the period covered by the current report a total of 452 eligible redundant construction workers and apprentices contacted the EGF Construction Contact Centre and 210 of these individuals received a total of 239 specific actions as identified with reference to Table 3.1. The number of unique beneficiaries and unique interventions is set out above.</p>
            <p eId="para_2125">The Department is not in a position to provide interim status updates or reports at this time. However, the next scheduled monthly report, which will include a status update with regard, inter alia, to the commencement and completion of specific interventions by this cohort, will be provided to the Department for the period to March 2nd 2012 and will be made public. In relation to the costs allocated under specific EGF measures these are presented in the three EGF applications approved by the EU budgetary authorities. The costing breakdown of each specific programme measure as approved is contained in three separate sets of proposed and final Decisions by the European Commission and these documents are publicly available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2126">Actual expenditure on particular measures, which is dependant on the take-up of measures and so demand led, will be ascertained through the interim and final claims which are duly submitted by service providers to the EGF Managing Authority. To date no claims have been received by the Department.</p>

        <b>   Deputy Seán Crowe</b>
         asked the

           the position regarding the numbers of teaching personnel waiting to be cleared by the Garda vetting unit; the estimated time for when the backlog is due to be cleared; the additional resources, if any, that are being allocated to ensure the swift vetting of teachers; and if delays in the vetting process are preventing teaching posts being filled.

            <p eId="para_2177">The arrangements for vetting of teaching and non-teaching staff were introduced in September 2006.  In late 2010, my Department issued Circular 0063/2010 which updated and clarified the requirements for Garda vetting as part of recruitment procedures for all teaching and non-teaching positions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2178">Responsibility for complying with the vetting requirements rests with the school authority as employer of school staff.  However, as the Teaching Council is the registered organisation that liaises with the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) for the vetting of teachers, an indication of the level of vetting that has been carried out for teachers is that approximately 30,000 of circa 73,000 teachers who are registered with the Teaching Council have been vetted to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2179">My Department's circular requires that vetting be completed in advance of appointments being made. However, it also provides that in certain limited circumstances where this is not possible, the prospective employee may, subject to certain conditions, be appointed pending the subsequent satisfactory outcome of the vetting process. The current turnaround time for the GCVU to return a vetting outcome to the Teaching Council is typically less than one month.</p>
            <p eId="para_2180">Responsibility for the GCVU and the deployment of staff to this unit falls within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality. The Deputy will be aware that the Minister last year published the Scheme of the National Vetting Bureau Bill 2011. This legislation will place the vetting of persons working with children or vulnerable adults on a statutory basis and will also set out the statutory requirements for the vetting of persons employed in schools.  Officials within my Department will continue to liaise with the Department of Justice and Equality in relation to matters relevant to the education sector arising from this legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2187">It is a requirement of the Official Languages Act that documents setting out public policy proposals, annual reports, statements of strategy, and matters considered to be of major public importance, are communicated by Government Departments in both Irish and English. Given this Act, and the obligations under the Education Act to promote bilingualism, to promote Irish as a community language in Gaeltacht areas, and to provide support services through Irish to schools, it is the general policy of the Department to issue circulars to schools in both Irish and English. The exceptions are very large documents or publications, where the Irish version would be sent to Irish medium schools only but also publicised on the internet. Normally, both versions are issued together in the same envelope, so that extra costs are minimised. In addition, my Department's section managers plan the distribution of materials to coincide with other scheduled distributions to either primary or post primary schools in order to keep postage costs to a minimum. It is not possible to identify the costs of Irish publications separately.</p>

            <p eId="para_2193">The National Strategy for Higher Education recommended the development of an Irish National Student Survey (INNS) as a key tool in the wider performance and quality measurement of Irish higher education.  There has been significant progress in its development by a Steering Group comprising institutional research officers and academics from the universities, colleges and institutes of technology along with representatives from USI, HEA, IUA and IOTI. A draft questionnaire is currently under consideration by the higher education community. Following piloting which is scheduled to commence in the current academic year, it is intended to fully implement the INSS from the 2012/13 academic year onwards. The Strategy further recommends that all higher education institutions should put in place robust comprehensive and anonymous student feedback systems to inform institutional and programme management as well as structures to ensure that action is taken promptly in response to student concerns.  In the last number of years there has been substantial progress in higher education institutions in establishing feedback mechanisms.  This process will be assisted by the implementation since April 2011 of an agreed document under the Public Service Agreement in respect of academic staff in Institutes of Technology including the ability for institutes to use student feedback for purposes of quality assurance.</p>

In that regard, my Department has been in contact with primary schools in the Mallow area concerning their accommodation position.  These developments are expected to cater for the projected growth in the Mallow area at primary level over the coming years.</p>

At a time of reducing resources the Department of Education and Skills will still maintain this general level of provision in 2012. The 2012 education and training provision will be targeted towards more effective programmes that reflect industry and employer needs and client preferences.

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_2204">Last December I announced details of the education infrastructure plan for 2012. Details of this plan are available on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>. For the Deputy’s convenience I have provided copies of the announced lists of schools under construction (60 schools) or anticipated to be progressed to construction in 2012 (56 schools).</p>
            <p eId="para_2205">I have also committed to announcing details of the five year education infrastructure plan in the coming months. This will outline when the major projects needed to cater for demographic growth will be completed.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_2804">I propose to take Questions Nos. 100, 102 and 108 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2805">A key part of the Government's overall budgetary strategy is a requirement to reduce the public sector payroll. This will continue to be the case until we close the gap between what we spend as a country and what we take in through taxes. Given that one third of all public sector employees work in the Education sector it is simply not possible to completely exempt staffing levels in education from the Government's need to reduce expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2806">The Government has prioritised, as best as possible, the filling of front-line posts in the Education sector within the constraints of the Employment Control Framework. For example, schools are permitted to fill teaching vacancies that arise within their approved staffing allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2807">The phasing of the budget measure whereby the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014 can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible. However I want to emphasise that no small schools will be forcibly closed by my Department and, if amalgamations do take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2808">This Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities. They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape. However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable for these difficult and challenging times.</p>
            <p eId="para_2809">My Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget measure. They won't lose their classroom post if any of them are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term. The detailed arrangements are set out in the Department's Staffing Circular that is now published on my Department's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_2811">I wish to reiterate for the Deputy this Government's commitment to the provision of resources for children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2812">As I recently indicated to the Deputy in my response to his question of 19 January 2012,  there has been no reduction in the number of Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) which will be available for the next school year, with 10,575 posts remaining available for allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2813">Neither has there been any reduction in the overall number of resource teaching posts which will be available for allocation to mainstream schools for the next year, either through the General Allocation Model or which are available for individual allocation by the National Council for Special Education.</p>
            <p eId="para_2814">The fact that the number of special needs assistant and resource teaching posts are being maintained at current levels is a reflection of this Government's commitment to prioritising supports for children with special educational needs, at a time when there is a requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas. This commitment to protecting front-line services for children with special educational needs will ensure that the requirements of special needs pupils in mainstream education can continue to be provided for on an ongoing basis, despite overall budgetary pressures.</p>

            <p eId="para_2816">The information sought by the Deputy is not compiled in the format sought. Officials in the Pension Unit of my Department are currently fully occupied addressing the pension benefit entitlements for those who are retiring at this time. The number of teachers in Primary Secondary, Community and Comprehensive schools who have applied to retire in the period 1 January to 29 February 2012 is 1166. Information received from the Vocational Education Sector indicates that 220 teachers have applied to retire in that sector during that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2817">A circular was issued by my Department, in July, 2011 requesting School Boards of Management to inform all staff in their schools (who are members of an occupation pension scheme) who intend to retire on or before 29 February 2012 that they are required to give 3 calendar months' notice of their date of retirement. The circular also stated that a notification may not be withdrawn on or after the date indicated as the last day of service. It was pointed out in that circular that failure to give the required notice could result in a delay in payment of pension benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_2818">Accordingly, the actual number retiring will not be accurately known until after 29 February, 2012. When the work of processing pension benefits for those retiring has been addressed it is intended to commence work on compiling detailed statistical data on the number of teachers who retired and to publish this information on my Departments' website.</p>

         the number of places by way of training or social employment available through Solas in the current year; the extent to which this is likely to meet the requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2886">The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs advises the Government on the current and future skills needs of the economy. This advice, together with information for other relevant agencies, both local and national informs course planning and provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2887">In 2012, at a time of reducing resources my Department will fund over 450,000 education and training places across the range of provision in the higher education, further education and training sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2888">FÁS plans to deliver up to 75,000 training places in 2012 and will manage the new Education and Training Fund which will provide up to 6,500 places. FÁS plans to provide 50% of its training activities in the demand-led training category, 30% planned to meet client preferences and 20% planned to meet the needs of those who require further supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_2889">My Department and its agencies will prioritise places, including in the further education and training sector, specifically for those on the Live Register for 12 months or more, and improve data collection and impact evaluation to ensure delivery of this goal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2890">The establishment of SOLAS, the new Further Education and Training Authority, that will replace FÁS,  will ensure the provision of 21st century high-quality further education and training programmes.  It is crucial that these programmes will be responsive to the needs of learners and employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2891">My Department also has a number of upskilling and reskilling measures under the recently announced "Action Plans for Jobs" initiative. In addition, the "Pathways to Work" initiative will set out the strategy to reform labour market activation policy.  My Department will have a significant role in the implementation of that policy. I am also satisfied that this new activation policy will make a very positive contribution to the training, upskilling and re-skilling of those on the Live Register and thereby enhance their employment opportunities.</p>

        <b> Deputy Sean Fleming</b>
         asked the

         the location and grade of all public servants within his Department or related agencies who while not having reached the minimum retirement age to avail of cost-neutral early retirement will benefit from the provisions under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009; his plans to continue the service provided by each of the retiring staff; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2893">I assume the Deputy is referring to the situation whereby officials who retire on or before the 29th, February 2012 will have their pension entitlements calculated at the payscale in place on the 1st January 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2894">The tabular statement below gives details of the number of officials who are expected to retire from the Department by the 29th, February 2012 together with details of retirements from the bodies under the aegis of the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2895">Five officials will retire from the Department on ill health grounds and twelve will avail of cost neutral early retirement. The remainder are officials that are over sixty years of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_2896">In relation to bodies under the aegis of the Department all the retirements in relation to FÁS are cost neutral. Two officials will retire from the State Examinations Commission and one will retire from the National Council for Special Education on cost neutral grounds as will the official referred to at the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. The remaining staff listed in respect of the bodies will retire on age grounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_2897">Retirements at the administrative grade levels are rather evenly spread across the grade structure and the Department will try to ensure that all essential services will continue to be carried on. In addition to this the Department will endeavour to reach the Employment Control Framework (E.C.F.) figure assigned to it by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (PER) for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2898">
              <i>The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS).</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_2899">It has been agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (PER) that the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) can have a professional staffing cohort of 173 educational psychologists in 2012.  Further recruitment at NEPS will take place throughout 2012 in order to replace any psychologists that retire or resign up to a maximum of 173 whole time equivalents.</p>
            <p eId="para_2900">
              <i>Schools Inspectorate</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_2901">The Department entered into discussions with PER to highlight the staffing situation at the Schools Inspectorate Division as a result of the large number of inspectors opting to retire early. Agreement was reached that key positions that were essential in order to have an effective School Inspectorate could be filled.  Some of these were promotions to higher positions and in January 2012 the Department engaged the Public Appointments Service (PAS) to conduct recruitment competitions for primary and post primary inspectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2902">The service was reconfigured into an eight rather than a ten region structure.  Significant work practice changes have been introduced which has resulted in the organisation being able to maintain a significant level of intensive whole-school inspections despite falling staff numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2903">
              <i>FÁS</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_2904">Sanction has been obtained from PER to fill the post of Assistant Director General. The Department is in discussions with PER in relation to filling posts equivalent to Assistant Principal level. The posts at higher Executive officer and Executive officer will be suppressed and the duties associated with the positions will be reorganised.</p>

            <p eId="para_3045">The guidelines on public procurement which are issued by my Department to public bodies specifically address the use of turnover as a qualifying criterion for potential tenderers for public contracts.  Contracting authorities frequently use the ratio "tenderer's turnover : contract value" as a measure in deciding whether a business has the financial capacity and strength to perform a contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_3046">Clearly, each project will have different requirements depending on its particular features and the level of risk to the contracting authority arising from non-performance.  Therefore, it is not possible to devise exact provisions to be applied to every situation.  An appropriate turnover level would depend on the particular features of the project and other potential risks to the contracting authority arising from supplier not having the capacity to fulfil its contractual obligations.  My Department's guidelines discuss these matters and advise public bodies on deciding an appropriate approach, including the need to ensure that newly established firms, or firms with no previous experience of public contracts are not excluded from competing for public projects.  The key consideration is that the turnover level chosen by a public body is proportionate to and justified by the needs of the contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_3047">The guidance published by my Department includes Circular 10/10: Facilitating SME Participation in Public Procurement and accompanying guidance, which is available at: <i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i>; and <i>www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie</i>.; and GN 2.3.1.3 Minimum Standards on Suitability Criteria for Works Contractors, which is also available at: <i>www.constructionprocurement.gov.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_3054">The estimated public service pension cost for 2011 is €2.75 billion.  The reduction in public service numbers will lead to overall payroll savings rather than losses or further expenses.

            <p eId="para_3104">A total of 72 requests were received by my Department under the Freedom of Information Act in 2011.  Of that number, three requests attracted ‘search and retrieval' fees, in accordance with Section 47 of the FOI Act.  It should be noted that under the Freedom of Information Act, decision makers are obliged, except in a few limited circumstances, to charge search and retrieval fees where significant search and retrieval of records is involved.  In relation to the three requests, the maximum individual fee sought was €83.80.  There were no instances in 2011 that a request did not proceed on the basis of a request for a search and retrieval fee.</p>

            <p eId="para_3106">I am aware that the Competition Authority, as the statutory independent body responsible for enforcing competition law in the State, has received information relating to alleged anti-competitive behaviour in the concrete industry.  Section 29(3) of the Competition Act 2002 provides that the Authority is independent in the performance of its functions.  Under section 30(1)(<i>b</i>) of that Act, the Competition Authority is responsible for investigating breaches of the Act.  It is the Authority’s policy not to comment on investigations.  As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the Authority, I have no direct function in the matter.  In light of this, I do not believe that it is appropriate to comment further.</p>

            <p eId="para_3155">Rent supplement provides short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Since 2005, rent supplement expenditure has increased from €369 million to a provisional outturn of €503 million in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_3156">As the Department currently funds approximately 40% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in a way that could increase rent prices for others, such as  low paid workers and students.  New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012.  These new limits are in line with the most up to date market data available.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3157">All new rent supplement applications are subject to these limits. As existing claims come up for review, or when an existing lease expires, they will be reassessed using the new limits.  The person concerned has been advised that she should renegotiate her rent with her landlord at the end of her current lease, which is due to expire on 6 March.  Where a landlord does not agree to reduce the rent to the new rates departmental officials will discuss the options open to the tenant, up to and including seeking alternative accommodation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3159">My Department participated in the Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (referred to as the Keane group) and is currently a member of the Steering Group set up by the Minister for Finance to oversee and drive its overall recommendations.  My Department provides a number of supports for those in mortgage difficulty, particularly through the Mortgage Interest Supplement scheme which aims to provide short term support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments.  In 2011 some 19,000 people benefitted from this scheme at a cost to the Exchequer of almost €68 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_3160">The Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group recommended that an independent Mortgage Support and Advice Service be established to advise mortgage holders in arrears or pre arrears in assessing their options.  The report stated that the need for this service would be time limited to approximately 3 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3161">The publication of the heads of the Personal Insolvency Bill in January 2012, proposes the introduction of a four step process to address personal insolvency issues with the first three steps involving non-judicial debt settlement arrangements.  This is a new arrangement and was not envisaged when the thinking in support of a Mortgage Advisory Service was originally proposed.  Therefore, my Department is examining the role envisaged for the Personal Insolvency Trustee to ensure that there is no conflict with or duplication of Government supported services.  From the customers perspective for example, the target group and complexity of the problems that need to be addressed appear to be similar and from the advisory perspective, the skills and expertise required would also appear to be similar for both services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3162">My Department is chairing a Working Group as part of the Implementation Steering Group to examine the issues relating to the establishment of the Mortgage Advice Service, and as part of its remit it is examining the efficiency, necessity and governance arrangements of potentially two separate services.  The needs of the customer, the importance of ease of access and information on services and the way in which the services will be made available must be to the fore.  My Department will be consulting with all relevant groups as part of its work in this area.</p>

These papers were received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 19th December 2011 and the appeal was assigned to an Appeals Officer on 14th February 2012 who will decide whether the case can be decided on a summary basis or whether to list it for oral hearing.</p>

A letter of offer for the purchase of the land has issued from my Department. However, no contracts for sale have been signed. I am advised that processing of applications on hand under this scheme has been slower than anticipated, due to capacity constraints in undertaking the work involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_3288">In 2011, the Government announced a compensation scheme for those affected by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation. This Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme consists of a payment of €1,000 per year, index linked, over 15 years or, where feasible, relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs, where they can continue to cut turf. Those wishing to relocate can avail of the financial payment or the delivery of cut turf while relocation sites are identified and prepared. The cost of acquiring and preparing relocation sites will be met by the State.  Where applicants under the Voluntary Bog Purchase Scheme have not received a letter of offer, or have received a letter of offer but contracts have not been signed, my Department will write to them to outline their options under the Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3399">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge by 31 March 2012, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.</p>
            <p eId="para_3400">There are a number of exemptions and waivers from payment of the household charge under the legislation.  In particular, section 4(2) of the Act provides an exemption from liability to pay the household charge for the year in which that liability date falls if, on that date, the owner of a residential property, which was that person's main or sole residence, is not residing in that property by reason of his or her having had to vacate the property due to long term mental or physical infirmity and that person is residing in another property that he/she does not own.</p>
            <p eId="para_3401">Section 4(6) of the Act defines the meaning of "long term mental or physical infirmity" as that which required the person to vacate the property in which he/she had been dwelling for a continuous period of more than 12 months and provides that such an infirmity must be certified by a registered medical practitioner.   I have no proposals to amend this definition.</p>

            <p eId="para_3403">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides that income from the household charge is to be paid into the Local Government Fund.  The proceeds from the household charge will be re-distributed on an equalised basis to local authorities within the context of the annual allocations of General Purpose Grants, ensuring that those local authorities with lower populations than others do not suffer unduly as a result.  In this way, the proceeds from the household charge will go towards the provision of essential local services, including public parks, libraries, open spaces and leisure amenities, planning and development, fire and emergency services, maintenance and cleaning of streets and street lighting.</p>
            <p eId="para_3404">The Government has indicated its intention to commence the installation of water meters in households connected to public water supplies later in 2012.  There are no plans to install meters in households that supply their own water.</p>
            <p eId="para_3405">The registration fee for septic tanks and other domestic waste water treatment systems will be a once-off charge. Registration will be valid for 5 years and there will be no charge for re-registration.  The national inspection plan, to be drawn up by the EPA, will form the basis for a risk-based inspection system which is to be implemented by the local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3406">The basic standards to be met by all domestic waste water systems are set out in the new legislation and require systems, irrespective of age, not to cause a risk to public health or the environment.  I will shortly be undertaking a public consultation process on draft guidance for the proper operation and maintenance of domestic waste water systems. A public information campaign regarding the new registration system will also take place.</p>
            <p eId="para_3407">I have stated on a number of occasions that I will keep under review the need to provide financial support to households whose systems are deemed, following inspection, to require substantial remediation.  The need for any such support will be only become clearer when inspections are being carried out.</p>

            <p eId="para_3412">The European Citizens' Initiative, which comes into operation in the European Union on 1 April 2012, will enable all citizens of the Union to participate equally in the promotion of citizens' initiatives for consideration by the European Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_3413">For an initiative to be considered by the Commission, it must get the support of at least one million eligible signatories, with a minimum number of signatories in at least seven of the States involved, corresponding to the number of members of the European Parliament elected in those Member States, multiplied by a factor of 750. Thus, in the case of Ireland's participation in this capacity, the minimum number of statements of support required would be 9,000.  Regulation (EU) No 211/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 on the citizens' initiative sets out the requirements on Member States in relation to implementation of the initiative. Article 3(4) of the Regulation provides that in order to be eligible to support an initiative, signatories are required to be citizens of the European Union and of an age to be entitled to vote in elections to the European Parliament. Annex III to the Regulation sets out the form of the statement of support that intending signatories in respect of any initiative are required to complete if they wish to support an initiative. Article 8 and Annex III of the Regulation set out the requirements in relation to the subsequent verification and certification by Member States of these statements of support. These provisions require that signatories of statements of support who are resident in Ireland should be submitted to the Irish competent authority for certification and verification. This will be done on the basis of such persons being entered in the Irish Register of European Electors or having an entitlement to be so entered. Statements of support signed by European Union citizens resident in Northern Ireland cannot, therefore, be taken into account in determining the number of statements of support from European Union citizens resident in this jurisdiction.</p>

The Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of some €29 million in Limerick during the period of the Programme.

            <p eId="para_3418">The Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth.  A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Limerick County Council, in response to my Department's request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities.

            <p eId="para_3446">Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 applies to estates which have been granted planning permission and include the construction of two or more houses (which as defined in the Act includes apartments) and the provision of new roads, open spaces, car parks, sewers, watermains or drains.  In relation to estates which have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority in accordance with the permission, section 180 provides that the planning authority must if requested to do so by the developer or by the majority of the qualified electors who are owners of the houses involved, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act 1993 for declaring the road(s) to be public roads, for whose maintenance the local authority will then be responsible.</p>
            <p eId="para_3447">Section 11 of the Roads Act empowers a local authority to, by order, declare any road over which a public right of way exists to be a public road. Before making an order the local authority must be satisfied the road is of general public utility, consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge and consult with the public/consider any objections received. The consideration of the objections and the making of the order declaring the road to be a public road is a reserved function, so that the decision whether to take the road in charge is ultimately one for the discretion of the elected members.</p>
            <p eId="para_3448">In relation to estates which have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within the relevant period section 180 also provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the owners, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act. However, in this case the section provides that the provision in section 11 of the Roads Act requiring the authority to consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge shall be disregarded.</p>
            <p eId="para_3449">Section 180 also provides that where a planning authority, in complying with the section, makes an order under section 11 of the Roads Act, it must also take in charge any open spaces, car parks, sewers, watermains, or drains within the attendant grounds of the development.  Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a planning authority may take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the planning authority consider that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3453">I propose to take Questions Nos. 168, 170 and 171 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3454">In advancing loans for house purchase by lower income borrowers it is of critical importance that local authorities make such funding available on the basis of sound lending criteria. My Department and individual local authorities have a responsibility to ensure that the borrower can sustain the loan over the full term.  Of equal importance, in view of recent developments in the domestic property market, is the imperative for a local authority to ensure that prudence and pragmatism are applied to all aspects of the management of its housing loans book. In a time of limited resources, deploying those resources in a focused and effective manner ensures the management of its loans portfolio can be achieved as efficiently as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_3455">The current credit policy has been in effect since 2009. It was deemed appropriate at that time to update the elements associated with local authority lending and to have a homogenous regime in place that ensured best practice was followed across the sector. All applicants are now assessed according to the same criteria, and their applications subjected to the same independent scrutiny. It is desirable to make adequate lending provision available to local authority tenants who wish to avail of the tenant purchase schemes, while also adhering to prudent lending practices, and the current guidelines achieve equitable consideration of all applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_3456">While it is the case that the rate of refusal of applications has increased it is also clear that the loans issued since the introduction of the revised credit policy are more likely to be fully performing. I am happy that the current mortgage loan model is fair and adequately meets the needs of prospective borrowers and facilitates participation in housing acquisition initiatives such as the tenant purchase schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3457">These schemes include the 1995 tenant purchase scheme for existing local authority houses which offers discounts up to 30% plus €3,809 off the market value, depending on length of tenancy; the incremental purchase scheme for certain new local authority houses, and the recently-introduced scheme for the tenant purchase of apartments in designated local authority complexes offer discounts of 40% to 60% off the all-in cost or market value respectively, depending on income.  It is the intention to replace the 1995 tenant purchase scheme with a new scheme based on the incremental purchase model when the necessary amending legislation is in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_3496">The provision of Garda information technology resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that currently there are 421 Garda stations which are connected to the Garda Network.  These stations account for over 90% of Garda personnel and the Garda authorities have stated that the current arrangements meet their operational requirements.  I am also advised that the general Garda policy is to expand the number of stations attached to the Network.  This is a process which is being undertaken in the light of overall operational requirements and the availability of financial resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_3497">The Garda authorities have also reported that a 112 SMS Emergency service was introduced in January 2012.  This facility enables members of the public to text requesting the assistance of an emergency service and it is available to anyone who registers for the service.</p>

            <p eId="para_3510">The persons concerned, a husband and wife, entered the State on 27th July, 2004, the husband on student conditions and his wife as his dependant, and they were granted permission to remain in the State on those bases until 10th May, 2007.  They were subsequently granted extensions of their respective permissions to remain up to 13th January, 2010, and then again for a further four months up to 13th May, 2010, to enable a prospective employer to apply for a Work Permit on behalf of the husband. My Department's records indicate that his efforts to obtain a Work Permit at that time were unsuccessful.</p>
            <p eId="para_3511">The first named person concerned had no legal basis to remain in the State beyond 13th May, 2010, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), he was notified, by letter dated 16th June, 2011, of the proposal to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against them.</p>
            <p eId="para_3512">The position in the State of the first named person concerned now falls to be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made. Once a decision has been made, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the first named person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3513">In relation to the second named person, she was granted permission to remain in the State on the 13th January 2010 on Stamp 3 conditions until the 13th May 2010.  In the event that her spouse was issued with a work permit she was advised to contact the General Immigration Division in order to have her permission to remain extended.  She was also advised that should her spouse not be issued with a work permit she was required to leave the State and provide evidence to the Division by the 13th June 2010 that she had done so. I am informed by my officials in INIS that they will be in touch with her shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_3526">The visa applications referred to by the Deputy were received in the Visa Office, Abu Dhabi in or around the 15 January 2012.  They were refused on the 29 January 2012 for the following reasons:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3527">1.   The evidences of finances were deemed to be insufficient or incomplete;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3528">2.   There was insufficient documentation submitted in support of the application (applicants should refer to the link to "Documents Required" as displayed on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service —<i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>).  The visa officer noted that documentation provided had not been translated.  Letters of undertaking from the applicants, confirming that the conditions of the visas would be observed, if visas were to be granted, were not provided.  Furthermore, no marriage certificate for the married applicant was provided;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3529">3.   The visa officer noted inconsistencies in the information supplied, specifically the source of family income.  This reason is essentially linked to the first refusal reason;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3530">4.   The obligations of the applicants to return to their home country were not deemed to be sufficient;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3531">5.   It was the opinion of the visa officer that the applicants may not observe the conditions of the visa and may overstay following the proposed visits;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3532">6.   There was no clear link to reference shown.  A suggested way in which a link to a reference may be shown (in cases of family members) is by way of birth certificates for all of the parties concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3533">The Deputy may wish to note that the second visa application number provided by him was incorrect.  In case of future enquiries the correct reference number for the person concerned is 8282122.</p>
            <p eId="para_3534">As is the case with all refused visa applications, the refusal decision and the reasons for that decision were sent by way of letter to the applicant.  It is open to the person concerned to submit an appeal within two months of the date of refusal, in this case before the 29 March 2012.  Guidelines on the visa appeals process is available on <i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>.</p>

During the course of this inspection discrepancies were recorded in relation to a number of parcels.

If the total area found is not sufficient to support the number of entitlements held penalties will be applied per the Terms and Conditions of the scheme. In this case the number entitlements held by the person named is 32.98. As the difference between the area declared and the area found is greater than 20%, under EU Regulations, no payment will issue. The person named was informed of this decision on 11 of January 2012 and of her right to seek a review. She was also informed of her right to appeal the outcome of any such review to the Independent Agriculture Appeals Office. Such a review was requested on 30 of January 2012 and is currently being considered. A decision on the matter will issue to the person named as soon as it is available.</p>

            <p eId="para_3648">In late 2009, the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) received a complaint from a member of the public in relation to the retention of Newborn Screening Cards (NSCs).  The basis of the complaint (which was upheld by the Data Protection Commissioner) was that the NSCs should not be retained indefinitely without consent as this constituted a breach of the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003. During 2010, a number of meetings were convened with the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner and representatives of the HSE, the DoH and CUH and Temple Street Hospital. A policy was agreed in conjunction with the DPC to address both the legislative and ethical requirements of the National Newborn Screening Programme, which included disposal of archived NSC older than ten years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3649">Following receipt of representations concerning the proposed destruction of archived Newborn Screening Cards, I requested the HSE to conduct a review of this decision. The review examined both the legal and ethical basis for retention of NSCs and their potential use for secondary purposes, including research. The report and recommendations of the review group were submitted to my office in January 2012. Having carefully considered the issue, I have informed the HSE of my decision in relation to this matter earlier this week. Further, I have requested that the HSE inform those interested parties of that decision in the coming week.</p>

            <p eId="para_3675">In its report on alcohol, the National Substance Misuse Strategy Steering Group recommended — among other things — the introduction of a legislative basis for minimum pricing per gram of alcohol. As minimum pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels for alcohol products that must be legally observed by retailers, its primary function would be thus to discourage at risk levels of alcohol consumption. This recommendation is being actively considered as part of the development of an Action Plan in advance of proposals being drafted for Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_3709">The cost for the recent search and retrieval mission in Union Hall was in the region of €250,000. This cost covers helicopter flying hours, volunteer incident allowances and fuel costs and the attendance of an incident manager. The costs are estimated as not all relevant claims have been processed to date. It should be noted that about 30% of these costs would have been incurred as a matter of course as both helicopter and volunteer training would have taken place during the period involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_3710">In relation to the number of fishermen registered in Ireland,  some 2,300 Certificates of Competency have been issued to fishermen including Skippers/Second Hand and engineers at this time by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3711">I consider that it is prudent to await the outcome of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board (MCIB) investigation into the tragedy at Union Hall and I would not wish to prejudice that. However, I have asked officials from my Department to examine issues relating to the carriage of Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs) by fishermen and to report to me as soon as possible on the matter. Currently all Irish registered fishing vessels are required to be fitted with Emergency Indicating Position Beacons, EPIRBs.  All fishing vessels over 12m must carry an automatically activating float-free automatic EPIRB and vessels less than 12m LOA (length over all) only have to carry a manually activated EPIRB.</p>
