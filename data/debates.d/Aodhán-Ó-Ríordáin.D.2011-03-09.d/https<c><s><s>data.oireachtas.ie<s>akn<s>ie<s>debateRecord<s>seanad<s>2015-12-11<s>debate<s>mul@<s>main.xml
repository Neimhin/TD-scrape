          <p eId="para_1">I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan. Before we commence, I remind Senators that they may speak only once on a recommendation on Report Stage, except for the proposer of the recommendation who may reply to the discussion on it. Each recommendation on Report Stage must be seconded.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> Recommendations Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, in the names of Senators Sean D. Barrett and Feargal Quinn have been ruled out of order because they involve a potential charge on the Exchequer.</p>

          <p eId="para_3">I move recommendation No. 4:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">In page 26, between lines 1 and 2, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_5"><b>"19. </b>The Minister shall, within 1 month of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the operation of the Employment and Investment Incentive in particular in how it relates to companies more than seven years old.".</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T10:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_7">The rationale behind the changes referred to in the recommendation was explained on Committee Stage, and officials in the Department of Finance furnished further information to Senators Darragh O'Brien and Mark Daly, as requested. I reiterate that the employment and investment incentive, EII, is targeted at job creation and retention and is available to the majority of small and medium-sized trading companies. As it is a state aid scheme, we were required to make changes to the qualifying company criteria in order to comply with new European Commission guidelines that came into effect recently. Failure to do so could have resulted in the scheme being in breach of state aid rules. In such a scenario, the Commission could have requested the suspension of the scheme in its entirety and launched a full investigation into its compatibility with Internal Market rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> The revised guidelines from the Commission take account of the fact that SMEs may face difficulties in gaining access to finance, particularly in the early stages of their development. The Commission notes that business finance markets may fail to provide the necessary equity or debt finance to newly created and potentially high-growth SMEs, resulting in a persistent capital market failure which would negatively affect SME growth prospects. The Commission has made changes to the qualifying company criteria in recognition that newer SMEs find it more difficult to raise funding via traditional routes. Such companies typically create more employment than companies that have been operating for longer periods, which further justifies the targeting of the relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> It is unfortunate that some companies will no longer qualify for the incentive, the conditions for which are laid out in the regulation from the Commission. As I said, that information was provided for the Senators. The Government had to ensure compliance with these conditions in order to retain the EII as an approved state aid. In essence, we had to make a choice between risking the whole scheme being disqualified by the Commission on state aid grounds and introducing it with a narrow set of qualifying criteria and, consequently, a narrower base of application. We are following the latter course and, for that reason, I cannot accept the recommendation.</p>

          <from>Senator Paschal Mooney<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T10:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_10">I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. One welcomes any initiative that will encourage SMEs which are the backbone of the economy. I applaud the Minister because I know he is very focused on this issue. Senator Darragh O'Brien is absent, but I understand that because of the relatively new nature of this initiative and its implementation, the amendment attempted to address the efficiency and successful operation of the scheme and was worded in such a way that a report would be laid before the Houses within one month of the passing of the Bill. Perhaps the Minister has a view on that matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_11">I welcome the Minister. The concern I had about this was the reference to seven years. The Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, explained to the best of his ability why we were controlled in that area. It still causes upset and I would like to think the Minister would give this further consideration in the coming year.</p>

          <p eId="para_12">Senator Darragh O'Brien's amendment was one worth considering and, in the interest of debating the legislation properly, we welcomed it. At the end of the day, however, we had to design the scheme in accordance with the regulations now being applied by the European Commission and they narrow the intended scope of the scheme. We would wish it had been broader, but in my experience, it is better to introduce the scheme with the full support of the Commission and nuance it later. I can commit to the Senator that, if we are all alive and well and back in government, we will look at it again.</p>

        <speech by="#AodhanORiordan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_14">I am pleased to present the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015 on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who is unavoidably detained on other important business. </p>
          <p eId="para_15"> The Bill aims to tackle persistent offenders charged with multiple offences of burglary of homes. It will enhance the provisions for refusal of bail in appropriate cases and provide for consecutive sentencing for repeat offenders. Burglary is an invasive upsetting crime which is not simply about theft or property. When it occurs in the home it strikes at our peace of mind in the one place where we should feel most secure. Article 40.5 of the Constitution highlights the importance of the home, "The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law". The courts have long recognised that the burglary of a person's home is an egregious crime. In his judgment in the 2006 case of DPP <i>v</i>. Barnes, Mr. Justice Hardiman stated, "The offence of burglary committed in a dwellinghouse is in every instance an act of aggression, an attack on the personal rights of the citizen as well as a public crime and is a violation of him or her."</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> On account of her concern about a rise in the number of domestic burglaries, the Minister initiated a review of the response of the criminal justice system to the problem. The review examined legislation, the management of prolific offenders, policing and crime prevention. It involved the Garda Commissioner, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service. The Minister has been consistent in her view that serious and serial offenders must continue to be imprisoned in appropriate cases. Public safety is of paramount importance. However, it is equally clear that imprisonment is only part of the solution. Locking people up and forgetting about them is not an effective way to reduce reoffending or protect communities and reduce victimisation. The review highlighted the fact that a large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Senators will be aware that approximately 25% of offenders are responsible for 75% of property offences. There is also evidence of a high rate of recidivism for burglary. Data from the 2013 Irish Prison Service recidivism study shows a rate of over 79% among persons imprisoned for burglary and related offences. Data from the 2008 to 2013 Probation Service recidivism study shows a recidivism rate of 49% among persons engaging with the Probation Service for burglary and related offences. These are the highest rates for any offence group.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> Offenders pass through the hands of the Garda, the courts, the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service. The criminal justice system cannot be effective if it is disjointed. The Minister is keen to ensure it handles offenders in a co-ordinated way from beginning to end. Last week the Minister launched the joint agency response to crime initiative, JARC, an inter-agency response to the management and rehabilitation of offenders. It involves the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service and An Garda Síochána working in collaboration with statutory, community and voluntary partners. The JARC strategy aims to target those recidivist offenders responsible for the majority of crime. To reduce crime and enhance public safety, the nominated prolific offenders will be managed through the co-ordination and integration of policy, practice and research between the organisations. It makes sense that by targeting identified prolific offenders with such cross-cutting initiatives, which address their criminal behaviour and the harm it does, crime will be reduced and public safety increased. The people concerned require a specific programme in the community if they are to make better choices. In this context, targeting the relatively small group of repeat burglars has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence of burglary and the harm it causes throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">In addition to a more co-ordinated approach to offender management, the review I referred to identified two key problems which can be tackled by legislation. One relates to repeat offenders who are granted bail despite being charged with multiple burglaries and who often commit further burglaries while on bail. The other relates to the fact that relatively short sentences can be imposed by the courts when multiple burglary offences are taken into account. This Bill will address these problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> Of course, before one can prosecute or manage offenders, one has to respond to burglaries and investigate them. Tackling crime and burglaries remains a top priority for the Government and An Garda Síochána. Operation Thor, a new multi-strand, national, anti-crime and anti-burglary operation was recently launched by the Garda Commissioner. An extra allocation of more than €5 million has been committed by the Government to support Operation Thor, which entails a broad range of activities to tackle crime, particularly burglaries, in urban and rural communities nationwide. These include additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of high-powered vehicles by the armed regional response units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce reoffending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign; targeted crime prevention advice for local communities; and enhanced supports for victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> Since Operation Thor commenced last month, there has been a range of arrests and persons have been charged as part of planned operations. These include arrests in Dublin, Dundalk, Cavan, Dunboyne, Mullingar and Birr, as well as a large-scale search of 12 locations in the Limerick area as part of a targeted operation against organised crime groups in which drugs and firearms were also seized. The Minister expects to receive ongoing reports on the impact of the operation throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> Special targeted patrols have been implemented with the assistance of Garda national support services against criminal groups. These arrangements have also targeted the use of motorways by criminal gangs and have contributed to the arrest of a number of high-priority suspects. It is also important to note that the sustained Garda response under the previous Operation Fiacla has produced many successes in disrupting those involved in this type of criminal activity. As of 31 August 2015, Operation Fiacla had led to 14,381 arrests, with 8,181 persons charged.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> The everyday tasks of An Garda Síochána and the specialist operations all have to be resourced. The Government has prioritised investment in the Garda and all aspects of its work. More than €34 million has been invested in new Garda vehicles since 2012, with more than 640 new vehicles coming onstream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units. The Government's capital plan for 2016 to 2021 provides for a further €46 million of investment in vehicles, as well as the recently authorised allocation of €1.8 million for the replacement and upgrade of equipment on the Garda fixed-wing aircraft.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> The capital plan contains an additional €205 million for Garda ICT systems and technology. This will bring overall Garda ICT funding to €330 million over the lifetime of the capital plan. A few weeks ago, the Minister, together with the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, Deputy Simon Harris, announced details of the Garda building and refurbishment programme, which includes more than €60 million of Exchequer funding as part of the Government capital plan for 2016 to 2021, as well as a major public private partnership project.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> Last month the Minister commenced the DNA legislation that saw the launch of a new state-of-the-art DNA database system, based in Forensic Science Ireland in the Phoenix Park. The DNA database represents a significant development in assisting An Garda Síochána in the investigation of crime. This high-quality intelligence and investigation tool will be invaluable in the fight against a whole range of crimes, including burglary.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> The most important resources the Commissioner has at her disposal are the members of the force whom I commend for their brave, compassionate and dedicated service, none more so than Garda Tony Golden who went far beyond the call of duty and gave his life to protect a vulnerable victim of domestic violence. He, with the 87 other members of the force who have given their lives in the line of duty, did so out of a sense of service, a vocation to care for and protect their fellow citizens. There are no words of sorrow or gratitude equal to that service and sacrifice. We can, as legislators and a Government, show our support for the members of An Garda Síochána in a practical way by giving them the resources they need to do their work. I have spoken already of the investment in vehicles, equipment, buildings and technology being made by the Government. The Bill we are debating will be a valuable legislative tool for gardaí in their work to tackle burglary.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> We also need to address Garda numbers. The Garda College in Templemore was reopened to new recruits in September 2014. Six intakes of new Garda trainees have since entered the Garda College, giving a total intake of 550 recruits. Of these, 295 have already attested and are now working in communities nationwide. The Minister recently announced the opening of a recruitment campaign for new members of An Garda Síochána in 2016. This new campaign underscores the Government's commitment to seamless ongoing recruitment to An Garda Síochána to ensure the service is renewed and has the capacity to deliver an effective, responsive police service throughout the country to protect our communities and respond to emerging crime trends. This additional recruitment will bring to 1,150 the total number of Garda trainees recruited under the Government between September 2014 and 2016. The 2016 campaign will include a special stream for eligible members of the Garda Reserve who give their time on a voluntary basis to support the work of An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> Community-based organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association, Neighbourhood Watch and Muintir na Tíre are key partners of An Garda Síochána in the fight against rural crime. Part of Operation Thor is to raise awareness in the community as to how they can work together to prevent crime. The funding being provided to support community alert and Crimestoppers is being doubled, with a total allocation of €397,000 in 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> I will now outline the provisions of the Bill. Section 1 seeks to ensure prolific burglars can be refused bail in appropriate cases. It is necessary to recall that a decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail because in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proved guilty.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 which gave effect to the 16th amendment of the Constitution permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. Burglary offences are designated as serious offences for the purposes of the Bail Act. However, it is clear that prolific burglars with numerous previous convictions are repeatedly granted bail, despite Garda objections, even when charged with a series of burglaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Section 1 will add new provisions to section 2 of the Bail Act 1997. The new provisions will apply where a court is considering a bail application from an adult charged with a relevant offence alleged to have been committed in a dwelling. A relevant offence is defined as a burglary or aggravated burglary offence contrary to section 12 or 13 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, respectively. For the purposes of bail applications in such cases, the court must consider previous convictions for domestic burglary, coupled with pending charges or recent convictions as evidence that the accused person is likely to commit a further domestic burglary.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> Turning to the detail of the provisions, the new subsection (2A) applies where a court is deciding whether it is reasonably considered necessary to refuse bail to prevent the commission of a serious offence by a person who is charged with a burglary alleged to have been committed in a dwelling. In such a case, if there are certain circumstances, as set out in subsection (2B), the court must consider the existence of these circumstances as evidence that the person is likely to commit a further domestic burglary. These circumstances are that the person has a previous conviction for domestic burglary committed in the five years before the bail application and that the person has been convicted of at least two domestic burglaries committed in the period starting six months before and ending six months after the alleged commission of the offence for which he or she is seeking bail, the person has been charged with at least two domestic burglaries allegedly committed in the same period, or the person has been convicted of at least one domestic burglary committed, and charged with at least one other domestic burglary allegedly committed, in the same period. The provisions, while making it clear that prolific burglars should be refused bail in the circumstances set out in the Bill, will leave the courts all necessary discretion to vindicate the constitutional rights of an accused person in relation to bail.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> The new subsection (2C) provides that a reference in subsection (2B) to a conviction for a relevant offence includes a conviction that is under appeal. The new subsection (2D) provides that subsection (2B) will not prejudice the operation of section 258 of the Children Act 2001 which provides for the non-disclosure of certain findings of guilt relating to offences committed by persons under the age of 18 years. A new subsection (4) will be inserted into section 2 of the Bail Act to define "dwelling" and "relevant offence" for the purposes of the new provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> Section 2 seeks to deal with the related problem of concurrent sentences being handed down for multiple burglaries. In many cases, relatively short sentences are imposed when multiple burglary offences are taken into account by the court. Section 2 will insert a new section 54A into the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001. The new section will require a court which decides to impose custodial sentences for multiple domestic burglary offences committed within a 12 month window to impose such sentences consecutively. The new section applies only to a relevant offence, which means a burglary or aggravated burglary. The provisions will apply only to adults previously convicted of a domestic burglary committed in the five years before the burglary offence for they are being sentenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> Subsection (1) of the new section 54A will apply where an adult is being sentenced to imprisonment for a domestic burglary, was convicted of another domestic burglary committed in the five years before the offence for which he or she is being sentenced and was sentenced to imprisonment for another domestic burglary committed in the period starting six months before and ending six months after the burglary offence for which he or she is now being sentenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">In such a case, any sentence of imprisonment which the court chooses to impose for the burglary for which the person is being sentenced must be consecutive to any sentence of imprisonment imposed for the prior domestic burglary offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> Subsection (2) makes it clear that where a prior burglary offence would come within paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (1), that offence may be considered for the purpose of satisfying either paragraph (b) or (c) but not both. Subsection (3) provides that subsection (1) will apply only where the burglary offence for which the person is being sentenced was committed after the Bill comes into operation and will apply whether the other offences were committed before or after that date.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> Subsection (4) provides that the aggregate term of imprisonment for consecutive sentences imposed by the District Court under the new provisions can extend to but not exceed two years. No such restriction will apply to the Circuit Court. Subsection (5) provides that a reference in subsection (1) to a conviction for a relevant offence includes a conviction that is under appeal. Subsection (6) defines "dwelling" and "relevant offence" for the purposes of the new section. The discretion of a court whether to impose a custodial sentence will not be restricted by the new provisions. Section 3 is a standard provision providing for the Short Title and commencement of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> The Bill targets repeat burglary offenders through bail measures and provisions concerning the imposition of consecutive sentencing for repeat offending. It is one part of a broader co-ordinated strategy to tackle burglary and other crime through investment in Garda resources, increased recruitment, specialist operations such as Operation Thor, co-ordinated offender management through the joint agency response to crime, JARC, investment in community initiatives like text alert and investment in crime fighting technology, including the DNA database. The key objective of the legislation is to target a cohort of persistent offenders who prey on law abiding householders and clearly have no concern for the damage and distress which they inflict on others.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#LabhrasOMurchu" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_40">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. The review by the Department of the criminal justice system, as a result of the recent spate of burglaries, is very important, as is the legislation before us. I do not have to remind the House that people living in rural Ireland are absolutely terrified. This is evident from the fact that public meetings that have been held on this issue have drawn huge crowds. In some cases, those attending do not want to hear politicians talking. They are making their own case and that case is particularly strong.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> The Minister of State is correct in saying burglary is not simply about the theft of property. Anybody who has been burgled has also lost his or her peace of mind. If one looks at that terrible case in County Tipperary, one can hardly believe such a thing could happen. When the criminals involved were going to court, the sheer contempt they displayed to the cameras was an indication of the seriousness of the situation. </p>
          <p eId="para_42"> There has been a marked increase in the number of burglaries, with 28,830 recorded, representing an increase of 2,241. I hope the Minister of State is correct in his assertion that matters have improved in more recent times, but the statistics would indicate that the burglary rate is increasing rather than decreasing. One of the reasons for this is the flaws and weaknesses in the criminal justice system itself. More than 60% of people who have been convicted for burglary repeat the offence, which shows there is no deterrent within the criminal justice system. A full 25% of people on bail commit burglaries while at large. It is vital that the courts are given the power to deal with what is now an epidemic. </p>
          <p eId="para_43"> We must consider the introduction of mandatory sentences which send a clear message to burglars. As Mr. Justice Hardiman said, if someone breaks into one's home, that is an act of aggression. The issue is not the property but the aggression towards the citizens of the State and that should be met with the most severe penalties. There should be a mandatory sentence of three years for anyone who breaks into a person's home. We should go further than that and introduce a sentence of seven years for anyone who commits burglary on three occasions within a 12-month period. That would send a clear message to the burglars that if they go down that road, they will pay for it. Such a message is important in the context of the damage done to peace loving, innocent citizens by burglars. That damage must be reflected within the sentencing process.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> It is worthwhile, in the context of this debate, to turn to the Garda Inspectorate's most recent report. There are many issues highlighted in that report which the Department should seriously consider. There are 80 recommendations in all, but one of the most fundamental points is that between 1,500 and 2,000 gardaí who are engaged in office-based work could be released for front-line duties. The Garda Inspectorate recommends that at least 1,000 of these be so released and is confident that An Garda Síochána will still have sufficient numbers to handle the administrative processes within the force. The Government should take that recommendation on board. As I understand it, Garda numbers in Dublin alone have been reduced by 639 in recent times. </p>
          <p eId="para_45"> I mention Dublin because this debate on burglary is not just about rural Ireland; the same is happening in Dublin. The criminals are acting with impunity. I am sorry to say - this is no compliment - that they are working with professionalism. It is quite clear they have strategies but, above all else, they have inside information. I am certain that before criminal gangs, particularly the mobile ones, hit a town, they are provided with information by people in that town. If the gangs did not have such information, they would not be able to do what they are doing. That suggests there is a network and that network must be broken. </p>
          <p eId="para_46"> The closure of 139 Garda stations is relevant, too. I am convinced, despite technological advances and our changing society, that there is nothing like the presence of a garda in an area. I am not suggesting that gardaí should necessarily be on the beat, so to speak, as in the past. However, the mere fact that there is a garda in an area who could receive information quietly, privately or even secretly, if necessary, means that he or she can combat the work of the local informants and be prepared for the gangs when they arrive. We should consider reopening a number of the Garda stations that were closed in recent years, particularly in areas that have experienced the type of crime to which we refer today. People might say that is done and dusted, but I argue that things have changed and the situation has gotten out of hand. This must be a priority issue. Having listened to the contributions made at a recent public meeting in Thurles, it was quite clear that nothing will satisfy the citizens or put their minds at ease other than radical action in this regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_47"> The neighbourhood watch scheme has been operating quietly for many years and has been quite successful. While the neighbourhood watch sign might not be a major deterrent, the fact that the scheme is organised and focused means that information is being shared and suspicious movements are being reported. However, communities need someone to receive that information and act on it. Making a telephone call and hoping a Garda car will arrive is not sufficient any more. The presence of local gardaí on the ground is essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> Closed circuit television cameras on motorways are vitally important because mobile criminal gangs have to use the motorways to commit their crimes. Closed circuit television cameras at motorway exits would pick up the movements of certain cars and so forth. I accept that there has been an improvement in the use of technology. Members of An Garda Síochána are upfront in telling us where there are inadequacies.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">They are on the front line. I often wonder if we appreciate fully the work members of An Garda Síochána do. We have one of the finest police forces in the world and know gardaí at local level. When somebody steps out of line, as happens in every element of society, there is a hullabaloo, but the truth is that gardaí are willing, ready, committed and dedicated to do what is required. We must ensure they are assisted and that the criminal justice system takes cognisance of the current position. It is a sad, sorrowful day for the country that we have come to this. We owe it to citizens to protect them and give them peace of mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> We support the Bill, which is as it should be. There are no kudos politically in it for anybody, but there are responsibilities for all of us who are privileged to be legislators.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinConway" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Senator Martin Conway<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_51">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, who is a regular visitor to the House at this stage. I thank Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú for his support for the Bill which is long overdue. We have all heard about the beatings that have taken place around the country, particularly in County Tipperary where the Senator is based and where there has been a spate of crime. Criminal gangs are operating and take full advantage of the motorway network to target certain areas. I commend An Garda Síochána for its recent successes in investigating these crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> The Bill is necessary. Members of the public cannot understand the notion of sentences running concurrently. If somebody commits a burglary in County Tipperary which is successfully investigated by the Garda, the person concerned will be brought to court and a sentence imposed. If they have committed another burglary in Ennis, they will receive a sentence for that crime, too, and all of the sentences will run at the same time. For the ordinary person, this does not appear to be just. Consecutive sentencing for repeat offenders is important because it is important not only that justice be done but also be seen to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> I wish to speak briefly about restorative justice, community courts and the prevention of crime. The Government has demonstrated its commitment to try to deal with the causes of crime and what makes young people engage in it in the first instance and, when somebody is found to have engaged in crime, what can be done to ensure he or she will not repeat it. Everybody in society deserves a second chance. There was all-party agreement in the House on a motion I had tabled on the issue of restorative justice. There is a very successful restorative justice programme which is being operated on a pilot basis in south Dublin and north Tipperary, of which Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú will be aware. The figures for the programme are incredible. There has been a 66% reduction in the number of repeat offenders where offenders engage in a restorative justice programme. I call on the Minister to enter into discussions on extending the pilot programme and running a restorative justice programme on a national basis. This proposal is worthy of consideration and is supported by this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> There is also the issue of community courts. The Minister is engaged in developing a pilot project in inner city Dublin, similar to the one operating in New York but obviously in an Irish context. Community courts have been very successful. A community court is, effectively, a one-stop-shop. Usually I do not like that term, but it is a one-stop-shop in providing for addiction counselling and all the other supports needed to ensure offenders will not become repeat offenders. However, where there is repeat offending, it is important that the law take its course. The Bill is extremely welcome in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_55"> The Government has been very successful in re-equipping An Garda Síochána which, like all elements of society, has experienced a difficult period. A behavioural analysis study of An Garda Síochána was carried out in 2013, which I mentioned previously in the House. It found that only 63% or 64% of the population had confidence in it. The same exercise was carried out three or four months ago and the figures had improved dramatically, with 87% of the public surveyed expressing confidence in An Garda Síochána. That is due to the diligent work done by the new Garda Commissioner and her senior management team. Nóirín O'Sullivan is the first female Garda Commissioner and has set the bar very high. She has appeared before the justice committee on a couple of occasions and delivered a flawless performance, as has done since her appointment as Commissioner. This, coupled with the dedication of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and her two able Ministers of State, Deputies Aodhán Ó Ríordáin and Kathleen Lynch, have transformed the Department of Justice and Equality and we are now in a position where both we and An Garda Síochána can move forward with confidence. An extra 600 gardaí will be recruited in the coming months and the recruitment programme will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> I welcome the Bill which I hope will receive all-party support. The message must be conveyed from this House that if one continues to offend repeatedly, one will be punished and justice will prevail. I hope the Bill will be passed speedily by the House.</p>

        <speech by="#TrevorOClochartaigh" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_57">Sinn Féin will support the passing of this legislation on Second Stage. However, that does not take from the fact that under the Government the incidence of assaults, sexual offences, theft, fraud and burglaries has risen. While it is welcome that serial offenders are being targeted in the Bill, the structural causes that give rise to the problem of burglaries stem from the decisions made by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> Recent CSO statistics illustrate the following increases when one compares the figures for the year ending June 2014 with those for the year ending June 2015: the number of assaults increased by 10%, from 14,548 to 16,054; the number of burglaries increased by 8%, from 26,589 to 28,830; the number of ssexual offences increased by 3%, from 2,006 to 2,072; the level of theft increased by 2% to 78,885; and the number of fraud offences increased by 6% to 5,337. In the past year the number of burglaries has risen by 2,241. In Dublin alone the number has risen by 15%. These figures are startling, but the true number of crimes may be much higher. An audit of 2011 Garda statistics by the CSO in June 2015 located 75,000 crimes that had not been recorded by the Garda. They included 5,100 burglaries. According to recent reports in the <i>Irish Examiner,</i> the CSO still does not know if there have been improvements in the Garda system since the audit. </p>
          <p eId="para_59"> What can be said is that under the Government the incidence of certain criminal offences continues to rise, while Garda stations continue to be closed. In response to a parliamentary question from my colleague, Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, on the closure of Garda stations, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, confirmed that the Government had closed 139. This has resulted in a minuscule saving of €556,000 per annum. On average, only €4,000 per annum has been saved on utilities and maintenance costs per station. Such a small saving has had a disproportionately negative effect within rural communities and it is not only Sinn Féin that has identified this problem. According to the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, the decision made by the Government to close Garda stations has resulted in an increase in crime. We are witnessing the human impact of seven years of austerity. The association has further outlined that its office has been inundated with concerns about increased crime, particularly in rural areas. In addition, according to a Garda source reporting to <i>The Irish Times,</i> the closure of rural Garda stations exacerbates the sense of fear and corresponding uncertainty.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">When reliant on an ever-changing roster of personnel and mobile patrols, a loss of continuity is apparent. Without a continuous presence in the community, gardaí cannot provide an adequate community police service. The closure of rural Garda stations severs the tie with the community, with the added problem that crime is neither reported nor detected. Mr. Seamus Boland of Irish Rural Link points out that the only policy put in place by the Government is the closing of Garda stations. This means that rural areas are without adequate Garda cover. The absence of a highly visible local Garda station is advantageous only to those with criminal intent. Since the criminal fraternity knows which stations have closed, it presumably has a greater opportunity to evade gardaí. Closing Garda stations directly undermines the confidence the community has in policing and it directly affects the reliability and speed of response.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> According to Sinn Féin's reform agenda, key principles that must inform any positive change for An Garda Síochána include policing with the community to develop maximum confidence in the policing service and maximise co-operation between citizens and An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> The impact of rural crime and the absence of Garda stations are particularly apparent in neglected Border regions. The delivery of policing and justice is undermined by partition. Criminality and illegality do not recognise borders. Cross-Border co-operation makes sense for Border communities where common working arrangements and protocols can tackle criminal behaviour and promote community safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> It is the Government's austerity agenda that creates the environment in which the crime rate is increasing. A lack of resources is well known to increase the incidence of theft and burglary. Misguided decisions to close Garda stations to make small savings to the Exchequer merely increase the opportunity for criminal activity and add to the uncertainty and fear citizens in the State are already experiencing under seven years of austerity. As always, it is the poor, isolated and vulnerable who suffer most under the Government. The Bill, while welcome, does not address the root causes of the increase in criminal activity and the negative social consequences of austerity.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> The review being carried out on the rostering of gardaí which is having a negative impact on rural stations is part of a pilot project. Even the chief superintendent in Galway has spoken about rostering and the problems it is causing. Rural gardaí are being sucked into urban stations to cover when personnel fall ill, etc. The rostering does not seem to be working very well. I realise this is a result of the working time directive but it certainly needs to be reviewed because of the very serious impact on rural stations.</p>

        <speech by="#IvanaBacik" eId="spk_13">
          <from>Senator Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_65">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, with his hard-working officials. We have commented already on the large volume of justice legislation we have been dealing with recently. Today is a case in point because there are four justice Bills before us. We have had to deal with many complex and lengthy Bills but this one is very short and focused. As Senator Martin Conway said, it has received cross-party support. It has a very clear aim, namely, to tackle the very specific issue of recidivism where it relates to burglary offences. Others have spoken about the real fear so many people have in various communities around the country owing to the prevalence of burglary. Others have rightly spoken about the dreadful impact burglaries have on victims and their families and children, particularly in domestic dwellings. We were all horrified by the dreadful domestic burglary in County Tipperary. From reports from the meeting in Thurles that followed, it is clear there is genuine concern over burglary and the high number of burglaries in certain communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> An issue arises over the perception of burglary. Many burglary offences are dealt with in the District Court as minor offences, but burglaries about which there have been so many reports - burglaries in homes at night when occupants are present that appear to be carried out by gangs in an organised fashion as part of a series of burglaries - are clearly very serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> The Bill clearly deals with just two aspects of the legal process, namely, bail and consecutive sentencing. With regard to the offence of burglary in the original Act of 2001, we might examine these aspects again to determine whether some distinction could be drawn between the very different types of burglary. The one offence may cover a number of levels of seriousness. This may be a real issue. There is an aggravated burglary offence in the 2001 Act but, even with that, there is quite a range of types of burglary, ranging from what might be termed more minor ones to more serious ones. Burglary is never minor to the victim but circumstances can mean offences vary greatly in their nature. The distinction between serious and minor offences capable of being tried in the District Court is one that might be examined in a broader review of the substantive law of burglary.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> The Bill deals with the two issues of bail and consecutive sentencing and is clearly aimed at dealing with the issue of recidivism. The Minister of State has spoken about the high rate of recidivism related to burglary offences. The Irish Prison Service's recidivism survey suggests a repeat offending rate of 79% and the Probation Service survey also shows a high level of repeat offending associated with burglary. I am aware of research on the psychology of young offenders in the State who are convicted of a number of burglary offences who might be described as "persistent burglars". The psychology is interesting, as evident in the report and interviews with those convicted of multiple burglary offences. One finds there is an opportunistic element in that the individuals concerned may take the opportunity to commit a burglary if they see an open window or house that appears empty or without a burglar alarm. However, there is also an ingrained culture. One hesitates to say expertise or experience builds up. Within the very small community of very persistent burglars, there is an ingrained burglar psychology. Clearly, this needs to be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> The Bill seeks to address this issue through the criminal justice system. The amendment to the Bail Act 1997 allows a court to consider repeat offences where burglary is committed in a dwelling and where the offender has attained the age of 18 years. This might be taken into account when refusing bail in respect of a particular burglary offence. I am glad to see there are safeguards in this regard. The Minister of State has pointed out the right to bail derives from the constitutional presumption of innocence. It is important that we ensure that the constitutional rights for those accused of crimes are protected. There are clear safeguards related to the qualifications in respect of the courts' role in deciding on bail.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> With regard to section 2 and consecutive sentencing, a range of safeguards is in place. A number of provisos must apply before a court can impose a consecutive sentence. Where a consecutive sentence is imposed by the District Court, the aggregate term is still limited to two years. That is important and the range of safeguards must be supported. Clearly, however, these provisions will not tackle the underlying causes of offending. For that reason, I really welcome the inter-agency approach the Minister has announced, namely, the joint agency response to crime initiative, JARC, which one anticipates will be more effective than any criminal justice response can be. We all know that the issues involved in the repeat offending of a small group of mostly young, persistent offenders must be tackled. Clearly, initiatives associated with bail and sentencing can go only partially towards this.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> More generally, it has been welcome to see that the Government's approach to criminal justice has focused on tackling causes of crime and emphasised the need to strengthen the restorative justice system. Senator Martin Conway has mentioned the latter. The approach has also focused on penal reform more generally. I really welcomed earlier this week the closure of St. Patrick's Institution, that dreadful place which for far too long has been a blight on the prison estate. Other Senators have also welcomed it. There was a general welcome for the emphasis on further resourcing of the Probation Service and on non-custodial sanctions as a way of ensuring the rehabilitation of offenders. Our own justice committee's report on penal reform, unanimously adopted some years ago, recommended that prison should be a sanction of last resort and that efforts should be made to reduce the number of those incarcerated for minor, non-violent offences. For that reason, everyone will welcome the commencement of the Fines Act in the new year, as announced by the Minister. It will ensure we will no longer see people sent to prison for the non-payment of fines. There was some discussion on that in the House this week. It is a very welcome change towards a more enlightened and progressive criminal justice and penal system that will see real inroads being made into addressing repeat offending and much better protections for victims of crime. Ultimately, victims of crime wish to see crime prevention and the tackling of repeat offending.</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> I commend the Garda for its work and welcome the fact that Operation Thor has been put in place to tackle very serious, organised burglary offences. I commend the Garda for its previous operation, Operation Fiacla, and the community groups on their efforts. The justice committee held hearings with Muintir na Tíre and the community groups, which are clearly doing a huge amount of invisible work on crime prevention on the ground in various areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">My own experience in an urban setting of the Garda's crime prevention office has been hugely positive. It is largely unseen work, with crime prevention officers coming out to people's homes in neighbourhoods where there has been a high rate of burglaries in previous weeks to advise communities on how best to secure their homes and to ensure crime prevention strategies are put in place. These are really important interventions. They are invisible, but they have a huge impact in terms of crime prevention.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> The Bill is only a small part of a much larger package of measures which are needed to tackle burglaries. It will receive general support and I am glad that safeguards are in place to ensure the presumption of innocence will be protected, as will the due process rights of accused persons.</p>

          <from>Senator Sean D. Barrett<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_75">I welcome the Minister of State who is a regular visitor to the House these days. I welcome Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú's generous response to the Bill and the Minister of State will receive the same support throughout the House. </p>
          <p eId="para_76"> As Mr. Justice Hardiman said, the offence of burglary, committed in a dwelling house, is an act of aggression and an attack on the personal rights of the citizen, a violation of him or her, as well as a public crime. People believe that when personal jewellery is scattered around the place or stolen, it is a real violation and it takes older people and those who live alone or in the country a long time to recover from such a traumatic experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_77"> In the context of attempts to enforce drink driving legislation, I regret the ingenuity of the legal profession in defending activities which lead to the death of some 160 people a year. Will the loophole merchants find a loophole in this legislation? Is the definition of "dwelling" strong enough? Will they be able to say they did not know something was a dwelling? Will they be able to say they did not know somebody lived upstairs? Will they be able to say they were robbing the post office, not knowing the postmaster or postmistress lived overhead? Perhaps on the next Stage we might look at whether the definition is watertight. The loophole merchants of the legal profession are probably at work already to find a way around it. I regret such conduct, but, after the recent drink driving case and the role different languages played in the case, cynicism among the public is at unprecedented levels. That is what the Garda has to cope with.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> The requirement to retire earlier than in any other occupation is wrong because the Garda force loses all that expertise. A previous deputy commissioner took the case for normal retirement in An Garda Síochána to the courts but lost as there needed to be a system of promotions and people would have been blocked off if others stayed on too long. On the retirement age in general, the unnatural early retirement age for gardaí might be looked at. I welcome the reference to the Garda Reserve, the members of which sometimes feel left out but whom the Minister of State has brought firmly back into things. </p>
          <p eId="para_79"> We need joint operations in Border areas. In the Smithwick report which investigated the deaths of two RUC men on leaving Dundalk Garda station there was a recommendation that the United States-Canada model for cross-Border policing be used. Given the very harmonious relationship between the PSNI and the Garda and the fact that there is a meeting in Armagh today between the Ministers of the two jurisdictions, that recommendation might be looked at. It is related, as the Minister of State said, to the deaths of Garda Tony Golden and Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe. We cannot have areas of criminality on both sides of the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> Garda visits to schools have a good record and should be maintained. This is not particularly relevant to burglaries, but children should be warned of the dangers on roads or being invited to get into cars. </p>
          <p eId="para_81"> On the question of a cumulative record of burglaries being taken into account, I accept the point about the presumption of innocence and that it is a strong part of the Constitution, but if there are 64 or 94 previous offences, the statistical probability of presuming innocence is reduced. A person is his or her record and it should be taken into account. There is general despair when people commit crimes while on bail and I welcome the Minister of State's attempts to deal with the matter today. It is an abuse of freedom.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> I wish the Minister of State well with the legislation. On a side issue, the name "An Garda Síochána" originated in this House and the title in legislation was to be the "Civic Guard". A Senator made a contribution which was acknowledged throughout society. </p>
          <p eId="para_83"> Senator Feargal Quinn is unable to be here, but he did ask that, in addition to the 999 number, we look at the 101 system whereby people who are not reporting a crime could seek the advice of gardaí. The Senator assures me that the system works very well in Northern Ireland. It takes pressure off the 999 service because one person deals with crimes, while the others give advice. Other Senators have mentioned the value of advice. For old people, a much appreciated piece of advice from gardaí is to get a dog, as burglars can get around technology, but a dog is a real deterrent.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> There should be greater community policing, while Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú mentioned the curse of bureaucracy. We should get gardaí on the beat, meeting people and reinforcing the relationship between them and the public, one of the great relationships in the country. An Garda Síochána is probably the most trusted institution in public life. On the subject of cherishing the role played by it in the development of Irish society, the Garda Museum in Dublin Castle has been shut for a very long time. It would be of great interest in increasing the appreciation and knowledge of the great history of the great servants we have in An Garda Síochána.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, and compliment him and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on the raft of reforming legislation which has been steered successfully through the Oireachtas in recent months and which will come to a conclusion in the next number of days. I particularly welcome this significant and timely legislation which addresses an issue which is near and dear to every citizen, namely, how the law can be strengthened to keep them safer from thugs who invade their private lives and homes where citizens are entitled to feel safe. The Bill does just that by addressing the issues of repeat offending and sentencing. It will close some loopholes in the justice system that allow dangerous criminals to commit multiple burglaries, obtain bail and reoffend while out on bail. Many people say it is long overdue to get tough with burglars, particularly those who use violence. We all know friends and neighbours whose homes have been burgled and some in this House have also experienced it, albeit without the violence, and know the trauma and anxiety it causes which last for a very long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> Burglary with violence is a particularly heinous crime and must be met with the full rigour of the law. Members will have read about a case in east Galway last year which involved a business couple in their 70s who ran a shop off the motorway in the village of Kiltullagh. They have been burgled on a number of occasions and last year were savagely beaten. Their son who arrived on the scene was hit on the head with a hammer. Their business was ransacked as the burglars looked for cash before they sped off in a high powered vehicle down the motorway. Four months earlier the same couple had been robbed of cigarettes, equipment and cash. I heard a heart-rending interview recently on local radio with the elderly gentleman concerned in which he recalled the events which had happened to them in the past few years. He said their lives had been changed forever and that they found it difficult to sleep in their beds at night.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">We must put an end to this behaviour. It is ludicrous that repeat offenders who have been charged with multiple burglaries are given bail and often commit further offences while on bail. I cannot understand how this practice has been allowed to continue. </p>
          <p eId="para_88"> I concur with Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú that sentencing for home burglaries must reflect the seriousness of the crime which involves intruding on people's lives and instilling fear in them. Many professional burglars make smart use of technology and often have inside information. Above all, however, they have an outlet for disposing stolen goods. This issue must be tackled by cutting off these outlets, thereby putting an end to their ability to dispose of stolen goods. </p>
          <p eId="para_89"> Investment is the key to tackling serious crime. The Government has invested heavily in crime prevention and Garda resources, including Operation Thor. The Garda was starved of investment during the recession. I am particularly pleased that a significant investment is being made in the Garda fleet. Approximately €34 million has been spent on Garda vehicles since 2012 and a further €5.3 million was allocated recently to fund the purchase of 600 additional new vehicles for the Garda fleet. I also welcome the recent announcement by the Minister that 600 new gardaí will be recruited in the coming year. Moves to strengthen the community approach to policing are also welcome. Community involvement through community and text alert and neighbourhood watch schemes is increasing and involves communities working closely with the Garda. There is no doubt that burglary rates decline significantly in communities where this approach is working effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> Today is significant in that we are passing legislation which will, I hope, deal with repeat offenders. We need to go further, however, by continuing to invest in Garda resources. I am pleased that a Garda station refurbishment programme was introduced early this year, much of which will come to fruition in 2016. I am not especially worried that small Garda stations will not reopen. I want to see more and more Garda patrols in rural communities at times when thugs are out doing their evil deeds. Having gardaí sitting in Garda stations is a waste of time. Unannounced Garda patrols in rural communities and villages are the best way to prevent crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> I applaud the Minister for introducing the Bill. I am particularly pleased that every Senator who has contributed thus far has spoken in favour of it. Together, we can help to eliminate this cancer in society by dealing with criminals who are terrorising innocent people. We are entitled to feel safe in our homes. As the old saying goes, a person's home is his castle and we all expect to be safe when we turn the key in the lock at night.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">I welcome the Minister of State. If he does not have the answer to any of my questions, I ask him to circulate it afterwards. </p>
          <p eId="para_93"> Was an impact assessment made of the implementation of this legislation by judges? One of the reasons people are given bail is the possibility that there will be an undue delay in hearing cases in court. It can take some time for a case to come to court.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> On the issue of whether to grant bail on the grounds that a person is likely to reoffend, how many more people will end up in prison as a result of this proposal? Some 25% of people who commit burglaries account for 75% of burglaries. What does this represent in hard numbers, in other words, to how many individuals does it amount? Does the prison system have the capacity to deal with the numbers involved if the law is implemented and judges refuse bail applications?</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> I spoke previously about the issue of smart tagging. The Minister of State alluded to the Bail Act 1997. The briefing material from the Library and Research Service notes that section 6 of the Act allows for electronic monitoring or smart tagging of persons who are charged with a serious offence or appealing against a sentence of imprisonment imposed by the District Court or out on bail. Unfortunately, this section has not been commenced. </p>
          <p eId="para_96"> On alternatives to bail, the Criminal Justice Act 2006 allows for an alternative sentence to imprisonment by means of electronic tagging. Research carried out by the Library and Research Service has found that reoffending rates among those who were subject to smart tagging or electronic monitoring in Florida for property and drug-related crimes declined by 95%. The Library and Research Service also notes that monitoring a person for one month costs €195, whereas imprisonment for one day costs €263. While I am in favour of the Bill on the basis that it is necessary to tackle those who are responsible for the majority of crimes, smart policing also involves using smart technology. I agree that habitual criminals should be allowed not to have a series of other crimes taken into consideration when being sentenced. In a recent case a person who had 60 convictions for burglary was sentenced to six months for a series of crimes. Let us be honest, this person will be convicted for a 62nd and a 63rd time because he is a habitual offender. We should use the Bail Act 1997 and the Criminal Justice Act 2006 to implement electronic and smart tagging for habitual burglars, as well as for other habitual offenders. As the Minister of State and the officials will be aware, of 16,000 people disqualified from driving, 500 were subsequently involved in serious accidents, some of which caused death. If electronic monitoring or smart tagging had been used, a member of An Garda Síochána would have been able to determine if the person was in a car at any time and could have had the vehicle stopped. Provided someone else was not driving, the person being monitored could then have been imprisoned. I am raising the possibility of such a provision being added to the Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_97"> My principal question to the Minister of State is whether the prison system has the capacity to deal with the 25% of burglars who are habitual offenders when they come before the courts. Will a judge agree with the Garda that a habitual burglar should not be granted bail but ultimately decide not to incarcerate the individual in question on the basis that the prison system cannot accommodate him or her or that a trial may not be held within 12 months?</p>

          <p eId="para_98">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach. </p>
          <p eId="para_99"> The Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015 has two main provisions. It provides for the option of refusing bail in certain circumstances to a person charged with domestic burglary.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">It also will provide that where a court imposes custodial sentences for multiple domestic burglaries, these sentences must be consecutive in certain circumstances. Members should consider the number of burglaries and other offences committed by criminals out on bail, as has been referred to by many Members, as well as repetitive burglaries and the question of access to free legal aid for persistent offenders. I am aware that constitutionally, one is innocent until proved guilty and, as far as I can see, a criminal who has committed in excess of 100 offences can have free legal aid and it is available <i>ad infinitum</i>. However, I believe there should be some way to get payback from these criminals, whether it be through voluntary work in their communities or, in many cases, a small reduction in social welfare benefits. I believe continuing to burgle houses while out on bail definitely is not constitutional.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> I acknowledge all community organisations and neighbourhood watch schemes, as well as the Irish Farmers Association and Muintir na Tíre. I also acknowledge the co-operation between the Police Service of Northern Ireland and An Garda Síochána. I recently called to a home in County Louth in which an elderly lady in her 70s lives alone. She called out to ask who was at the door and when I told her who it was, she asked me to wait as she had four locks to open on the door. I simply was calling to check on her and to ensure everything was all right, but it took her three or four minutes to open all the bolts she had on the door. She is living in fear with the lights on all night and so on. Members must act to stop this. I met a fellow recently who received a telephone call at 3 a.m. A guy was going by boat on a business trip to Scotland when he saw a jeep, the number of which he recognised. He rang the owner to find out where on the boat he was in order to have a chat during the crossing, only to discover the man was at home in his bed in Cooley and did not realise his jeep was on the ship going to Scotland. It was fortunate that the man had made a telephone call because the owner then realised his jeep had been taken from outside his door and was being taken to Scotland during the night. Thankfully, with the co-operation the perpetrators were apprehended.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> I acknowledge the remarks by Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú about our police force, An Garda Síochána. Its members must be commended on their dedication and full commitment to protecting communities nationwide. I support the Bill and I am glad everyone who has spoken is supportive of it. It is being supported by all parties and I look forward to its implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> If I can raise one further matter, the Minister of State might comment on the issue of reasonable force. I would like it if someone to explained to me what constitutes reasonable force. If one goes home and opens one's door to find some guy leaving with one's television or goods from the home, what does one do? I know what I would do and while it might not be within the law, that is the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_105">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin. I also welcome the Bill which Fianna Fáil supports wholeheartedly and the changes it makes to the bail laws and the sentencing regime. I have listened to all the contributions in the Chamber, all of which are familiar to me. I carried out some research on this issue and understand there were 28,830 recorded burglary and related offences in the 12-month period ending in June 2015. This represents an increase of 2,241, or more than 8%, when compared with the corresponding period ending in 2014. While this is only a statistic, when Members think about all the families, households and communities that are affected and the devastating impact a burglary can have, these statistics can only be described as a national crisis. The closure of 139 Garda stations and the reduction in Garda numbers from 14,000 to approximately 12,500 members, have left both urban and rural communities extremely vulnerable to burglary. The recent spate of violent attacks during burglaries on elderly people in their homes has left many people living in constant fear. My party already has published a Bill to introduce a mandatory three-year jail sentence for criminals convicted of burglary and a minimum of seven years on conviction of a third offence. Fianna Fáil did this because we understand that when someone breaks into one's home, it is not just the items which are stolen that causes the impact but also the shattering of the sense of security and comfort a home offers. This is particularly the case for elderly people who are most vulnerable in their homes. No law can bring back that comfort and security to the individuals targeted and that is why Members must be ready to do whatever it takes to end the current crisis. I note what the Minister of State said and Senator Sean D. Barrett alluded to the comments of Mr. Justice Adrian Hardiman of the Court of Criminal Appeal when he stated, “The offence of burglary committed in a dwellinghouse is in every instance an act of aggression, an attack on the personal rights of the citizen as well as a public crime and is a violation of him or her." That sums it up quite well for us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> The burglary epidemic being witnessed nationwide is being carried out by a few criminals. These individuals are ruthless, often, albeit not always, fuelled by drugs and have absolutely no regard for the law. Unfortunately, they are better equipped with technology than are gardaí and have high-powered vehicles that can outrun any Garda patrol car. I acknowledge the Government will invest in new high-powered cars for the Garda, which I greatly welcome. Members must give the Garda the necessary resources to defeat these criminals. The State has a duty to defend its citizens from lawlessness and it is failing in that duty, which is a great shame. Members must wake up to the challenge faced by communities and rural communities, in particular, which feel isolated and where people often live in fear because of these criminal actions. I am familiar, as are other colleagues, with the stories of many elderly people who lock their doors at 6 p.m. Senator Terry Brennan has just alluded to such a case. They refuse to answer the door after that time because they live in fear in their homes. I also know of neighbours who do everything they can to protect their homes but believe they will be the next victims of this horrendous crime. I hope this Bill will act as an additional deterrent to those engaged in criminal activities. However, even in cases where criminals who engage in burglary are convicted, there is a significant chance of the individual reoffending when they are released. As some colleagues have referred to the reoffending statistics, I do not intend to go into that subject again.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> The other issue I wish to see addressed is the free legal aid system. Victims of burglary who are obliged to go to court must have legal representation and are obliged to pay for it themselves. In 99% of cases, the criminal who has committed the offence is given free legal aid. Free legal aid is too freely available and this issue must be examined in depth. I ask the Minister of State to so do.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> I welcome the resources the Government is providing for the Garda. We need to build up the numbers of gardaí in communities. A burglary in a house in Dublin or a rural community has the same effect on the person who is burgled. Such victims feel isolated and live in fear. Some communities have taken matters into their own hands. I refer to the group formed recently after a public meeting in Swanlinbar, County Cavan. A group of individuals is now patrolling their area and has had some success in catching criminals. Cross-Border crime is a particular problem in the area I come from. The Minister of State would be familiar with it through family connections. In these particular cases, persons have been caught engaging in criminality and have been handed over to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, but they have walked free. That is because the law is backing the criminal. These communities telephone the local gardaí, but by the time the gardaí get to the scene of the crime, it is too late and they are gone. We need to put the gardaí on the ground in the communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> There is also a need to invest heavily in smart technology. Garda stations that have been closed will not reopen. Unfortunately, it is a fact that more Garda stations will close. We should have a system where every number plate in the State is recognisable and it should be easy to say whether a car is taxed, is insured, has undergone the NCT and who owns it. If it is cloned, we should be able to identify this and move in fairly quickly on the person driving it.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> I welcome the Bill which my party supports fully. I hope it will have a speedy passage through this House.</p>

          <from>Senator Cáit Keane<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_111">I pay tribute to the late Garda Tony Golden, the late Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe and the 87 members of the Garda force who lost their lives in protecting us. I hope the Bill will do what it is supposed to do and help to put a stop to the revolving door. There is nothing more frustrating than when one's house is burgled because one's home is one's castle. It is protected by the Constitution, which states, "The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law".</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> The previous speaker spoke about closure of Garda stations, but Fianna Fáil closed more Garda stations than we did. I do not agree with the view on the closure on Garda stations. Compared to 2011, before Garda stations were closed, the number of burglaries and aggravated burglaries recorded has fallen by 0.4% and 5.7%, respectively. It is preferable to have a garda sitting in a highly equipped car with a mobile phone and IT - one of the new 640 plus vehicles put on the road this year - rather than sitting in a station with an old phone and no IT. The technology is available whereby gardaí could log on to the PULSE system from their cars through a secure mobile hand-held unit. This should be available to every community garda. Gardaí should not have to travel back to the station to log on to their computers. It is like being back in the Dark Ages and it must change. An extra €205 million has been allocated this year for ICT, 640 new vehicles have been provided and €1.8 million has been allocated for replacement and upgrade of surveillance equipment.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> I have much to say about repeat offenders. Some 25% of offenders are responsible for 75% of property offences and the rate of recidivism is at 79%. Tagging was mentioned. It would be much cheaper if one could do that. The DNA legislation will go a long way. When gardaí come out to one's house to take fingerprints, what happens after that? The new system and the new legislation will go a long way in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> The Minister of State might make a statement on automatic number plate recognition, ANPR. I raised it at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly recently. According to the Automobile Association, there are cameras all around the country, but they are not linked to Garda stations. If one computer could talk to another one, it would save a lot of money also. If automatic number plate recognition was linked to the technology the Garda has and to the speed cameras, one could cut down on the number of burglaries. The JARC system that has been introduced and the inter-agency offender management community programme will go a long way to addressing that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> Senator Diarmuid Wilson spoke about free legal aid. One should hit people in their pockets. If they are in receipt of social welfare payments, there should be even a minimal deduction. For every offence, let it creep up and hit them where it hurts. If repeat offenders can go to prison for one day, or an hour like the two Deputies, it says it is all right and that they can get away with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> I welcome the €397,000 extra the Minister has put into the community alert scheme. The community alert scheme and people working together and keeping an eye on what is happen are important. We should have a programme to address the 79% recidivism rate. The individual must decide to transform himself or herself. There are programmes in America and in England, namely, cognitive transformation theory for desistance from crime, which work. One could work with communities because many communities know the repeat offender. Rather than locking them up and throwing away the key, it is preferable to do something with the individual and to let him or her try to transform himself or herself. There are some cognitive transformation desistance programmes in action and we should look at them.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> As was stated, there is no point in having the legislation if we do not have places to put people, but I do not think that is what it is about. It is about how we prevent crime.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">I welcome the Minister of State. Fianna Fáil supports the Bill to address the significant rise in burglary offences witnessed in the past three years. Sadly, the number of burglary offences continues to soar within the State. The CSO recently published figures show a national increase of 8.4%. I wish to speak about the constituency of Dublin Rathdown in which the Stepaside Garda station was closed. I have called that a folly on a number of occasions and Fianna Fáil is committed to reopening the Garda station there or, alternatively, to building a new custom built Garda station in the area that would have three cells and whatever else is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> Exit 13 on the M50 is used by burglars who travel freely and quickly into, and out of, the constituency. It is unbelievable. At the two public meetings I held on burglaries in the area, more than 60% of those who attended said they had been burgled or knew somebody who had been burgled. It is a daily occurrence. It has left many older people in constant fear of being burgled. I always recommend to older people in the constituency that they put on their alarm early in the evening and do not to answer the door.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> Fianna Fáil has proposed that CCTV cameras be installed at motorway exits to assist in the detection and prosecution of criminal activity. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, for instance, that would include exit 13 off the M50. In the case of public transport, the operators of the Luas have inspectors on the tram who observe passengers and monitor criminal activity, but they cannot intervene where a crime is committed. There is very little they can do if they see somebody committing an offence such as pick-pocketing, or notice a person they suspect was involved in a crime in the area. We are proposing that gardaí be seconded from local stations to deal with cases, for example, where a person suspected of committing a crime is frequenting the Luas. Unlike the security people monitoring the trams, gardaí have the power to arrest people in these circumstances. From my own experience, the community gardaí in Dundrum do a marvellous job.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> Fianna Fáil intends to bring forward legislation to introduce longer sentences for those who assault elderly persons, who are among the most vulnerable in both rural and urban communities. In addition, we propose to introduce mandatory minimum sentences for persons convicted of burglary offences. The neighbourhood watch schemes operating in many areas serve a very useful purpose, but my party is committed to establishing a national neighbourhood watch directorate to centrally support and drive community initiatives across the country. Gardaí do an excellent job in nurturing and supporting local neighbourhood watch schemes, but it would be excellent to have an overall directive. In a similar vein, Crimestoppers is an international organisation which has a great deal to offer in terms of preventing crime within communities. However, it does not receive adequate funding in this country to let people know what it is capable of doing and to get them involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> The rate of burglaries in the State is a very serious issue. As I said, criminals are using the motorways and the Luas to move around the place with ease. I support the Bill on behalf of Fianna Fáil.</p>

        <speech by="#FidelmaHealyEames" eId="spk_22">
          <from>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_123">I welcome the Minister of State. I am delighted to welcome the Bill which represents a timely and appropriate response to the increased incidence of burglaries of dwellings. That is not to say it is the ideal solution. In fact, nobody knows what the ideal response is to this very serious issue. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill notes that the recidivism rate for persons convicted of burglaries and related offences is 80%. There must always, of course, be a presumption of innocence until a person is proved guilty in any criminal prosecution but, as Senator Sean D. Barrett observed, there is cause for serious concern when a person comes before the courts who has 94 previous convictions. Will consideration be given to setting an above-the-bar figure beyond which a person will not be granted bail? I ask the Minister of State to address that suggestion in his response.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> I support the measures in the Bill in regard to consecutive sentencing. However, the issue about which I am most concerned is the impact of these crimes on victims. I do not claim criminal justice as a specialism of mine, but I do understand the trauma that is visited on people when these things happen to them. At the time I moved to Oranmore in the mid-1990s, a local man in his mid or late 60s was murdered during the course of a burglary. That represents the nth degree to which these types of crime can escalate. Such is the trauma visited on people that they often do not feel safe in their homes and end up living in fear. This is especially so for older people, whose confidence may be taken away forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> On Monday night I heard about the number of break-ins in Clarinbridge, in Maree in Oranmore, where I live, and also in the Newcastle area of Galway city and Portumna. We need to tackle the root causes of this type of crime and implement measures to make it very unattractive to potential criminals. Senator Terry Brennan spoke about hitting these people where it hurt. There certainly is a case for reviewing social welfare entitlements, for instance, in such cases. I am conscious, however, without in any way wishing to justify criminal activity, that if we penalise people to the degree that we put them on the bread line, they might be driven to burgle out of necessity. I was involved in a study on early school leaving in the course of which we interviewed a number of young prisoners. Many of them, particularly the female prisoners, spoke about growing up in an environment of abuse, illiteracy and drug addiction and with family members who spent time in prison. The only way they could survive that environment was to burgle. It is a major societal issue at that level. None of that is reflected in the Bill, although I acknowledge the inter-agency approach to which Senator Ivana Bacik alluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> On the other hand, if the sanctions and penalties are too weak and offenders know that they will get away with it, they will continue to engage in criminal activity. We know there is a culture of crime in certain areas and within certain families. That is part of the bigger picture and it needs to be tackled through the education and juvenile justice systems. I agree with Senator Michael Mullins about the need to have a visible Garda presence. We need more community gardaí and more regular patrols. At the same time, there are steps people can take to reduce the likelihood of burglary and keep themselves safe. The text alert system is very good and is in operation where I live, in Maree. Having alert neighbours is better than having any number of gardaí on patrol. People who are at home on a regular basis notice unfamiliar vehicles and unusual activity in their area. People also need to be careful when it comes to social media usage. Young people, in particular, tend to advertise their location at any point in time. That gives very valuable information to smart burglars. I agree that a good dog is a great asset. I have one at home and it does make a difference in terms of making one feel safer.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> I will conclude with a few questions for the Minister of State. Based on the evidence, what is the best sanction or penalty to prevent criminal recidivism and rehabilitate offenders? We need to work with offenders to help them see the impact of their crimes and ensure they do not want to do the same again. Second, what is An Garda Síochána seeking in terms of additional resources and supports to tackle this problem? I am presuming they have sought such assistance. Will the Minister of State consider provisions to withdraw access to bail for repeat offenders after they have been convicted of a certain number of burglary offences?</p>
          <p eId="para_128">Is there a means of tagging offenders above a certain number of burglaries?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AodhanORiordan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_23">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_129">I appreciate the contributions made across the House and the support for the Bill. I listened with interest to what Senators had to say and thank all those who contributed to the debate. It is clear that all of us here are of the view that burglary is an odious offence, particularly when it interferes with what should be the peaceful haven of a person's home.</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> In tackling burglaries, the Government is particularly focused on serious and repeat offenders in terms of sentencing and in smarter and more co-ordinated offender management and investing in the capacity of An Garda Síochána to tackle such offenders. </p>
          <p eId="para_131"> The Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, commissioned a review of this area earlier in the year and the Bill is directly informed by the concerns identified by An Garda Síochána. Officials from the Department met the detectives tackling burglaries so that they could hear first hand the difficulties they face to identify the improvements in the law which have been delivered in the Bill. Gardaí noted the particular challenges they face in tackling repeat offenders who obtain bail, despite having multiple convictions or facing multiple charges. Such offenders often commit many burglaries while on bail and then push to receive a sentence for as few offences as possible while having many more taken into consideration. The Bill addresses both ends of the problem. </p>
          <p eId="para_132"> The constitutional right of liberty of accused persons is carefully balanced with the constitutional right to inviolable dwelling. Multiple offences of domestic burglary or multiple pending charges or a combination of both will be considered as evidence that the person is likely to commit further domestic burglary. The courts will be empowered to deny bail to such prolific offenders in appropriate cases. </p>
          <p eId="para_133"> As regards sentencing, multiple offences committed within the same 12-month period cannot simply be taken into consideration or rolled up into a single concurrent sentence of imprisonment. If a court is minded to impose a sentence of imprisonment it would be obliged to impose it consecutively to any sentence of imprisonment for domestic burglary committed within the same 12-month period. </p>
          <p eId="para_134"> Work is progressing on the drafting of a new bail Bill which the Minister intends to bring forward as a matter of priority to strengthen other aspects of the law and to protect the public against crimes committed by persons on bail. Legislation is only part of the solution. Results on the ground are delivered by the men and women of An Garda Síochána. Gardaí ensure our laws are enforced and that the rights of vulnerable victims are upheld.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> It is important that we equip the gardaí to do their jobs. I wish to outline the significant investment the Government is making in Garda equipment, ICT, vehicles, buildings and the new DNA database. The Government's capital plan is providing a major investment in 21st century policing to tackle crime. An additional €46 million has been provided for vehicles, €60 million for buildings and overall ICT funding of €330 million over the lifetime of the capital plan. The Minister secured an extra allocation for the recruitment of 600 new gardaí. I have already mentioned the effect of Operation Thor.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> I listened with particular interest to the concerns of all Members of the House to particular cases mentioned by colleagues. I sympathise with all victims of burglaries. In addition to resourcing An Garda Síochána to tackle the offenders, we are putting in place supports for victims. The general scheme of the criminal justice (victims of crime) Bill has been published and the Bill is being drafted. Victims of crime will be placed at the heart of the justice system for the first time. Victims will have a right to receive clear information on the criminal justice system, their role within it and the range of services and entitlements they may access. The Bill provides the right to receive written acknowledgement of the making of a complaint as well as details on how further information can be obtained. Victims will be able to request information concerning the progress of the investigation in any court proceedings. The information must be provided by a prison service on the release and escape from prison of an offender serving a sentence for an offence against the victim if requested. Victims will also have the right to individual assessment of the measures necessary for their protection from further victimisation. An Garda Síochána, the Courts Service, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Irish Prison Service and the Garda Ombudsman Commission will all be obliged to train staff members in the needs of victims and to enable them to deal with victims in a respectful and professional manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> On the closure of Garda stations, policing has a lot more complexity to it than where a station is located. Recent statistics show no correlation between station closures and a rise in burglary. The number of burglaries has, in fact, fallen in some areas where stations were closed. I understand the concern expressed at the closure of Garda stations. It can appear that resources have been withdrawn from an area when this happens, but that is not the truth. The closure of Garda stations was not about saving money. It was done to enhance service delivery and efficiency. We have heard again in recent days from the Garda association and the Garda Inspectorate about the need to release gardaí from paperwork for front line duties. The rationalisation programme put in place by Garda management shows front-line gardaí to be deployed with greater mobility and flexibility, particularly for targeted police operations. As a result, communities benefit from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which improves the police service to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> The network of more than 700 Garda stations inherited from the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Dublin Metropolitan Police reflected a 19th century model that predated the invention of the motor car. Can anyone seriously argue that a 19th century policing model should be applied to 21st century crime? The Garda strategy which the Minister supports and has resourced is to ensure a dynamic policing response that has enabled it to tackle crime where and when it happens and the appropriate equipment. The Garda cannot drive a desk to a scene of a crime to apprehend criminals or move that desk to the other side of the county in response to changing crime patterns. However, a garda in a patrol car or a high-powered response vehicle can both engage with the local community and attend the scene of a crime. We must support a 21st century model of policing. </p>
          <p eId="para_139"> On the issue of tagging, the Criminal Justice Act 2007 provides for the introduction of electronic monitoring as a condition of bail at the discretion of the court. However, due to issues relating to the operational effectiveness of untargeted electronic monitoring, these provisions have not been commenced. Evidence in other jurisdictions has shown that electronic monitoring has significant limitations. For example, the report on the Scottish electronic monitoring has a condition of bail where neither the aims of increasing public safety perceptions nor reducing the custodial remand population have been achieved in any significant way. </p>
          <p eId="para_140"> I thank Members for their support for the Bill. The Bill was developed, having sought the advice of gardaí on the ground and in the light of the challenges they face. It represents a targeted response to those who think they can repeatedly burgle the homes of innocent victims with impunity. Suggestions that people's right to free legal aid should be curtailed are not consistent with the values of a republic. One may not like it and we may find it difficult to accept, but if we believe in living in a free and open democracy and in a republic, there are certain rights and entitlements that go with living in that republic. It is a constitutional right.</p>

          <p eId="para_143">It represents in this Bill, a short Bill, a technically complex Bill which carefully balances constitutional rights to ensure the Garda and the courts can respond fairly but effectively to the crime caused by prolific burglars. This legislation, together with Operation Thor and the joint agency response to crime, is focused on tackling and managing prolific offenders. It forms part of a comprehensive package aimed at reducing the scourge of crime and burglaries, in particular. There is a wider debate to be had about the root causes of crime and issues of inequality in that respect, but that is for another day.</p>

          <p eId="para_146">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_147">In page 7, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_148">"(9) No place of detention shall henceforth be titled St. Patrick's".</p>
          <p eId="para_149">I welcome the Minister of State. While I am aware that he said he was here for the day, I hope I am not the cause of delaying him unnecessarily. This amendment is about the closure of St. Patrick's Institution which, of course, was warmly welcomed after criticisms of the institution dating back to Fr. Flanagan in the 1940s.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">More recently, we have heard criticisms from Judge Michael Reilly, Ms Emily Logan and the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon. I commend the Minister for abolishing such an institution and not having anything more in this country based on the borstal.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> The amendment provides that no place of detention should henceforth be called or titled "St. Patrick's". The Department is doing away with this model and I fully support it in abolishing it. It has taken so long. The institution was based in Clonmel in 1946. Then in the 1950s it was moved to a prison in Mountjoy. Now, it is finally being shut down with universal support.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> The name "St. Patrick" was invoked sometime in the 1950s. It had been called a borstal before it moved back to Clonmel after the Second World War. The Army had been in the building up to that point. Invoking St. Patrick was an attempt to disguise what actually happened in these institutions. All the critics, dating back to Fr. Flanagan, have described the beating of children, the deprival of clothing and visits and all sorts of abuse. It was given some kind of respectability by invoking the national saint and that was particularly inappropriate. St. Patrick was kidnapped in another jurisdiction at 16 years of age. He was held as a slave in this country for six years and forced to work without reward. Then he escaped. There is some dreadful irony in using that title to lend respectability to an institution which we are now abolishing. I hope it never features again in the name of any institution of detention.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> It is an unfortunate title, to put it mildly, given what happened to the gentleman concerned. There is nothing to be said in favour of what happened there, given all the criticisms during all the years. I have in mind the statements from the Ombudsman for Children and Judge Michael Reilly, as well as earlier criticisms. Lest there be any possibility that the national saint could ever be invoked in this way, let us end the use of the name in a place of detention. I have no wish to delay the Minister of State further. That is the purpose of the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#AodhanORiordan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_30">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_154">On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, I thank Senator Sean D. Barrett for bringing forward this amendment. It arose from an interesting point he made on Second Stage regarding the appropriateness of attaching the name "St. Patrick's" to a place where young persons were detained in view of the circumstances under which St. Patrick had been reputedly brought to Ireland and subjected to forced labour.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> Senators will appreciate the Government is fully committed to and will very shortly achieve, finally, the closing of St. Patrick's Institution. Accordingly, it is now a matter of when, rather than if, St. Patrick's Institution will be closed. Subsequently, there will be an end to the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> While recommending in 2013 that St. Patrick's Institution be closed, the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention also recommended that the name "St. Patrick's" be consigned to history. The Bill will do this by providing not only for the complete closing of St. Patrick's Institution but also through the general removal of references to St. Patrick's Institution from the Statute Book. In particular, the Bill will repeal all the legislative provisions that specifically enable the courts to order the detention of young persons in St. Patrick's Institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> The term "place of detention" has a specific meaning in prisons legislation. Section 2 of the Prisons Act 1970 provides that the Minister for Justice may, for the purposes of promoting the rehabilitation of offenders, provide places other than prisons for the detention of sentenced persons. These places are known and referred to as "places of detention". Wheatfield Place of Detention, as it is now called, is one such place. Therefore, the Senator's amendment would not prevent a children's detention school or prison from being given the name "St. Patrick's". More generally, I imagine Senators understand the attachment of the name "St. Patrick's Institution" to the premises which is the subject of the Bill was of its time and would not happen today. In the circumstances, while she fully appreciates the sentiments behind the proposed amendment, the Minister does not believe it is necessary or that it should be included in the Bill.</p>

The Bill finally marks the closure of St. Patrick's Institution and the end of the practice of detaining children in prisons. It is most welcome, especially on the day when we have also seen the order on reasonable chastisement finally signed into law.

          <p eId="para_164">I agree with Senator Jillian van Turnhout. Unfortunately, if we think this will bring to an end young people being incarcerated, it will not. We very much look forward to the day when it will happen, while accepting the fact that it must happen in some cases as a last resort. Perhaps we might consider putting more resources into education programmes such as Youthreach which conducts very successful programmes throughout the country, as well as and other support services. It might result in young people not necessarily being detained at the State's pleasure.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T12:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_166">We are making a little history today. I thank all of the Members who contributed to the debate on the Bill. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and I are grateful for the support of Senators for the proposals contained in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> The Prisons Bill finally delivers on the calls to close St. Patrick's Institution which have been made for the past 30 years. The Government's unprecedented programme of reform in closing St. Patrick's Institution and developing national children detention facilities at Oberstown will allow young people sentenced to detention to be placed in a secure environment that will offer them a better chance, as stated in the Children Act 2001, to take their place in the community as persons who observe the law and are capable of making a positive and productive contribution to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> Before concluding, I advise the House that the Minister intends to table amendments to the Bill in the Dáil to provide for two further matters. The amendments are linked with High Court proceedings in connection with prison-related matters. Unfortunately, it was not possible for the drafting of the amendments to be completed in time for their inclusion in the Bill, as published, or for them to be tabled on Committee Stage. The first arises from the judgment of the High Court earlier this year in the case of Mr. O <i>v.</i> the Minister for Justice and Equality. In that case the High Court considered the legality of the temporary release of a prisoner who had been subject to a deportation order and deported immediately after his release from prison. The High Court decided that section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960, which governs the temporary release of prisoners, did not permit the temporary release of prisoners who were subject to deportation orders for the purposes of their deportation or removal from the State. Given the practical implications of the Mr. O judgment for the deportation process, the Minister believes a clear legislative basis is needed to allow non-national prisoners to be taken from prison by members of An Garda Síochána or immigration officers for the purposes of giving effect to deportation orders under the Immigration Act 1999 or removal orders under the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006. She, therefore, proposes to bring forward an amendment to make new and specific provision for this purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> Second, arising from an issue that has emerged in recent High Court proceedings, the Minister considers it appropriate to bring forward a technical amendment relating to warrants issued by courts in Dublin for the committal of persons to prison. Dublin District Court committal warrants are addressed to An Garda Síochána in accordance with the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851. However, District Court Rules permit committal warrants in Dublin to be addressed directly to the governor of the prison to which a person is to be committed. It has always been thought that this was permitted under the 1851 Act and the courts have operated on that basis. However, in a judgment in the recent case of Grant <i>v.</i> Governor of Cloverhill Prison the High Court judge expressed the view that the relevant provision of the District Court Rules might be inconsistent with the 1851 Act. As this opens up the prospect of uncertainty in the legal position, the Minister proposes to table an amendment to the Bill in the Dáil to declare that the committal warrant issued by the District Court in Dublin can be addressed to the governor of a prison. This is the position that has been taken to apply in Dublin for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> The Prisons Bill is expected to complete all Stages in the Dáil on Monday and I understand arrangements will be made for the Bill to be returned to this House later next week in order that it can complete its passage through both Houses and be signed into law by the end of the year.</p>

          </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_177"><b>2. </b>(1) In this Part, “qualifying legal academic” means a full-time, permanent member of the academic staff of an educational establishment mentioned in <i>subsection (2) </i>who has the qualifications mentioned in <i>subsection (3)</i>.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_183">(3) For the purposes of <i>subsection (1)</i>, a qualifying legal academic shall have qualified as a legal practitioner, whether or not that person has practised as a solicitor or as a barrister.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_184">(4) For the purposes of <i>subsection (3)</i>, legal practitioner has the meaning ascribed to it in <i>section 2(1) </i>of the <i>Legal Services Regulation Act 2015</i>.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">The purpose of the amendments is to introduce a route to qualification as a judge called "qualifying legal academic", that is, a full-time permanent member of the academic staff in an educational institution who has been there for not less than 12 years, to join the new eligibility category of solicitors to qualify for appointment as a judge, if the person displays the degree of competence and probity appropriate to and consistent with the appointment concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> It is hardly a secret that the amendment would have come from legal colleagues in the university rather than economists. They believe they have a case, although it might be opposed. Some people say legal academics should not be let near the courts as they could cause chaos. However, there is a level of competence and ability which might be of assistance in the appointment of members of the Judiciary and the amendment is proposed in that spirit. Is this a useful proposal as we plan the construction of the Judiciary? It is offered to the Minister of State in that spirit and I hope it will assist him. That is the reason it is being proposed.</p>

          <p eId="para_187">I was not one of the legal colleagues who spoke to Senator Sean D. Barrett about this amendment. I have always believed in principle, as have my colleagues who are legal academics, that it would be good to make provision for legal academics to become judges in this jurisdiction, as we have seen happen in other jurisdictions. In one jurisdiction with which I am very familiar, South Africa, there are legal academics serving at the highest level in the constitutional courts. It is something we might consider at a future date. My self-interest precludes me from saying anything further. Certainly, it is not a matter to be dealt with in this Bill as it is, clearly, a far bigger policy issue as colleagues, including Senator Sean D. Barrett, will appreciate. It would require a great deal of consideration before it could be introduced. However, I thank the Senator for proposing it. It is an interesting proposal which is certainly worthy of further consideration.</p>

          <p eId="para_189">I believe Senator Ivana Bacik would be eminently qualified for appointment as a member of the Judiciary. This is a very good amendment. My only concern is that practical experience should be included also. It should not be confined to somebody who has been an academic for 12 years but has not practised law. If one is to face the public as a judge, one should have experience of a court and dealing with the different difficulties that arise on a daily basis. Other than that, I have no difficulty with the proposition, in principle.</p>

        <speech by="#AodhanORiordan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_42">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T12:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_190">The purpose of the proposed new sections is to amend the law relating to judicial appointments but with only one dimension of the law considered, that is, making legal academics eligible for appointment as judges of all courts by extending to them the qualifying and eligibility provisions which currently apply to practising barristers and solicitors. Effectively, the amendments would equate a legal academic with barristers and solicitors who, subject to having the relevant practice experience, are eligible for appointment to all courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> The first amendment defines a "qualifying legal academic" as a member of the academic staff at the King's Inns, the Law Society, universities and other legal training institutions. The second amendment would make such legal academics eligible for appointment to the High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. The third amendment would make them eligible for appointment as temporary judges. The fourth would make them eligible for appointment to the Circuit Court; the fifth would make the same provision in respect of the District Court, while the sixth would have the effect of including such legal academics among those whom the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board may consider suitable as persons whose names could be submitted by it to the Minister under the appointments procedures set out under the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> The amendments, given that they deal with appointments as judges, are outside the scope of the Bill. The Government is conducting a wide-ranging review of all matters concerned with judicial appointments that will allow the necessary full assessment of all aspects of the issue. It is committed to bringing forward legislative reforms in this area and a judicial appointments Bill which is being prepared is the subject of a commitment in the agreed programme for Government. The subject of the amendments, that is, the eligibility of legal academics for judicial appointment, is one of a wide range of matters included within the scope of the review I have mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">Legislation in this area that might have regard to only one aspect of eligibility for judicial appointment is unlikely to complement the overall reform process needed in the area which is balanced and considered and which, as I have mentioned, the Government proposes to bring forward as soon as practicable. The question of appointing academic lawyers is not new. From time to time, calls have been made to tap into the deep academic experience and knowledge of professors of law and similar. Often, these are persons with a great level of expertise in particular areas of the law or who research the law extensively. They teach the subject and, in some cases, they have authored legal texts and engaged in public discourse on matters relating to the law. I am confident the merits or otherwise of such a measure will be fully explored in the context of the judicial appointments review I have mentioned. It was understood on launching the review and the public consultations that it would be worthwhile to consider opening up the eligibility criteria for appointment as a judge, perhaps in so far as the experience of academic lawyers is concerned, but perhaps also to reflect the depth of experience in other areas where great legal expertise is evident without the required practice experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> The consultation process last year reflected the fact the appointments system, including the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, while a model of best practice in its day needed reviewing almost 20 years after its establishment. Arising from the consultation process, draft legislative provisions to reform and update the judicial appointment procedures are being prepared by the Department as such legislation is part of the agreed programme for Government. The Minister has indicated that reforms will be brought forward in 2016. On this basis I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment in favour of fully comprehensive reform of the law in the area of judicial appointments as the amendment is outside the scope of the Bill. I undertake to refer the Senator's amendment to the Department for inclusion as a matter for consideration in the work of the review I have mentioned.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_198">
            <b>"Age of Retirement of District Court Judges</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_199"><b>2.</b> (1) The age of retirement of a judge of the District Court who holds office at the time of the coming into operation of this section shall be 70 years.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_200">(2) Section 72 of The Courts of Justice Act, 1924 is deleted.".</p>
          <p eId="para_201">This is with regard to the age of retirement of District Court judges. As the Minister is aware, the retirement age for a District Court judge is 65 years. For all other judges, it is 70 years of age. The appointment of District Court judges may be extended on a year by year basis by a committee consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General. If they think it appropriate, after consultation with the Minister for Justice and Equality, the judge can be given an extension of time until a maximum of 70 years of age. This process requires the District Court judge to provide a medical certificate for the committee and be interviewed by it annually from age 65 years to 70. Most judges are aged over 40 years on their appointment. They terminate their legal careers on appointment and qualify for a pension after 20 years of service. Somebody who is appointed in his or her 50s does not get the benefit of a full pension. The reason for this arrangement is unclear and it is now accepted that the process is embarrassing and rather odd to everybody concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> As the Minister of State is aware, the Council of Europe has established the Group of States against Corruption, GRECO. Ireland joined this group in 1999 and has been subject to four evaluations by it since. The fourth evaluation round relates to members of parliament, judges and prosecutors under various headings. With respect to the retirement age of District Court judges, GRECO noted:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_203">While Supreme Court, high court and circuit court judges retire at the age of 70, district court judges retire at 65. However, a district court judge may be continued in office for successive periods of one year until the age of 70, if allowed by a special warrant. The GET [GRECO evaluation team] heard criticism in respect of these differences which were described by some as an historical anomaly, heard no justifiable reasons for the discrepancy, and suggests that all judges be subject to the same retirement regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">All the amendment asks is that judges of the District Court be treated in the same way as other judges and have their retirement age extended to 70 years.</p>

          <p eId="para_205">My understanding of the amendment is that its desired effect is to standardise the retirement age of District Court judges with all other judges to a fixed retirement age of 70 years. I have been informed the Minister has been in consultation with the Judiciary on this matter and agrees the retirement age of District Court judges should be raised to 70 years, but I do not believe the amendment would achieve this or that any such amendment should be inserted in the Courts Bill 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> The position is that District Court judges are required to retire at 65 years of age and may, subject to annual review, be permitted to serve until age 70. Supreme Court judges, Court of Appeal judges, High Court judges and Circuit Court judges retire at the age of 70 years with some exceptions. These exceptions relate only to those serving judges who were judges before the reduction of the age of retirement from 72 years to 70 under the Court and Court Officers Act 1995. The relevant provisions include section 30 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 which provides that the age of retirement of a District Court judge shall be 65 years. Section 2 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act 1949 provides that a warrant may be made by a committee comprising the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General to allow a judge to continue in office for an additional year if the judge is not suffering from any disability which would render him or her unfit to continue to discharge efficiently the duties of the office. Subsequent warrants may be made to allow the judge to remain in office until he or she attains the age of 70 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> The Minister is inclined to agree that an annual review system for District Court judges between the ages of 65 and 70 years is, when compared to other judges, anomalous and unsatisfactory. There are no grounds for believing that all judges should not be subject to the same retirement regime. To this end, I have been informed that the Minister has instructed the Department to review the relevant statutory provisions and bring forward a comprehensive amendment at the earliest possible opportunity. I anticipate such provision can be brought forward early in 2016. Changing the retirement age to 70 years would require amending the sections I have mentioned. Amendment of other provisions may also be required, for example, to section 1 of the Courts (No. 2) Act 1988. This section makes provision for warrants to be made retrospectively. Additional provisions also require consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> There would be implications for the pension arrangements of judges arising from a change in the retirement age which would need to be carefully considered and the relevant scheme and pensions legislation are being considered. In this connection, I would be most reluctant to bring forward or accept any amendments in this area until all of the implications are fully assessed. As I have indicated, I anticipate this work, which is at an advanced stage, will be concluded in the near future. Section 72 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 was repealed by the provisions of the Court of Justice (District Court) Act 1946 which was, in turn, repealed and replaced by the provisions to which I have referred in the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> Apart from the technical difficulties to which the amendment gives rise and the fact the subject matter of the amendment is outside the scope of the Bill, the overriding position is that the substantive issue which the amendment seeks to address is the subject of review by the Department and relevant comprehensive measures are being prepared, while the administrative implications, for example, on pension matters are also being examined. I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment on the basis that its intention can be fully reflected in a comprehensive fully analysed set of provisions which, as I indicated, are in preparation.</p>

          <p eId="para_210">On this issue, the retirement age in Ireland must rise. As life expectancy increases, the pension burden to which the Minister of State referred will increase. That is why the troika recommended raising the retirement age. It is an acknowledgement of the way the world is going in that 70 is the new 50. People live longer; they live healthier lives and, particularly in the case of lawyers, in the constituency Senator Ivana Bacik and I represent, the saying would be that lawyers mature well and mathematicians peak when they are 25 years old or thereabouts.</p>

          <p eId="para_213">However, as lawyers probably improve with age, there would be nothing lost by keeping them there. Moreover, Senator John Crown always draws attention to how we have a very popular President and highly successful Minister for Finance, both of whom would be ineligible were any of these rules to be applied. They are highly successful people who are highly esteemed in society. In any case, there also is the general issue of age discrimination. Consequently, I am glad the Minister of State is reviewing this matter and Senator Diarmuid Wilson's amendment is important. It should be on the agenda and I understand there are discussions in the other House about abolishing compulsory retirement altogether, as it is age discrimination. It is an easy way to do it, whereby one can state that when a person has reached a certain age, he or she is out. Were one obliged to devise alternative measures as to whether they were capable of doing their duties, that would involve much larger human resources and personnel departments and perhaps disputes. However, having compulsory retirements is a rather blunt way to create vacancies for the next generation and to get rid of the present generation and they rapidly are becoming a thing of the past. I am delighted the Minister of State's Department is reviewing them.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">Having heard the Minister of State's response, I am delighted the principle is agreed. All Members are in agreement that it is anomalous that District Court judges retire at 65 years when other judges continue until they are 70 and that in practice, it is a yearly review procedure. I am glad to hear this is being addressed in other legislation. As Senator Sean D. Barrett noted, there are other more general proposals about retirement age. Yesterday, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality launched a unanimously agreed report about ending mandatory retirement age altogether. It is an excellent report and I urge colleagues to read it, as it again makes some of the points made here on this issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_215"> To conclude, it is true that at the Bar, in particular, and in the profession of solicitor, one sees people practising well beyond the standard age of retirement. One sees colleagues at the Bar who went into the barrister practice having retired from other professions, some of whom are practising into their 90s. It appears to be a career that is noted for longevity, but I am certainly glad to hear the principle is agreed.</p>

          <p eId="para_219">However, I have not been forced to retire. I acknowledge I am under threat of divorce unless I retire shortly. Therefore, I will be retiring. However, during the week I spoke about a man to whom I had spoken on Tuesday, which was his 99th birthday, namely, Dr. T. K. Whitaker, a famous former Member of this House for two terms. He also was Chairman of the Central Bank and Secretary General of the Department of Finance. This is a man who, at 99 years, is fluid, able to express himself and so on. He has been involved in many aspects of society in Ireland, but I refer to seeing someone at that age who is capable, competent and able to do all the interesting things he does at present. Consequently, I believe it is wrong to have a finish at 70 years. While people should have an option to finish at 70 years if they so wish, to insist on their finishing at 70 is not on. I had a large number of employees and when they came to the age of 65 years, one objective within the Superquinn company was to encourage them to stay on and come back, albeit perhaps not full-time. They often came back just for a few days or a few hours each week to train new people coming up. However, it impresses me when I go back into the company and meet people in their 70s who are highly competent. They could be bakers, butchers or something else. One lady who retired just last month was 88 years of age and she was well capable of doing the job. Consequently, I disagree entirely with the objective of insisting there must be a compulsory retirement age. While there certainly should be the ability to retire, it should not be compulsory and it should be possible to maintain one's job.</p>

          <p eId="para_220">I support my colleague, Senator Diarmuid Wilson, on the amendment he has tabled and have a question for the Minister of State on foot of his statement here. Is there a particular timeframe the Department has set by way of a review of this retirement age and of keeping it to 65 years? It unquestionably is anomalous when one has one cohort of judges who must retire at 65 years and then apply for a late retirement option. Members would be happier if they knew whether the review had started and by when it was intended to conclude. Senator Ivana Bacik mentioned the report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and I certainly will read it. I have a specific interest in this issue and the Minister of State and I also have discussed compulsory retirement in previous debates. The point also has been well made by Senators Sean D. Barrett and Diarmuid Wilson that people wish to work beyond the age of 65 years. The State pension has been moved to 68 years for most people and by the time any Member gets to retire, it probably will be 70 years-plus, given improved life expectancy. Can Members be provided with an indication as to the nature and the timeframe of the review? Has a deadline been set for publication of the review and where will it go from there?</p>

          <p eId="para_223">I move amendment No. 8:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_224">In page 3, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_225">
            <b>“Qualification of Judges</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_226"><b>2. </b>A judge of the District Court who has served as such a judge for a period of not less than 2 years shall be qualified for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal or the High Court.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Again, this amendment pertains to eligibility for appointment of a judge of the District Court to the High Court or to the superior courts. As all Members are aware, District Court judges have vast experience as they are the members of the Judiciary who hear the greatest volume of cases, including criminal, civil, family, child protection and care, licensing, firearms, regulatory and foreign evidence hearings among others. To be appointed to the District Court, a solicitor or barrister must have not less than ten years experience to be considered for appointment. Traditionally, solicitors were mainly appointed to the District Court but this has changed and now judges who qualified as solicitors have been appointed to the Circuit Court, the High Court and the Court of Appeal, as well as to the District Court. This has been effected under the Court and Court Officers Act 2002. Many District Court judges also are barristers.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> District Court judges, under section 20 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act, hold office by the same tenure as High Court and Supreme Court judges. The unusual position is that all legal professionals, either solicitor or barrister or Circuit Court judges, are eligible for appointment to the High Court. The only legal professional of similar standing and experience who is not so eligible is a District Court judge. In other words, a barrister or a solicitor can be appointed to the District Court and District Court judges, in turn, can be promoted to the Circuit Court. However, a District Court judge cannot be appointed from the District Court to the High Court or the Court of Criminal Appeal and I suggest this is completely unacceptable. It is not clear whether this was deliberate policy or an oversight that should be remedied.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> In modern times and internationally, it is accepted that the best practice for developing the Judiciary is to have promotion between the different courts. This is happening in Ireland of late in that judges from the District Court have been appointed to the Circuit Court and, likewise, judges from the Circuit Court have been appointed to the High Court and from the High Court to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. I refer back to the Group of States against Corruption, GRECO, in the context of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">Among other recommendations, it recommended in November 2013 that the current system for the selection, recruitment, promotion and transfer of judges be reviewed with a view to targeting appointments at the most qualified and suitable candidates in a transparent way without improper influence from the Executive or political power. I very much welcome that recommendation. </p>
          <p eId="para_231"> On the specific amendment, it is ridiculous that a person who has been appointed as a District Court judge is precluded from promotion to the High Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal or the Supreme Court. </p>

          <p eId="para_232">I agree with Senator Diarmuid Wilson on this issue. It does not make sense that a solicitor can be appointed directly to the High Court, as in the case of Mr. Justice Peart, but if the same solicitor had been appointed to the District Court one month previously, he or she could not have been appointed directly to the High Court. To the best of my knowledge, a solicitor must have ten years experience to be eligible for appointment to the Judiciary. I am not sure what the position is in the case of the Bar. This appears to be an oversight, unless it is the case that a shorter period of qualification is required before appointments can be made to the District Court. I am interested in hearing the response to Senator Diarmuid Wilson's query.</p>

        <speech by="#AodhanORiordan" eId="spk_60" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice_and_Equality">
          <from>Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_233">The desired effect of the amendment is to provide for the eligibility of District Court judges for appointment to the High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. I have been informed that the Minister has been in consultation with the Judiciary on this matter and is inclined to agree that District Court judges should be eligible for appointment beyond the Circuit Court. However, this is not an appropriate amendment and no such amendment should be inserted in the Courts Bill. Dealing with the District Court judge promotion question without more broadly addressing arguably equally pressing judicial appointments issues, as the Government is committed to doing under the agreed programme for Government, would be an unwise step. The Minister's preferred approach is to defer the issue for consideration in the context of wider reform of the law on appointments, a matter to which I will return.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> Section 5(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961, as inserted by section 4 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002 and relevant amendments in the Court of Appeal Act 2014, provides that a person shall be qualified for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the High Court if he or she is, for the time being, a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than 12 years standing who has practised as a barrister or solicitor for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately before such appointment. Section 5(2)(<i>c</i>) of the 1961 Act provides that a judge of the Circuit Court who has served as a judge for a period of not less than two years should be qualified for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the High Court. Therefore, such a judge is not precluded from consideration by the requirement that the person be a practising barrister or solicitor at the time of appointment to the higher courts. As there is no provision equivalent to section 5(2)(<i>c</i>) in respect of District Court judges, they cannot qualify for appointment to the higher courts as they were not considered to be practising at the time of appointment. A similar provision would, therefore, be required to make District Court judges eligible for appointment to courts higher than the Circuit Court. Transitional provisions and other consequential amendments may also be required. </p>
          <p eId="para_235"> I am aware that the Judiciary is of the view that District Court judges should be eligible for appointment to the High Court. As I have indicated, the Minister agrees with this view and careful consideration needs to be given to the question of whether District Court judges should be eligible for appointment to the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal. Judges of certain European and international courts are also eligible for appointment to the superior courts. For example, a person who, during the period of two years immediately before the appointment concerned, was a judge of the Court of Justice of the European Communities is eligible for appointment to the High Court or the Supreme Court. This provision also applies to a judge of the European Court of Human Rights, the International Criminal Court and certain other European and international courts. </p>
          <p eId="para_236"> The Minister accepts that there appears to be no good reason that, of all the various categories of judges, the only group specifically excluded from the possibility of appointment as a judge of the High Court or above are District Court judges. She has asked her Department to prepare relevant provisions to make District Court judges eligible for elevation to courts higher than the Circuit Court. However, this is being done in the context of a full, ongoing review of the entire system of judicial appointments. The Government is committed to introducing legislative reforms in this area and a judicial appointments Bill which is being prepared is a commitment in the agreed programme for Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_237"> The subject matter of the amendments, namely, the eligibility of District Court judges for judicial appointment, is one of a wide range of matters included in the scope of the review to which I referred. As part of this review, a consultation process on the system of judicial appointments was conducted in early 2014. There was a significant response to the call for submissions, with substantive and wide-ranging views received on the legislative framework that provides for eligibility for judicial appointments and the process of appointments. Legislation in this area which may have regard to only one aspect of eligibility for judicial appointments is unlikely to complement the overall reform process required in this area which must be balanced and considered and which, as I stated, the Government proposes to introduce as soon as is practical. On this basis, I ask the Senators to withdraw their amendment in favour of a fully comprehensive reform of the law in the area of judicial appointments which will include changes in the eligibility conditions for serving District Court judges. The amendment is outside the scope of the Bill. The position is similar to that on the previous amendment in that while it is sound in principle, the issue as stake is the mechanism by which the objective is to be achieved.</p>

          <p eId="para_238">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I do not agree the amendment is outside the scope of the Bill. This is courts legislation which proposes to increase by two the number of High Court judges who can be appointed. The amendment is relevant. It is a matter of whether the Minister of State is minded to accept it. It is unacceptable to suggest that because someone has been qualified as a solicitor or barrister for 12 years, he or she is more qualified to serve in the higher courts than somebody who has had a minimum of ten years experience as a solicitor or barrister and is thus eligible for appointment as a District Court judge. The amendment specifically provides that a judge of the District Court who has served as such a judge for a period of not less than two years would be qualified for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the High Court. It is specific in this regard. It is ridiculous to suggest, as I have interpreted the Minister of State's comments, that a solicitor or barrister with 12 years experience is more qualified than a District Court judge who has served in the court for a minimum period of two years. The Minister of State has provided an excuse for not accepting this reasonable amendment. I ask him to comment further.</p>

The Minister of State spoke about deferring the decision on this matter, which does not make sense, especially as he has admitted that there appears to be no good reason to preclude a District Court judge from appointment to a higher court. He referred twice to a commitment in the agreed programme for Government. Is he referring to the current programme for Government or were his comments based on an assumption that this matter will be taken further? The Government's programme has practically finished.</p>

There is time left in the legislative programme to allow an amended Bill to pass through the Dáil.

As Senator Diarmuid Wilson outlined in the amendment, "A judge of the District Court who has served as such a judge for a period of not less than 2 years shall be qualified for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal or the High Court".

          <p eId="para_254">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_255">In page 6, line 14, to delete “child pornography” and substitute “child sexual abuse material”.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">As set out during Second Stage in October, tackling child sexual abuse material on the Internet has been a consistent priority for me throughout my time in the Seanad. I firmly believe the proliferation of child sexual abuse material on the Internet is a stain on our moral conscience. A child sexual abuse image is a crime scene, a digital record of sexual abuse being perpetrated against a real child in the real world. I reiterate my disappointment that the decision was not taken to introduce a filtering system against online child sexual abuse material or to do so by statutory instrument. We continue to rely on the threat of this as a means to coerce ISPs into self-regulation and the Garda to develop a response.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> The term "child pornography", as defined under section 2 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, is the same term used in this Bill. We should take the opportunity to replace the term "child pornography" with the more apt and reflective descriptor "child sexual abuse material". I have tabled amendments to this effect. I appreciate that the word pornography which first appeared in the English dictionary in the mid-19th century and the use of pornography have until relatively recently been associated with salaciousness and taboo and contrary to the morals of respectable society. Pornography was secretive, shameful and unacceptable. Against this backdrop, the term "child pornography" makes much more sense but attitudes towards pornography have changed significantly over the years. Pornographic material can now be purchased openly in newsagents and petrol stations throughout the country, where it is stored on the top shelves. "Pornography" is no longer a dirty word and its use is no longer an underground practice. As such, I really do not believe the seriousness and repugnant nature of depictions of children being raped, of incest or children being sadistically assaulted or tortured for the sexual gratification of paedophiles is adequately captured by the term "child pornography". Furthermore, I believe the term is misleading regarding the child's role or agency in his or her exploitation. The majority of law enforcement agencies working in this area, most notably Interpol and Europol, agree. According to Interpol, the world's largest policing organisation:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_258">A sexual image of a child is “abuse” or “exploitation” and should never be described as “pornography”.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_259"> Pornography is a term used for adults engaging in consensual sexual acts distributed (mostly) legally to the general public for their sexual pleasure. Child abuse images are not. They involve children who cannot and would not consent and who are victims of a crime.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_260"> The child abuse images are documented evidence of a crime in progress – a child being sexually abused.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The Minister of State will be aware that I tabled an amendment similar to amendment No. 1 to the Children First Bill. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, agreed that the term "child pornography" is outdated and fails to reflect the full horror of sexual abuse involved. He stopped short of accepting my amendment on the basis that "child pornography" is still the language used in international instruments by which we are bound. He referred in particular to EU Directive 2011/93/EU which is to combat sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography and the Lanzarote convention of the Council of Europe. I am not sure, however, whether it is strictly necessary as a matter of law to use the exact same language as used in the convention and elsewhere provided we give robust effect to the substance of the measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> One of the methods of interpreting international treaties is the teleological or purposive approach which involves looking to the purpose of the international instrument and the broad intent motivating the enactment of the measure rather than its strict text. Notably, Article 41 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties states, "A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose". Given that international treaties usually apply to multiple countries in many different languages and legal traditions, an excessively literal approach is often unhelpful. By analogy, it is submitted that, provided we address the substance of the relevant international and supra-national measures and achieve, in substance, the outcomes laid out in these instruments, the precise language we use to achieve these aims would not be of primary concern to the relevant monitoring bodies. The Council of Europe and the European Union are unlikely to be troubled if we use different language to achieve substantially the same outcome as set out in the relevant instruments.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> The United Kingdom, our fellow European Union and Council of Europe partner, grappled with similar concerns over the inappropriateness and non-reflectiveness of the terms "child prostitution" and "child pornography". These are removed from its Sexual Offences Act 2003 through amendments in the Serious Crime Act 2015. The term for both phrases is now "sexual exploitation of a child".</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Incidentally, the practice of updating the language used in criminal statutes to reflect modern understanding is not unknown in Irish law. In section 2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990, for instance, the offence of indecent assault upon any male person and of indecent assault upon any female person are effectively renamed as "sexual assault". It states, "The offence of indecent assault upon any male person and the offence of indecent assault upon any female person shall be known as sexual assault". I have used similar language in this amendment, the broad impact being that what was formerly known as "child pornography" should henceforth be known as "child sexual abuse material". I believe it is a case of when and not if other jurisdictions will follow suit. I am aware of concerted lobbying efforts by groups such as ECPAT in the United Kingdom and at EU and international level to have these terms removed from the directives and the conventions. We can and we should act now. We need to show leadership. </p>
          <p eId="para_265"> I wish to clarify that the second subsection, as it were, that I included in this grouping of amendments is designed to avoid the risk of a trial collapsing because of an inadvertent reference to the existing terminology. I have tried to ensure we protect it. I believe we should be taking this approach.</p>

          <p eId="para_266">Senator Jillian van Turnhout has spoken on this issue previously in the Seanad. There is a great deal of sense in her point about the terminology used. It may not be possible to do it in this Bill and I accept that there are issues particularly around the international language used and particularly as the Bill is explicitly required to give effect to a directive on combatting sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. As the Senator said, there is an issue about the language used in EU and international treaties. We might look towards changing that culture where that language is used and rename it. I accept that would require a great deal of work in terms of education and so on, but it would be a good idea to rename it to reflect more accurately exactly what we are talking about.</p>

          <p eId="para_267">I have always admired Senator Jillian van Turnhout's commitment to children and addressing the damage being done to them. She has outlined in a cogent, effective and convincing manner, the reasons the Minister of State should take her amendments on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> We are living in a changing world. I am not sure that I totally agree with the reference to the fact that "pornography" has become muted or diluted. We all understand what pornography means, but in the context of children anything that would highlight to the general public, the awfulness of these crimes is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> I am concerned about a matter which the Minister of State might address in his response. The report Changing Policing in Ireland published during the week indicated that child pornography cases - let us use that term for the moment - are taking up to four years to be processed. That is scandalous. We, as a nation, cherish children and while we may not do it in the spirit of the 1916 Proclamation, we all have good intent in that regard and certainly where our own children are concerned, we will jealously guard and protect their rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> It is unacceptable that the judicial system, the legal system or the Garda system is inhibited to such a degree in this day and age. That is only one of many flaws or inadequacies in the technology that has been provided to the Garda. It is unacceptable. It is a severe criticism of the Government and of the Department of Justice and Equality that this has been allowed to fester and continue. Particularly in the context of the amendments, having changed the language, done everything right and put in the structures, when it comes to being effective in fighting against this pernicious crime or series of crimes, the Garda is operating with one hand tied behind its back in this modern technological age.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> The Taoiseach is constantly going around the world saying this is the best small country in the world in which to do business in and that it is modern and technologically advanced. I would not confine those remarks to the current Taoiseach but the previous Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, in trying to introduce electronic voting, said he was fed up with the idea of a country that was so modern - this was ten years ago - using pencil and paper to count votes. Therefore, it is nothing new. This supposedly modern reformist Government that was elected in 2011 has done nothing.</p>

          <p eId="para_272">I support the amendment. There was a discussion on the word "pornography". It comes from the Greeks who defined it as the writings of or about prostitutes and prostitution. It seems pornography is very widely accepted, apparently. I have not visited the petrol stations or the newsagents patronised by other Members of the House, or at least I have not seen this material openly on view, but I assume that they are correct in that it is. The phrase "child sexual abuse material" seems particularly appropriate in the light of the spread of pornographic, or sexually explicit or derogatory material on the Internet. Again, I have no personal direct knowledge of these things because I do not use a computer. I have never watched the Internet, if one can watch it and I do not know if one can. It seems to be something in the ether. I have never seen child sexual abuse material or child pornography, nor do I want to. It is pretty disgusting. For that reason, I strongly support Senator Jillian van Turnhout. She has done us a favour by raising this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> I understand from Senator Ivana Bacik that there may be some reasons in terms of the correlation between this law and international legal procedure that means we cannot do this, but I do not take that argument because I do not see why we should not lead the way. This country led the way in the marriage equality referendum. This was the first country in the world to vote this through on a national basis. I do not see any reason we should not lead the world again. Why should we be so backward in feeling we have to tie in with everybody else and that we have to use language that is not as explicit, that is not as clear and does not make the attitude of society as explicit simply because other countries have not yet caught up? We should be in the vanguard. We should be out front, leading proudly as Ireland, as a young progressive nation. I strongly support the substitution of "child sexual abuse material" for the phrase "child pornography".</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> People are now very chummy about pornography and seem to think it is a good thing and everybody openly discusses it on radio and television and all the rest of it. There seems to be something kind of warm and fuzzy and really sort of nice about pornography - there is the view that everybody does it and all this kind of stuff. Whatever about adults - I spoke on this many years ago in defence of people's access to explicit sexual material for learning purposes, instruction and titillation - I do not see anything wrong with it, but that is when it includes consenting adults. This is children and children are always in these circumstances the victims of exploitation. They are never consenting. They are never willing. They are frequently, I understand from reading about it, as I have never seen it, I would not watch it and I could not bear to watch it, abused physically, raped and, in some circumstances, I understand, even murdered for the pleasure of adults. It is really horrifying.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> The nice chumminess where one sits down after one's Sunday roast beef or roast lamb and says we will switch on the television and see pornography is a very different thing from child sexual abuse material. That terminology seems to get it, it focuses it and it makes it clearer. I commend Senator Jillian van Turnhout for her amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">I support Senator Jillian van Turnhout in tabling this amendment. The terminology "child sexual abuse material" is still not strong enough. As Senator Ivana Bacik said, there should be a stronger terminology. What that is I do not know, but perhaps it should be child rape and abuse or something like that. The horrific acts carried out on young children are unimaginable. Thankfully, I have never experienced the viewing of it, but I have spoken to professionals who, during the course of investigations, have had to look at it and they have been physically and mentally sick and disturbed as a result of it. It is totally unacceptable. If we could think of a stronger term to use than that proposed, we should use it.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">I support the amendment that every place in the Bill where the words "child pornography" are used, they would be substituted with the words "child sexual abuse material". Sadly, many young people do not know that child pornography is wrong. There is a normalising of pornography by society. It is the beginning of the ruination of many young people's lives. It is part of a grooming process being used and part of an acceptance culture. While the words may not be strong enough in the view of Senator Diarmuid Wilson, these are helpful words because they include the vital words "sexual abuse". I commend Senator Jillian van Turnhout for being perceptive in this area and identifying a useful change that I hope we all can support.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_280">I thank Senators for their comments. When debating the Bill, we all are united in our attempts to tackle this most heinous of crimes. The Senator refers to explicit material. There is a deliberate attempt among commercial enterprises to sexualise young people and children, to shorten their childhood and to make them aware of their sexual power above any other power. It is quite disturbing. It is something that must be addressed because it is completely disempowering and is warping the young minds of boys and girls as early as possible for commercial benefit in the "legitimate" commercial and corporate sphere. This is something we may be able to return to between now and Report Stage because I am taken by the comments that have been made. I will give the technical response, but perhaps this is something on which we can work.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> The effect of the amendments would be to substitute the term "child sexual abuse material" for "child pornography" throughout this Bill and other Acts in which it appears. As the Senator will be aware, the language used in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and this Bill reflects that contained in the EU directive to which the Bill, among other matters, is giving effect, as well as the Council of Europe Convention on Child Sexual Exploitation. It is also a term used in other EU instruments, including the Council decision to establish Europol. The amendments are proposed on the basis that the term "child sexual abuse material" more accurately reflects the horrific abuse involved and avoids the idea of some form of consent which may be implicit in the term "pornography".</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> In terms of the wording of the amendments put forward, there is a technical difficulty, which means that I would be unable to accept them. The term "child pornography" appears in the Statute Book outside the 1998 Act and any general amendment to that term throughout the Statute Book should be carefully made. I am advised that a general amending provision, as proposed by the Senator in amendment No. 25, would not suffice. Rather each provision in the Statute Book containing the term which it is proposed to amend should be individually identified. While it is not unusual to amend one form of words with another, it is done through individual identification of each instance. This is an important safeguard, particularly where the provisions relate to the criminal law.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> The amendments proposed also raise other technical difficulties such as the effect on the Short Title of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998. I am advised it is not appropriate to amend the Short Title of an existing Act by an amendment in subsequent legislation. The Act should be substituted and repealed.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> For these reasons, I am unable to accept the amendment on this occasion. The Minister would, however, fully support including the Senator's proposal in any future review of child pornography legislation. It is a technical reason. Perhaps we might look again to see if we can overcome this technical matter because the language the Senator has proposed is stronger and most likely to be more appropriate.</p>

This is not a case of if it will happen; it is when it will happen. It is about updating our laws to reflect the true seriousness of the crime. However, I withdraw the group of amendments. I want to get this right, but I also want to ensure we protect children and that we send a clear message that there is no consent, it is a crime scene, it is abhorrent and we will not tolerate it.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">The purpose of amendment No. 3 is to allow the court to impose a fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment on a person who is convicted on indictment of an offence under this section. A fine is already available as a penalty or part thereof for summary convictions under this section but was omitted in respect of convictions on indictment. It is unusual to provide for both a fine and a term of imprisonment in the available penalties, particularly where financial gain may be a motivation in the offence. This is consistent with the framing of other penalty provisions contained in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">My apologies for wanting to return to my earlier comments, but this Bill is as much about enforcement and here is a section dealing with fines. The report to which I referred and to which the Minister of State did not allude has indicated serious inadequacies in the manner in which child pornography crimes and sexual crimes against children are followed up. For example, there is no cybercrime unit in the Department of Justice and Equality. With respect to Senator David Norris's ignorance of the Internet, most of this awful traffic takes place on the Internet, yet there is no reference at all to what will happen following the enactment of a Bill which will include additional fines and more punitive measures against those perpetrating child pornography and child sexual crimes. The report which was not compiled by the Department but by Mr. Olson states quite clearly that we do not have a cybercrime unit in the Garda. I was gobsmacked when I read that.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> I would like some response. I am not trying to make a political point, but this is a serious issue involving the Garda and we are passing a law that will put extra pressure on Garda resources in specific areas relating to cybercrime and child pornography, much of which takes place on the Internet with paedophile rings, etc. I would like a response because it is the earliest opportunity this House has had to raise this matter, following the publication of the report. For the information of the Minister of State, the Leader of the House indicated that the House will debate this report in the new year. I am basing my questions on newspaper reports rather than on anything emanating from the Department. My understanding is that the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has accepted the report in its entirety, which I welcome, but perhaps the Minister of State has some insight. I appreciate it may not be his main area of responsibility, but in the context of this legislation, he might be able give some indication.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">With the Minister of State's amendment, we have ended up diluting what is in the Bill. Will he give us an explanation? The Bill, as published, stated, "on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years". We have diluted that to a fine or imprisonment. In other words, we are leaving it to the discretion of the Judiciary. I would be of a view that an offence under this section warrants mandatory imprisonment and it should not be discretionary.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The sexualisation of children is one matter, but the sexual exploitation of children is more serious. People should not be able to get away with a mere fine, which would not be related to the capacity to pay. It should be imprisonment, full stop. The term of imprisonment should be at the discretion of the judge. We should not remove mandatory imprisonment.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">I share the Senator's concerns. Reducing the punishment to a fine or imprisonment dilutes the sanction for such a serious and heinous crime. Imprisonment at least offers some rehabilitation. Any imprisonment for sexual offences should be matched with rehabilitation. To leave the penalty at a fine gives an option for the offender to go scot free. It is not at all adequate. We are either serious about penalising sexual offences, knowing the effects on victims, or we are not.</p>

          <p eId="para_292">This is standard legal practice, it is not unusual. To not do it would be an anomaly. The amendment is a standard framing of penalties in the State. A range of penalties are available for offences in the Bill and it is a standard in the drafting of penalties for offences. It is not in any way to suggest a fine in this area is an appropriate sentence, it is just the way that legislation in the State is framed across the Statute Book in every single circumstance.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> Reference was made to the report of the Garda Inspectorate.<i>
						</i>The office of Internet safety within the Department provides a hotline service for the reporting of crime and the Minister has completely accepted the report and is examining it in detail. The prosecuting of child pornography is a technically difficult type of investigation which can involve different jurisdictions, unnamed people and unnamed vulnerable victims. As it is Internet based, it is particularly difficult to prosecute. However, there have been a number of recent sexual exploitation cases which were successfully prosecuted. It is given the highest priority, but in order to execute a conviction one must have a proper, robust investigation. Unfortunately, that can take time because of the complex nature of the offence.</p>

          <p eId="para_294">I take the Minister of State's point that, in general, the option of "fine or imprisonment" applies right across all statutes. However, it is not universal within the Statute Book. If my memory serves me right there is mandatory imprisonment for offences regarding drug pushing. We have seen that sanction ignored by the Judiciary which, unfortunately, is a law unto itself when it comes to these issues and is not in any way accountable. In the past decade the Judiciary has successfully resisted the efforts of Administrations to establish a judicial council which operate in more progressive and democratic administrations. </p>
          <p eId="para_295"> We cannot compare the sexual exploitation of children which in many instances may have a lifelong impact on them with other offences on the Statute Book where this discretion is allowed. As legislators, we should collectively say this is an offence which is countenanced under no circumstances and that it is taken seriously. If a person engages in any way in this exploitation or encourages others, or engages in or encourages others to pay for or set up the exploitation - there is specific reference to the sexual exploitation of children - one pays the price. That price is imprisonment and the Judiciary would have discretion on the term of that imprisonment. A person who may be well off financially should not be able to get off purely by paying a fine. It might be a substantial fine but because of their own financial resources it would be insignificant to them and the sanction would be meaningless. This would not be acceptable and it is not prioritising the protection of children in the way that should be done. I feel strongly about this. I know that the amendment has gone through, but I appeal to the Minister of State to re-examine it in order that on Report Stage we could ensure this section reflected the graveness and seriousness of the offence of sexually exploiting children.</p>

          <p eId="para_296">I will be brief in the context of the Government's proposals. I am at a loss to understand why this is happening. I appreciate the Minister of State has outlined that this is standard across various pieces of legislation. However, I refer to what has been happening with our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, with some very high profile cases relating to child pornography and Operation Yewtree. During the 1970s Gary Glitter was an icon to children and his hit records at the time conveyed this. Under his real name, Mr. Paul Gadd he was as a paedophile jailed in the United Kingdom and the Far East. Several other high profile celebrities, when they went before the courts and were convicted of child pornography would have had, as Senator Jim Walsh said, massive financial resources and would have easily met a fine no matter how high. Mr. Rolf Harris was a case in point and he was jailed. This amendment is sending the wrong message. It is saying the people concerned have a possibility of getting off with a fine, no matter how heinous the crime.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">I know that in practice it is being left to the Judiciary to decide if it will be a fine or imprisonment, but as far as I am aware the amendment is changing the original sanction which was a mandatory jail term, unless the Minister of State can tell me otherwise. To delete "to the imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years" and substitute "to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both", means in plain English that the original version was imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years. Now it is changed and the Minister of State is not sending the right message at all. I do not know why this was drafted and why it went through the Cabinet considering all of the comments made in this House which would reflect the opinion of the population - that this is a heinous crime for which there will be no tolerance whatsoever.</p>

          <p eId="para_299">I believe we are all agreed that this is a heinous crime and it is good to see it being defined and laid out in such detail in this important Bill about the sexual exploitation of children and adults. However, I wish to inject a small note of reality into the debate. The amendment which has already passed without contest simply allows for a fine to be included alongside imprisonment. It is a technical amendment. When one looks at subsection (5), the subsection into which the amendment is being made, one sees that it provides for the sentencing in standard fashion - "a person shall be liable on summary conviction to a class A fine or imprisonment, not exceeding 12 months, or both". It is not a mandatory sentence. A summary conviction is in the District Court which is where fines are imposed in more cases than in the Circuit Court. It is at conviction on indictment where one sees the sanction of imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years. If a person is being prosecuted on indictment in the Circuit Court on an offence under section 3, they are more likely to be subjected to a term of imprisonment than if they are being prosecuted in the District Court where fines are already imposed. It is simply technical that the words "fine or imprisonment" are always included. One would very rarely have fines imposed by way of penalty where there is a conviction on indictment in the Circuit Court for an offence of this seriousness.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> I reassure colleagues that, as a matter of practice and reality, where one has an offence of this serious nature proceeding to prosecution on indictment, prison is the most likely outcome and much more likely than in the District Court. However, imprisonment is not mandatory in either case. The Bill uses the term "shall be liable". The point is that imprisonment is the maximum penalty.</p>

          <p eId="para_301">Section 3(6) provides that a child "means a person under the age of 18 years". In section 4, child "means a person under the age of 15 years" and section 5 defines a child as "a person under the age of 17 years". In the space of three consecutive sections, the word "child" has three different meanings, namely, a person aged 18, 17 and 15 years, respectively. This is completely inconsistent. Why dither with the description of a child? The Minister of State may live in one of Dublin's leafy suburbs but I live in the north inner city where if one called a person of 18 years a child, one would get what is locally described as a poke in the snot. A person of 18 years is not a child, as I understand the word. The matter would be resolved by removing the word "child" and inserting the phrase "a person under the age of" followed by the prescribed age. Why not define the age in absolute terms instead of having this glaring inconsistency?</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> The age of consent is a troubled and difficult issue, although I have always agreed with the idea of an age of consent as a guideline. In this Bill it is illustrated by the inclusion of three greatly different ages - 18, 17 and 15 years - to define the same thing, namely, a child. I assume that in respect of section 4, somebody who is aged more than 15 years is not a child. If somebody of 16 years is not a child in section 4, why should a person be a child until the age of 18 years for the purposes of section 3? This is completely daft, but I am a humble, ordinary person. Humility is one of my most remarkable attributes, of which I have a great number. </p>

          <p eId="para_305">The entire episode was utterly revolting and shocking. In his autobiography Jimmy Saville drew attention to the fact that he was molesting children. He was brazen in the extreme and it was shocking that he was not prosecuted at the time. Senators should consider the case of Cliff Richard who is a decent man as far as I know. While I have never met him, I have always liked him and his music and I approve of his Christian beliefs and so on. As part of Operation Yewtree, his home was invaded by police who did not tell him what they had told television broadcasters and the tabloid press. The police have since had to withdraw the allegations. In this case, a person who was innocent of the allegations had his name trawled through the mud by the police, which is utterly shocking. While I agree with the legitimate prosecution of these types of offence, which have correctly been described as heinous, a certain degree of sensitivity is required. It is profoundly shocking that in cases where persons were being pursued on suspicion or on the word of an unnamed third party whose anonymity was protected, police handed out information to the media before subsequently being forced to withdraw the allegations. While I do not expect the Minister of State to comment on that matter, I would appreciate a comment on the business involving the meaning of a "child".</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> Would it not be more logical to replace the word "child" in section 3 with the words "a person under the age of 18 years"? This phrase is perfectly clear and does not lead to the contradiction in the very next section in which a child is defined as a person under the age of 15 years. One could just as easily insert the phrase "a person under the age of 15 years". In section 5, one would then use the phrase "a person under the age of 17 years". That is the logical approach, rather than having this nonsense about children being of different ages all over the place.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">The Minister of State indicated that it is standard legal practice to provide for the imposition of a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years. However, the amendment changed the meaning of the original text which provided for a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years. Is the inclusion of that penalty not also standard practice?</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> I share the view expressed by previous speakers that we must ensure the penalty is a term of imprisonment and the imposition of a fine is not an option. The withdrawal of a person's freedom is the minimum that should be experienced by the perpetrator of this heinous crime. Victims groups are driven mad by the sentencing that involves fines. How many times, following the handing down of inappropriate sentences for serious sexual offences, have Senators argued that the punishment did not fit the crime? We are of one view on this issue. The Bill gives permission for fines to be imposed. I ask the Minister of State to revisit this issue. Why did the amendment reduce the sentence?</p>

          <p eId="para_313">If one views the section in its entirety, it is not about individual crimes, that is, one individual exploiting a child, but about group paedophilia. It is about obtaining, providing, etc., a child for the purpose of sexual exploitation in which money changes hands. The section refers to obtaining a child for himself, herself or another person and provides for a sentence "on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years". The amendment changed this by providing that such persons may be fined. The original text is clear and does not provide for the imposition of a fine or a term of imprisonment. I cannot understand the reason the provision is being diluted.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> I was very reluctant to go down the road Senator David Norris went down regarding Cliff Richard, but I concur with everything he said. I am a great fan of Cliff Richard whom I have met and believe what was done to him was outrageous. I did not want to go down this road because there is a case that is still unresolved and shows similar patterns much nearer to home. I refer to a person who has been accused in the public media without due process. My main focus in this matter is to ensure what the Minister of State is doing in the matter of convictions is the right thing and will not in any way allow people to get off.</p>

          <p eId="para_319">I do not wish to diminish the seriousness of the topic we are discussing. On the issue of fines and mandatory prison sentences, mandatory imprisonment is limited to a small number of offences, namely, certain drugs and firearms offences. The sexual exploitation of a child is addressed in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and carries a penalty of a life sentence. We are dealing today with an offence that is in part financially motivated. Therefore, the addition of a fine, as provided for in the amendment, is appropriate. It should be noted, however, that the amendment has been passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">It is a worthy debate, but we have work to do. </p>
          <p eId="para_321"> In terms of the sections, as outlined by Senator David Norris and on the apparent discrepancy in the definition of what constitutes a child, these are technical issues and relate to international law. Section 3 is an EU directive requirement and, therefore, the age is 18 years. Section 4 is a passive form of sexual assault and the age below which one cannot consent to an act which may amount to sexual assault is 15 years. Section 5 stipulates 17 years which reflects the age of consent in national law generally.</p>

          <p eId="para_322">I understand what the Minister of State is saying to the effect that we are bringing these things into alignment with international law. On the other hand, there is nothing to prevent him from taking out the word "child" and putting in "a person of such and such", which would remove the apparent contradiction. It does look like a contradiction. If in international law one has a situation where children are defined differently all over the place, that is absurd also. Why not call it absurdity? It is not just absurdity if it occurs in this jurisdiction. If it occurs throughout Europe, it is even more absurd that children are classed as being such at different ages, depending on what section of the law at which one looks. A child is a child is a child just as a rose is a rose is a rose. It seems to be utterly daft to have different definitions of what a child is in terms of his or her age. If in one section a child is somebody under the age of 15 years, how can it be that somebody under the age of 18 years is a child in the next section? It seems to be absurd. I am not going to push the matter, but it is absolute nonsense.</p>

          <from>Senator Jim Walsh<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_323">I thank the Minister of State for his reply and explanation but neither has fully reassured me. I can understand from where he is coming a little better. This section is about obtaining or providing a child for the purposes of sexual exploitation; therefore, there is an intent. I agree in terms of the section on summary convictions which would be dealt with in the District Court and I have not put forward fines as an alternative. However, if it is a conviction on indictment, obviously the matter has been regarded more seriously by the Garda and also by the Director of Public Prosecutions. Does it matter whether we take a view that we can depend on the Judiciary? I do not think it does. It comes down to what signal the Legislature sends to the Judiciary. Are we happy to send it legislation which says a fine is a satisfactory penalty or sanction for somebody who has obtained or endeavoured to obtain or who is providing a child for the purpose of sexual exploitation in circumstances where that is regarded a sufficiently serious offence to be subject to conviction on indictment? I certainly do not agree that it is sufficient. I accept what the Minister of State said about the section being passed. Unfortunately, I only spotted what we had done to the original text as I read the section. All I am asking is for the Minister of State to look at the matter. Will he give us an undertaking that he will look at the matter and come back to us on Report Stage when he has considered the points which we have made? Many people have spoken in favour of this point of view. From his comments, I do not think he has a fundamental objection with what has been said. I ask him to consider the matter between now and Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> The age of consent can be a difficult enough issue. I spent some time, probably ten years ago, on a children's committee. Two of the other members of that committee were the then Minister for Health and Children, the late Brian Lenihan, and the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr Michael McDowell. It was an all-party committee and I think the parties had their own legal representation. We took a strong view on the age of consent. One of the suggestions that came from the committee which the Minister of State might consider, if not in the context of this Bill then perhaps in terms of another is that where two senior adolescents, for example, 16 or 17 year olds, engage in sexual activity, they should be treated differently and perhaps the law should reflect this. I think the Judiciary probably does so. It is different from a situation where-----</p>

All I am asking is that the Minister of State, perhaps in this legislation or, if not, a future Bill, consider providing for a situation where a case involving somebody aged 40 or 50 years would be regarded more seriously. The committee recommended that if there was a ten-year age gap, the offence should be regarded more seriously. I wanted to share with everyone that which the committee to which I refer came up. Its findings might be something that might be looked at with regard to the age of consent, adding to what Senator David Norris said on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_329">I wish to comment on the definition of what constitutes a child. I believe different definitions are needed. Let us say two 17 year olds are doing a line. Section 4(1) states, "A person who, for sexual purposes, invites, induces, counsels or incites a child to touch". If a child, in that instance, is defined in the same manner as a child in an instance of paedophilia, that is different; therefore, we need a definition. The Minister of State should return to this matter because the legislation could deem all 17 year olds going out together to be criminals, particularly in the context of the phrase "inviting to touch". That is an issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_354">The issue in respect of age of consent is addressed in section 17. The proposed section 17 includes a new section 3(8) of the 2006 Act and provides for a proximity-of-age defence where a person is charged with an offence against a child between the ages of 15 and 17 years. It shall be a defence that where the child consented to the activity and the accused is younger or less than two years older than the child or the accused, he or she is not considered to be a person in authority or there is no intimidatory or exploitative element to the relationship. Effectively what I am saying is that the issue Senator Jim Walsh has raised is dealt with in section 17.</p>

          <p eId="para_356">Section 9 includes a new paragraph (a) with a definition of child pornography that includes any visual representation "that shows, or in the case of a document relates to, a person who is or is depicted as being a child". The reference to "the case of a document" seems a little odd to me. I presume this refers to a pornographic document. What happens in the case of Benny Hill dressing up as a child and engaging in frolics and so on? That is little nonsensical. In other words, what if we have someone who is an adult but dresses up in a pair of short trousers or a baby frock or whatever else, but he is plainly and obviously an adult? Is it really very significant to attack this kind of practice? It does not titillate me, I have to say, but it seems a little absurd. It is fine in the case of a person who is a child, but I am unsure about the provision for "a person who is depicted as being a child". It seems to be a little daft. Again, perhaps there is a cogent explanation.</p>

          <p eId="para_357">Article 2 of the EU directive obliges member states to define child pornography as: "any material that visually depicts a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct". In other words, it covers the case of any real depiction of a child. The definition also includes:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_358">Any depiction of the sexual organs of a child for primarily sexual purposes; or</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_371">“(c) a current or former step-parent of the child (‘step-parent’ shall include, for this purpose, a spouse, a civil partner (as defined by section 3 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010) or a cohabitant (as defined by section 172 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010) of the child’s parent),”.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">For the purposes of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006, a step-parent is treated as a person in authority. This means that he or she is subject to heightened maximum penalties on conviction of a sexual act with a stepchild. The traditional legal understanding of a step-parent has long been the spouse of a parent.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Notably, <i>Murdoch's Dictionary of Irish Law</i> defines "stepchild" as "a child of one spouse by a former union". Other legal sources suggest that a marriage is required to make a person a step-parent. For the specific purpose of tax law, however, the child of a civil partner is treated the same as the child of a spouse, but this is a result of a specific amendment to the Finance Acts 2011 and 2012. While the meaning of "step-parent" may well have evolved or evolve over time, it is not clear whether the civil partner or cohabitant of a parent is also a step-parent for the particular purpose we are discussing.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> While a civil partner or cohabitant is likely to be treated as a person in <i>loco parentis</i> and, thus, a person in authority for this purpose, I remain concerned, since any ambiguity in legislation must be read in the favour of the accused. For instance, a civil partner could claim that he or she was not a step-parent and potentially escape liability, in particular if the civil partner is not for some reason in <i>loco parentis</i>. Arguably, he or she should be treated as a step-parent, but the point is unclear and the legislation would benefit from a wide definition of "step-parent" or a clear statement from the Minister of State that it was his intention that a current or former spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of a child's parent was a step-parent and, thus, a person in authority for the purposes of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_375">I endorse Senator Jillian van Turnhout's comments. The scientific research on all family types done in this regard shows that, by a significant degree, the highest at-risk situation for children is where a single mother cohabits. In such situations the child is substantially at risk of sexual exploitation and physical and fatal injury. It would be essential not to permit a lacuna in the law regarding such situations, as that would be to exclude the situation in which someone would be most at-risk.</p>

          <p eId="para_376">I am in sympathy with what Senator Jillian van Turnhout stated, as it is revolting that someone in a position of authority should exploit a child for sexual purposes. However, it strikes me that paragraph (d) covers this matter adequately. It reads, "a current or former partner of a parent of the child". As such, the amendment is redundant and I see no necessity for it. I would, however, be interested in hearing the Minister of State on this point.</p>

          <p eId="para_377">I have sympathy with the Senator's amendment. The evidence is that a great deal of the sexual abuse of children occurs within the family setting. This has been noted for a long time and was one of the bases on which the Stay Safe programme was introduced in the early 1990s. It is abuse in the most trusted of settings. I do not know what the legislation can do to prevent it. We have always addressed it from the point of view of empowering the child to know when there have been inappropriate approaches and touches, but it also depends on the culture of the family. Any legislative measure that we can put in place to protect the child or punish the offender is welcome, but, unfortunately, it is often too late for the child, as the offence has already taken place. This forms part of a wider discussion on the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_384"> There have been a number of calls, including from organisations associated with the Turn Off the Red Light campaign, for the removal of those selling sexual services from these offences. The effect of such a change will be that only those people who solicit the sexual services of others, that is, the buyers and pimps, will be prosecuted for the solicitation and loitering offences under the 1993 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> The primary rationale for decriminalising the sale of sexual services is that those offering the services involved in prostitution are highly vulnerable, often from impoverished backgrounds and frequently with addiction and other issues. It is often the case that those involved in on-street prostitution are among the most vulnerable and marginalised within an already vulnerable group. Retaining criminalisation for solicitation is to penalise this high-risk group. Decriminalisation will also allow people to report violence experienced on the street without fear of prosecution and encourage them to seek appropriate support services. The decriminalisation of on-street prostitution will bring the Irish approach further into line with that of Northern Ireland and the Nordic approach generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> Amendment No. 26 deletes the current paragraph (a), which reads, "offers his or her services as a prostitute to another person", from the definition of "solicits or importunes for the purposes of prostitution" in section 1(2) of the 1993 Act. The effect of the amendment is to remove the persons offering sexual services from the offences under sections 7 and 8 of that Act of soliciting and loitering, respectively, in a public place for the purposes of prostitution. These offences will still apply to any person who solicits a prostitute, that is, the buyer or pimp, or any person who loiters in a public place for the purpose of soliciting a prostitute.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> The inclusion of this amendment by itself gives rise to concerns that the Garda would be left with no means of combating any public nuisance if sexual offences were to be offered, for example, in a residential area. There is also a concern that the provision could be exploited by criminal gangs or others. Amendment No. 30 addresses these concerns. Section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 provides that a garda may direct a person who is behaving in certain ways, for example, intoxicated, threatening or abusive, to stop behaving in that way or immediately leave the specific area. It is an offence under section 8 to fail to follow such a direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">This amendment will add loitering for the purpose of offering services as a prostitute to the behaviours subject to a direction under section 8. The effect of the proposed amendments will be that on-street prostitution will not itself be an offence, but the Garda will still have the power to move on from a public place when necessary a person or persons offering sexual services. The remaining amendments in this group have been proposed by Senators and I will respond to them after they have been moved.</p>

          <p eId="para_389">I welcome the Government's amendment. Our amendments were trying to achieve the same end. There has been a very long campaign to ensure we could decriminalise those who sell sexual services and I commend the people in the Visitors Gallery who have been campaigning on this issue for a very long time. The Turn Off the Red Light campaign has been very effective and very important because it has long been the case that many women have found themselves in the position of being turned into criminals in situations where they have been virtually powerless. In the light of the Government amendment which obviously crossed with us tabling amendments, we will not be pressing our amendments. We are achieving the same aim and I welcome the statement of the Minister of State.</p>

          <p eId="para_390">I welcome amendment No. 26 which the Minister had flagged on Second Stage and which was requested by the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. I also welcome those in the Visitors Gallery who have been involved in moving forward this law reform, particularly the Immigrant Council of Ireland, Ruhama and the Turn Off the Red Light campaign. We debated the policy behind the provisions of sections 20 and 21 on Second Stage and they are very welcome to target demand and to criminalise the purchase but not the sale of sexual services. I see amendment No. 26 as very important in confirming that policy because, as the Minister of State said, it will decriminalise services as a prostitute by making that amendment to section 1 of the 1993 Act. That is very important. As the Minister said, it will bring this jurisdiction into line with the law in Northern Ireland and in Sweden and other Nordic countries that have taken a similar approach to tackling demand. To stress it again, the women and men engaged in prostitution and the sale of sexual services will be themselves decriminalised. Sometimes those who criticise the Nordic approach have suggested this is all about criminalising clients. Offences around the purchase of sex are already criminalised.</p>

          <p eId="para_392">This approach decriminalises those engaged in prostitution, recognising the exploitation involved. In this regard, I understand why amendment No. 30 has been included. I have some concern that it may lead to harassment on the street of those engaged in selling sexual services, those women and men engaged in prostitution. While I understand that, as the Minister of State said, it does not criminalise prostitution which is now decriminalised, it does provide for the offence of failure to move on when directed to do so and specifically with reference to somebody who is loitering for the purpose of prostitution. I ask that some attention might be paid to this if we are going to put that amendment through. I understand the public order issue, but we might look at guidelines for An Garda Síochána as to how it operates that provision. Those of us from the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality who travelled to Sweden and heard about how the law there is implemented were very impressed by the multi-agency approach and by the exit strategies with which the police and social services were all engaged. It was not just criminal justice.</p>

          <p eId="para_394">It is, therefore, very important there be joined-up thinking and that the Garda not, on the one hand, be given a directive that it should be moving on women or men involved in selling sex on the street and, on the other hand, trying to work with them to ensure the criminalisation of clients and pimps. We need to be careful about this. I very much welcome amendment No. 26. It is welcome and very much in line with the request of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. Perhaps the Minister of State might consider putting forward an amendment to section 13 of the 1993 Act on Report Stage in line with the overall policy objective of section 20. That would be to extend to section 7A, the new offence inserted by section 20 of the Bill, the power of arrest already present for section 7 offences. It is a power of arrest contingent on the new offence in section 7A-----</p>

          <p eId="para_397">I welcome the people from the Turn Off the Red Light campaign. I completely oppose their position and suspect their motivation. The information supply has been disastrous. Senator Ivana Bacik spoke about social workers in Sweden. Attempts were made to silence a considerable number of social workers in Sweden who have spoken out and given statements contradicting the position of the Turn Off the Red Light campaign. There is something incredibly patronising about people defining somebody as a victim, despite that they do not feel they are a victim. They have no right to say they are not a victim. I welcome the Cathaoirleach's guidance on the matter. As I am opposing the section, I presume I do not speak until it comes up for discussion.</p>

          <p eId="para_400">This is a momentous day and I hope we pass the Bill. It would be nice to have unanimity on it. I welcome the amendment. The women and young girls who comprise most of those involved in prostitution are vulnerable, marginalised and poor. I appreciate the work done and the information shared with us by Ruhama, the Turn Off the Red Light campaign and the HSE. They speak about the frame of mind women who have had to engage in prostitution to survive have to get into to go through these acts. On exiting it, for those who have been able to do so, one of the quotes was "It was a shit life". When that is the only way a person has to survive, it may be seen as consent, but I would question consent under that type of pressure. There is no such thing as safe prostitution. Sometimes people are battered to death, in the words of one rape crisis volunteer. The HSE has reported on the gang rape of women. The Internet is not helping. Prostitution is gender-based violence against women. We are right to take an ethical stance against buying another person, because that is what we are talking about. This is an exploitation issue. There are no safety or labour laws in the prostitution context. The Netherlands has tried and failed for ten years. The profits, on the other hand, are extraordinary. I read a quote from one young woman who said she did not have to pay any more than 50% to her pimp. One wonders who has to put up with all the pain and who gets all the gain. The hands of the Garda have been tied. That came out in the "Prime Time Investigates" programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> Is the Swedish model enough? I would say it is a start. It is welcome that it makes it an offence for someone to purchase sex, but it is not the full solution for the woman who may be vulnerable and poor. We need very solid exit strategies and supports to help women rebuild their lives. It came across very well at a briefing we had in the audiovisual room recently that we had to bridge them into a new life. They have to be given holistic, psychological and financial support. One cannot leave people high and dry and on the breadline. They are also vulnerable to being enticed back. The best approach - there was consensus about this - is a more victim-centred one and the Garda would have to be trained and supported in that role. It needs support in legislation. Will the Minister of State say what extra Garda resources will be put into this?</p>

          <p eId="para_406"> I would like to flag another issue. Some of the women involved in prostitution have been trafficked here. Some of them do not have a visa status that supports them working here. If they make a report to the Garda, can we ensure they will not be criminalised for their visa status? Can we ensure the primary issue will be the health and well-being of the woman or man who involved in prostitution and wants to get out of it? A very important balance needs to be struck within a competing set of rights. We might come back to that point. </p>
          <p eId="para_407"> I welcome this legislation.

          <p eId="para_408">I welcome any move which deals with the exploitation of vulnerable people. The people in question are women in the main, although some are men. I welcome any protection given to those who are trafficked, in particular. It is extraordinary that in this day and age we have moved back to a slavery trade that is probably more extensive than it has been at any time in history. It is appalling that this trade is even more extensive than it was in the 19th century. It has not been addressed by the international community as comprehensively and energetically as it needs to be. Anything that protects the women involved, in particular, is essential and I welcome it. I also welcome the steps being taken to protect women who are vulnerable by reason of drug addiction. The Minister of State has taken the particularly strong line that the criminal system is not the way to deal with drug addiction and the crime that flows consequently from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> It is a mistake to say everybody involved in prostitution is being exploited or vulnerable. All the reports clearly show that a coterie of women participate in high-class escort agencies and charge very high fees for the sexual services they offer. I do not know to what extent this is the case. I agree with Senator David Norris that it is absurd that the purchaser is guilty of a criminal offence but the women who are selling the sex - it is a very lucrative business as far as they are concerned - are not guilty of such an offence. The Minister of State should look at that issue again. There is a danger associated with the manner in which this is being done. It is contingent on men, in the main, responding to the fact that they will be prosecuted criminally for what they do. That may not have the deterring effect that the Minister of State might expect or that any of us might expect. There are many laws on the books that are ignored by people.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> I am concerned about vulnerable women, in particular. Some Senators referred to poor women who had resorted to prostitution as a means of getting some money. Poverty drives people into the sex trade. I am not sure the construction of this legislation will not have the opposite effect of increasing the number of women who participate in prostitution. That would be of some concern to me. I lived in an era when almost everybody was poor. We had nothing like the levels of crime we have today.</p>

I am not speaking about those who do it out of financial necessity, because they are addicted to drugs, because they are being trafficked or because their pimps - boyfriends, in many instances - are forcing them to do it. It is absurd, as Senator David Norris said, that women would not be subject to a criminal offence in circumstances in which none of those things applied.</p>

The Minister and I have deliberated on the matter with various interest groups in this area. The Swedish approach comes from a Parliament that is 45% female. The issue of gender equality in parliamentary representation is an important one. We should think about that when we discuss the issue of gender quotas also.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> I accept Senator Ivana Bacik's well made point that we cannot take legislation from another jurisdiction without resourcing and funding it, providing for a process of training with regard to it and discussing with the Garda and others how it will be managed and how it will come into effect.

          <p eId="para_433">In this amendment we are attempting to decriminalise these individuals to ensure they know they can approach the authorities, that help and support are available to them and that they are not criminals by virtue of having been lured or forced into the industry. The great majority of those involved in it are involved in it for reasons of poverty or addiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The amendment criminalises the buyer, which is an appropriate response. That enables the Garda to tackle the issue properly in a proactive and realistic fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> I thank the Senators who have spoken about this issue. While I appreciate that people have come to it with different perspectives, the issue of prostitution is one that has been with us for a very long time. To suggest we continue to approach it as we always have does not stand up to scrutiny any more. There are movements across the world to address the issue differently. The Swedish and Northern Irish approaches are being adopted here. As Senator Fidelma Healy Eames said, this is a good day.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">It is disingenuous of the Minister of State to try to give the impression that anybody suggested prostitution was a glorious career. Nobody I heard in the Chamber suggested that. Perhaps it is because he does not have a better argument to defend against the point that was being made to him, which he ignored. I support fully the view that a majority of women who decide to resort to prostitution are very vulnerable, often due to financial necessity, drug addiction, or human trafficking, which is heinous. However, there is a coterie of women for whom it is a choice. Anybody who has watched this on various programmes internationally or here, or who has read reports on it, knows that there are women who make considerable money from it and it is a choice. While I agree fully with criminalising and charging the purchasers right across the board, that coterie who do it as a choice and do not have the defence of being drug addicts, trafficked, pimped or coerced should face the same rigours of the law as the men. It can be the converse, too. It can be a gender-neutral situation because there are male prostitutes also. In those scenarios, it is wrong that one party participating is being charged with a criminal offence, while the other person is regarded as immune from any criminal prosecution. That is fundamentally wrong and borders on sexism.</p>

          <p eId="para_448">Our effort in order to tackle demand is to criminalise the purchaser and decriminalise the seller in an attempt to ensure the vulnerable seller of sexual services feels society takes a compassionate view of the situations in which they find themselves, that support services will be available to them, that they can approach gardaí without fear of criminal sanction, that they can find a pathway out of prostitution and that the resources of An Garda Síochána and the criminal justice system are channelled and funnelled toward the demand side of the equation. That is the purpose of the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_449">I am <i>ad idem</i> with the Minister of State on reducing the level of prostitution and agree fully that one of the ways to do so is to tackle demand. However, the point I make is that if he is really serious about reducing it, why not tackle the supply side also where it is not being produced by women who are vulnerable in any of the categories I mentioned? There are women who do it as a career because it is very profitable. Why not take the same approach to them? I see no good reason the Minister of State would not. I do not disagree with tackling the demand side because he is correct, but for those who participate very willingly, have no qualms with regard to doing it, find it highly profitable and are not in any of the vulnerable categories that all of us would want to protect and not criminalise, why do we not make a distinction? That is the point I am making.</p>

          <p eId="para_450">The Minister of State talks about demand and supply as if this was simply an economic situation, which it is not. Taking at a superficial level the question of tackling demand, there is nothing whatever to suggest demand has decreased as a result of this measure. Any purported statement that this is the situation have been completely undermined by Swedish academics. When the Minister of State was talking, I said: "What about prohibition? Did that work?" Worse than that, the Minister of State is not even suggesting prohibition. He is suggesting decriminalising the bootleggers and criminalising the drinkers. It is completely daft. I will have a great deal more to say about this when we get to discuss the section.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryMWhite" eId="spk_212">
          <from>Senator Mary M. White<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_451">I move amendment No. 29:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_452">In page 17, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_453">“(3) The Minister shall collect data to review the operation of this offence and report to the Houses of the Oireachtas after this offence has been in effect for two years. In particular the report shall set out—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_454">(a) information on the nature and extent of prostitution connected to human trafficking including numbers of arrests and convictions during the period covered by the report in connection with an offence under this section or section 2, 4 or 5 of the Criminal Law(Human Trafficking) Act 2008,</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_455">(b) the extent to which, in the opinion of the Minister, this section has operated to reduce human trafficking, and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_456">(c) the impact of this section on the safety and well-being of prostitutes”.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">My amendment would require section 20 of the Bill criminalising the purchase of sex to be reviewed and voted on again after two years by the Oireachtas. It is a very reasonable suggestion and, if it believes the law will result in a reduction in the number of people engaged in sex work and incidences of trafficking for sexual exploitation, I cannot see why the Government would oppose assessing its effectiveness in two years time. According to Amnesty International, the criminalisation of sex work is increasingly being recognised as a human rights concern. The United Nations special rapporteur on the right to health has called explicitly for the decriminalisation of sex work. The final report of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, an independent body convened by the UN Development Programme on behalf of the joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS, has made the same call. The commission deliberated over a two-year period, undertaking extensive analysis and research including seven regional dialogues on the links between legal frameworks, human rights and HIV.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> Sex Workers Alliance Ireland, represented in the Visitors Gallery by Ms Kate McGrew, suggests two years would give an accurate picture of the impact of the legislation to assess it adequately. We must allow time for gardaí to be issued with guidelines on enforcement. A two-year period would provide the Garda with enough time to establish enforcement and the Government to commission an independent evaluation. There is zero evidence from Sweden that sex work has decreased since the introduction of the criminalisation of the purchase of sex, as there has been no consistent monitoring, independent research or evaluation of the legislation there. The Swedish Government's report evaluating criminalisation between 1999 and 2008 provided no data or evidence to prove that the levels of sex work had decreased or increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The report stated: “Altogether, this means that we can feel somewhat secure in the conclusion that prostitution as a whole has at least not increased in Sweden since 1999”. No data or evidence is provided to back up the statement in any way. As a result, the report is highly questionable. This is a highly complex policy area. We must ensure Ireland does not make the same mistake as Sweden and fail to monitor the outcomes and impacts of our laws adequately. That is why I propose the amendment to insert an operational review of section 20 into the Bill to ensure we have consistent, independent evaluation of this and other legislation related to sex work at regular intervals.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> Sex workers tell us that where this law is implemented it makes their lives more difficult and they often have very poor relationships with the police and support services. HIV Ireland and the World Health Organization, WHO, have expressed serious concerns about the impact of such measures on health care access and HIV rates. Ireland's HIV rate increased by 11% last year. This is very serious and we need to do more to reduce HIV rates, not introduce laws which increase HIV rates, according to research by <i>The Lancet</i> and the WHO. We need this review of the legislation to ensure we monitor and assess the impact the law will have on health. It is a nonsense to criminalise the purchase of sex. It is a coalition between extreme feminists and right-wing fundamentalists. I am entitled to my opinion.</p>

          <p eId="para_486">The justice committee turned its face against considerable evidence. The document, Research into Prostitution in Northern Ireland, prepared at the request of the Northern Ireland Department of Justice, is unequivocal, and the justice committee did not mention it. The objective, scientific realities were completely ignored. The Chairman of the justice committee, Deputy David Stanton, put a notice on his website fully endorsing the Swedish model before the committee had heard any evidence. This shows how open-minded he was. Senator Ivana Bacik is right that the committee does not represent a diverse group of opinion. That is the problem with it. All members are singing from the same hymn sheet.</p>

          <p eId="para_498">What have we got to be afraid of in a review of the operation of the legislation? The Minister of State does not want to know the facts. He has turned his face against them. The amendment provides that the Minister shall collect data to review the operation of this offence and report to the Houses of the Oireachtas. What is wrong with it? It is good parliamentary procedure. The Minister's report would include information on the nature and extent of prostitution connected to human trafficking. There has been a blurring of the division between prostitution and trafficking. It is a disgrace. It is a marketing exercise and a PR stunt by people who are radical feminists and ex-nuns. Some of them should be ashamed of themselves, given that they come from the order that operated the Magdalen laundries and are still trying to control people. The amendment provides that the Minister's report would include the extent to which, in the opinion of the Minister, the section has operated to reduce human trafficking. The Minister of State does not even want to know whether it will reduce trafficking. What is he afraid of? He is afraid of the truth, reality, objective facts on the ground. He will not face them. The amendment provides that the Minister also report on the impact of the section on the safety and well-being of prostitutes. All this humbug about talking to the women is all tripe if the Minister of State is not interested in their well-being. If he were really interested, he would want to know the impact on them. Of the women spoken to for the report commissioned by the Northern Ireland Assembly, 98% were against this model. The Minister of State does not speak on behalf of these people. I attended the briefing session and it was laughable. There were people there who were interpreting the minds of these women and speaking on their behalf with no permission to do so. Unless the Minister of State accepts the amendment, his hypocrisy is completely exposed. He does not give a damn about the safety and well-being of the women who are walking the streets and the spread of disease. It is all a middle-class pretence and a load of hypocrisy.</p>

          <p eId="para_512">It is looking for information on the nature and extent of prostitution connected to human trafficking, including the numbers of arrests and convictions during the period of the first two years. That is a matter in which every Member of this House should be interested. The second point looks for the extent to which, in the opinion of the Minister, this section has operated to reduce human trafficking. That is important because I presume one of the main objectives of the legislation is to reduce prostitution and, therefore, human trafficking and sex slavery. The third item is the impact of the section on the safety and well-being of prostitutes. Senator David Norris is correct in saying these requests for information are a barometer, or litmus test, of the genuineness of the legislation and the motivation behind it. I am not querying the motivation behind the legislation, but I accept that it is genuine. If it is genuine, I see no reason whatsoever the amendment would not be accepted and endorsed by the Minister of State. It would add to what has been stated as being the purpose of the Bill. It would provide for a check in order that the Department and Garda offices would be accountable. I hope the Minister of State will have no difficulty in accepting this and I divorce the amendment from the manner in which it was introduced. I do not agree with the comments made when the amendment was introduced, but I do agree with its wording and intent.</p>

I have only listed a number of organisations, but they should not be dismissed as having any motive apart from what is best for those who find themselves in a very vulnerable postion. </p>
          <p eId="para_530"> The amendment inserts a review provision into the Bill in respect of one section only, namely, section 20, which criminalises the purchase of sexual services. I assure the Senator that all the provisions in the Bill which, in addition to dealing with the exploitation associated with prostitution, address the sexual exploitation of children and protections for victims in the criminal process will be kept under continuous review. While I appreciate that there is a similar provision in the Northern Ireland legislation, the provisions in this Bill are too important not to be fully and properly implemented and I have no doubt it will be kept under review, with or without the proposed amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> It is also the case that the information sought should be available on request at any time without the need for a future review provision. Given the considerable debate on these provisions, I fully expect the information to be sought from my Department well in advance of a two-year review. In so far as the amendment sets out particular matters to be reviewed, since 2009 the anti-human trafficking unit of my Department has been providing annual reports on trafficking in human beings in Ireland. These annual reports are available on a dedicated anti-human trafficking website <i>blueblindfold.gov.ie</i>. Information on the extent of prostitution offences is available from the CSO and is regularly published.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> I certainly expect issues impacting negatively on the safety and well-being of prostitutes to be addressed as they arise, but, as I have said and while there has been much discourse and narrative on this point, there is no substantive evidence showing a negative impact on the safety of those who provide sexual services in those jurisdictions where a similar approach has been implemented.</p>

The Departments are not so proactive in monitoring what goes on in matters immediately under their control, not to mention previous legislation, which would probably be an impossible task. This is a specific request with regard to the issue of human trafficking and the Minister of State is doing himself an injustice.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">He is exposing himself to giving credibility to some of the criticism that has been directed at him as to the motivation behind this. This is a very simple amendment. It would ensure that within two years - it would not be at the Minister's discretion, as it would be mandatory - such a report would be published on what are very germane matters concerning the outcomes of the legislation we are passing today.

          <p eId="para_539">I might not go that far, but as somebody who has shown some degree of ingenuity in the responsibilities he holds, the Minister of State should clearly exercise his right to accept the amendment. Too many Ministers of State who come to this House do not have any discretion, look over their shoulders for guidance and do not accept amendments. What distinguishes the good Ministers from the routine or run-of-the-mill Ministers is that they will exercise discretion in the House by accepting amendments that are sensible and enhance the legislation. That is the purpose of the amendment.</p>

I challenge the Minister of State to provide information on the precise page and line number in the Bill where this review is indicated. I do not believe it is available, but if the Minister of State can direct me to it, I will withdraw my allegation. Again, it is astonishing that he would turn his face against the collection of data and information on the nature and extent of prostitution connected with trafficking, the extent to which this is operated to reduce human trafficking and the impact of the section on the well-being of prostitutes. He might well say the legislation in its entirety is subject to review, but that is not stated in the Bill. That is a general piece of waffle. Will the Minister of State be kind enough to show me the precise page and line where a review of this legislation, in whole or in part, is provided for, because I do not see it?</p>

          <p eId="para_567">On his own bladder be it.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> To challenge the question of the Swedish experience, I quote from a report of the Norwegian Ministry of Justice: "The Swedish street prostitutes experience a tougher time". That is the evidence. The Minister of State asked if there was evidence and said there was none. I have it with me. It is an official report from the Norwegian Ministry of Justice. It continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_569">They are more frequently exposed to dangerous clients, while the serious clients are afraid of being arrested. Prohibition will never be able to stop the purchase and sale of sex. It could only make conditions worse for the prostitutes. They have less time to assess the client as the deal takes place very hurriedly due to fear on the part of the client. [The prostitutes] are exposed to violence and sexually transmitted diseases. If the client demands unprotected sex, many of the prostitutes cannot afford to say no. Harassment by the police has increased and the clients no longer provide tip-offs about pimps, for fear of being arrested themselves. The social workers working on the streets have problems reaching them. [The prostitutes] use pimps for protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">In further support of this, I will quote from an interview in 2010 with a senior adviser regarding prostitution of the National Board of Health and Welfare of Sweden:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_571">[You] put [them] in the same category, and you say that well, ultimately, it's all the same, it doesn't matter if you make €5,000 a month, you sell sex without intermediaries, independently ... you're in the same position as someone who is forced by third parties to, somebody who's underage and forced by third parties....</p>
          <p eId="para_572">In other words, there is a complete blurring of the situation. I offer another quote from a social worker in Malmö's prostitution unit:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_573">... [You are] not [included in the debate] unless you are a former sex [worker]. Or a former client [...]. If you ... give a picture [that's] painted in many colours, it's not okay. If you paint in black, it's okay. You can be listened to.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The senior adviser at the National Board of Health and Welfare for issues surrounding prostitution noted during an interview that a political consensus was formed by silencing discursive opposition, where Gunilla Ekberg and radical feminists working for the Social Democratic Women "really made an effort to control what people were saying, and then they, of course, did not invite those who were blacklisted, or on their shit list, they did not invite them to meetings, and of course you understood that your agency could not be considered for government grants ...". What is that if it is not bullying? Threatening to take away grants if one expresses a different opinion is a wonderful exercise in democracy. To quote an interview with a social worker in the Malmö prostitution unit in 2010:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_575">...everyone must be on board. If you're not, if you say something bad about [the discourse], then you're against the whole law, you're against the whole thing. And then you're excluded...</p>
          <p eId="para_576">I am quoting the National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden. I am providing a series of quotes because I wish to be factual and clear. I wish to reply to what the Minister of State said about there being no qualifications in Sweden and about the results being clear, unambiguous and scientific. They are not. They are open to the most severe challenge. I refer to a 2007 report of the National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden. That is quite official; it is a fairly authoritative voice. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_577">It is also difficult to discern any clear trend of development: has the extent of prostitution increased or decreased? We cannot give any unambiguous answer to that question. [How does the Minister respond to that?] At most, we can discern that street prostitution is slowly returning, after swiftly disappearing in the wake of the law against purchasing sexual services. But as said, that refers to street prostitution, which is the most obvious manifestation. With regard to increases and decreases in other areas of prostitution - the 'hidden prostitution' - we are even less able to make any statements.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">The Minister of State does not want to have a review because he does not want to face these facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> Women involved in prostitution say that criminalising clients will see more women being trafficked into Ireland. After all, pimps always have access to clients. The new law will cause sex workers to be much more secretive about their job and unlikely to reach out to agencies for help and support. This is the wonderful way in which the Minister of State is helping women. The Swedish National Police Board issued a press release in 2010, a decade or so after the new law was introduced in that country, which stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_580">Serious organized crime, including prostitution and trafficking, has increased in strength, power and complexity during the past decade. It constitutes a serious social problem in Sweden and organised crime makes large amounts of money from the exploitation and trafficking of people under slave-like conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">That is the effect in another jurisdiction of the law the Minister of State proposes to introduce here. No wonder he does not want to learn about its effects. No wonder he does not want to have an examination or review of the provisions he has brought forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> In a survey of sex workers in the United Kingdom, a roughly similar jurisdiction to ours with a very similar social make-up and so on, one of the key findings was that the large majority of interviewed migrant workers in the sex industry were not forced or trafficked into prostitution. In Northern Ireland, it was found that 98% of prostitutes interviewed were fully against the provisions the Government is introducing here. The UK study found that immigration status is by far the most important factor restricting sex workers' ability to exercise their rights in their professional and private lives. Working in the sex industry, it noted, is often a way for migrants to avoid the unrewarding and sometimes exploitative conditions they meet in non-sexual jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> I turn now to the negative consequences of the law, particularly the increased risk of violence. Although there is no reliable study on the issue, sex workers express fear of increased violence, as well as the conviction of an actual increase. Unlike speakers on the other side of the House, I am referring to actual research. Other speakers can only cite their jaunt to Sweden where they failed to engage with any of the groups working with prostitutes. They refused, for example, to meet representatives of the Rose Alliance and ignored the fact that when they were there, figures were released showing an enormous increase in prostitution and trafficking. I am referring to research conducted by Dodillet and Östergren in 2011, Scoular in 2010, Hubbard in 2008, the Norwegian Ministry of Justice in 2004 and Östergren in 2004. The Skarhed report of 2010 notes that a 2003 Swedish Government report referred to a heightened risk for sex workers because of greater competition among women for fewer clients. However, being a Swedish Government report, it concluded that this increase in violence was not the fault of the law but of the women themselves. As I said, the report by Queen's University, Belfast, noted that criminalisation of clients is not considered a useful policy measure by the vast majority of sex workers. Only 2% of the 171 workers who took part in its survey agreed that criminalising clients was a good idea. That is the level of support for these changes among sex workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> In Sweden sex workers and researchers say the crackdown on street-based sex selling has forced women to move to more hidden and thus potentially dangerous locations. The men still on the streets are reportedly the more dangerous ones, while the nicer, safer clients have moved to the Internet. That is a factor of which no account seems to have been taken. Since the 1980s, there has been a significant drift from the street to the Internet, a reality that is not reflected in this law. As sex workers avail of more hidden locations to avoid the police, they may end up in the hands of third parties in an effort to stay out of the view of the police and secure clients. That is documented in the 2011 paper by Dodillet and Östergren, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare report of 2007 and the 2008 paper by Bernstein. Is the Minister of State prepared to deal with these facts? Will he indicate whether he or his advisers have read the Queen's University report, Research into Prostitution in Northern Ireland?</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> I take the opportunity to offer a number of comments by Irish sex workers. It is vital that their voices are not silenced.</p>

        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_316">

          <p eId="para_587">No, I am directly addressing my reasons for refusing to consent to the passage of this section. One Irish prostitute noted that the new law would make it more difficult to find apartments and hotels in which to work. She expressed concern that workers who were already established might find it easier as they already had a network, while new girls would be more likely to put themselves in danger as the industry went further underground. Another is convinced that many sex workers will be driven into poverty and have to rely on benefits. Since the Cathaoirleach does not want the voices of these women to be heard, I offer those comments by two women as a representative selection and will omit the comments of the other 12 or 14 women. If Members ever want to hear the other statements, I will be happy to show them.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> I turn now to the marketing campaign surrounding the alleged success of the Swedish Sex Purchase Act. It is claimed the law has reduced prostitution and trafficking for sexual purposes, had a deterrent effect on clients and changed social attitudes. Those claims were most recently stated in the 2010 evaluation of the Act. At least an evaluation was made. Even the Swedes did that much, but the Minister of State is not prepared to do the same because he is afraid of what he might find.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> The problem with these claims is that if they are carefully investigated, they do not appear to be supported by the available facts from research. As soon as the official evaluation was published, it was criticised from several directions, with that criticism focusing primarily on the lack of scientific rigour. The evaluation did not, it was noted, have an objective starting point since the terms of reference given were that the purchase of sex must continue to be illegal. There was no discussion of the facts. Illegality was the starting point and the facts had to be found to fit that or, rather, the facts had to be concealed and buried. There was not even a satisfying definition of prostitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> The evaluation of the law did not take into account ideology, method, sources and possible confounding factors. There were inconsistencies, contradictions, haphazard referencing and irrelevant or flawed comparisons. According to the academic report by Dodillet and Östergren, the Sex Purchase Act "was introduced by feminist policymakers who argued that prostitution is a form of male violence against women". In other words, it was ideologically driven. The report by the Norwegian Ministry of Justice talks about a general problem with statistics from Sweden, describing them as "highly uncertain". This is one Government commenting upon another.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> There is not the slightest scrap of international evidence that the so-called Swedish model has reduced trafficking into that country. In fact, the United Kingdom and Ireland scored better than Sweden in a recent survey on global slavery. To be clear, we are scoring better than Sweden on this marker after some ten years of the operation of the new law in that country. That tells us how effective it has been. The finding is somewhat odd given the claims made by the proponents of the Swedish model that it has reduced trafficking for sexual exploitation. In addition, there is a general ignoring of the New Zealand example, which has been successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> Between 2009 and June 2014, the total number of suspected victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation encountered by the PSNI was 81. The number of confirmed victims was 26 during that five-year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">This is serious and dreadful, but it is hardly the epidemic to justify this massive campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> I am a member of three unions and was never consulted. Not a single trade union consulted its general membership on this issue. This is the strength of it. It was a PR campaign railroaded through.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality had a jaunt to Sweden and while it was there, the Swedish forum for human rights confirmed the trafficking of more than 166 children between 2008 and 2011 and confirmed the loss of 438 immigrant children in 2011 alone. Hello - is anybody listening? On the final day, sex workers were graciously permitted in but no transcript was made publicly available. Neither of the two sex workers, whose appearance at the very end of the meeting was sheer tokenism, requested their testimony to be excluded from the transcript, but the decision was made not to record their views. How balanced is this?</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> I wish to quote from a report from the press agency of the Rikspolisstyrelsen, the Swedish National Police Board. It has stated serious organised crime, including prostitution and trafficking, has increased in strength, power and complexity in the past decade, that it constitutes a serious social problem for Sweden and that organised crime makes large sums of money out of it. Why, when it was considering this, did the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality neglect to examine a variety of social models and concentrate exclusively on the Swedish model? Why did it refuse specifically to liaise with the New Zealand authorities and the New Zealand Prostitutes' Collective, despite the well publicised success of full decriminalisation? Why did it refuse to invite the Swedish sex workers who expressed great dissatisfaction with the social model? At the Dublin conference in October Pye Jakobsson of the Swedish Rose Alliance spoke about the serious and various negative consequences experienced by sex workers under the Swedish model. Why did the delegation which visited Sweden in November refuse to meet the Swedish Rose Alliance? I have referred to the fact Deputy David Stanton put on his Facebook page a declaration about the situation before the committee had heard any evidence whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> In 2007, eight years after the law was implemented, the Government of Sweden conceded, according to an official Swedish Government document, that it could not give an unambiguous answer to the question on whether prostitution had increased or decreased. That is an interesting comment from the Swedish Government. Reporting from 2008 to 2010 showed an increase of trafficking in Sweden of 106%. The number of reported cases of sexual services sold went up by 569%. That is hardly a great tribute to the success of the Bill. A paper in <i>The Lancet</i> in July 2014 stated full decriminalisation would inhibit HIV transmission by up to 40%. Is nobody listening to these things? Is nobody concerned about the spread of disease? It is all very well to be comfortably ensconced here in our little middle-class environment and prate about life on the streets when very few people have real experience of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> Amnesty International is a highly reputable body of international reputation. One in Four was instanced by the Minister of State as supporting it, and perhaps it is, but the founder of One in Four is the director of Amnesty International, which has fully endorsed the report. This should tell us something about diversity of views. There are all kinds of sensational charges laid about Amnesty International and against anybody who speaks out on behalf of this vulnerable minority. As I pointed out, 98% of prostitutes are against it, but 80% of the voters in Northern Ireland are in favour of it. That is why we have the unusual alliance between provisional Sinn Féin-IRA, on the one hand, and the Roman Catholic hierarchy, on the other, together with the Paisleyite Protestants. It is an interesting alliance. Amnesty International does not endorse or encourage sex work. It takes no position on this issue and is solely concerned with the protection of sex workers' human rights. Neither is Amnesty International's approach advocating any right to buy sex. Amnesty International states the moves to criminalise the purchase of sex run counter to increasing evidence that such an approach puts sex workers at risk and leads to human rights violations. This is Amnesty International stating it puts people at risk and leads to human rights violations, not a trade union or the Irish Countrywomen's Association, but the principal body dealing with human rights in this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_605">The criminalisation of sex work is increasingly being recognised as a human rights concern. The UN special rapporteur on the right to health has explicitly called for the decriminalisation of sex work. The final report of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, an independent body convened by the UN development programme on behalf of the joint United Nations programme on HIV-AIDS, has made the same call. The commission deliberated over a two-year period, undertaking extensive analysis and research, including seven regional dialogues on the links between legal frameworks, human rights and HIV. I apologise, as this information has been given by Senator Mary White in a very fine statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> The UN AIDS advisory group on HIV and sex workers recommended that states move away from criminalising sex work or activities associated with it. It also recommended that the decriminalisation of sex work include removing criminal penalties for the purchase and sale of sex. It could not be any more unambiguous. This is the most reputable international body. It also recommended that the management of sex workers, brothels and other activities related to sex work, to the degree that states retain non-criminal administrative law regulations concerning sex work, be applied in ways that do not violate the workers' rights or dignity and ensure their enjoyment of due process of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> Now let us turn to the World Health Organization and the Minister of State can dismiss this any way he likes. It calls for countries to work towards the decriminalisation of sex work and the elimination of the unjust application of non-criminal laws and regulations against sex workers. The International Labour Organization has called on governments to recognise sex work as an economic sector and a legal occupation, with protection under the labour law, social security and health regulations. Human Rights Watch, Open Society Foundations and Anti-Slavery International, among other non-governmental groups, have also called for the decriminalisation of all sex work. A constellation of bodies is calling for the deletion of these two sections, which is my proposal. In Norway-----</p>

          <p eId="para_615">That is why I was asking. The Minister of State still looks perfectly serene. I do not know how he can be in the light of the blistering account I have given him of all those organisations that have a completely contrary point of view and whose voice was silenced by the Turn Off the Red Light campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> My document states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_617">In Norway, leading academic researchers have cautioned that the reported decrease in sex work is limited by “substantial uncertainties”; expressing concerns that the authors of the evaluation failed to sufficiently explore their own findings that demonstrated that the market in Norway “may have changed because the people involved try to ‘stay under the radar’ and avoid arenas where they can be observed, and by implication, counted”.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_618"> In both Sweden and Norway, researchers have found evidence of increased risk-taking among sex workers in relation to their safety since the passage of the purchasing ban. [The Minister of State challenged me on this point so I am giving him the information.] Research in 2012 by Pro Sentret, Norway’s national centre of expertise on sex work policy, indicated that since the introduction of the prohibition on purchasing sex, some sex workers have reported seeing a decrease in ‘good clients’ and that the remaining ‘bad clients’ now make up a greater proportion of available options. The report indicates that sex workers are taking greater risks in their interactions with clients such as agreeing to visit their homes, concluding negotiations with clients more quickly or in secluded spaces that are safer for the client, and agreeing to take more dangerous clients. In Sweden, concern has been raised that this actually empowers those purchasers [and the pimps] who are willing to take risks as sex workers have less bargaining power and are potentially forced to sell sex cheaper and offer unprotected sex. [That is a wonderful way to address the problem of AIDS.] Research also indicates that this increase in risk is felt most acutely by the most vulnerable, resource-poor, street-based sex workers who cannot relocate indoors and now face increased competition for ‘bad’ clients, more pressure to conclude negotiations quickly and covertly, and reduced bargaining power.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_619"> Both the Swedish and Norwegian government evaluations reported that sex workers felt less safe since the passage of the purchasing ban. </p>
          <p eId="para_620">The reality is that people feel less safe since the passage of the ban. Moreover, the document states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_621">For example, the Norwegian report stated that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_622"> “[W]omen in the street market report to have a weaker bargaining position and more safety concerns now than before the law was introduced. At the indoors market, prostitutes express concerns for ‘out-door calls’. They prefer to have customers visiting them at their own apartment or own hotel room. The threshold for reporting a violent customer to the police also seems to be higher after the law. People in prostitution are afraid that such actions will come back to halt them at later stages.”</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_623"> Of their discussion with current sex workers in Sweden, the authors of the evaluation reported that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_624"> “They describe having chosen to prostitute themselves and do not consider themselves to be unwilling victims of anything. [It is the Government that is calling them victims.] This self-righteous campaign decided that these people who do not feel they are victims. It is the responsibility of the government to decide what other people are ... ."</p>
          <p eId="para_625">It is also stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_626">"Even if it is not forbidden to sell sex, they feel they are hunted by the police. They feel that they are being treated as incapacitated persons because their actions are tolerated but their wishes and choices are not respected. Moreover, they state that there is a difference between voluntary and forced prostitution."</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_627">[…]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_628">The criminalisation of the purchase of sex has also reportedly impacted on HIV prevention and harm reduction. Condom distribution to sex workers and clients has been publicly criticised for ‘encouraging sex work’ and running contrary to the law and has been scaled back in at least one area of Sweden since the passage of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">When thinking about the human rights of prostitutes, we must note that not all of them regard themselves as unfortunate. Some of them are, however. Some of them, as a result of the operation of the law in Sweden, have been deprived not only of a large proportion of their income but also of their homes. I find it shameful that, in Norway, the police actively targeted the landlords of known prostitutes and called this excursion Operation Homeless. It is fairly cynical driving prostitutes out of their homes in a police operation described as Operation Homeless. This has led to the eviction of sex workers from their place of work and occupation. Is that what the Government wants? Does it want an increase in risk and damage to the safety of women? Does it want an increase in the risk to health and the risk of HIV infection, the dispossession of women from their homes, the harassment of women and their exposure to greater danger? I cannot believe this is what the Irish people want.</p>

          <p eId="para_630">Sections 20 and 21 provide for two offences in the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services. The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute and the second is the more serious offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a trafficked person. These provisions are the result of considerable and extensive public consultation by the Department of Justice and Equality but primarily by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality which recommended similar proposals in 2013. The matter has already been the subject of considerable debate both inside and outside these Houses and even beyond the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> In deciding on these provisions the Minister considered all sides of the debate and the experience of those states that have introduced similar measures and those that have addressed prostitution in a different way. The purpose of introducing these provisions is primarily to target the trafficking and sexual exploitation of persons through prostitution. Both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have recognised the effectiveness of the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services as a tool in the fight against human trafficking. However, even to leave aside this unquestionable objective, there is undoubtedly evidence of wider exploitation of persons involved in prostitution outside those trafficked such as those coerced or otherwise forced through circumstances to engage in the activity.</p>

          <p eId="para_634"> Senator David Norris raised many aspects in the debate today. He raised issues about the impact of the provisions and the safety, health and well-being of those who work in prostitution. The Minister is well aware of the arguments and concerns. In deciding to put forward her proposals, she listened to all sides of the debate and is convinced that targeting the exploitation associated with prostitution requires targeting those who demand prostitutes.</p>

          <p eId="para_680">It proposes to make the offence gender neutral. The offence is split by gender, assigning a dominant role to the male and a passive role to the female. The penalties are much lighter for female offenders, but they are being equalised now. The problem is that males may be tried for incest from the age of 12 years and females from 17 years. As such, it appears that males and females are not treated equally regarding their intentional capacity under the Bill. We just wanted to point out this anomaly to the Minister of State. It needs to be addressed. If that is not done here, it could be challenged at a later stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_681">I thank the Senator. The Minister appreciates the purpose behind the proposed amendment, but she has initial misgivings about it. The purpose of the provisions in sections 22 and 23 is to remove the existing gender anomaly relating to the penalty for incest by a male as opposed to by a female. Otherwise, they reflect the provisions of the Punishment of Incest Act 1908. When offences of this nature occur, generally an adult and child are involved. The 1908 provisions were undoubtedly intended to protect children within the family, but they were also motivated by the potentially adverse effects on any children born out of such relationships and eugenic considerations generally. For this reason, the Act and the amended provisions proposed in the Bill limit the offence to an act between persons where pregnancy is most likely.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> The Senator's amendment would broaden the offence in this respect. For instance, the current offence of incest by a male includes a male who has carnal knowledge of his granddaughter but not a male who has carnal knowledge of his grandmother. Equally, in so far as there is an offence of incest by a female, it may occur where there is carnal knowledge with her grandfather but not her grandson. Obviously, where a person engages in a sexual act with a child under the age of 17 years, the existing defilement offences under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 will apply. However, where it is an offence of incest, the relationships within which the offence may arise are limited to those most likely to result in pregnancy. Therefore, the Minister wants to examine this aspect of the amendment to ensure that it does not unnecessarily extend the offence of incest. The amendment would limit the offence to persons over the age of 17 years where currently that limit only applies to females and not to males. The amendment would exempt males under 17 years of age from the offence, thus restricting its scope while expanding its extent by unifying the categories of prohibited relationships for both sexes. We must be careful not to bring about unintended or unnecessary consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> The Supreme Court has adjudicated that the Oireachtas is entitled to protect girls under the age of 17 years from the risk of pregnancy because a girl potentially carries a greater burden from the act physically and emotionally should she become pregnant. The Minister is concerned that accepting the amendment may preclude, where appropriate, the prosecution of a male of, for example, 16 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> The amendment also would delete subsection (2) from the offence of incest by a male. Under subsection (2), a male cannot rely on the consent of a female as a defence to a charge of incest. While there is no similar provision in the offence by a female, it would not be correct to suggest that the offence by a female can be defended by the consent of the male. The nature of the offence by the female is different than that committed by a male. The offence by a female is committed where she permits a specified male relative to have carnal knowledge of her. Consent on the part of both parties is, therefore, implied and an element of the offence. Relying on the defence of consent on the part of the male would not arise. The offence by a male is committed where he has carnal knowledge of the female. A provision clarifying that consent of the female is not a defence is, therefore, required and brings it into line with the offence by a female. Removing this provision from the offence by a male would mean a male could rely on consent as a defence but a female could not. For these reasons, we cannot accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_686">I would like to tease out a few issues. This section relates to incest. Can incest take place between two males? There is an exclusion of male-to-male sexual activity from the Bill. I am curious as to why. I am not advocating that it should be included, but I am curious to know why this particular form of behaviour is not covered by the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> Regarding the line "Any female person of or above the age of 17 years" in section 23, what about someone who is 16 and a half years of age? Does the world dramatically change on a 17th birthday? Is it perfectly legal for a girl of 16 and a half or 16 and three quarters years of age to have sex with her grandfather, father, brother or son? The provision reads, "knowing him to be her grandfather, father, brother or son". There was a tragic case in Germany in the past ten years of a brother and sister who were separated at birth, did not know each other and went to different families. I am not sure whether they went to different towns. They met casually, fell in love, started a relationship and, as far as I remember, had children. They applied to get married.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> Imprisonment for life is a harsh term. I am not in any sense encouraging incest but imprisonment for life is putting it on the same level as murder. I would be interested in the Minister of State's response.</p>

          <p eId="para_689">It is a difficult discussion to have and I understand that it can cause great upset to people who have been victims of this offence or affected by it.

On that basis, sexual intercourse between two brothers would not be considered to be incest.</p>

          <p eId="para_703"> The Minister has confused matters further by introducing a High Court or Supreme Court ruling on the question of pregnancy. Is the Minister of State suggesting somebody under the age of 17 years cannot get pregnant? People get pregnant at quite early ages. It may be very regrettable, but it is a fact. At what age can people be married?</p>

As with the Code Napoléon, we need to codify laws in a coherent and sensible manner in order that we are all treated in the same way. When the Minister introduces the notion of pregnancy, it seems almost to imply that somebody under the age of 17 years cannot get pregnant.

          <p eId="para_723">Yes, I have been asked by Senator Jillian van Turnhout to move her amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> I move amendment No. 35:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_725">In page 22, line 27, after “in this section” to insert “and in section 19B”.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">The purpose of amendment No. 36 in my name is to restrict the availability of therapy notes in criminal proceedings to those which have a direct bearing on the offence in question. We have raised issues around this on different Stages. Therapy, following from sexual abuse, is not solely concerned with discussing that experience. According to representations from the CARI Foundation, the Children’s University Hospital, Temple Street, and Our Lady’s Children’s Hospital, Crumlin, therapy often covers a range of family and relationship issues which are often not relevant to proceedings. Without a definition of relevance, there is a risk that defence representatives would cast a deliberately wide net, seeking sensitive information which does not contain reference to the actual offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> Amendment No. 38 is to ensure therapy records do not provide an indication of whether or not a complainant has an ability to testify at trial. Such notes do not capture the current developmental, verbal or emotional competencies of a complainant or, in any way, assess a complainant’s capabilities to participate in the criminal justice system.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> The purpose of amendment No. 39 is to ensure therapy records do not provide an indication of whether a complainant has an ability to testify at trial.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> Amendment No. 41 is to ensure vulnerable people such as children are protected from re-traumatisation. It is the opinion of special care units that the risk of harm, psychological harm in this context, which could be caused to the victim by unnecessary disclosure should be included as a factor. This is consistent with EU directives which describe that child witnesses should be protected from further victimisation and re-traumatisation within the criminal justice system.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> To put it in a nutshell, we are concerned by the way therapy notes could be misused by unscrupulous legal representatives and how they could possibly drag up many issues which people might not like to have discussed in a public or other court. This could be a deterrent to some people taking cases. We know these cases are difficult to prosecute in any sense. I imagine the Minister of State is coming from a similar type of perspective to ourselves on this. I hope he will consider these amendments helpful and take them on board.</p>

        <speech by="#AodhanORiordan" eId="spk_403" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice_and_Equality">
          <from>Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin<recordedTime time="2015-12-11T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_731">Section 33 regulates the disclosure of the content of third-party counselling or therapy records in sexual offence trials. The disclosure of counselling or therapy records in the context of criminal proceedings, especially with regard to sexual violence, touches on several sensitive issues and balancing of rights. The right to a fair trial for an accused must be respected. However, so too does the right of the victim not to feel further violated in the criminal justice process. This section establishes a process for the disclosure of such records, where appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> Since the publication of the Bill, the Minister for Justice and Equality has received several submissions proposing changes to this section. Notably, submissions from the Ombudsman for Children, Rape Crisis Network Ireland and Q4, representing the child sexual assault units in Temple Street and Crumlin children’s hospitals, are being considered by officials in the Department of Justice and Equality. The necessary balancing of fundamental rights involved in the disclosure of sensitive personal records requires careful consideration from both a legal and operational perspective. The Minister expects to be in a position to address several concerns raised about this section by way of amendment as the Bill progresses through the Houses. For example, the Minister intends to accept one proposal raised in the submissions of Q4 and Rape Crisis Network Ireland, namely, the removal of all references to the competence of the complainant or witness to testify, as she is persuaded that counselling records are not relevant to competence.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> With regard to the specific amendments proposed, I thank Senators Jillian van Turnhout, Denis O’Donovan, David Cullinane, Trevor Ó Clochartaigh and Kathryn Reilly for their amendments. The Minister fully appreciates the points they have made.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> Senator Jillian van Turnhout’s amendments Nos. 35 and 43 propose a separate disclosure regime to apply to children. The Minister is concerned that difficulties would arise in applying two regimes simultaneously but will consider the particular protections applying to children as part of the review of this section.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> As to amendment No. 36, there are several difficulties with the definition of “relevant record” proposed. The proposed amendment deletes the reference to the prosecutor having sight or knowledge of the record, making it almost impossible to identify which records would be subject to a disclosure application and pre-trial hearing. Requiring, by definition, that the record has some probative or evidential value also raises the question of how this can be determined in advance of a pre-trial hearing and may create a presumption in favour of the disclosure of the record at a hearing. These are matters appropriate to the hearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> Amendments Nos. 37 to 41, inclusive, seek changes to the list of assertions in section 33(4) which, on their own, will not establish the relevance of a record, and the factors in section 33(9) which the court must consider in determining whether to disclose a record. These are issues which have also been raised in the submissions the Minister has received and the two subsections in particular are being reviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> The Minister is minded to take on board some of the changes proposed. However, it is important to emphasise again that a careful balancing of rights is involved to ensure the disclosure provisions are constitutionally sound.</p>

          <p eId="para_759">I thank the Senator for bringing forward these amendments. This question of introducing a statutory definition of consent has been raised by a number of groups, in particular those who work with and support the victims of sexual offences and also by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in terms of domestic and sexual violence. Moreover, this is an issue which does not appear to have received any significant consideration since Law Reform Commission's proposals in 1988. I know that the Minister is of the view that the question of providing a statutory definition of consent is overdue for review and that she has directed officials within her Department to undertake that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> There is a clear understanding of the arguments favouring a statutory definition, including the clarity and understanding it will bring, as well as the assistance it could offer jurors, particularly in cases that may be difficult to adjudicate. However, there are also concerns that a statutory definition of consent may mean the flexibility of the common law system would be lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> Aside from whether there should be a statutory definition of consent and if the answer is "Yes", what that definition should be, there are also a number of other questions which must be considered. Other common law jurisdictions have adopted different approaches to what is or is not consent. For instance, in the United Kingdom consent is defined with the addition of listing both evidential and conclusive presumptions about consent. While not defining consent itself, the New Zealand approach is to list the circumstances under which allowing sexual activity does not amount to consent. The Canadian model defines consent, as well as setting out those circumstances where no consent is obtained and those circumstances under which a defendant's belief that consent was given would not be a defence.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> While other jurisdictions share a number of similarities in their approach to the question of consent to a sexual act, there are differences, and Ireland should adopt a model appropriate to this jurisdiction. That is a complex matter which warrants a comprehensive review and appropriate consultation with those involved in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences. While that process is ongoing, the Minister is currently unable to accommodate Senator Denis O'Donovan's amendments today but, again, I thank him. The approach adopted in these amendments will also form part of the further consideration of this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_763">It is regrettable that the Minister of State is not taking on board the relevant points made by Senator Denis O'Donovan in his amendments. Amendment No. 45 refers to the "non-consent of sexual activity" which formed the basis of a case recently. The amendment continued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_764">(f) the complainant was asleep or otherwise unconscious at the time of the relevant act;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_765">(g) the complainant was too affected by alcohol or drugs to freely agree to sexual activity;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_766">(i) the complainant having originally consented to engage in sexual activity expresses by words or conduct a lack of agreement to continue to engage in the activity;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_767">(j) the complainant submits to sexual activity because of the abuse of a position of authority or trust.".</p>
          <p eId="para_768">These are very real situations in which people are abused every day. It would add quite appreciably to the Bill to have those definitions included, if one can call them definitions. They would assist juries by quite a lot to reach judgments that assist the victim.</p>

          <p eId="para_769">Two of the amendments deal with the question of consent. Amendment No. 44 reads, "An individual consents if he or she agrees by choice and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice". That seems to be a reasonable definition of consent. I have not thought deeply about the matter, but it seems to be a fairly commonsense view of the question of consent. </p>
          <p eId="para_770"> Do the amendments propose new sections because I can see that the headline reads "Consent"? I presume that means it is an entire new section.</p>

          <p eId="para_772">They propose to the insertion of new sections, yes, but that is not actually stated. The Cathaoirleach has been helpful and I thank him very much. I notice that the provision comes in at the end of the Bill. The amendment does not state it is a new section after line 41 on page 27 of the Bill, after the end of a short two paragraph statement on double jeopardy. The section does not really talk about consent at all. Section 38 reads:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_773">(1) Where a person has been acquitted of an offence in a place other than the State, he or she shall not be proceeded against for an offence under this Act consisting of the alleged act or acts constituting the first-mentioned offence.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_774">(2) Where a person has been convicted of an offence in a place other than the State, he or she shall not be proceeded against for an offence under this Act consisting of the act or acts constituting the first-mentioned offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">I do not see any connection whatever there with consent. It is unusual that amendment No. 44 states, "In page 27, after line 41." </p>
          <p eId="para_776"> Amendment No. 45 states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_777">An individual is to be taken not to have consented to sexual activity where:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_778">(a) the defendant intentionally deceived the complainant as to the nature or purpose of sexual activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">I am not sure what that provision means. Perhaps I might get some further information from the proposer. Does that mean that the defendant says, "We're just having sex not for pleasure but in order to produce children"?</p>

          <p eId="para_786">As I was saying, I do not understand what the phrase meant. I know that the amendment has been withdrawn, but it shall be put forward on Report Stage. Therefore, it is still meat for discussion. I do not understand paragraph (a) in amendment No. 45. Paragraph (b) states, "the defendant intentionally induced the complainant to consent to sexual activity by impersonating a person known personally to the complainant". Again, I would counsel that if this amendment comes back on Report Stage, such a line be removed because how on earth would one do so? Such a scenario beggars and stretches belief. People talk about things being ludicrous and frivolous. I mean if somebody presents himself or herself in front of someone, one can see him or her and one knows who he or she is.</p>
