          <from>Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">It was obvious from the beginning that this global pandemic that a European response was required to meet the unprecedented challenges relating to Covid-19. We therefore welcome this Bill. The support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency, SURE, instrument within this Bill provides for €100 billion to be raised on the capital markets by the EU Commission. This will enable member states to temporarily mitigate unemployment risks and it will help us to finance our wage subsidy scheme. It is vitally important that the scheme continues while businesses struggle to operate to full capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> Keeping people in employment during this time of uncertainty must be a priority. This was the approach taken in several other European countries. The benefits of a short-term work scheme were seen in Germany during the recent recession. The temporary wage subsidy scheme has been vital in keeping people in work and keeping working relationships intact. The European Investment Bank, EIB, pan-European guarantee fund will provide additional loans to SMEs, mid-caps and corporates affected by Covid-19, but the loans must be interest-free. We must ensure that the money gets to where it is needed most as quickly as possible. Businesses need cash and they need it now.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> I welcome the steps that have been taken to date but I am concerned that too many businesses and self-employed people are falling through the gaps. These gaps are becoming more evident as we push through the challenges we continue to face. Small businesses in Mayo continue to close on a daily basis, and we must stop this. Many of these businesses could remain open with proper supports. Grant aid, not loans, is necessary to keep these businesses open until such time as they are able to operate again to their full potential. We bailed out the banks, now we need a bailout for these businesses which have served us so loyally over generations. We need to realise that enabling businesses to stay open, employ people and keep our towns and villages alive makes economic and social sense. It has to be the only show in town. Boarded-up shop fronts, long queues for unemployment benefit and reduced returns for the Exchequer must be avoided at all costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> Too often in the past, EU administered loans have disproportionately gone to larger companies. Even in the context of the fund under discussion, companies with as many as 3,000 employees can access the loans. Of these loans, 65% will be ring-fenced for SMEs but the category relating to SMEs is broad. Some such enterprises have 250 employees. We have also seen how larger companies are better placed to avail of these funds. They can afford the accountants and financial expertise to draw down large portions of funding available, while smaller businesses and those with only three, five or ten employees do not have the means to do so. I ask that the scheme be strictly monitored in order to ensure that the funds get to where they are needed most and that financial institutions do not capitalise on the backs of struggling businesses. I ask that we do not, as often happens, rely on the sketchy judgment of audit companies that fail to protect our best interests. What measures are being put in place to conduct real-time monitoring of the progress of this scheme so we get the proper outcomes? Can we ensure that companies which benefit from this scheme operate in an ethical manner? It is important to support SMEs of all sizes but we must also recognise the needs of different businesses. SMEs need grant support. This is particularly true of small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> While there are positive elements here, we cannot let them distract from what is really needed, namely, an SME grant scheme that will keep shops in Belmullet, Castlebar and all the other towns across the country open. I am concerned that the necessary finance to keep these businesses open keeps moving out of reach. While businesses hear of there being millions and billions available, they are often told that what is on offer is just not suitable for them. That is why we must aim to fill in these gaps. One business owner described it to me as being like swimming in the deep end of a swimming pool and trying to reach out and grab an edge that keeps moving. We need to get cash into these businesses and we need to do that now, not in a few weeks time or a few months. This Bill allows for that to happen and it is up to us to make it happen in a speedy manner.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_6">Everyone must welcome this legislation and what it intends to do, namely, give a boost to the business sector, which must recover in order to make our economy self-sufficient. Other Members have noted that it comes at an awkward time for businesses that barely got out of a recession which hit them and the country very hard. It is tough luck that the coronavirus came upon us at a time when we were recovering. We had no control of that whatever, and still have very little control over it. The virus continues to rage across the globe and remains a serious threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> The European Union has come in at an early stage. The German Chancellor has outlined what she believes to be necessary to deal with the issues before us. She is correct that a semi-mutualisation of the debt that has befallen European countries is the obvious thing to do because those countries did not bring what is happening upon themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">This did not happen due to mismanagement and it could not have been bargained for. The only thing individual Governments can do in this particular situation is to put in place the necessary health checks to contain the virus and to bring about a situation where it is suppressed to the extent that business can recover and survive. </p>
          <p eId="para_9"> In every respect, we do not know the full extent of the impact as yet. This Bill is an appropriate reassurance and stabilising measure that will be of benefit to the business sector. Confidence is necessary. Confidence and access to credit are crucial elements in the business sector. Without them, the business sector will wander. What is most important in the context of this particular development is that all countries across the European Union are likely to be treated in the same fashion. That is positive. It is important from the point of view of smaller countries like Ireland that we can expect equal and fair treatment from our neighbours and that they too can expect to receive favourable treatment and support through the various mechanisms that are being made available by individual member states. It is important that we grasp this opportunity. There has been much said about the need for greater emphasis on grants and less emphasis on loans but if the loans are provided at appropriate interest rates they will be of huge benefit in any event, particularly for those companies that want to plan for the future. Access to a particular source of capital, be it by way of grant or loan, provides reassurance and the confidence that is required. </p>
          <p eId="para_10"> This country came through a huge trauma in the course of the recovery from the economic crash. Without going over that in any great deal, we were bruised after it. The business community was bruised after it. While we made a relatively dramatic recovery in comparison with other countries across the European Union we are still bruised. There are small businesses throughout the length and breadth of this country that are seeking further borrowings and a restructuring of their loan facilities in order that they can recover from it. It is to the eternal credit of the business sector in this country that it has done so well. Businesses worked hard in the face of unbelievable obstacles to bring about a resolution for the restoration of their economy. The agri-food sector in particular bore a heavy burden and did extremely well.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> It is no harm to remember that because of the considerable impact of the economic downturn, it naturally follows that we become punch-drunk and that our people are under pressure for considerable periods and as a result they suffer. The most important issue now is access to credit. Credit is important to the running of any business. A business cannot operate unless it has access to credit and can wash its face in terms of the resources it has available. The manner in which it can do that is best dealt with by the people who are experts in the business area, namely, the small and medium sized businesses the length and breadth of this country who, as we speak, continue to endeavour to the best of their ability to put in place the necessary measures to propel them into the future and a safe environment. </p>
          <p eId="para_12"> My final point is in regard to the future. We do not know for how long this situation will continue, which is sad. It is impossible to determine that at this stage. Much will be determined by the extent to which the global community gets to grips with the pandemic and puts in place the necessary measures to contain and suppress it. By the same token, the supports proposed in this legislation, which are necessary, may have to be and can be revisited in the future. In this regard the support of our colleagues throughout the European Union is important. Standing together, we stand the best chance of restoring confidence in ourselves, industry and the country while at the same time being able to compete in the wider global markets. We live in an open economy. The global markets are available to us as individual business people throughout the length and breadth of this country but only if we are in a position to access sufficient resources to ensure we can continue to run our businesses. We can do that. It is good that we are in that position at this particular time. I hope that the uptake of the resources being made available is sufficiently high to make a positive impact on our economy and as a result our return to economic independence.</p>

          <p eId="para_14">I am sharing time with Deputies Cathal Crowe and O'Callaghan. I am thankful for this opportunity to speak on the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) Bill 2020, specifically its importance and relevance to rural Ireland. We all know and realise that Covid-19 has ripped through the heart of rural Ireland, robbing families of loved ones and imposing a necessary lockdown on rural Ireland that ran contrary to the civic and community spirit that best exemplifies our community. For small businesses, this could not have come at a worse time. They were slowly emerging from the crash and seeing the semblance of some form of recovery but then it was as though they were pulled back through a time portal, which has left them facing into a period of immense uncertainty and, no doubt, worry. There is no doubt that Dublin and the large metropolitan centres will bounce back but for towns and villages such as Longford, Ballymahon and Lanesborough, the future is paved with uncertainty and deep anxiety.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> I welcome all of the measures that have been put in place to date to assist small businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs. In Longford, the local authority commercial rates team has worked assiduously to roll out the business restart scheme but there are some concerns around the uptake of the scheme. While just over 1,300 businesses from County Longford were deemed eligible for the scheme, as of the start of this week only 450 had applied for it. Under the scheme a business can avail of grants of between €2,000 and €10,000 based on its rates bill from 2019. I would encourage all businesses that have not yet applied to apply for it before the 31 August deadline. </p>
          <p eId="para_16"> Annually, the shift towards online shopping has been of the order of 6% but this has increased exponentially over the period of the Covid-19 crisis. This will be one of the biggest challenges facing small businesses into the future. The local enterprise offices, LEOs, provide a range of supports to assist businesses in this regard, one of which is the online trading voucher scheme. I spoke recently to Sharon Devlin of Cherche La Femme in Longford town. While her heart is very much on Dublin Street, thanks to the online voucher scheme her shop window is now global. Great credit is due to the LEO teams across the country for their work in this regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_17"> Next week, the Government will announce the July stimulus initiative. It is critical that there are sufficient incentives and supports within it to assist as many businesses as possible. It is important to note that there are still many businesses that are wavering on the question of reopening. As reopening will be incredibly tough for pubs and restaurants in Dublin and the big cities, one can imagine how difficult a challenge it will be for pubs in rural Ireland. We hope that today there will be clarity on the reopening for pubs but, more importantly, we need guidelines to enable pubs that do not provide food to reopen in comfort and with certainty.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> I recently met Tommy Kirwan of the famed Greville Arms Hotel in Granard, which was the home place of the late Kitty Kiernan. </p>
          <p eId="para_19">Despite his best efforts and those of his staff, he knows that the road to recovery will be desperately slow. He, like so many others, is pleading for guidance, assistance and support.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> In the July stimulus, there needs to be meaningful movement on the VAT rate for the hospitality sector. For many food outlets and bars in rural Ireland, such as those in Killashee, Ennybegs, Aughnacliffe, that may be the deciding factor as to whether they can reopen for business. What is just as important for them and for many small businesses will be the wage subsidy scheme, which needs to be not only retained but also reinforced for a considerable period. Sadly, we have seen the closure of a number of local businesses in Longford, foremost among them the Nine Arches restaurant in Ballymahon. We show solidarity with such businesses and hope to see them return in another guise in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The July stimulus is just one step on the road to recovery. It will pave the way for budget 2021 later in the year, which will set out our national economic plan. I am greatly heartened by the work that has gone into this as we seek to secure our public finances in a world in which we must live with Covid-19. Doubtless, the future will bring immense challenges for County Longford, which will be at the epicentre of efforts to decarbonise the economy. It is critical that budget 2021 positions the recovery fund to ensure that rural Ireland and counties such as Longford get the maximum opportunity. For Longford specifically, the budget will need not only to build on and copper-fasten the just transition fund, as well as to make good on the €1 million rates deficit facing Longford County Council, but also to put in place a stimulus package that can encourage a range of marquee, enterprise, tourism and hospitality ventures for the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> I am aware that Longford County Council has recently submitted its largest and most ambitious regeneration proposal to date under the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, and we will, I hope, have a positive decision on this submission in October. If successful, it will seek to address the Great Water Street, Lower Main Street, Connolly Barracks and Church Street areas of the town. Hopefully, a significant State investment will follow on the back of a successful application. If the necessary supports and investment are subsequently included in budget 2021, I have no doubt it will trigger the private sector investment of which Longford town and county have been starved for more than 12 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> We are still battling Covid-19. The many who have, sadly, lost their lives should and never will be forgotten. Nevertheless, it is important that we start to look to the future, a future in which we will have to live with the challenges of Covid-19 and in which we, as legislators, will have to ensure that the people and businesses of County Longford and all of rural Ireland are afforded the same opportunities as the rest of the country. If the battle with Covid has taught us one lesson, it is that we leave nobody and no community behind on the road forward.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CathalCrowe" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Deputy Cathal Crowe<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_24">I welcome the Bill and will fully support it. So far, we have managed the health crisis quite well but the litmus for test for the Government is how it will support SMEs as they try to get back on their feet and as our country negotiates its way through an evolving economic crisis. There are a number of indicators that evidence the extent of the economic crisis we find ourselves in. The total net voted expenditure for the first six months of the year is more than five times greater than it was this time last year. Concurrent with that, our economy has an unemployment rate of 22.5% and there has been a 20% drop in the expected VAT take. All of this indicates how stark the circumstances are. The sector that is most exposed in retail is that of SMEs. I am glad the Government is considering stimulating the economy rather than adopting austerity measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> The Bill is the product of co-operation and partnership between the EU member states. Ireland's share of the EU's €540 billion support package will be used to prop up our ailing but very important SMEs. As we try to reboot our economy, these businesses will be of great importance. When we pass legislation this week, we will be delivering a crucial adrenaline shot to them. There can be no overestimating the key position held by SMEs. In my home county of Clare, there are 8,700 such companies, most of whom employ fewer than ten people but, collectively, they have major firepower, providing approximately 35,000 jobs in the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> There are some outlying issues we still need to deal with. I hope that the Cabinet will today give full clarity on the reopening of bars, which need to have certainty as to what lies ahead in the coming days. There are also some in the SME sector that have not, thus far, been properly supported. I can think of a number of bed and breakfast operators in County Clare that find themselves outside the current criteria for certain support schemes. Some of them, due to age profile, have not been able to avail of the Covid-19 payments that so many others have been able to avail of in recent months.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> The Bill is very important. There should be full and unequivocal support for it tomorrow when we vote on it. This legislation will give a much-needed adrenaline shot to SMEs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOCallaghan" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_28">Déanaim comhghairdeas le mo chara, an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers. Níl aon dabht agam ach go mbeidh sé ag obair go crua agus go dícheallach ina oifig nua ar son leas an phobail sna blianta romhainn. I congratulate my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, on his appointment. I have no doubt that he will be a very effective and competent Minister of State in the years ahead and I wish him well.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> We can safely say that when the history of the 21st century is written 100 years from now, the events of 2020 in general, and the particulars of the Covid-19 pandemic, will form a very large part. There are two reasons for this. First, the impact the pandemic has had on people's lives, health and lifestyles has been enormous. We have seen that not only in this country but throughout the world. The second reason, although we are not yet fully aware of it, is the long-term consequences of our response to the pandemic. I am fairly sure, and I regret to say, that there will be very serious repercussions regarding the response of not just Ireland but other countries to the pandemic. These were responses we had to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> I have spoken previously about the significant impact our response to the pandemic has had on certain vulnerable groups in our society, such as on children and young people, victims of domestic violence and those who have mental health issues or special needs. In designing our response to the pandemic, it is very important that we do not subordinate all other societal needs to the very legitimate need of seeking to ensure that people do not get sick as a result of Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> The purpose of the legislation we are discussing is to try to deal with one set of consequences of our response to Covid-19, namely, the severe and significant economic consequences of our attempt to curtail the pandemic. In particular, it seeks to resolve and target one of the most dangerous consequences of our response to the pandemic, namely, unemployment in general and youth unemployment in particular. Anyone who has studied past recessions will know that one of the most dangerous consequences of a recession is high youth unemployment. I regret to say that, according to the statistics in Ireland at present, the unemployment rate among 15 to 24 year olds is 45%. That is an extremely unusual and, I hope, very temporary high statistic. It is because of the immediate response to the pandemic through the lockdown and it will reduce in the months ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> It is nonetheless very important that we try to ensure that we put in place effective measures in order that we do not allow long-term youth unemployment to obtain in this country. When one considers the impact that long-term unemployment has on a country, one can see the necessity of trying to ensure that it does not happen. A consequence of people being unemployed for lengthy periods is they lose their connection to the labour force. Employers, I regret to say, become dismissive of somebody who has not been in employment for a period of, for example, more than a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">We must do our best to protect young people in particular from the consequences of long-term youth unemployment. We can learn a great deal from what other countries have done. Germany ,Britain and, earlier this week, France, have announced measures to target unemployment, particularly among young people. I welcome the legislation the Government is introducing. It builds upon decisions that were made by the EU arising from the powers that are vested in it under Article 122 of the treaty on the functioning of that Union. That article is not used frequently but it provides power for the Union to provide financial assistance to member states when there have been exceptional occurrences. Clearly it is the case that the pandemic is an exceptional occurrence and, therefore, we need exceptional action by the Union. As a result, on 19 May, Council Regulation 2020/672 was passed. It established the European instrument known as SURE and provided up to €100 billion that is available for the Union to give to member states to deal with the response to the economic consequences of Covid-19. As set out in the Schedule to the Bill, Ireland has to guarantee a certain amount of the contribution but, in turn, we get the benefit of those moneys, which we will badly need to ensure that we can protect young people in particular from the devastation of long-term unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> We also need to recognise that this recession is unusual. Never before have we had a recession that was deliberately caused by governments. They were right to cause the recession when we look back at what was happening in March 2020. When we saw what was happening in the intensive care units, ICUs, and emergency departments in Spain and Italy, we had no alternative but to ensure that we tried to protect our own ICUs and emergency departments by bringing in the lockdown. It was a very deliberate act by us. We know the consequences, although we did not understand fully the long-term consequences. We knew there would be consequences to the lockdown. Just as we were very deliberate in closing down the economy, now we have to be very deliberate in opening it up again. That requires State intervention. We need to take extraordinary measures to prevent long-term unemployment. The Government may need to take measures beyond this legislation. This beneficial proposal is available under the Article 122 provision but it could be the case that we will have to take further steps such as those taken by the UK and France earlier this week. We need to be radical. If we allow a whole cohort of young people to become long-term unemployed, that will have a significant detrimental impact not just on them but on our society. Our society will not recover from having a young cohort who do not have any secure employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> People have been affected by the lockdown in many different ways. A group that probably has not been given sufficient attention to date and that has been significantly damaged is people aged under 40. In fairness to them, their economic security and work lives have been put on hold to a certain extent for the purpose of trying to ensure that we protect the health of people who are predominantly more elderly than they are. They did that selflessly and they were prepared to do it. We must recognise that we have a responsibility to them as well to ensure that society protects them. Young people have very insecure economic positions not just in Ireland but around the western world at present. The terms of their employment, whether they have any pension provision in the future, their ability to access secure and affordable accommodation are all uncertainties in the lives of most people under 40. It is unusual that they find themselves in the position where their own economic security is less than what was the case for their parents. That is unusual for this country and the world. The State must recognise that we have a responsibility to repay to those young people the selfless acts they have engaged in. They are the people whose careers have been damaged as a result of the lockdown. We must ensure that we do not allow a large cohort of them to drift into long-term unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> This is a very worthwhile Bill. I commend the Minister of State on steering it through the House. It will be of benefit to the country in trying to protect our society from the impact of long-term unemployment. However, we should not close ourselves off from other options that we made need to take off our own bat without having to rely on the EU to direct us. There is a very strong challenge ahead of us but for the future of the country and for the future of young people, who are our future, we need to ensure that we protect them from the ravages of long-term unemployment.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Jack Chambers)<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_38">I thank my colleagues, Deputies Flaherty, O'Callaghan and Cathal Crowe for their contributions this morning. I also thank all the Deputies who took part in this debate yesterday evening. In particular, I acknowledge the broad acceptance across the House of the need for measures that this legislation will facilitate. I would like to respond to a few of the specific points raised by Deputies. We may have the opportunity to follow up on them on Committee and Remaining Stages of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> Covid-19 is a symmetric shock that has hit all countries through no fault of their own, and one that requires a strong collective response to get our economies back on the path to recovery. I agree with the point Deputy O'Callaghan made about ensuring we have stimulus investment and that we invest in our communities. The stimulus package that is to be announced in the next week, as well as additional lines of funding, will ensure that. Some of the remarks in the debate yesterday referred to a decade ago and the fragmentation in a European context. This is an example of European solidarity where countries have come together to act on a collective basis in the context of this pandemic. That is a welcome development in the EU. </p>
          <p eId="para_40"> This Bill enables access to two EU pandemic response instruments, SURE and the EIB guarantee fund. The SURE scheme aims to support member states with efforts to protect workers and jobs specifically on short-term working arrangements such as Ireland's temporary wage subsidy scheme. To date, Ireland has spent €1.85 billion supporting workers and employers through the scheme. Under the proposal, the European Commission will borrow up to €100 billion on financial markets to provide loans to member states, allowing them to benefit from the EU's strong credit rating and low borrowing costs. Access to this facility is dependent on market rates and the maturity of loans offered by the Commission. The Government will make a decision at the appropriate time, having considered the advice of the NTMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> The objective of the EIB guarantee fund is to respond to the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak by ensuring that SMEs, mid-caps, corporates and other eligible entities in the participating member states have sufficient liquidity available to weather this rapidly unfolding crisis. The EIB in managing this fund plans to deploy a broad mix of products, to include counter-guarantees, venture debt, venture capital and private equity through a range of financial intermediaries, including national promotional banks, commercial banks, guarantee societies, special purpose vehicles, leasing companies and any other financial intermediaries authorised to lend. While I note Deputy Boyd Barrett's concern that debt financing cannot go on forever, I am acutely aware of the need to support the SME sector to protect livelihoods. This fund is designed to provide assistance to the sector by supporting lending to high-risk operations that are viable but vulnerable due to the impact of the crisis. The primary focus will be on SMEs but there will also be a focus on public entities providing essential services, particularly in health, research and education sectors, which are also eligible for funding. The requirement of the health service in Ireland in respect of whether direct Exchequer funding or access to the guarantee fund would be the most cost-effective approach can only be considered in the context of overall public sector arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">In response to Deputy Doherty, I wish to make clear that access to funding supported by the EIB guarantee in participating member states will be determined based on need and demand relative to the impact of Covid-19 and the related market situation. The EIB will make available additional financing in the context of the fund in all contributing member states, aiming for a geographic distribution that is proportionate to the economic impact of the crisis, the size of the economies and the available national and European support instruments. Deployment of funding will be subject to fund-specific concentration limits, including that the three member states that receive the most financing should not exceed 50% of the total fund financing. This excludes underlying financing structures that are, by their nature, multi-country, that is, covering two or more member states. The 15 member states that receive the least financing should exceed 10% of the total fund financing. These concentration limits will be reviewed and may be adjusted to reflect the evolving impact of the crisis and market needs in the various member states. Any change in the concentration limit will be subject to approval by the contributors' committee which will include a representative of each of the participating member states. There are no further economic conditions attached to an individual member state's membership of the guarantee fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> Deputy Doherty and others referred to the need for the EIB guarantee to be aimed primarily at SMEs. This fund is so aimed. One of the specific provisions of the fund is that €130 billion, or 65% of funding, will be allocated to companies with less than 249 employees. The remaining funding will be allocated in the following manner: €46 billion or 23% will be available for companies with 250 employees or more, €10 billion or 5% will be available for public sector companies and entities active in the areas of health or health research or providing essential services related to the health crisis, and €14 billion or 7% will be available for larger companies with up to 2,999 employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> I note Deputies' concerns regarding funding allocations to large corporations. I wish to assure them that this matter was given thorough consideration during all the negotiations involving member states. It was agreed that greater restrictions will apply on the amount and types of funding that can go to the largest companies, with additional safeguards in place regarding large corporates with more than 3,000 employees. The restrictions are that there will be no equity investments or asset-based securities operations, with support available only for working capital and supply chain finance. Financing will only be available through financial intermediaries with skin in the game and exposure to individual corporates will be limited to €250 million. In order to rule out strategic investment projects that could be interpreted as industrial policy, only loans in full alignment with the temporary state aid regime applicable for national schemes, including regarding short loan maturities, will be considered. Funding will only be available to sectors that are in line with the EIB long-term mission of innovation, the environment and SME support. There will be further involvement of participating member states represented on a contributors' committee on individual transactions, complemented with higher reporting requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> Deputies Verona Murphy, Fleming and Michael Collins referred to the difficulties that may be encountered by small and microenterprises in the context of meeting the cost of borrowing. One of the values of guarantee systems is that they reduce the levels of risk for lenders. This, combined with the triple A rating of the EIB, serves to increase the availability and reduce the cost of borrowing to small business. The SBCI will seek access to guaranteed capacity from the guarantee fund in order to continue to provide long-term unsecured lending to the SME market. The SBCI and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation are monitoring the requirement for a working capital support scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> In response to the comments of Deputy Shortall regarding austerity, it is clear from the Bill and the programme for Government that the Government is committed to recovery through investment and will draw on all available resources to maximise opportunities and supports for Irish businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> Deputies raised concerns about the pace of the legislation. The Bill deals with an extremely urgent matter and we are seeking to expedite its enactment. It is the first legislation to be brought forward by the Department of Finance since the Government was formed. The SURE instrument cannot be accessed by any member state until all member states have signed the guarantee agreement. The Commission needs guarantees from all the member states in order to access the bond markets on the best possible terms. Ireland cannot participate in the EIB pan-European guarantee fund unless the Bill is enacted. A lack of participation would have a direct impact on Irish businesses and public sector bodies as they cannot apply for finance supported by the fund until Ireland has signed a contribution agreement with the EIB.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> There is a risk that certain banks may refuse to sign up to loan schemes currently being developed by the SBCI to help SMEs deal with the Covid crisis due to an ambiguity regarding the circumstances in which the insurance Acts and regulations apply to the issuance of guarantees by the SBCI. The amendment in the Bill to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Act 2014 removes this ambiguity and brings greater certainty in that space.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> Deputies queried the potential conditions of the loans and whether they will reflect similar conditions which applied to historic loans. As I stated, this situation is the complete opposite of that referred to by the Deputies. It is a matter of European solidarity. Article 9(2) of the Commission regulations sets a limit of 10% of the maximum amount of borrowings by the Union that can fall due in any one year. This will smooth the repayment profile and ensure that borrowing will be structured to ensure that it is over different maturities. This is an important risk mitigation, ensuring that there cannot be a large calling-in of guarantees and minimising any residual risk to the Union's budget. Nonetheless, the guarantee agreement notes that the full amount of the guarantee is reflected in Ireland's share of this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> In regard to the amount that Ireland will draw down or whether we will draw it down, the SURE instrument offers a useful access stream to a pool of liquidity that has long-term maturity, which brings certainty for Ireland. However, it depends on the market rate and maturity of the loans offered by the Commission. That will be a matter with the NTMA over the coming period. The recovery strategy instruments announced later are designed to assist hard-hit economies to get back on their feet until after the Covid pandemic has passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> I thank Deputies across the House for their contributions. I appreciate their input into the Bill. If the Bill is passed this week, it will allow access to a significant stream of funding that will support SMEs and employment and assist in getting our economy back on track as we continue to drive through this crisis.</p>

I look forward to working with him over the coming years in a constructive and productive manner. Both of our parties share the same desire to transition to a greener society and economy but this must be done in a fair and just manner. Climate justice must be at the heart of the Government's approach to reducing carbon emissions.

            <p eId="para_59"> My question considers the greenhouse gas emissions projections report produced by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, last week.

            <p eId="para_60">I thank Deputy O'Rourke for his kind words and I look forward to working with him over the coming years. He is right that our parties share a common aim and ambition in terms of how we place this country at the centre of leadership in tackling the climate and biodiversity crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> As Minister with responsibility for climate action, I will lead on delivering our shared commitment to achieve an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Renewable energy will be at the heart of this transformation and my Department will drive the renewables revolution such that reliance on fossil fuels is reduced as quickly as possible and to the maximum extent possible. </p>
            <p eId="para_62"> The programme for Government’s green new deal commits to taking the steps to deliver at least 70% renewable electricity by 2030 by, <i>inter alia</i>: holding the first renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auction by the end of 2020, with auctions held each year thereafter, including the first RESS auction for offshore wind in 2021; giving cross-Government priority to the drafting of the marine planning and development Bill so that it is published as soon as possible and enacted within nine months; producing a whole-of-government plan setting out how we will deliver at least 70% renewable electricity by 2030 and how we will develop the necessary skills base, supply chains, legislation and infrastructure to enable it; finalising and publishing the wind energy guidelines; developing a solar energy strategy for rooftop and ground-based photovoltaics to ensure that a greater share of our electricity needs is met through solar power; continuing EirGrid’s programme, Delivering a Secure, Sustainable Electricity System, or DS3; implementing the national retrofit plan; and progressing the planning of the necessary offshore grid infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> Good progress is already being made on a number of these commitments and, next week, projects will compete in the first auction under the RESS auction system. This will deliver new renewable energy projects to the grid at scale, for the first time ever targeting solar farms to power Irish homes. Onshore and offshore wind will also be developed through the RESS auctions, with the first offshore wind auction planned for next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">Expanding our renewable energy sources will be key to achieving our carbon emissions targets. The recently published programme for Government states that this Administration is committed to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030. However, what has become clear is that this is an average of 7%, so it seems this Administration plans to backload most of the work to the latter half of this decade, passing the baton to the next Administration. The EPA report states that the full and early implementation of the 2019 climate action plan is needed. Does the Minister agree that now, rather than in the latter half of the decade, we have a prime opportunity to take advantage of the low interest rates for borrowing to invest in substantial renewable energy projects that can help us meet our targets and reduce our emissions?</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I agree fully that now is the time to invest and now is the time to act. However, some of those actions, such as introducing the maritime spatial planning legislation to allow us to develop offshore wind, will not actually deliver emissions reductions until the latter part of this decade. It does take that length of time. As to the scale of investment, we are talking of hundreds of millions if not billions of euro, which we should borrow now, but borrow in the knowledge that by the time we get through the planning system, build out the grid, contract the turbines and then install them, it will be the latter half of this decade when that kicks in. The 7% averaging is the correct approach. It is not like we can flick a switch and immediately have offshore wind. Certain products can be developed relatively quickly and, for example, solar farms in the field should not take that long to install. However, anyone involved in the industry would recognise they have already been planning for five or ten years just to get to the point of being able to bid in to develop those resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_66">I encourage and implore the Minister to use the opportunity of the July stimulus to be very ambitious for renewable energy. What are the plans for the inclusion of renewable energy projects in the July stimulus? I am aware there are barriers to the development of renewable energy, for example, there are regulatory barriers to offshore wind. I am particularly interested in the model of delivery of renewable energy resources, in particular community involvement, co-operatives and community-led projects. What plans has the Minister for developing different models of delivery?</p>

            <p eId="para_67">The delivery of renewables will have to be through both the large-scale projects, such as the offshore projects I have just mentioned, and much smaller projects, so that it is more widely owned. That starts, for example, in the retrofitting of buildings, where we will be taking out an oil or gas-fired boiler and putting in a heat pump powered with renewable electricity. This will help us to balance renewable power in the long run, when we have a large stock of heat pumps that we can turn on and off to match the wind power as it becomes available.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> That is an example of the projects we should be targeting in the immediate future – in the next year of the stimulus period - because it can be delivered quickly. Similarly, I agree fully that community involvement and community ownership of renewable power is going to be a critical component of this transformation and this just transition. There are mechanisms within the proposed auction system that will allow us to promote and ensure community ownership within the development of new projects. That political agreement among all parties in the House will help to deliver this as quickly as possible. </p>

At that time, a single individual was working on an informal basis, as much as anything else, to protect our systems. That has now been replaced with the new National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, which is located within my Department. It is the primary cybersecurity authority in the State and has a number of roles, including leading on cybersecurity incident response and on the resilience and security of critical infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> The NCSC contains the State’s computer security incident response team, CSIRT. This is the body that responds to the full range of cybersecurity incidents in the State. The CSIRT has international accreditations and operates its own, purpose-built, secure incident response software environment. Since its foundation in 2011, the CSIRT has developed significant expertise in managing cybersecurity incidents and now handles in excess of 2,000 incidents each year. The CSIRT has also developed and deployed the Sensor platform across Departments, and deployed malware information sharing platforms, MISPs, across a range of critical infrastructure operators.</p>
            <p eId="para_74"> The NCSC has a set of statutory powers to ensure critical infrastructure operators maintain and operate critical infrastructure in a secure manner. To date, 67 operators of essential services have been designated. The compliance team in the NCSC has been working with these entities to improve their security since 2018, and formal audits will start before the end of the current quarter. </p>
            <p eId="para_75"> The programme for Government commits to the implementation of the 2019 national cybersecurity strategy in full. This strategy includes a number of measures designed to ensure our level of preparedness remains appropriate to deal with likely future threats.</p>

            <p eId="para_76">I thank the Minister for that informative response. I commend his Department on publishing the national cybersecurity strategy in December of last year. It is a very good document. I am heartened that there is a significant reference to cybersecurity in the programme for Government. It is important considering the number of international technology firms based in the country and the increase in the move towards digitalisation and remote working as a result of the crisis we are going through.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> I am encouraged by the fact that a capacity review is taking place in the NCSC. This is vital, particularly considering how small the centre is. It has only 24 staff approximately, and it is operating on a shoestring budget of only €4 million per year, which is very small considering the major strategic risks the centre is attempting to protect this country against.</p>
            <p eId="para_78"> I have three questions. Is there any indication when the capacity review is likely to be completed? Will the Government commit to publishing it? Will it commit to implementing its recommendations?</p>

            <p eId="para_79">It is true that the importance of this work cannot be understated but I am confident, from my initial briefings from departmental officials, that the scale and expertise are sufficient in the office. The Deputy will be aware that there are other areas of expertise in the State, including in the Garda and Defence Forces, where there are additional resources. Bringing those resources together is often what is needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> I do not have a completion time for the review but I will ask the Department to revert directly to the Deputy on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> My philosophy in general, even on cybersecurity, is that openness and transparency are often among the best protections in terms of security in that people can see what our structures are and, if there are weaknesses, help us to address them. I will certainly be compelled to follow the advice in the recommendations once received. I would like to implement them as soon as I can. </p>

            <p eId="para_83"> The programme for Government has a specific reference to utilising the potential and important role of the Defence Forces in this regard.

            <p eId="para_84">I see the relationship as one of co-operation. Primary responsibility will lie with the NCSC. That is proper and it mirrors best practice throughout the EU, where it is in the civil authorities that overall control and cybersecurity management rest. That will involve a lot of collaboration and personnel moving from the Defence Forces into this area. That provides for a healthy level of operational cohesion. The Defence Forces have specific responsibilities, including in managing their own security and systems. That expertise feeds into the NCSC but primary responsibility rightly lies within our Department. That, however, does not preclude the provision of further resources to the Defence Forces. In the programme for Government talks, we discussed the Defence Forces Reserve and the possibility of building up cybersecurity capabilities through it that might assist with the Defence Forces' work and the wider work of the NCSC.</p>

            <p eId="para_86">I want to ask the Minister about the proposal to quadruple the carbon tax over the next ten years. Sinn Féin has pointed out consistently that without alternatives in place first, it is a punitive tax that will hit workers and families hard. It will associate positive climate change measures with a negative. Some 400,000 people are living in fuel poverty in this State. If they cannot afford to heat their homes now, they will not be in a position to pay a carbon tax.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_87">The programme for Government underlines that carbon tax has an important role to play in addressing behaviours with negative externalities, in this case greenhouse gas emissions. It, therefore, commits to increasing carbon tax to €100 per tonne by 2030, through annual increases of €7.50 per annum to 2029 and €6.50 in 2030.</p>
            <p eId="para_88"> The clear view of the joint Oireachtas committee was that the introduction of a carbon tax would have to be based on measures to prevent fuel poverty. It is in that context that the programme for Government contains a commitment to commission further research from the ESRI, to be published by October 2020, on how best to protect those affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_89"> The programme for Government also commits to hypothecating all additional carbon tax revenue into a climate fund, raising an estimated €9.5 billion over the next ten years. This fund will be utilised to ensure that the increases in the carbon tax are progressive by spending €3 billion on targeted social welfare and other initiatives to prevent fuel poverty and ensure a just transition. The fund will provide €5 billion to part-fund a socially progressive national retrofitting programme targeting all homes, but concentrating first on social housing and rental properties in which people are at risk of fuel poverty. Finally, we are committing to allocate €1.5 billion to a REPS-2-style programme to encourage and incentivise farmers to farm in a greener and more sustainable way. This funding will be additional to funding from the Common Agriculture Policy and it will include incentives to plant native forests and to enhance and support biodiversity on family farms. </p>
            <p eId="para_90"> A significant volume of research has been undertaken in recent years, by the ESRI and others, into the distributional impacts of carbon tax. This research has helped to inform decisions taken in the context of budget 2020 to ring-fence a portion of the additional revenues from increasing the tax to €26 per tonne. I refer to measures to address fuel poverty, including increases in the winter fuel allowance as well as additional funding for the warmer homes scheme. Investing in energy efficiency and low-cost renewable energy comprise the best way of eliminating fuel poverty.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">Sinn Féin agrees that we need to reduce our carbon emissions and meet our legally binding targets. It is on the approach to this that we differ from the Government, however. We believe climate action must be socially just and that we must protect people as we transition to a greener economy. It is not just Sinn Féin that disagrees on the approach being proposed by the Government. The Minister previously advocated a fee-and-dividend approach to carbon tax. At his party conference last year, he said the fee-and-dividend approach is progressive and benefits those on low incomes. He stated: "It is a clear immediate signal for everyone to reduce their carbon, but it doesn't hit people in the pocket." Has he completely abandoned that position? Will he outline the specific model of carbon tax that is being proposed?</p>

            <p eId="para_92">It is true that I was, and still am, an advocate of the fee-and-dividend model. At all times during the discussions of the joint Oireachtas committee at which we were focusing on how to protect people from fuel poverty, I said clearly that I would not rule out the hypothecation model if it could be designed and structured in a way that achieved the same objectives. I referred to the three-way split. Elements include the allocation of some €3 billion to increase social welfare provisions or other measures specifically to target people at risk of fuel poverty and investing particularly progressively in social housing and rental properties. The best way to address fuel poverty is to improve people’s homes. Another element is the allocation of €1.5 billion for an agricultural scheme, particularly aimed at small family farms. Census data or CSO data show this community is particularly left behind in the current economic system.</p>
            <p eId="para_93">The measures being set out can address that social justice objective. As I have said throughout this process, that was the primary aim that we sought to achieve.</p>

            <p eId="para_94">I am not persuaded by that argument. In my experience as a public representative in Meath I have seen that there is a cohort of people who will not benefit from the measures that are being proposed, who will see these measures as regressive and who will be disproportionately affected by them. These people are vulnerable and the imposition of a carbon tax without alternatives, which they do not and will not have, will be very difficult. I am not the only one who says this approach is a regressive one and some people in the Minister's party say the same.</p>
            <p eId="para_95"> I want to ask about the proposed €9.5 billion that the programme for Government says will be raised from the carbon tax. That is a massive commitment to make but there is no detail on how much of this will be raised per year and from what sources. Can the Minister outline some details on that?</p>

            <p eId="para_96">Again, I do not have the figures to hand but I will happily ask the Department to follow up on it and to forward to the Deputy the background statistics, which came from the Department of Finance's projection forward as I recall. Strangely, one would hope that in time as a variety of different measures kick in, including the carbon tax, our use of fuels will decrease and the revenue numbers will fall from that sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_97"> It is clear that carbon tax is an element of this but it is not the only one. The key measures are some of the investment decisions, not just in the use of this €9.5 billion but other private and public sector investments will also have to be made. The retrofitting programme alone is a €30 billion project for the next ten to 15 years. It is beyond compare in terms of the scale of investments we need to make. In that context, the carbon tax will help but it is not the only policy measure, nor is it the critical policy measure to my mind. We will need every measure, such is the scale of change we are seeking to bring about.</p>

            <p eId="para_99">I want to ask the Minister what measures his Department is taking to support the retention and protection of jobs in the midlands, with specific reference to Bord na Móna workers and those working in the horticultural sector. This question is being asked in the context of a just transition process that is being escalated. It is an unfair transition - it is not just. This question is also being asked in the context of Bord na Móna's decision to suspend all peat harvesting for 2020. There is significant concern around the impact on employment that these two realities have. I call on the Minister and this Government to support Bord na Móna in its appeal to recommence peat harvesting in order to safeguard jobs for as long as possible in the midlands, particularly in Offaly.</p>

            <p eId="para_100">The Deputy is right that the just transition we seek in the midlands is critical. It has to be delivered and it is the first real test of the nature of the change we will make as we start to reduce our emissions at scale. It is critical for Bord na Móna that we deliver alternative job opportunities to the sectors and regions most affected and that we ensure vulnerable groups are helped as transformative policies are implemented. The Government is committed to such a just transition, recognising the significant level of change required and that burdens borne must be seen to be fair. This includes support for the work under way in the midlands to deal with the challenges facing Bord na Móna, its employees and various contractors and businesses, including local services which depend on the current business model. A whole-of-government approach to addressing this challenge is being implemented. This involves working with local stakeholders to ensure the people impacted can be best supported.</p>
            <p eId="para_101"> A just transition fund of €11 million opened on Friday, 19 June and will make money available to support those with good project ideas in the areas of employment and enterprise, training and community supports, and to projects which can make a difference. The call closes on Friday, 17 July and my Department, working with colleagues from other Departments, is preparing to review the project applications and looks forward to being able to select strong project proposals and allocate money to the wider midlands region. An implementation plan is being prepared by my Department in response to the recommendations contained in the first report of the just transition commissioner, and urgent action has already been taken in some key areas. This includes both the just transition fund call for applications, which I have just mentioned, and working with Bord na Móna to facilitate the advanced rehabilitation of bog previously harvested for peat used in electricity generation.</p>

            <p eId="para_102">I thank the Minister for that response but I want to take up one point with him straight away. The Minister has not answered my question on whether he will support Bord na Móna in its appeal process to try to recommence peat harvesting in order to safeguard many jobs for as long as possible. We know that bog rehabilitation is spoken about but that will only provide handfuls of jobs in comparison to what we have now. I want to remind the Minister that this is an important employment source for many workers in the midlands, including in Offaly. The reality for workers is completely different from what is written on paper. I have had workers in my offices, many of them with young children and mortgages. Many environmental groups wave the green banner and are aspirational but have no consideration for the lives of others, for the communities or for the small businesses that will be affected by the policies they are advocating for. These people are still struggling to get on their feet and have not fully recovered from the recession. Instead of aspirations, we need common sense, pragmatism and assurances that job creation and retention will be top priorities for this Government in the midlands because we do not want to see our region further decimated. It still has not recovered, as I have said.</p>

            <p eId="para_103">The Deputy is right. Those constituents of hers have to be at the centre of all of our attention. The cessation of peat extraction for industrial peat, power generation or horticultural use is a matter that is being led by the courts. The political system cannot intervene in the judicial process in that regard. However, we can start to promote the alternatives that will create the jobs that give us a sustainable future and will provide growth for Bord na Móna and for other private operators involved in managing our bogs into the future. That is not involving a handful of jobs. It has to be hundreds and thousands of jobs. I hope we can look within the stimulus package to advance further measures that will use the expertise that exists within the Bord na Móna workforce in managing bogs to see the storage of carbon and the benefit to the environment, as well as long-term jobs potential in the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_104">I thank the Minister for that response and I understand the courts system but we need more than goodwill from the Government. We need strong assurances that the Government will support the retention of jobs for as long as possible, bearing in mind that this just transition was to last until 2030 and everyone was to be given a fair chance to adjust. We have not been given that fair chance. I want to ask the Minister, out of decency to the people of Offaly and the wider midlands area, to be fair about this.</p>
            <p eId="para_105"> I want to take another point up with the Minister. Will we see solid fuels imported into this country because of a decarbonisation strategy? Will we see something reflective of what happened in agriculture with the sugar beet industry? We saw sugar being imported and we saw where wrong decisions were made. I have fears of the same thing happening with fuel. That is why we need aspiration to be replaced by pragmatism and common sense and why we need to meet the needs of people in this State, including in the midlands. It is certain that we will have fuel poverty and that we will see imports coming in. I would like the Minister to answer those queries.</p>

            <p eId="para_106">The programme for Government commits that within the lifetime of the Government we will solve the air pollution problem, which is a particular problem for many towns in the midlands, by moving away from the use of all smoky products that add to the air quality problem, especially imported products. That is a commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_107"> Bord na Móna's new strategic plan that came out in response to the crisis that is facing the company needs to be more ambitious again, particularly when it comes to employment generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">I believe there is a real opportunity for the company, not just in the area I mentioned of managing bogs, to restore biodiversity and store carbon but also in the using of the company's logistics and energy skills. For example, the retrofit programme we spoke about earlier is the perfect sort of project for Bord na Móna to develop apprenticeships, employ younger people who will have a 30 or 40-year career in rolling out the scale of change we need to make. Similarly, in the development of renewable power, I believe the company has real potential in wind, solar and other power supply systems to develop an economic base for the midlands that is the best example of public enterprise, which is in the tradition of that company. It is through those sorts of initiatives where we can create jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_111">I thank Deputy O'Rourke. I am aware of the anger and the intense public concern in a variety of areas but I am also aware of the critical importance of this piece of infrastructure for the island of Ireland and for co-operation North and South and the benefits for all our people. It is critical to improving the efficient operation of the single electricity market and increasing security of electricity supply across the island. It will also help us to move towards a 70% renewable electricity target, which is a commitment made in the recent programme for Government. It will help us get a resilient and well-connected energy infrastructure, which is vital for our economic well-being, and the ability to respond to the future needs of energy consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_112"> I am aware that there are concerns in relation to the construction. The option of undergrounding the line has been assessed at length on several occasions over the years. Most recently, my Department published an independent study in October 2018 on undergrounding the interconnector, which found that an overhead line remained the most appropriate option for the proposed interconnector. The study report is available on the Department's website. It was the latest in a series of studies that reached the same conclusion and I do not intend to order a further review of the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_113"> This goes back to 2003 or 2004. The Cathaoirleach and I shared a seat when we were on the Oireachtas joint committee on energy, if he recalls, although it was 15 or 20 years ago, where the urgency of the project was outlined to us. That urgency remains. The benefits remain and I believe it can be built in a way that protects health, which is the first priority in any instance, which can deliver economic benefits, particularly in those counties each side of the Border. Where it has been difficult to get employment this will bring other ancillary benefits. I understand that the main problem is now North of the Border so if Deputy O'Rourke's colleagues, as an all-Ireland party, could help overcome those we will see real economic benefits to both sides of the Border, which is what I believe we all agree we seek to deliver.</p>

            <p eId="para_114">At the heart of this issue is a fundamental principle that will affect much of what we both want to achieve in terms of ambition around climate change, that is, the fundamental principle of public participation in decision-making. The Minister referenced the reviews that took place. He knows as well as I do that for every one of those reviews there is a real criticism in terms of the scope, nature and extent of the review and the comparisons that were drawn upon. At every hand's turn we have seen a case where the community position on it has not been meaningfully taken on board. That leaves a very bad taste and huge resistance locally. I ask the Minister, as a follow-up question, what the cost of this project has been to date. I am standing by that position. Unless there is a meeting of minds in respect of this we will throw good money after bad and this project will not be delivered.</p>

            <p eId="para_115">The most recent estimates I have from the Department on the cost of the project is that €180 million will be incurred in the South, with the remaining €109 million being incurred in Northern Ireland. The total figure estimated by the International Expert Commission was a cost of €230 million. I do not have the figure for the cost incurred to date but I imagine it is not insignificant given, as I said, that this project has been many years within the planning process and has been reviewed extensively going back at least ten years in my recollection.</p>
            <p eId="para_116"> I return to the key point. I believe this project will deliver real value for money. My last memory of the cost of not having this facility is that it would be approximately €30 million a year that the Irish customer is currently paying through much higher bills than would otherwise be the case if we had the interconnector, so there are real savings to be achieved. More than that, this is fundamental to whether we have an all-island energy policy. We are at real risk of cutting off the North and at real cost, not just to the South but also to the citizens in Northern Ireland. My real concern is that this would divide our island at a time when I would prefer to see us having a shared island.</p>

            <p eId="para_117">I do not disagree with the Minister on a number of those points but I believe we are not speaking to each other in this exchange. We are speaking past each other because the points I am raising are the points that have been raised by the community and it is my firm opinion that unless we address those concerns specifically we will not make progress. The Minister has responsibility for delivering this project. I am asking him, as a constituency TD who wants to see the project delivered, how he intends to deliver it. My firm opinion is that it will not be delivered in the current form and reasonable concerns have been raised by local communities about the nature of the proposal, how it was developed and the alternatives that exist. There is a forensic level of knowledge in the local community and I give them great credit in that regard. I know that currently there is not access to the lands. I do not see that at any point in time in the future. There have been signs up in those communities for ten years. How will the Minister deliver this project, which is a commitment of the Government, in light of the huge community resistance?</p>

            <p eId="para_118">I hope we are not speaking past each other. I want to be as honest and up-front as I can be in saying I believe the project should proceed under the planning permission it has and in line with all the reviews that were done. My personal view, having looked at this in real depth and detail over the years, is that I do not believe it is technically possible or optimal to do it with an alternative design. As I said, we have to be very cognisant of health and local communities as we are building it but I believe the current proposal is the best way of doing that so I will be supportive of that. One of the biggest obstacles now is in the political system in Stormont. My hope is that we can work with our colleagues in the Assembly to minimise any downsides for local communities but to make sure we do not miss the strategic importance of uniting our island energy markets, which is something we agree on across the political spectrum.</p>

            <p eId="para_120">At the outset I offer my congratulations formally to the new Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. We laboured together in the vineyard on the communications committee in the previous term so I have full confidence that the Minister is more than <i>au fait</i> with the issue. I look forward to engaging with him on this and on transport matters, which are also close to my heart. I am aware the Minister's new responsibilities will encompass that also. I wish him the best of luck in the term ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_121"> My question is on broadband provision and roll-out. I welcome both the commitment in the programme for Government and reports in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> recently that there is the potential for some accelerated delivery of the national broadband plan. I ask the Minister to elaborate on how that might be achieved and whether it will be uniformly achieved across the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_122">I thank Deputy Lawless. I look forward to his next term in the vineyard of policy ideas. He worked very effectively on the digital transformation that we need to achieve so I look forward to continuing to work with him on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_123">Rolling out the national broadband plan, NBP, will be central to that. This plan will provide high-speed broadband to the 1.1 million people living and working in the nearly 540,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms and 695 schools, where commercial operators currently will not commit to deliver the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_124"> The State-led intervention will be delivered by National Broadband Ireland, NBI, under a contract signed on 19 November 2019. The NBP network will offer users a high-speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 150 Mbps from the outset.  By the end of next year, National Broadband Ireland plans to pass about 115,000 premises, with between 70,000 and 100,000 passed each year thereafter until roll-out is completed. All counties will see premises passed in the first two years and more than 90% of premises in the State will have access to high-speed broadband within the next four years.</p>
            <p eId="para_125"> Design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 17 counties and steady progress is being made, with more than 40,000 premises surveyed to date. This survey work is feeding into detailed designs for each deployment area and the laying of fibre should commence shortly with the first fibre to the home connections expected around December of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_126"> The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of good broadband to ensuring that citizens across Ireland can avail of remote working, education and other essential online facilities. Recognising this, the programme for Government commits to seeking to accelerate the roll-out of the national broadband plan. The programme for Government also recognises that the NBP will be a key enabler to many of the policies envisaged, particularly around increased levels of remote working.</p>
            <p eId="para_127"> My Department is currently engaging with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP roll-out and to bring premises which are scheduled for connection in years 6 and 7 of the current plan forward to an earlier date. These discussions are ongoing and a preliminary position will be arrived at by the end of the summer. It is premature at this point to speculate on what premises may benefit from this potential change, other than to say that those premises currently scheduled for the latter end of the roll-out are the focus of the analysis.</p>

            <p eId="para_128">I thank the Minister for his answer. The Minister listed several numbers of homes with various target dates. This is welcome but I am particularly interested in the potential for acceleration. I must confess that I was a sceptic in respect of the national broadband plan in the last Dáil but it is in progress, so I wish it Godspeed. We need to roll it out as fast as we possibly can. One of the reasons I was somewhat sceptical is that I believed, and still believe, that there are ways to achieve wider coverage in an accelerated fashion instead of or in parallel with the national broadband plan. One of those approaches, contained in legislation I published during the last Dáil, included a rapid roll-out broadband planning framework. This would allow site-sharing, the reuse of kit and the compilation of an inventory of kit, the standardisation of area plans and planning frameworks, consolidating planning regulations across local authorities and many other things. This legislation included a provision for new planning permission to require ducting to the threshold. From previous committee meetings I know the Minister probably shares my view on this. There are several ways this could be done. I may re-examine that Bill for this new Dáil. These measures can be taken in parallel with and as complements to the national broadband plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_129"> The Minister mentioned years six and seven. To be local about it, some of my constituents in places like Eadestown and Kilteel in north-east Kildare are 20 km from Dublin city centre. In terms of broadband service provision, however, they are as rural as the west of Ireland or parts of Connemara. They cannot wait until year six or seven for this to happen. There is a large contingent of people who are currently working from home or engaged in high-intensity activity. It is imperative that they receive the service as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_130">I thank the Deputy. This plan was debated extensively throughout the lifetime of the last Dáil. Whatever my concerns around ownership issues and contractual arrangements, and they were real concerns, I was always supportive of the need for a rural broadband system. I am happy to take responsibility for making sure that we deliver it. It is not the only critical infrastructure that we need. Outside the areas covered by the broadband plan, ongoing investment from the likes of Eir, SIRO and other operators will be needed. I absolutely agree with some of the options mentioned by the Deputy, such as improving planning permission requirements so that ducting is included in any new building project, including homes. That absolutely makes sense, as does the sharing of masts or other site systems. This plan does not prevent us from engaging with a range of other initiatives. It does ensure that we leave nobody behind. In light of the increased importance and benefits of broadband, I particularly wish to accelerate delivery to those houses that were previously expected to be provided for in latter years. I hope to deliver to them ahead of schedule.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Lawless<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_131">I thank the Minister. Going back to the heart of the question, I wish to reiterate the proposals which I may discuss with the Minister. They are complementary to the national broadband plan rather than an alternative to it. I am trying to get a greater understanding of the suggestion that there is a potential for accelerated roll-out. Is that driven by technology, geography or commercial factors? That understanding will help us to realise whether this acceleration can be applied uniformly across the country or whether particular clusters will be in the fortunate position of receiving broadband more quickly. I hope the acceleration is technology-driven, and in a procedural sense I hope we can apply it uniformly so that the entire country receives a broadband connection in the same advanced manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_132"> If I may touch on the Minister's other responsibilities and an area of common interest, this has many benefits across the board. That hardly needs to be restated. I travelled this morning by train from Sallins in north Kildare. The trains are not full, but even with the pandemic and the reduced economic capacity they are beginning to get busy again. We are at the very early stages of reopening. The sooner we can enable people to work at home to avoid those commutes, the faster we can tackle multiple issues pertaining to the environment, quality of life, public transport capacity constraints etc. I really cannot stress the importance of this enough. Perhaps we might examine that legislation or other options. I am very interested in the specifics of the accelerated roll-out that has been flagged in the programme for Government and the recent <i>Business Post </i>reports.</p>

            <p eId="para_133">Like so many other projects the national broadband plan has been delayed slightly by the Covid-19 pandemic due to the difficulty of completing certain work but it has not been delayed as much as other projects. A lot of the work of recent months, such as surveying poles to see which ones need to be improved or upgraded, could continue. By the end of this year we expect to be pretty much on target in terms of delivery timelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_134"> I note another factor that may help accelerate progress. We started this project in a world where it was very hard to get construction workers. There were so many different demands and construction activities taking place. Post Covid-19 it may be a possible to access workers and contractors more quickly than was the case six months ago when the economy was at full tilt.</p>
            <p eId="para_135"> Moreover, hopefully there is a benefit for everyone in this. Acceleration might be helped by increased confidence that the uptake of these services will be on the higher end of our expectations, because we are seeing the benefits of remote working and the use of high-speed broadband in a way we would not have expected six months ago. I hope that might help us to accelerate the process to the benefit of all concerned. </p>

            <p eId="para_139">I thank Deputy Duncan Smith. This is one of the most interesting areas. One learns so much about the infrastructure that supports our society. I look forward to working with the Deputy on this common cause.</p>
            <p eId="para_140"> The high-speed broadband map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>, shows the areas in north County Dublin which will be included in the national broadband plan's State-led scheme, as well as areas targeted by commercial operators. The map is colour-coded and searchable by address and Eircode postcode. Premises in the amber area will be provided with high-speed broadband through the State-led Intervention, the contract for which was signed in November 2019. Some 6,050 premises in Dublin Fingal fall into this category.</p>
            <p eId="para_141"> The blue area represents those areas where commercial providers are currently delivering or have plans to deliver high-speed broadband services. Some 57,338 premises in Dublin Fingal fall into this category.</p>
            <p eId="para_142">The light blue area represents Eir's commercial rural deployment plans to roll out high-speed broadband to 300,000 premises, including in Wexford, as part of a commitment agreement signed in April 2017. A total of 194 premises in Dublin Fingal fall into this category.</p>
            <p eId="para_143"> The NBP network will offer premises within the amber intervention area a high-speed broadband service with the minimum download speeds I mentioned earlier and passing 115,000 premises, also as stated earlier. All counties will see premises passed in the first two years and more than 90% of premises will have access to high-speed broadband within the next four years. Design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 17 counties and progress is being made in serving in excess of 40,000 premises surveyed to date. I am advised that contractors are due to begin surveying townlands in Skerries in late quarter 3 of 2020. Further information on deployment activities associated with the roll-out can be found on the NBI website <i>http://www.nbi.ie</i>. </p>

            <p eId="para_145">The website is useful up to a point, and has been for a number of years, in identifying the townlands. The issue is knowing how long these townlands will remain amber or when they will go live with broadband. That is a big job for the Minister to deliver on. Throughout the pandemic we have seen the benefits of working from home, but we have also seen the challenges. Some households in the constituency I represent may have two adults along with one, two or three children all needing broadband to work or study from home.</p>
            <p eId="para_146"> People have often had to use the mental health services. Yesterday the Covid committee heard a presentation on the challenges that poor Internet provision brings to online mental health provision. North County Dublin is as rural as areas in counties Mayo, Kerry, Wicklow, Meath and others. Similar to those areas, it needs a broadband service. Those townlands will need timelines as well as their colour coding.</p>

            <p eId="para_147">The Deputy is right. Everything has changed following the pandemic. Householders are rightly seeking information.</p>
            <p eId="para_148"> In Dublin Fingal some 6,050 premises are due to be provided with broadband under the NBP scheme. In the current plans the blue area where commercial operators are delivering or have plans to deliver, it is almost ten times that number at 57,000. That is subject to change. I expect other operators, some of which I mentioned earlier, to respond to what they see as an increase in demand. Even the networks were under serious pressure during the pandemic because the volume of data we were all using went through the roof. Our networks held up for the most part but the current system is probably at maximum capacity. As well as the NBP, we will need significant private sector investment to respond to that demand. I hope to get clarity and certainty on that, working with those operators to ensure they roll out and demonstrate to their customers where they are rolling out new networks because there is demand there.</p>

            <p eId="para_149">I urge caution on the private sector and having to row back on them. With a new Government and a Minister with a strong track record in fighting for this, we need to strengthen the NBP and give confidence to people that it will deliver. Those 6,050 households cannot be left behind at the end of the list. The State needs to provide them with what is now an essential service. Communication about this is key. We have had issues whereby broadband technology and infrastructure has gone halfway up a laneway in north County Dublin because they have bundled a number of houses rather than a geographical area. All these factors undermine the confidence in broadband provision, not only in north County Dublin and in Fingal, but throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_150"> I understand what the Minister is saying about the capacity issues, but we need the State to lead on this. It is his responsibility to improve confidence in the national broadband plan to deliver for north County Dublin and the rest of the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_151">I agree with the Deputy. Some very high-profile people have criticised the NBP. Strategically for the State, the guarantee that no house will be left out is critical. It is not relying on the market and we will intervene in areas where the market cannot or will not deliver. The mapping of that has been done and it is effective. The broad approach in identifying those houses is the correct one.</p>
            <p eId="para_152"> The Deputy is correct that there has been considerable frustration in houses where they see fibre or cable going up part of a road and then stop. The advantage of the NBP is in hopefully now a four or five-year rather than a six or seven-year timeframe - some such accelerated timeframe - we will cover every single house. That will be critical for the entire country.</p>

            <p eId="para_157">Congratulations to you as well, a Chathaoirligh. I am happy to respond to your question. Over the years we have worked on various committees together and I think you will agree that is where the most important work of the Oireachtas is done.</p>
            <p eId="para_158"> The programme for Government sets out our ambition to more than halve our carbon emissions over this decade. The action we take in the coming years will be critical in addressing the climate crisis, which renders our current economic model redundant and threatens our safe future on this planet. </p>
            <p eId="para_159"> As Minister with responsibility for climate action, I will lead on delivering our shared commitment to achieve an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The 2050 target will be set in law in the climate action Bill, which I will introduce in the Dáil within the first 100 days of Government. </p>
            <p eId="para_160"> With the increased scale and depth of this ambition, new strategies will be needed to sustain a reduction trajectory that will increase over time. I will work with colleagues across government to develop a new climate action plan before year end, with additional initiatives in every sector to bring about the significant change needed to transform our society.</p>
            <p eId="para_161"> While this will be challenging, requiring fundamental changes in how we live our lives, we will improve the health, welfare and security of our society, as well as realising enormous opportunities in a new, decarbonised economy. Climate change means the fossil fuel-based economic model is no longer fit for purpose. It is crucial that as we rebuild, we make the necessary structural changes to break the link between fossil fuels and economic progress. To this end, the Government is committed to ensuring that the economic recovery is a green recovery, delivered in a fair way that ensures that no sector of our society or community is left behind. The July stimulus and the national economic plan will seek to front-load investment to this end.</p>
            <p eId="para_162"> Critical to this process will be the Oireachtas joint committee which is due to be set up under the programme for Government. I hope it will carry on the good work done in the previous Dáil by a similar Oireachtas committee. It should be a cross-party and fully collaborative effort.</p>

            <p eId="para_164">I wish the Minister well in his new role. I look forward to working with him. We have many of the same goals and I hope we can progress those during this Dáil.</p>
            <p eId="para_165"> The NECP was due to be submitted to the EU at the end of 2019 but was delayed because of the general election and the Government formation process. When will the Minister work with the European Commission to advance a stronger national energy and climate plan for 2030? When will the Department submit the NECP, which was previously on hold due to having an interim Government in place? How does he plan to make the NECP a stronger document?

            <p eId="para_166">I look forward to working with the Deputy and bringing her expertise into play on where we go from here.</p>
            <p eId="para_167"> There was an informal meeting of the European Council of environment ministers yesterday. Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European Commission, set out the approach the Commission is planning to take this autumn and into the new year under the German Presidency. The German minister also outlined that. We hope to see and be part of a major acceleration in ambition across the European Union to help the Union play its part in meeting the Paris climate goals. In that regard I expect to have a further phone call with the vice-president of the Commission, tomorrow I think, to set out our plans for progressing the NECP. I understand data have already been submitted setting out the emissions reduction that could come from the existing climate action plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_168">That may well provide a baseline for our contribution but we will immediately switch to working with the European Commission. By the end of September they are looking to do an assessment of what increased ambition might be possible across different nation states, taking into account those baseline national energy and climate plan, NECP, submissions. We look to have climate legislation in the autumn that would commit the European Union towards a net zero 2050 target in CO2 reductions, with a new effort-sharing mechanism to show how the EU as a whole would achieve that by 2030. If this is agreed by the European Union, which I hope it can be by the end of this year, it will lead to the development of a new NECP, which will meet and match the newer higher target that the programme for Government commits to. That is the process I see us working on with the European Union to deliver higher ambition. It has to involve engagement with the Oireachtas joint committee, the special Cabinet sub-committee on climate action, biodiversity and the environment, and all actors in Irish society. This must be central to the new national economic plan. The approach I look to take will put in our baseline what the climate action plan shows, we will immediately start working with the European Commission on how we set out a higher ambition target and get agreement in the European Council for that, and then deliver the NECP, which will deliver on that sort of commitment. That is the approach I am thinking of taking.</p>

            <p eId="para_169">I thank the Minister. Can I take it that the existing NECP will be submitted and then the Minister will work on a new version of it that will strengthen aspects of it? During the consultation process, many environmental groups raised a number of issues such as the need for: an overall economy-wide carbon budget to be included in the document; a plan for the cessation of offshore fossil fuel exploration; a formal revision of the national mitigation plan; and nature-based solutions to be incorporated into it, which I am very passionate about. We tend to silo issues of biodiversity against issues of technological advances when it comes to climate. Is the Minister prepared to take nature-based solutions into consideration in the new NECP?</p>

            <p eId="para_170">Yes to most, or all, of those comments. The Commission will work now on the new higher ambitions. Sending in the outgoing NECP proposal around the climate action plan will give us a baseline by which the new Commission can do its assessment of what a higher ambition will target, and how we would contribute to the higher ambition of at least 50% to 55% emission reductions across the European Union. This is what we now need to work on with the Commission, having moved on from the old baseline level, which everyone agrees now needs to be increased.</p>
            <p eId="para_171"> The Deputy also referred to offshore oil and gas exploration, and I would include imports of liquefied natural gas, LNG. We have to achieve that objective at the same time. Critically, I agree with the Deputy on that central fact. I will also seek to call the Cabinet environment committee the committee on climate action, biodiversity and the environment. We are in a biodiversity crisis, as well as a climate crisis, and the solutions to the climate crisis will help us in addressing the biodiversity crisis in a whole range of different ways. It is absolutely critical that we do this as an integrated project, and not just tackle the climate crisis but also the biodiversity crisis at the same time. I wholeheartedly agree with the Deputy on that.</p>

            <p eId="para_172">It will be very important to bring people along on this journey with us. What does the Minister propose for engagement and consultation over the coming year? It seems there will be a considerable body of work to be done in that regard. How will the Minister involve our community and expert involvement in that? How will the Minister ensure that this document becomes, essentially, a living document? Scientific knowledge and technological advances are happening all the time. How do we make sure to incorporate those advances on an ongoing basis to make the NECP the most up-to-date plan based on best scientific knowledge at the time?</p>

            <p eId="para_173">Dialogue is key. The Oireachtas committee will have a role in that. We represent communities and can provide a forum where people can come in, on the record, to engage in the whole process. We also need to go beyond that and beyond the regional assemblies that have been set up so far, to much more local and detailed discussions on what this transition is going to look like. From my perspective, the broad European approach gives us room because it is not a case of top down or that the Commission knows best. It is trying to agree on the broad, overall effort-sharing arrangement, while leaving nation states free to be flexible around the solutions that exist. The climate fund, which allows communities or businesses to come forward with ideas, is a good example of the existence of bottom-up solutions here and not just top down. We will debate the National Oil Reserves Agency (Amendment) and Provision of Central Treasury Services Bill 2020 later today, which will help to support that. Critically, and particularly in areas such as retrofitting of homes, improvement of local environment through afforestation, rewetting or through other mechanisms, it will not work with just a top-down approach. It has to involve community engagement, community energy and the supply of new systems. That involves us listening and engaging with local communities to make it their plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_177"> Programme for Government commitments will be incorporated into a new statement of strategy for my Department, required under the Public Service Management Act 1997. The new strategy, which will be published within six months, will set out our vision and mission for the next three years across a broad portfolio, encompassing climate action, energy, communications networks, environment, waste management and natural resources. It will reflect the commitments to be delivered over the five-year lifetime of the programme for Government. This includes: a national clean air strategy; seeking to accelerate the roll-out of the national broadband plan, achieving an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030; delivering a national aggregated model of retrofitting reaching more than 500,000 homes by 2030; developing a major drive to realise the immense potential of Ireland’s offshore renewable sector; enacting the climate action (amendment) Bill; and completing and implementing a major waste and circular economy action plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_178"> The statement of strategy will be developed in consultation with interested stakeholders and will identify the steps required to ensure that the commitments set out in the programme for Government are achieved. When complete, the statement of strategy will be presented to both Houses. My Department will commence work with this shortly.</p>

I had thought they might be grouped. For the purpose of making this exchange a little bit useful, perhaps the Minister could focus his response on the plan as it is envisaged to roll out, the weakness of the plan from the Minister's perspective, and what he will bring to the plan in his position of Minister to improve on it and to bring about prioritisation of its rapid delivery.</p>

            <p eId="para_181">After years of working in this area, it is my assessment that we often focus on the technology, the wires, the hardware and the way one gets digital information moved from one place to the other. I believe that the key issue for success is in the use and actual behavioural side of it and in what ways the technology is used. The actual soft application side can be more important than the aspect we all focus on, which is the technology side. One must have the technology to be able to start using it but if we can take that as a given, I believe that the real key issue with the national coming in.broadband plan will be what type of societal changes, benefits and usage it will encourage. An example related to the current situation in Covid-19 is that in my Department, there are very few workers </p>
            <p eId="para_182">Largely, the Civil Service is working remotely to show a lead in protecting public health and safety. There is a question of how remote working might work best. In the future, it will be flexible in a variety of ways, people might come into work for three or four days a week rather than five, but we might also look at other mechanisms. For instance we can take high-speed broadband connections, particularly in a village or town, and create community enterprise centres where people would work remotely but not at home. There would be an opportunity for social interaction, community enterprise and some of the benefits of being in a shared office where people spark off each other and have ideas. Creating community enterprise hubs around that use of the broadband connection is one example of how we can use the system and services we have. Similarly, what can we learn from the last six months for e-learning and life-long learning, and how we use these video conferencing and other systems? That side of usage is critical for success as much as the technology itself.</p>

            <p eId="para_183">I appreciate the response and understand the perspective. Very significant societal changes will come with the full implementation of this plan. During the lockdown, as RTÉ reported, one of the digital hubs in my area did not have high-speed broadband connection. The building existed, with the tables, chairs and offices, but they did not have the broadband infrastructure to make it work. It is crucial that the system is in place to deliver it and that the broadband plan is delivered as quickly and to as high a standard as possible. What is the Minister's view of the timeframe for the roll-out and the model of delivery? The comparison has often been drawn with the ESB. Does the Minister support the model that is there? Will the project proceed as proposed or will there be a review?</p>

            <p eId="para_184">On the last point, I do not believe the contractual arrangements are agreed about the exact route network options that will be used. In opposition, and now in government, I have argued there is much strategic sense in using the ESB network in deploying some of this architecture, and that there is real benefit. There is an electricity wire going to every house in the country. That might provide some synergy in developing broadband.</p>
            <p eId="para_185"> To give a specific example of how the roll-out to work, the first phase of about 300 broadband connection points was to be the first roll-out. Many were in rural areas, perhaps connecting to a local school, GAA club or community centre. People in rural constituencies in particular, might ask how we can benefit from the technology starting with those 300 connection points which we expect to see rolled out by the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_186">In my experience information and communication on this are really important. People are really frustrated about access to information. People do a tremendous job in trying to get a forensic knowledge of broadband in their local areas. They are able to say what lines are going where and they have engaged with the different utility providers. The experience of dealing with the utility providers can be very frustrating. Meath County Council has a broadband officer, Cormac McCann. He is a fantastic resource to public representatives in the area, he has a forensic knowledge of what is happening on a county-wide basis. I do not know the basis by which he is employed in the council but I commend the approach. Perhaps the Minister might roll the approach out more widely. Information is key on the broadband roll-out and people really appreciate being well informed.</p>

            <p eId="para_187">Often during Minister's questions, a Minister will respond by saying they will revert to the Deputy with further information. In this case, I will throw it back the other way and ask the Deputy if he will provide me with much more details about that officer in Meath County Council. If it is working well, it is something we could examine and support and ensure that every other council does the same. This is exactly the sort of learning by doing, learning by best practice and swapping stories that we need to do. If the Deputy sent me a specific note on that, I would welcome it.</p>

            <p eId="para_189">I fully support increased climate ambition at EU level and welcome the publication of the EU climate law proposal, including the delivery of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions at EU level by 2050. The EU climate law is currently under negotiation in the Council, and the impact assessment to increase the EU 2030 climate ambition will be published this summer with a view to reaching agreement later this year. While the targets and ambitions under the European green deal are still being negotiated, I will continue to progress Ireland's increased climate ambition.

            <p eId="para_193">Those targets will probably not be ambitious enough. My sense from yesterday's European Council meeting is that there was a clear majority of Ministers representing a majority of states and population who were willing to look at a higher reduction target than 40% but a reduction of 50% to 55%. It has not been possible to get European Union agreement on it yet but I believe that it is close and must be achieved by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_194"> That will have knock-on consequences. To achieve the 32% target for renewables or the 32.5% efficiency target, it will not be sufficient to meet the higher target. It will require raising ambition across all sectors. Both the European climate Bill and our own legislation will focus on the net-zero target for 2050. It is then the job of the climate advisory committee to the Government and all bodies to set out the series of five-year trajectories that will allow us to meet that higher target.</p>

            <p eId="para_196">I hope to have it in September or October, whenever the 100-day limit is. It must come within that sort of timeframe. The benefit of that timeframe is that it will be in tune with the timing of the European climate legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_197">It will also allow us to be in tune with the new national economic plan which has to incorporate the scale of change that brings. People have asked why the target is 7% per annum. The science demands it. It brings a scale of change without historic comparison in terms of the speed and change it will bring. This changes everything. The climate Bill is only the start. It is the enabling legislation to put in place one of the institutional structures that will help us to deliver it. Many other not only legislative measures but budgetary measures, economic plans and consultation will be required, consultation, as mentioned earlier, probably being the biggest, most important to ensure everyone is behind the scale of change we need.</p>

            <p eId="para_198">22. <b>Deputy James O'Connor</b> asked the <b>Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment</b> his plans to upgrade the broadband infrastructure in eastern areas of County Cork which has poor connectivity that is hampering development within the area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_199">I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on his appointment at Cabinet and to a very exciting and important portfolio, particularly in a 21st century economy. I have an interest in the transport area, having done a great deal of work on it at a local authority level alongside many fine Green Party councillors in the constituency of Cork East.</p>
            <p eId="para_200"> Based on the Department's high-speed broadband map one can see that the Cork East area, which I represent, is in need of State intervention. In the national broadband plan, it is marked as an amber zone. Currently, Cork East is heavily dependent on commercial operators for broadband coverage. As we enter a new normal and with the increased number of people working remotely and reliant on commercial services, which are clearly inadequate, unsustainable and unacceptable, I ask the Minister to elaborate on the progress of the roll-out of the national broadband plan for Cork East.</p>

            <p eId="para_201">I thank the Deputy for his kind words. I look forward to working with him, hopefully in closer quarters when we return to the Dáil Chamber. </p>
            <p eId="para_202"> The high-speed broadband map shows the areas in Cork East which will be included in the national broadband plan, as well as areas targeted by commercial operators. As I said earlier, the map is colour coded and searchable by address and Eircode. Premises in the amber area will be provided with high-speed broadband through the State-led intervention, the contract for which was signed in November last with National Broadband Ireland, NBI. There are 16,200 premises in Cork East falling into this category. The blue area represents those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high-speed broadband services and covers 25,087 premises in Cork East. The light blue area represents Eir's commercial rural deployment plans for high-speed rural broadband, including Cork East as part of a commitment agreement. Some 177 premises in Cork East fall into this category.</p>
            <p eId="para_203"> The NBP network will offer those premises a high-speed connection of 150 Mbps. All counties will see premises passed in the first two years and over 90% of premises will have access to high-speed broadband within the next four years. Design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 17 counties and progress is being made on the over 40,000 premises surveyed to date. Contractors have commenced surveying in surrounding areas of Midleton. Surveying in the Youghal and surrounding areas is due to commence early next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_204"> The Government is currently engaging with National Broadband Ireland to explore accelerating aspects of the plan and to bring forward premises which are currently scheduled in years six and seven to an earlier date. These discussions are ongoing and a preliminary position will be arrived at by the end of the summer.</p>

            <p eId="para_205">I welcome the Minister's response. According to a report in 2019 by a major phone operator, the creation of regional digital hubs could generate in the region of €312 million for the regional economy and create over 8,400 new jobs across over 1,000 new businesses. I am sure that the Minister will agree that to ensure rural towns and villages, such as those in Cork East, do not disappear there will need to be balanced regional development in the programme for Government. Key broadband infrastructure is vital in this regard. Main streets, including in my own town in Youghal, could benefit from such initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_206"> I would like to give the Minister an indication of the shortfalls that exist. In some of the areas that I canvassed, including in Inch near my own home between Killeagh and Youghal, there are houses that in 2020 still do not have home phone connections, which is hard to believe. I am happy to work with the Minister to address the shortfalls that exist across many rural areas in the constituency.</p>

            <p eId="para_207">I would be happy to do that. I agree with the Deputy's assessment that the establishment of digital hubs provides huge opportunities, particularly for Irish towns and villages, to restore commercial and retail life to the centre of our historic streets in our towns. In terms of an example, the Ludgate Hub in Skibbereen has shown how we can progress. There are other examples. The commitment in the programme for Government to a towns first type policy, which is about restoring enterprise to the centre of our streets and communities, will be critical. It is in tune with what is happening in other countries and here in towns that are starting to succeed on the back of good planning. Broadband is a critical part of that planning. I am happy to work with the Deputy in trying to roll out broadband and the centres as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_209">One of the areas on which we can work together is the identification of premises that might be appropriate. Local authorities and community enterprise have a critical role in identifying premises for the creation of such digital hubs. By definition being wireless they can be located anywhere. The purpose of the national broadband plan is to bring connectivity to the individual house. For retailers, publicans and other community facilities that have experienced difficulty in recent years digital hubs provide us with an opportunity to transition them into new community enterprise centres facilitated with high-speed connectivity. Councillors and colleagues in east Cork, west Cork and every county, in particular rural areas of the country, need to start identifying those types of premises, working with the local authorities to try to provide the connection but also the other facilities that would make them vibrant community enterprise centres.</p>

            <p eId="para_212">It is vital that we ensure that community energy can play a role in reaching at least 70% renewable electricity, including a community benefit fund and a community category within the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auction; and that we aim to continue to work with the EU to agree community participation as an integral part of installing new renewable energy and a route for community participation in the projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_213"> The renewable electricity support scheme, which will support the development of many dozens of renewable projects nationwide over the next decade, includes a separate community category in its first auction to be held later this month. The category is open only to projects that are at least 51% owned by the local community and we understand that some of the projects entering the category are 100% community-owned. The category has a capacity allocation of 30 GW hours, enough to support several projects, both solar and wind. </p>
            <p eId="para_214"> In future onshore RESS auctions we expect to see increasing numbers of community projects being supported. To ensure a pipeline of such projects we plan to establish an enabling framework of capacity-building supports that will include information dissemination, trusted intermediary and adviser services, feasibility grants, soft development loans and a simplified grid connection process. Together with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, my Department has already commenced planning the development of this enabling framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_215"> While nurturing a new community energy sector, the vast majority of projects successful in RESS will be larger developer-led projects. </p>
            <p eId="para_216">Ensuring local communities benefit from these projects is also a key objective. To that end, all projects successful in RESS must establish a community benefit fund in the annual dispersal of which locals will have a substantive say. My officials are also exploring further community participation in renewable energy projects for future auctions under RESS.</p>

          <p eId="para_217">I raise the issue of the sacking of the former Minister, Deputy Cowen. Many were left scratching their heads as to what changed between 2 p.m. and 9 p.m. yesterday. The Taoiseach moved very swiftly from fully backing his man to sacking him. People wonder whether the Taoiseach learned something new and whether there is another twist in the tale or another piece of information. The truth, however, is that the Taoiseach knew this whole sorry story from the very beginning, unlike the rest of us who learned of it piecemeal. Did the Taoiseach share the full story with the Tánaiste and with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on 4 July, when he learned the full story, or did he feed it to them piecemeal?</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> He had the full story and he failed to act. That is the truth and that is the problem. He accepted an apology from the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, which we all, including myself, believe was absolutely genuine. The Taoiseach, however, also chose to stand by someone who was challenging a Garda record and account and who had sought to avoid a Garda checkpoint according to that account. He allowed him to give an incomplete statement to the Dáil and he failed to act for a week before it all unravelled yesterday on the floor of the Dáil. This raises very serious questions about the Taoiseach as Head of Government because it was only when his lack of judgment was exposed that he chose to act. In a very short period, he went from backing the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, to sacking him. Tá ceisteanna don Taoiseach mar cheannaire an Rialtais. Laistigh de tamall gearr chuaigh sé ó chosaint Teachta Cowen go dtí é a chur as a phost.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> I have a series of questions for the Taoiseach. He said in the Dáil yesterday that he had seen the document, the PULSE record, that morning and that "having seen it, I can say that it is not quite as it has been portrayed." The Taoiseach therefore actively moved to play down the content of the Garda PULSE record. However, by 9 p.m. last night, he said that the issues in that same record were so serious and raised such fundamental questions that they had to be addressed and that he had moved to sack Deputy Cowen because he would not deal with these issues before the Dáil. This raises two questions. Did the Taoiseach mislead the Dáil by playing down the content of that PULSE record? If that is not the case, what did he learn after 2 p.m. yesterday? When he sacked the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, he said that he had asked or instructed him to answer the legitimate and serious questions arising from the Garda PULSE record in the Dáil, yet only hours earlier he had voted against bringing Deputy Cowen before the Dáil to do just that.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> The Taoiseach confirmed yesterday that he had been made aware of the allegation that Deputy Cowen avoided a Garda checkpoint and that he spoke to him the weekend before last on this matter. That was prior to Deputy Cowen making what was to be a full statement to the Dáil. The Taoiseach let that go. He allowed an incomplete statement to stand on the record of the Dáil. The Taoiseach seems to have sacked Deputy Cowen for his failure or refusal to answer questions. I hope he will now, as Head of Government, answer questions on the issues he needs to clarify.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">Ar dtús báire, ní aontaím leis an Teachta. Níl an ceart aici sa mhéid atá ráite aici go dtí seo. I strongly disagree with the Deputy's assertion that I knew about this on 3 or 4 July. Allegations, assertions and media questions are not facts. Deputy Cowen is still, as he was at the time, adamant with regard to the accuracy of the report from his PULSE file. At that stage, he did not have access to that file and I certainly did not. I did not see it until yesterday morning. I sought it on Monday night but Deputy Cowen was not in a position to bring it with him at that time. I told him I needed to see the file. I had a long discussion with him on Monday night regarding his account of what transpired. At approximately 7.30 a.m. the following morning, a copy of the file itself was sent to my phone. I had discussions with him on Monday night and read the actual, factual account in the report for the first time yesterday morning. The Deputy should not assert that I knew what I knew yesterday morning a week ago because I did not. I read it myself in what the garda put on the file.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> I also had a difficulty insofar as Deputy Cowen questions the accuracy of that report on the file and is going through a legal process to get it changed. In addition, the matter of the release of his data is being examined and investigated by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC. I was, however, fully satisfied yesterday that the Deputy should come before the Dáil. That was Deputy McDonald's assertion yesterday; she demanded that he come before the Dáil to make a statement. We voted for the Order of Business as agreed by the Business Committee yesterday. The Order of Business, however, did not preclude Deputy Cowen making a statement. I made it clear to Deputy Cowen yesterday morning that he should come before the House. He said he would not, and I told him I wanted him to reflect on that. As soon as Leaders' Questions was over, I contacted the Deputy and told him that his position in refusing to come before the Dáil was not acceptable or tenable and that he would have to come before the Dáil. He still refused to take that route.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> The fundamental difference between myself and Deputy Cowen on this issue is that he took a legal route and a legalistic approach to defend his rights, in his words, as a citizen and as a public representative. In my view, this issue could only be resolved through the political route, that is, by coming before Dáil Éireann. It did not have to be yesterday, it could have been today or tomorrow, but a comprehensive statement on this issue from the Deputy was required in this House. I accept what Deputies in this House have said. I believe that office holders, and Ministers in particular, should come before the House to answer questions on issues of public interest.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">I have the record of what the Taoiseach said yesterday. He made clear that he was fully aware of all aspects of the story regarding Deputy Cowen from the beginning. That is not an assertion of mine; it has been clarified by the Taoiseach. He said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_225">I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, the weekend before last and he adamantly denied any suggestion or implication that he would have evaded or attempted to avoid a checkpoint.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">The Taoiseach had that information. Did he share it with the Tánaiste or the leader of the Green Party? I ask the Taoiseach to please answer that question. He had that information and therefore knew full well that Deputy Cowen's statement to the Dáil was incomplete. He did not, however, challenge Deputy Cowen on it. Above all else, the Taoiseach stood behind, and today has continued to stand behind, an assertion by a former senior Minister and senior member of the Taoiseach's party which contradicts a Garda record. I am sure the Taoiseach will appreciate that is a very serious matter. I believe it is unprecedented for the Head of Government to side with a party colleague in contradicting a Garda record, using the cover of legal processes to so do. The Taoiseach's judgment in all of this is very much in question. He had the information. Did he share it with his partners in government? He allowed his colleague to make an incomplete statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">It was the Taoiseach and his colleagues in government who prevented Deputy Cowen from coming yesterday, today or any other day to give an account of himself and to answer what the Taoiseach concedes are very legitimate questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">I am not standing by any assertion by Deputy Cowen in respect of the Garda statement. Does Deputy McDonald understand that? I am not standing by the assertion in relation to the Garda record on the file. That is the point. I read the file yesterday. I spoke to Deputy Cowen the night before. There is a process in place and I do not want to prejudice it, but I have my own view on it. I did not have that perspective a week ago. The Deputy needs to understand that it is great to be making the assertions but I am deeply conscious that it is a very difficult day for the Cowen family and for Barry and his family. I have to put that on the record. I have never sought in any shape or form to undermine any garda or to undermine the accuracy or the credibility of any garda statement on the file. I only saw it for the first time yesterday morning. I had a discussion with Deputy Cowen the evening before that. I drew my own conclusions and that is why I felt it needed a Dáil statement.</p>

          <p eId="para_241">I do not wish the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, any ill will. It is a very difficult day for him and his family but the Taoiseach has set a record as regards firing a Minister in the quickest time ever - 17 days. It is quite confusing listening to the Taoiseach's contribution now and what he has said over the past week or two because not an awful lot has changed since 3 July when the story broke and the Taoiseach's awareness of "issues". He should not mind the semantics. The issues surrounding what was in the public domain have not changed dramatically. I feel what has changed is the political consequences for the Taoiseach, and that is worrying. The information regarding what happened and the Taoiseach's awareness of it at some level has not changed; what has changed is the Taoiseach's interpretation of this. The executive summary is that as long as it was not going to cause a huge issue for the Taoiseach politically, then the Minister, Deputy Cowen, could stay, but if it was, he could not. It was fine, as long as the additional information that came out over the weekend in <i>The Sunday Times </i>and then in the<i> Irish Independent</i> was not in the public domain and as long as it was secret but then once it all came out, it was not. I am sad to say it raises questions about the Taoiseach's judgment; it really does. It raises questions also about what the Taoiseach said. He stated: "I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, the weekend before last and he adamantly denied any suggestion or implication that he evaded or attempted to avoid a checkpoint." To the Taoiseach's knowledge, nothing has changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> I have a number of questions about how we got to this point, and some of them go deeper than the Taoiseach or the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, in respect of the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda Síochána. How did the Minister, Deputy Cowen, receive the data from An Garda Síochána? The Taoiseach referred to it as a Garda report or record but he refers to it as a PULSE file. Which is it?</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> I am holding a subject access request form in my hand. This is how one gets information about oneself from An Garda Síochána. It usually takes between one and three months. I respect the data protection issues here but how was the information provided to the then Minister, Deputy Cowen? Was it expedited for some reason and how is that justified in the case of a Minister? Citizens do not get PULSE files. It is really worrying in terms of the information that has been provided, the process by which this information was provided to a Minister, the channels by which that was asked for and how that was delivered. Many people in An Garda Síochána and their families are watching this and wondering about it. How was the information provided? We need to know if the information that has been provided included any details outside of raw personal data. For instance, are gardaí named? If they are, thousands of gardaí around the country who are doing their job today are deeply worried and concerned that what they put into the system in a PULSE file will be identified as being from them, not necessarily their raw data-----</p>

          <p eId="para_246">The first point I would make is that it now seems to be the case on the Opposition side that the assertion by a journalist, who is entitled to make assertions and points, is fact, and that one should act immediately on it. That seems to be the import of what is being said here this afternoon.</p>

          <p eId="para_248">I cannot act on that, nor should I. In terms of the acquisition of the file, Deputy Cowen was faced with a situation where he was being presented with private material about himself from journalistic sources. In other words, they had information about him relating to a PULSE file on him that he himself did not have. His point was that he was very taken aback by any assertions in respect of certain details. He was very clear. He acknowledged in the Dáil that he was guilty of a drink-driving offence, but seems to have been completely taken aback and shocked at any other implications. That is the language he used. Then information was coming out about speeding fines. Deputy Cowen related to me that he then rang the Garda directly to seek access to his own information, given that others in the media had it. I am just telling the Deputy what happened. I think a person has an entitlement to their own personal data if others have it and are putting questions in relation to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">That is a bigger question that everyone in this House should be concerned about as well in terms of data and the release of data. That is a wider more fundamental policy question that we all have to be conscious of. On another day in this House we will go on about companies and multinationals and citizens' rights, which is important too and is valid.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> Deputy Cowen then got access to his file in the middle of last week, I think. He challenged that and he then wanted to correct the record. Apparently, one is entitled to seek a correction of a record about oneself and he has undertaken that particular process. Likewise, we know the Garda Commissioner has asked GSOC to investigate the wider issue of the protection of the Deputy's personal data.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> At all stages I wanted to be fair to the person and that is why I sought the report on Monday night. It is not my record and I do not necessarily have an entitlement to it. Deputy Cowen did not bring it along with him on Monday night as it was with his solicitor. I said I needed to see it following our discussion. There is material on the file relating to the Deputy, which I must be careful about as I am not in a position to release it. My understanding is that it is a PULSE file.</p>

          <from>Deputy Alan Kelly<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_253">The Taoiseach has not given us much clarity on anything. I accept there are data protection issues at play. I also accept that the Data Protection Commission and GSOC will have to undertake serious investigations and there are wider issues concerning a citizen of the State, in this case, Deputy Cowen, but there is a process by which anyone gets information and it takes time. The Taoiseach never answered the question on whether it is an actual printout of a PULSE file. Is there information about An Garda Síochána being made available to Ministers? These are serious questions about precedent and the Taoiseach has not answered any of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The Taoiseach was aware that there were issues around this situation and about what happened with the former Minister, Deputy Cowen. He was aware of this on 3 July. Nothing changed in relation to the Taoiseach's information. Am I to understand that the Taoiseach was happy that Deputy Cowen did not address it when he made his statement but was not happy yesterday evening? No information has been given on what changed the Taoiseach's mind and that is the crux of the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> I have raised a whole range of questions here which have a broader consequence for An Garda Síochána, the administration of justice and the protection of Garda personnel in the performance of their duty. Where the hell is the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy McEntee, in all of this? She has been tweeting about greenways. There are serious issues at the heart of An Garda Síochána and-----</p>

          <p eId="para_266">I asked Deputy Cowen to share his personal data with me. To be fair to him, he did so in the end. I felt I needed that because I am here now accounting to the House. One moment it is being said that I know everything without seeing any PULSE file, the next moment when I do seek access to the PULSE file that is something that is terribly wrong as well. That is not fair or balanced. It is an issue of huge public controversy involving a Government Minister. Information pertaining to him was in the public domain that he did not have access to. If one accepts that, it logically follows that he should have access to it because other people are commenting on it and writing about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">The fallout from the sacking of Deputy Cowen as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine inevitably switches the spotlight to the Taoiseach himself. The obvious question involves what occurred between 2 p.m. and 9 p.m. yesterday, because there was certainly no indication in the Taoiseach's responses at Leaders' Questions that it would transpire as it did. While the incident took place in 2016 it is recent news to most of us, including the Taoiseach. It originally came into the public domain on 3 July. It may well have been in the <i>Irish Independent</i> before John Mooney's first story in <i>The Sunday Times</i>. Not only was it in the former Minister's interest and in the public interest that he fully address the outstanding issues, but it was also in the new Government's interest that he did so. There is no doubt that this has been a bad start for the Government at a time when the focus of attention should be on the risks from Covid, on safely restarting our society and economy and on building leadership and trust. It is early days but it is difficult to know what to make of the new Government that the Taoiseach leads. There is no doubt that people are busy, as our new Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, has told us, but does that mean the schools will reopen in September? The Government is busy with the July stimulus and hopefully it will be well targeted. It has also been busy limiting Opposition voices with the new arrangements in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> The indecision around flights into this country from areas where Covid-19 is reproducing rapidly, particularly the US, is the biggest cause of public concern at the moment. Quite frankly, it is being viewed with disbelief. I have heard several Ministers minimising the risk by telling us that just 250 people are coming into the country from the US on a daily basis and some are self-isolating. However, 250 people per day is 2,500 people over ten days. They are coming from what is the epicentre of the virus at the moment. The people of the US are free to choose whoever they wish to lead them but we can all see how the virus is being handled there. As I have said, it is the epicentre of the pandemic. The seriousness of it is being minimised there with tragic consequences. We have to factor that into the public's understanding of this matter. That is why the US is such a high-risk country. On several occasions, our people have been ahead of us on this issue and they are ahead of us again. Despite the huge Ryanair marketing campaign for cheap flights, people have largely heeded the warning to restrict themselves to essential travel and are choosing to holiday at home.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">The Deputy began by asking a number of questions about the events of yesterday evening. Again, the fundamental issue yesterday was Deputy Cowen's refusal to respond to my request that he address Dáil Éireann on the issue. I felt he needed to come into the House to clarify the issues that had arisen, particularly following my reading of the file and my discussions with him the evening before. He felt that would prejudice his rights in respect of the two processes that are under way concerning the data. That is the fundamental point. Prior to 2 p.m. he had not agreed to do so. When I went back to my office I contacted him immediately and made the point that it was not tenable if he was not prepared to come into the House at some stage to clarify matters. That is the essence of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> On the Government's focus, the legislative output from the Government this month is probably the largest volume of legislation in any one month for quite some time. It needs to be said that it is designed to underpin our response to Covid and the economic recovery. The preparations are well advanced for the jobs stimulus which will be launched at some stage next week. Again, it is critical for the support of small to medium-sized companies and indeed people's livelihoods and incomes, particularly through the two pillars of the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> On Covid-19 and travel, I met the acting CMO last evening. NPHET has provided advice to the Government. There will be a Cabinet meeting this evening on phase 4 of the roadmap and we will be responding to the advice that NPHET has provided to us. There is concern about increased numbers. They are not attributed to last week or the week before. There were some issues from mid-June onwards about behaviour and so on that we need to be very conscious of. The figures are still relatively low in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">We need to be very cautious and careful about how we proceed from now on in respect of this. My immediate priorities are to facilitate the reopening of schools, which is the number one national objective, and to maintain capacity in our health services to treat non-Covid conditions and illnesses. That is my approach.</p>

We all understand that there is a high degree of co-operation from the Opposition on this but it will be all at nought if we end up with a second wave similar to the one we have already had and we have to lock down a second time. This is why people are so concerned about travel from the United States in particular at present, or other countries at the epicentre. There is no confidence. We have seen on the television that restaurateurs have become those who vet people and ask them whether they have recently arrived and self-isolated. This tells us there is no confidence in the systems in place. We know that it is an offence not to fill out the locator form correctly but people do not have confidence regarding the arrival of flights or the follow up.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">I accept the Deputy's well-articulated concerns and she is correct that people are very concerned about the fact there is travelling from what we might call hot spot areas or areas that, to me, appear to be out of control with regard to the virus. I accept the Deputy's point on this. Since the start of the pandemic, travel has never been banned. The Deputy's point about follow-up is equally true and accepted. In our announcement some weeks ago, we indicated that this dimension had to be improved upon, in terms of follow-up and engagement with those who have arrived into the country. I watched a report on "Prime Time" last night in which quite a number of people who had come into the country were interviewed. Some are citizens here and some work here and they were coming back from these hot spot areas. All said they were committed to quarantining, staying in isolation for two weeks and obeying the guidelines. I accept the Deputy's point that more needs to be done-----</p>

          <p eId="para_292">As they marched to the Dáil today, Debenhams workers chanted, "Apple got sorted out. We got sold out." The Taoiseach supported the successful appeal against Apple paying the State €13 billion. The Debenhams workers are campaigning for the far smaller sum of €13 million but the Government is taking no action on their behalf. This €13 million is the sum necessary to provide almost 1,000 Debenhams workers with two weeks' statutory redundancy and two weeks per year of service to top it up. To try to win this modest sum, these workers are forced to resort to picketing the 11 Debenhams stores in the Republic of Ireland. It might be more accurate for me to say these shops are being blockaded. They are being picketed around the clock with a view to blocking any attempt to remove stock. The workers understand that liquidation law, framed by the Taoiseach's party and Fine Gael, leaves them way down the pecking order and that they are very unlikely to have their redundancy pay topped up by the liquidator. As the dispute approaches its 100th day this Saturday, blockading the stock in the stores is the one bargaining chip left to these workers and they intend to use it.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> I have listened carefully to the Taoiseach's comments on this issue over the past eight days. He offers sympathy on the workers' plight. He downplays the possibility of workers receiving more than the statutory redundancy. He promises the possibility of law reform to improve workers' rights in liquidation situations but only after a review and, implicitly, quite some time later in the lifetime of the Government. To be blunt, this is not going to cut it with these workers. As the acting shop steward for the Blanchardstown store, Ann Peppard, said outside the Dáil less than an hour ago, Micheál Martin's sympathy will not pay her mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> They know that Debenhams can afford to make a just settlement. They know Debenhams has 122 stores currently trading in the UK and that the UK parent company has profited from online sales sourced in the Republic of Ireland every day since the Irish stores closed. They are digging in for a better deal. I honestly do not see how the liquidator will get that stock out. I am certain sure that the threat of arrest will not work. I cannot see court injunctions working either. Sooner or later, the Government will have to intervene here. The Taoiseach was part of a Government that introduced emergency legislation in 2008 when it rushed through the bank guarantee, which ended up costing the taxpayer €64 billion. Is he telling us that whereas emergency legislation for bankers was introduced in 2008 he cannot introduce it for workers in 2020?</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> A total of €5 million is owed to the Revenue by Debenhams. Is the Taoiseach prepared to say this €5 million should be used towards providing these workers with that basic decent redundancy settlement of two weeks plus two?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_143">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_296">On the Deputy's opening statement on Apple getting sorted and so on, Apple did not get sorted. Apple is also about workers. Apple has been in Ireland since 1980 and the court decision is that there was no state aid to Apple. This is the essential point that the court decided. Apple now employs 6,000 people throughout the country. This is important. There has been an ongoing view from the Deputy and others consistently undermining the role of multinational companies in Ireland. I want to put on the record that it is an important role. It underpins the work of many small to medium sized companies that also create thousands of jobs. There are hundreds of thousands of jobs involved in companies such as Apple. It was important in terms of protecting the industrial policy of the past 30 or 40 years, in my view, to identify the State's credibility and reputation whereby we do things within the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> That said, with regard to Debenhams workers I will not commit to something I cannot legally deliver. I will not do that in the House. I have said before that the treatment of the workers by Debenhams was unacceptable and wrong and that the law does need to change. This in itself will not benefit the workers themselves. The State has to do everything it possibly can through its various schemes and mechanisms to support the workers. Ideally, we can secure alternative employment and provide a range of other supports over and above income supports to help the workers. There is a long-established position in terms of statutory redundancy being the State's mechanism to support workers in this situation. This still holds. That said, this does not in itself provide satisfaction for the workers because they are being denied justice by the company. The company's behaviour has been disreputable and wrong. It has not treated workers with the dignity or respect they deserve or given them supports..</p>

          <p eId="para_298">This dispute is now an historic dispute, as it is the first dispute of the coronavirus lockdown. The flagship store for Debenhams is on Henry Street in Dublin, the scene of another historic strike, the Dunnes Stores anti-apartheid strike in the mid-1980s. That dispute was resolved by a Government introducing legislation that in name may not have been emergency legislation but effectively was special legislation, taking apartheid South African goods off the shelves. There is a deadlock in this dispute. There is a risk of arrest and court injunctions facing these workers. The Government will have to intervene.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Legislation must be introduced to resolve it. The Taoiseach said that he hoped alternative employment could be secured for the workers. That is an interesting point, but it has just been thrown out and left hanging. Can he be a little more specific about what he means and what actions he is prepared to take in that regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> Finally, next Saturday will be the 100th day of this dispute, but in that 100 days the Taoiseach has yet to meet a delegation of Debenhams workers. The workers would like him to meet them. Is the Taoiseach prepared to meet a delegation of Debenhams workers to discuss the issues they are facing?</p>

          <p eId="para_301">First, I did participate in a Zoom meeting with Debenhams workers, and the Deputy should know that. Of course, I will meet a delegation of the workers. There is no difficulty whatsoever. I have communicated with workers in my constituency in that regard. The difficulty I have is that in situations such as this I am very reluctant to create false expectations and false hopes for people who are going through a traumatic time after losing their work in such unacceptable circumstances. The Deputy can stand here and say that we should introduce emergency legislation without specifying what he has in mind or whether it is tenable or sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> In terms of my remarks about the State using all its apparatus to support workers, I recall being Minister with responsibility for enterprise when Motorola closed in Cork resulting in the loss of 400 to 500 jobs. We marshalled all the agencies ranging from Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to what was then FÁS to work with the workers collectively and individually to make a new start and get people jobs. That was an interesting study in itself because many new companies were born out of that experience. However, it took a fair degree of collaboration between State agencies working with the workers in that tech sector, and there were good outcomes in that respect. I am always of the view that the State should work with workers who have been made redundant to ensure it can secure alternative employment and give whatever supports the State has available to help workers to reskill, retrain or gain employment elsewhere.</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T12:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_303">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_304">That Dáil Éireann approves the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Dara Calleary for appointment by the President to be a member of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Pursuant to section 4(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1946, I propose to assign him to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. In his short time as Government Chief Whip, the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, has shown that he is committed not just to reforming the Dáil but also to overseeing a comprehensive legislative programme, which I referred to earlier. The legislative programme for the month of July is the busiest for one month in a long time, and I acknowledge the co-operation of other parties in the House. Most of that legislation will underpin economic recovery in dealing with the continued challenges of Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> It is crucial for our country to have a strong, progressive, sustainable and resilient agrifood sector. It is one of most important indigenous sectors, providing more than 170,000 jobs and accounting for 10% of exports. The Government is committed to supporting farmers and food businesses, which underpin towns and villages across the country. There are many challenges facing agriculture, such as Brexit, Covid-19, climate change in the future, Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, negotiations and the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, which we will discuss later this week at the European Council. In the negotiations on the next CAP, we are seeking to protect the family farm and farm incomes, and maintaining the CAP budget will be our top priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> I know that Deputy Calleary will be an effective Minister. He will work hard and diligently at implementing the ambitious commitments in the programme for Government on agriculture, food and the marine. I wish him well in his new role and commend his appointment to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> I also take this opportunity to inform the House that it is my intention to seek the approval of the Cabinet this evening to appoint the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Jack Chambers, as the Government Chief Whip and Deputy Fleming as Minister of State in the Department of Finance with responsibility for financial services, credit unions and insurance. I know the House will join me in wishing them both well in their new posts.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T12:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_309">I extend my sincere congratulations to Deputies Calleary, Chambers and Fleming, respectively. The appointment of a new Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine happens at a crucial time for the agriculture sector on our island. Family farms face an uncertain future and the threat of Brexit remains real. It is an important job and I wish Deputy Calleary very well in his role.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> Unfortunately, we cannot ignore the circumstances in which the vacancy arose. The controversy, which we discussed again earlier, surrounding the sacking of Deputy Cowen has unquestionably undermined public confidence in this new Government after little more than two weeks in office. I put it to the Taoiseach earlier that the way these matters have been handled has called his judgment into question and raises serious concerns about how he will deal with controversies in the time ahead. He should be in no doubt that the people are looking at this latest mess and they are exasperated, experiencing the terrible sinking feeling that they are in line for more of the same. The Taoiseach has been at pains to say that Fianna Fáil has changed, but the message from this debacle is clear. It is that Fianna Fáil cannot be trusted to do the right thing, that good governance and the public interest always seem to come a distant second to what is politically expedient. One cannot blame people for thinking that it is same old Fianna Fáil, dodging and being less than full with their accounts to the Dáil and the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> We should be discussing how Ireland can recover from the Covid-19 crisis and we need to discuss solutions to housing and childcare but, unfortunately, because Fianna Fáil cannot change and cannot take up the job of government seriously, we have been discussing a political controversy only a few short weeks after this new Government came into being. I regard that as a failure on the Taoiseach's part. I do not believe he grasps the import or the full consequences of this. People remember previous Fianna Fáil-led Governments and how they operated. They know they cost them very dearly. They are determined, and we are determined, that we are not going down that road again. People deserve a great deal better. Let us remind ourselves that people voted for something better last February. Now, here we are a few short months later with Fianna Fáil back at the helm, and here we go again. The Taoiseach's answers today, frankly, have not been satisfactory. In fact, he failed to answer any of the critical questions I and others put to him, including, interestingly, about the knowledge of the Tánaiste, the leader of Fine Gael, and Deputy Eamon Ryan, the leader of the Green Party, and when they got access to the full facts regarding the controversy and the Deputy Cowen debacle. Instead of being fully forthcoming, the Taoiseach has decided to stick to an approach that muddies the waters. That is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> I again appeal to him to answer the questions, at some stage, that have been put. He sacked a senior Cabinet Minister because he said he had asked him to answer questions and the Minister steadfastly refused. Irony of ironies, the Taoiseach who did the sacking is himself not prepared to answer in a straightforward way the questions that have been put to him about his actions, decisions and judgment.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanKelly" eId="spk_148">
          <from>Deputy Alan Kelly<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T12:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_313">I wish the new appointees well, particularly the new Minister, Deputy Calleary, who has served a long apprenticeship in Leinster House and in politics. I truly wish him well in his brief. There is a bit of ground to make up now. This was in many ways a delayed appointment. I am sure his disappointment has now been assuaged. I wish him the best of luck. I also wish the Ministers of State, Deputies Chambers and Fleming, well. I served with Deputy Fleming on the Committee of Public Accounts. He was the Chairman of the committee when I was Vice Chairman. At times he can be very forensic in his analysis, so when it comes to the insurance industry I hope he will be forensic because we need that. I extend my best wishes to all three appointees.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> There is, though, an issue arising with the Government. It has had an exceptionally poor start. I do not say that with any malice, but I and other Deputies have asked a range of questions today as to what happened in respect of Deputy Cowen, questions that are broader than just Deputy Cowen. I respect his personal rights and requirements under data protection and that he should ensure that all those rights are vindicated. I also respect the fact that there must be inquiries as to how certain information got into the public domain. There are, however, deeper issues, and I have raised very serious questions with the Taoiseach and he did not have any answers. I forensically asked him questions about the information he knew about. There are also contradictions in some of the statements he has made, and they will all be combed through, so he needs to put an end to this. He needs to think today about how he will do so because many people are now asking extensive questions that go beyond even the issue at hand and into how he is handling things. I urge him to think over the next 24 hours about how best he can put an end to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> There are broader issues of competence here. There has been a lot of change in the Department of Health. From a Government perspective, the Taoiseach needs to get a handle on this. There is a new acting Secretary General, a new Minister, a new Chief Medical Officer and a range of other people. The Taoiseach needs to pick up the baton and ensure that the process by which we make decisions for the good of this country continues and that people have confidence on the whole range of issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> The Minister for Justice and Equality has disappeared. There are so many issues with what has transpired over the past few days. The fact that she has not made any public comment on them is just bizarre. The Taoiseach will have to take a real look at transparency and how the Government deals with things. I have tabled a whole range of parliamentary questions, as have my colleagues in the Labour Party, and the way in which the Government has handled them is a disgrace. I will forward them to the Ceann Comhairle, as usual, to look for more information from the Ministers because they refused to answer the questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> Together with this is the fact that the Freedom of Information Act needs a complete overhaul. The issue of giving out information has not resulted in a good start. Given the Taoiseach's track record as leader of Fianna Fáil while in opposition, I hope to see greater transparency.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> The Minister with responsibility for housing has not been clear as to what he will do about the extension of the ban on evictions or about mortgages. From what I hear, the quantum in respect of the July stimulus will not be anywhere near what is required. Hope for young people is very quickly evaporating. I accept, because the Taoiseach has stated as much, that opening schools is the biggest priority. However, given the interview the Minister for Education and Skills gave to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last week, I have zero confidence in this regard, so things need to change there pretty quickly. It was absolutely incredible to read. There are concerns about childcare as well and where we are going in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> There is, however, a July stimulus for one group of people. I refer to the number of advisers being appointed to the Taoiseach's office, the Tánaiste's office and the office of the Minister with responsibility for transport and climate change, as well as to the Ministers of State, the new head of protocol, who will be in the Tánaiste's office, and the drivers. Funding has been provided to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade so he can continue with his Garda driver and his Garda car. There is a July stimulus for all them.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> It has not been a good start for the Government. Let today be a watermark and a change in order that the whole country can, it is hoped, move on and get through Covid. However, the way in which the Government has shown leadership to date has not given us much cause for hope.</p>

          <p eId="para_321">I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Calleary. His is an incredibly important portfolio. I wish him well. I know these are not the circumstances in which he would have wished for this to happen and that he will be thinking of Deputy Cowen and his family from that point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> There was a lot of attention on the failure to allocate a Minister for the west, but there is no such thing as a Minister for the west. I accept there is a region that feels very disenfranchised. The key issue is that Ministers are for all the country; it is the portfolio that matters. This will nonetheless be seen as a gain in the west but at an expense of the midlands. Deputy Fleming, with whom I served on the Committee of Public Accounts, is being appointed as Minister for State, but there is no doubt but that that will be the feeling. There is something wrong with our politics when that is how ministerial appointments are perceived. A Minister cannot be a Minister for a region or an individual constituency. We have heard very concerning things from that point of view in recent weeks. It is essential, however, that Government functions in such a way that Ministers are for all the country. This is one of the areas on which we need to hold this Government to account. There is evidence from previous Administrations that whichever Deputy is in a particular position can matter hugely to his or her individual constituency. However, we need to move towards objective resource allocation so we do not end up with postcode lotteries in the provision of public services and infrastructure, and that resources are fairly allocated and based on need, not the location of a particular Minister. We would all gain from such an approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> I am all in favour of expertise being available to Ministers, but I think the number of advisers and the actual expertise being brought in will become sources of serious concern because in some cases it is quite difficult to see exactly what that expertise is, other than media management. I think there will be close scrutiny of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> The Taoiseach has talked about how important the role of Chief Whip is and has made a big issue of that. I agree with him: it is a very important position. Three weeks on, however, there are justifiable questions about this. I wish Deputy Chambers well in his new role. Government has a job to do, but so has the Opposition. Within the framework document the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste produced, the role of the Opposition was acknowledged. I am quite concerned about the majoritarianism we are seeing come to pass in respect of the Dáil reform committee and the curtailment of some voices in the Opposition. We should be very concerned about that. It is not on for Members of this Parliament not to be able to sit on committees and hold the Government to account. That cannot be the way in which this proceeds.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">I hope there will be a rethink of the approach that has been forthcoming from some quarters. These are important roles and, again, I wish the Ministers, Deputies Calleary, Fleming and Chambers, well.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T13:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_326">This controversy is not over. The Taoiseach has sacked Deputy Cowen to try to draw a line under it and he is spinning furiously about what he knew in an attempt to evade responsibility. However, the essence of the matter is very clear and it will come out. The Taoiseach colluded with the then Minister to keep vital information from the Dáil. They relied on legal threats to keep that vital information from the media. If it was not for <i>The Sunday Times</i> publishing the article, including the reference to the Garda report last Sunday, the Taoiseach would never have asked Deputy Cowen to answer questions before the Dáil and nobody would be any the wiser.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> Earlier, the Taoiseach told the Dáil that Ministers should come before the House to answer questions of public interest. However, the Taoiseach's Government voted twice - on 7 July and yesterday, 14 July - to shield the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, from facing those questions. The Taoiseach abused his majority to ensure he would not face questions and would come in and make a statement and waltz out again without facing any questions. The Taoiseach was backed in that by the Labour Party the first time around and by a number of Independents both times. Ironically, the Minister who now replaces Deputy Cowen was then in his role as Chief Whip, ensuring the questions would not be asked. The Taoiseach‘s statement today that Ministers should face questions is clearly disingenuous.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> The Taoiseach relies very heavily on the fact he did not get a copy of the Garda report until Tuesday morning but he knew of its existence on 3 July. He was told about it by a journalist and he knew there was a reference in it to a serious incident about evading a Garda checkpoint. The Taoiseach tried to wriggle out of that by saying it was what a journalist told him and he did not know what was in the report. However, the point is he knew the significance of that at that time. Over the weekend of 4 and 5 July, he discussed the matter with Deputy Cowen and, as part of that discussion, it is clear from Deputy Cowen’s statement that he discussed this Garda report. The Taoiseach knew the significance of this report. He discussed it and together they agreed that when Deputy Cowen made a statement to the Dáil on 7 July, he would not tell the Dáil about it. They agreed he would speak about having a full and frank disclosure and about avoiding a damaging drip feed of information and yet Deputy Cowen chose, with the agreement of the Taoiseach, not to put this vital information into the public domain. From the absence of the Tánaiste from the Chamber and the repeated failure of the Taoiseach to answer point-blank questions about whether he told the Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, it seems extremely likely that he chose not to tell his coalition partners about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> Is it not the case that the Taoiseach relied on legal threats to gag the media? He agreed with Deputy Cowen that, in making his full statement on 7 July, he would not tell the Dáil about the existence of this Garda report and the reference to evading the checkpoint because the Taoiseach and Deputy Cowen thought at that point that the legal threats had done their job. They thought the media would not publish and they would be able to move on. If <i>The Sunday Times</i> had not published that story last Sunday, is it not the case that the Taoiseach would not have asked Deputy Cowen to answer questions in the Dáil and there will be no question of accountability?</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> What we have in this absolute dumpster fire of two and a half weeks of a Government is a clear display of the culture of Fianna Fáil. It is a party that is about power and not about ideology. The squabbling between different backbench Members over who should get what junior or senior ministerial jobs at a time when one in four people is unemployed and then this consistent attempt to avoid accountability, which is continuing right now from the Taoiseach, remind people correctly of everything that Fianna Fáil is about and it is tainting correctly the Green Party and Fine Gael as long as they stand beside Fianna Fáil.</p>

I know all three would not like being appointed in the manner they have been appointed but I congratulate them nonetheless. I particularly congratulate the Minister, Deputy Calleary, on his accession to a full seat at the Cabinet table. Very few people have secured the opportunity to sit around the Cabinet table and it is a great honour and a huge responsibility, particularly at a time when huge change is needed. The Minister will get the good wishes of every Member of this House. I have enjoyed working with the Minister over the past few weeks in facilitating the heavy legislative workload that is going through the House at the moment. The skill set he has developed since his election to Dáil Éireann in terms of working with people will be a vital tool for him working in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, both in Ireland and the Council of Ministers level, where he will really have to roll up his sleeves. It is a huge honour for the Minister and for his family, who know the ebbs and flows of politics, and I think of them as well today.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> I know he will do a good job for his country, his county and his party in his role in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. There are huge challenges there at the moment, particularly in relation to the viability of family farms, particularly in the suckler sector, which the Minister will know well. There is a need to protect the overall Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, vote at European and domestic levels and to ensure the new environmental schemes that are introduced are farmer focused and farmer friendly. We have indications from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine that we will see a new farm retirement scheme and that would be warmly welcomed because of the age profile in agriculture, particularly within the beef sector. It is not a good age profile to drive the type of change that is needed to sustain the viability of many family firms across this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> I congratulate the new Minister and wish him the best of luck. If I could give him one piece of advice, it would be to take on board the suggestions from the Opposition side of the House. I know he will take those on board because it should not be about Government and Opposition. It should be about Parliament inputting in a constructive way to come forward with practical and implementable solutions for the challenges we now face in an economy and society post Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> I was shocked and saddened to hear the news last night that my neighbour, Deputy Cowen, had been sacked by An Taoiseach. This is not an easy time for Deputy Cowen or his family. He is in a very lonely place at this point. I have known him since he entered Dáil Éireann and I have worked with him and his brother. At a time when just transition is a key term across the midlands, it was reassuring to know that we had someone at the Cabinet table who knew the issues and challenges facing our communities as a result of the wind down of Bord na Móna. I know Deputy Cowen will continue to work hard for his constituents in Laois and Offaly and keep a close eye, along with myself, on the plans for just transition across the midland counties. I wish Deputy Cowen and the Ministers, Deputies Calleary, Chambers and Fleming, very well in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_335">Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghuí ar na hAirí ar son an Rural Independent Group. </p>
          <p eId="para_336">I compliment Deputy Calleary on his forthcoming appointment as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and wish him well. I also congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, and the incoming Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, on their new positions. In his time as Chief Whip, Deputy Calleary has worked exceptionally well with the Whips of the different parties and groups. There is a huge legislative programme to get through but he has always been understanding and engaging in his role as Chief Whip. He has looked for agreement rather than division. I have worked with Deputy Calleary for decades, going back to his days in Ógra Fianna Fáil, and since he came into the Dáil in 2007. I have had many a joust and jostle with him and no doubt we will have many more, but I know the west is wide awake this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> I do not mind what others say about Ministers for regions, but regions must be represented at the Cabinet and, before today, the west was not represented. Now it will be well and truly represented. I know there will be a small celebration in Carty's Bar in Knock and other places. Breda Laffey will be very happy, as will many others. Deputy Calleary's wife, his mother and all his family will be proud. I wish him well and look forward to working with him in these very difficult and challenging times, with the Common Agricultural Policy negotiations and the demise of agriculture. If he can make one mark, I hope it will be to cut out half the bureaucracy and red tape that is involved in the schemes run by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Many of those schemes are going back with moneys not drawn down simply because of the bureaucratic red tape.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, well and I look forward to working with him as Chief Whip. The incoming Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, who is from close to my own heartland of Tipperary, proved his ability, capacity for forensic questioning and fairness as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. He will be well able for the challenge that is put up to him today.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> It is a sad time for the former Minister, Deputy Cowen. I wish him, his wife, his mum, his brother, who is in recovery, and all the Cowen family well. I knew and had engagement with his late dad, Ber, when he served as Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture. He often travelled to meetings at the greyhound track in Clonmel and engaged with people there. The Cowen family has a long and proud history of service to politics. I stood up yesterday in this House to speak about the situation following Deputy Cowen's statement to the Dáil last week. I have just received a text message indicating that the Garda Síochána has contacted the Data Protection Commissioner to investigate the leak of information relating to Deputy Cowen. This is a very serious situation and it is why I did not support the proposal yesterday to have another debate or ask additional questions. We have a huge legislative programme and a huge amount of work to get through. Deputy Cowen came into the House last week to give a profound apology for a crime he committed and for which he paid the price. He did the crime and he did the time. Now we are going to have a forensic investigation of the matter. Are any of us who ever robbed an orchard going to be hauled before the Oireachtas for statements?</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> It is the parties of the left, in the main, which were grandstanding on this issue. I resent the fact that yesterday, after I opposed her party's proposal regarding Deputy Cowen, the self-proclaimed leader of the Opposition, who thinks other Opposition Deputies will be silenced, told me it was the most untruthful statement I ever uttered.</p>

          <p eId="para_344">Imagine that. It might not be on the record but the journalists heard her say it. I will take no lessons on slíbhínism from a party with such a murky past and which is still involved with that past. It is a party that is denying that it did not want to be in government and now its leader wants to be total leader of the Opposition. None of us in the Rural Independent Group, the Regional Group or the Social Democrats has any voice. That is the diktat of the unelected leader of Sinn Féin. I do not know of any democracy in Europe that has appointed leaders, but we have one in the North and the South.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> If Deputy McDonald thinks I am a Member under her wing and I will bow and kowtow to her, she is mistaken.

          <p eId="para_349">Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire nua, an Teachta Calleary, agus leis an mbeirt eile. Guím gach rath orthu ina róil nua. Cuireann sé iontas orm, áfach, nach ndearna an Taoiseach tagairt ar bith d'Aire sóisearach don Ghaeltacht. Ar ais arís, níl trácht ar bith ar an nGaeltacht i mbliain chinniúnach maidir le hAcht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla agus maidir le polasaí do na hoileáin. B'fhéidir go mbeidh an Taoiseach in ann soiléiriú a thabhairt air sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> I congratulate the Minister and Ministers of State on their new roles. I cannot let the occasion pass without saying that the elevation of a further three wise men brings into sharp focus the long journey we have to go towards gender equality. The role of Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is an extremely important one in terms of sustainable rural and regional development and the challenges that present in regard to climate change and bringing farmers and their families on board. I wish the incoming Minister, Deputy Calleary, the best in all of that. However, the circumstances of his appointment and the sacking of the previous Minister leave a lot of unanswered questions. While I wish the Taoiseach the best and I think he has a good heart behind his actions, he has handled this situation very badly. In my view, his judgment has been brought into question by his handling of the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> Nobody in the Opposition asked for a head on a plate. We did not ask for a Minister to be sacked. All we asked for was openness and accountability. Indeed, some members of the Opposition voted against proposals put forward on this side of the House. We simply asked for questions to be answered. The need for accountability was the strongest messages we got from people during the election campaign. We all make mistakes and we all do something wrong. Nobody here can say they did not do something wrong at some time. Where members of the Government make mistakes, there is an onus on them to come into the House and explain, particularly in the circumstances that pertained in this case, where there was the release of a Garda record. We do not know how it was released. We do not know what the particular record was, or whether it was a PULSE record or something obtained under data protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> Then there is the whole question of Ministers being vetted. As I understand it, nominees go through a vetting process by the Garda before their appointment. The Taoiseach is shaking his head, so I might be wrong about that. I presumed they go through such a process, just as teachers and others have to be vetted before they are appointed. Are Ministers vetted by the Garda and, if so, what emerged from that in Deputy Cowen's case? Then there is the very serious question of data being released in the manner in which they appear to have been released. I certainly agree with the Taoiseach that there is a serious question to address in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_353">I am sharing time with Deputy Fitzmaurice. I offer my sincere good wishes to the new Minister, Deputy Calleary, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, and the new Minister of State, Deputy Fleming. I am especially pleased that we now have a Minister of State with responsibility for credit unions. I look forward to working with him to ensure there is an appropriate regulatory framework for the not-for-profit, member-owned credit unions that have consistently supported communities. I wish all three appointees well. I am pleased to see that the new appointments give a certain rebalancing from the perspective of the regions. The big news is the appointment as Minister of Deputy Calleary, who faces huge challenges in securing an adequate CAP budget. I look forward to seeing him pursue the Fianna Fáil policy of convergence of the basic payment in the next round and in the transition phase. I wish him well in his work and I look forward to working with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> In regard to Deputy Cowen, it is important to note that there is an ongoing process. He disputes the PULSE record and, as a citizen, he has a right to do so. However, as a Minister, he had a duty to come into the House and answer questions and he chose not to do that. Finally, on a personal level, this is a devastating blow for Deputy Cowen and his family. As a fellow Member of Dáil Éireann, I feel for them. Politics can be a brutal business.</p>

I wish Deputy Calleary the very best of luck. The ministerial map is at least being rebalanced a small bit for the west of Ireland. I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, whose mother hails from Castlerea, the best of luck, and likewise the incoming Minister of State, Deputy Fleming.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">The new Minister, Deputy Calleary, has a job at hand today. I think he will get support from many in the House wishing him the best of luck. However, he should remember that for years, there has been an imbalance in agriculture, and the conglomerates have been looked after year upon year by previous Governments. The Minister comes from an area where small family farms keep the community viable and where the butcher shop and local shop are kept going by the local farmers. Now is his opportunity to leave a mark in agriculture over the next few years, for the farmers of the west and the north-west who have been forgotten for many years. I wish him the very best of luck in the future. </p>

          <p eId="para_357">I send my thoughts to Deputy Cowen and his family. It is incredibly difficult when one loses office in the circumstances we witnessed last night. There are issues and questions again about how people's personal private data are revealed to the public and we have to look at that in a variety of different ways. Regardless of that matter, it is true what the Taoiseach said in that we in the political system are held to higher standards. That is particularly the case when it comes to people questioning the integrity, independence or accuracy of An Garda Síochána. We have a particular responsibility to get that right.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> This has been a terribly difficult issue for the individuals involved. My experience is that I was informed by the Taoiseach about it in a timely and fair manner and I respect and support his judgment calls, which were difficult judgment calls. We welcome and look forward to working with the new Minister, Deputy Calleary, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Chambers and Fleming, in the critical work they have to do. While this has been a difficult political and personal issue, I do not believe it will distract from the vital work the Government has to do. We face immediate challenges in how we manage Covid, stimulate our economy and effect change in the health and housing systems. This Government can, and will, continue to work cohesively and with all its energies to address the challenges facing our people. </p>

          <p eId="para_365">The ban on evictions, notices to quit and rent increases expires on Monday next. As the Taoiseach will be aware, tens of thousands of renters who have lost income due to Covid-19 are protected by this ban and without it, they will be immediately at risk of eviction or perhaps homelessness. There were worrying reports in last weekend's papers that the Taoiseach is being advised not to extend the ban. I remind him that during the general election when we in Sinn Féin spoke about a rent freeze and applying protections for those renters, we were told it could not be done. In fact, many went so far as to say that to do so would be unconstitutional, yet those protections were then introduced, albeit in the context of a public health emergency. Will the Taoiseach clarify the Government's position? I ask him to commit to extending these protections, not just to October but to year's end, and to also commit to introducing a rent arrears debt resolution scheme, including the option of partial or full rent write-downs.</p>

          <p eId="para_366">There was no Covid-19 during the general election and the assertions made then bore no relationship to what subsequently happened. The eviction ban and freeze on rent increases was grounded in the emergency public health legislation arising out of Covid-19. There are issues around that but the Government is examining them. We are conscious that it has helped public health by preventing homelessness and reducing homelessness, evictions and so on, and that that trend would continue. There has been a relaxation of emergency measures under the roadmap but the Government is giving this very detailed scrutiny right now and we will consider it at Government meetings over the coming weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_367">The programme for Government is virtually silent on the question of workers' rights and there can be no even or fair recovery in the absence of a focus on collective bargaining and decent pay and wages. I acknowledge the welcome commitment in the programme to a living wage, but there is no timeline of any substance. What is required is for the riding instructions of the Low Pay Commission to be changed in legislation to give it a legal target to transform the national minimum wage rate to a living wage over the next period. In the absence of such a move, the aspiration to convert the minimum wage to a living wage will remain just that - a mere aspiration. Does the Taoiseach have any plans to amend the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 to give the Low Pay Commission a legal timeframe within which to work to deliver a living wage for the workers of this country? Will he confirm that the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has received the annual report from the commission with recommendations on the rate of the national minimum wage for 2021? When will Cabinet consider that report, and will the Government accept the recommendation that is about to be lodged?</p>

Dependable broadband is essential to support rural communities, foster businesses in our towns and villages and enable people to work from home and students to learn online. Every day, I am contacted by people who are extremely frustrated at their appalling Internet access. Throughout lockdown, people resorted to working from church car parks in their cars. Some teachers could not access the Internet at home to teach remotely. The list goes on.

          <p eId="para_373">Page 119 of the programme for Government contains a promise for political reform. That promise appears, at the very least, a little aspirational now. I have a simple question for the Taoiseach. If <i>The Sunday Times</i> had not published the story about the Garda report last Sunday, is it not the case that the Taoiseach would not have asked Deputy Cowen to answer questions in the Dáil? Is it also not the case that the Taoiseach was relying on legal threats to gag the media and that he had agreed previously with Deputy Cowen that he would not tell the Dáil about the Garda report because the Taoiseach thought that those legal threats would prevent the media from publishing?</p>

          <p eId="para_392">I am following up on last week when I asked a question about masks. I refer to the 2 m social distancing on public transport having been reduced to 1 m without the mandatory wearing of masks or criminal consequences or fines. It is welcome that that happened this Monday. I use buses and public transport all the time. I was on the bus yesterday and everybody was wearing masks and I was on the Luas today and everybody was also wearing masks. The drivers, however, were expected to tell people that they could not board without a mask. I think that is outrageous and the issue should be looked at from the perspective of the National Bus and Rail Union, NBRU, raising the issue of policing public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> We are increasingly reaching a point now where everybody should be wearing a mask in public in indoor places, such as in supermarkets and other retail outlets and even in here. We should all be wearing masks to protect one another. I am not an expert in this area, but the Government should be looking at this issue now from the point of view of public health. I would like the Taoiseach's opinion on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_394">I recall the Deputy raising this issue last week and I did move to try to bring this matter to a conclusion. That is why on Friday the Minister for Health signed the regulations regarding the wearing of masks on public transport. I did that notwithstanding the tensions. These things can be delayed indefinitely because of people wanting to know who is going to do everything, specifically and exactly. It is interesting that once the regulations were signed, the public adhered to them. It is always my view that the public is generally compliant with regulations that are passed in the public interest and so it turned out.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> I respect the position of the NBRU. My late father was a founding member of the NBRU and sometimes I am accused of having too soft a spot for it by other unions. Notwithstanding that, we need to work collectively to ensure that what has emerged remains the position. Regarding other sectors, we need to examine what the position will be in respect of retail locations, for example. That is something that will be subject to further examination.</p>

          <p eId="para_396">On page 113, the programme for Government refers to outlining preparations for post-Covid-19 education and the return to school. The Taoiseach has just said that it is the number one priority. Parents, however, were absolutely aghast at the interview given by the Minister for Education and Skills to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> because there was scarcely any answer at all in the interview.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> It is 15 July, it is four months since schools closed and it is about six weeks until schools reopen. Consultations only began in mid to late May. We were promised a roadmap a month ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">That seems to have completely fallen off the agenda. Parents are at a loss. Many are very concerned and unbelievably frustrated. They want to know whether their children will be back for three, four or five days per week. They want to know whether they will have to wear masks on buses. They want to know how many children will be in each pod. They want to know whether schools will get extra funding, resources and teachers. All those questions are unanswered at this stage. Time is running out. It is not good enough. Of all Departments, the Department of Education and Skills has been the most slack in the Covid-19 context. Parents and teachers are frustrated.</p>

The representative group has been in touch with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to outline measures that will help them to stay in business. They have been excluded from all grant aid. The only possibility of generating income is when schools are back. Will the Taoiseach take on board their proposals and commit to specific measures to help them in the July stimulus package?

We are going from 25 traditional apprenticeships to 100 potential new apprenticeships. One of the things that has been holding this back is the very limited involvement of the public service in apprenticeships. Will the Taoiseach consider, through either the July stimulus package or the national economic plan, providing for the public service to take on an ambitious programme of apprenticeships? Many of the apprenticeship areas are now relevant, including laboratory technicians, engineering services staff, maintenance engineers, accounting technicians, financial services staff and supply chain specialists. They are very much at the core of what the public service should be doing. It would be a great boost to apprenticeships. Let us compare Ireland to Germany. A total of 500,000 people enrol in apprenticeships every year in Germany. In Ireland it is only 1% of that number.</p>

          <p eId="para_417"> One thinks of the great role semi-state companies played in the past in terms of apprenticeship and training across the board. It is something that needs to be rekindled, regenerated and rejuvenated in the modern public service. The Deputy has made an important point and it is one I take a personal interest in.

          <p eId="para_419"> This sector has been decimated by Covid-19. The flood of properties that were in this sector but are now up for general rent on the market shows the effect the sector has on supply.

          <p eId="para_420">In principle, yes. This is an opportunity, particularly on the homelessness question, to drive down homelessness. The Deputy is correct in saying that it illustrates the impact short-term lettings have had on the availability of units and houses for people generally. We have to prioritise. I will certainly be speaking to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government about reviewing those regulations.</p>

          <p eId="para_421">I raised privately with the Taoiseach earlier the issue of the iconic and transformative north quays project for Waterford. I know he is aware of the importance of this project. Planning permission was granted last week. The council has tried to get certainty on funding and the sequencing right for two and a half years, but this has still not happened. I spoke to the CEO of the council earlier, who is exasperated. It is very important for the future of Waterford city and the south-east. Can the Taoiseach intervene and talk to the Ministers with responsibility for housing and local government and public expenditure and reform and give the people of the south-east certainty on this iconic project so that it can go ahead very quickly?</p>

          <p eId="para_422">The Deputy spoke to me before this session. It is very important project and one that has great potential for Waterford. I will pursue the issue. Notwithstanding that I am Taoiseach, it is not in my gift to instruct every Minister to provide every grant to every project. This is an important project with critical mass that can have knock-on benefits for the region. I will talk to the Ministers with responsibility for housing and public expenditure about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_423">On behalf of all of the publicans in rural Ireland, I ask the Taoiseach to give them the green light to open next Monday. They have waited for 17 or 18 weeks. People living in rural valleys, glens and highways do not have the wherewithal to go to bigger towns where they have to have a meal. They do not have the time or funding to do so. People used to go to their local pub for a couple of drinks. They are at their wits' end. Mental health is an issue for publicans and people who cannot get a drink and have a conversation in rural Ireland because all the doors have been closed to them. Some two-thirds of the publicans in Dublin are working. Half of the pubs in larger towns have reopened. Nothing is happening in rural Ireland. Places such as Gneeveguilla, Scartaglin, Rathmore, Brosna, Knocknagoshel and Sneem have been shut down. It is not fair. The Government is discriminating against the publicans in rural Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_424">I am reluctant to intervene in such lyricism. The manner in which the Deputy can ream off wonderful phrases is something I genuinely enjoy. His point is well made. In respect of the plight of publicans in rural Ireland and the life experience of people more generally in terms of the impact of Covid-19, the overriding priority will be public health. Public health advice will be made available to the Cabinet this evening and the Government will make a decision based on that. As I said earlier, there is some concern about the increase in the spread of the virus. We have to be very clear-headed about our overarching priority and where our focus needs to be. That is the approach that will inform our response to NPHET's advice.</p>

            <p eId="para_524">I thank the Taoiseach for the rundown on the number and variety of Cabinet committees. Can he confirm which committee will discuss the implications of the Apple judgment? I assume it will be dealt with by the committee on economic recovery and investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_525"> The programme for Government commits to a commission on taxation and welfare. We in the Labour Party have repeatedly called for the establishment of a standing committee on taxation. We have also repeatedly called for a minimum effective corporation tax rate in the interests of tax and economic justice and fairness more generally. There are commitments in the programme for Government relating to tax reform, but many of them are, quite frankly, very weak on specifics. Can the Taoiseach confirm that a commission will be established that will identify in real time some of the abuses of the Irish tax system?</p>
            <p eId="para_526"> The truth is that many multinational corporations are way ahead of this Government and other governments internationally in the way in which they aggressively plan their tax affairs. Will the Taoiseach consider establishing a commission on taxation on a statutory standing basis to ensure that, in real time, we can understand the operations of large companies that aggressively plan their tax affairs? It is critical that is done in the interests of Irish taxpayers and citizens, as well as in the interests of fairness in this country and economy. It would ensure that we could respond in real time to some of the aggressive tax planning that goes on.</p>

            <p eId="para_527">We discussed some of these matters yesterday and the Taoiseach again set out for us the committee structure, for which I thank him. Yesterday I asked him about the Government co-ordination committee and he explained that this was the forum in which the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and the leader of the Green Party would meet and discuss matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_528">I asked the Taoiseach yesterday if that was the mechanism by which he briefed his Government colleagues on the full story in respect of the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, and he said that was not the case. This morning the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, leader of the Green Party, said he had been fully informed of all facts in respect of the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, in what he called "a timely fashion". I simply want the Taoiseach, when he gets to his feet, to place on the record of the Dáil when it was he gave the full information in his possession from the weekend of 3 and 4 July. When did he inform the Tánaiste and the leader of the Green Party and fully brief them on the full facts?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mick Barry<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_529">Can the Taoiseach tell us when the Cabinet's education sub-committee is due to have its first meeting? <i>The Irish Times</i> reported on Monday that the National Educational Psychological Service presented a report to the Department of Education and Skills regarding stress and anxiety levels among Irish second level students. The report is said to have found much higher levels of anxiety over school work and exam-related stress than is the case in other developed countries. The report apparently finds that 50% of second level students feel nervous and stressed and 25% feel physically unwell when thinking about exams.</p>
            <p eId="para_530"> Interestingly, the report in the newspaper said the report was a key factor in the then Minister, Deputy McHugh's, decision to cancel the leaving certificate. Actually, when one thinks about it those are not just arguments for cancelling leaving certificate 2020 but for cancelling the leaving certificate, full stop, and replacing it with a more student-friendly and less stressful way to measure a student's level of educational attainment.</p>
            <p eId="para_531"> The report goes on to say that, separately, education authorities are said to have drawn up options to give students more choice in next year's State exams to help make up for lost teaching time. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and the State Examinations Commission, SEC, have reported to the Minister for Education and Skills on that and there is to be consultation between stakeholders between here and the end of July.</p>
            <p eId="para_532"> I give a cautious welcome to this news, which is positive if the proposed changes genuinely make up for lost teaching time; a big issue for the forgotten fifth years, as I call them. It would be the opposite if they were to fall significantly short of genuinely making up for lost teaching time. We will soon see. I hope the information can be presented to this House before we rise at the end of July. Perhaps the Taoiseach could informs us when the first meeting of the education Cabinet sub-committee will be and whether these issues will feature on the agenda of that meeting.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_533">First, with regard to the Apple judgment, obviously we have the committee on economic recovery but the Cabinet as a whole will consider it this evening and will have a report on it. It is important to make the point that Ireland is only entitled to revenue within the law and legal framework. The essential judgment is that the Commission's decision is being annulled and so Ireland was not in a position to get any of that revenue because it was not entitled to it. That is the decision of the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_534"> I also make that point that we need to look at the broader issue of global companies and multinationals and how their tax treatment is organised. Equally, it must be said that Ireland's industrial policy for more than 40 years now has been to attract foreign direct investment. It is founded on a basic strong relationship with those companies be they in life sciences, technology, financial services or in other sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_535"> Tax certainty has been critical to that success, and it has been a success story. For far too long people on the far-left, in particular, and I am not going to put those in that bracket, have been niggardly in any acknowledgment of the central role of foreign direct investment in terms of the creation of modern Ireland as being a country of manufacturing excellence that creates good synergies with small to medium-sized indigenous companies and a sector that has created significant employment. I rarely hear that being said when this debate happens. It is a debate that has been fought on populist and simplistic grounds. The other key part of that agenda has been Ireland's reputation and credibility, in particular, the credibility of our revenue, because it is not just about one company, it is about a broader approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_536"> In essence, the court is saying that no special aid was given. No State aid was given in this respect. This may be appealed and if Apple had appealed it on its own it would have been the same decision of the court. That must be said. The Cabinet as a whole will assess it in the first instance. The Government's position is that we prefer the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, approach to dealing with it. I take the Deputy's point that there are issues. Global companies are bigger than states now. This is happening at European Union level as well and there is much vigorous debate internationally on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_537"> With regard to Deputy McDonald's question, I did answer that question yesterday. The Deputy has a habit of suggesting that I never answered a question. I did answer the question, which was if this was the mechanism by which issues around the Deputy Cowen controversy would be organised, in other words, the Cabinet co-ordination committee. The Cabinet co-ordination committee is a Cabinet committee. Discussions held there are, like all Cabinet committees, subject to the framework of confidentiality. I said to Deputy McDonald yesterday it is possible that at such a committee issues of that kind would be discussed, and also that outside of that committee there had been discussions. As Deputy Ryan said, he was fully informed on a timely basis. I was not fully informed on 3 or 4 July.</p>

            <p eId="para_547">In terms of the leaving certificate and the National Educational Psychological Service, it is important to point out that there have been significant reforms to the leaving certificate over the last 20 years with a greater reduction on the emphasis on written exams. That is a good thing. The benefit of the leaving certificate has been its anonymity, the fact that it is fair and that it avoids any subjective correction of results. I favour a greater use of continuous assessment and project-based work and I look forward to the fact that other options are now being considered to give students greater choice. There have been better reforms in recent years on the oral competence in the leaving certificate, which is a good thing. It needs to be tested and assessed in terms of languages. The Irish language now is a much more significant part of the exam than the written part. Students taking the history curriculum have the opportunity to do a history project which accounts for approximately 20% of the results.</p>
            <p eId="para_548">That is the kind of initiative I would like to see more of because it enables students to learn and develop a lot more.</p>
            <p eId="para_549"> I take the Deputy's point about the stress on students. That needs to be eased. I value the work of the education psychological service. I was the Minister responsible for establishing it in the late 1990s and it does valuable work.</p>

            <p eId="para_551">As I am a trained historian, as is the Taoiseach, I hope he will recognise the role that my party, the Labour Party, has played in opening Ireland up to the investment of multinational corporations. The view has always been that this was an initiative of Seán Lemass and the late T. K. Whitaker, a good friend of mine from my alma mater in Drogheda, St. Joseph's CBS, but of course, it was William Norton, then Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce and leader of the Labour Party, who first opened Ireland up to investment and moved us away from the isolationist perspective. We owe a debt of gratitude to William Norton, and, indeed, those who followed, in terms of modernising our economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_552"> I stress a generous competitive corporation tax offering does not a national industrial strategy make. Of course, we have a considerable focus on the issue of corporation tax - that needs to be a minimum effective rate of corporation tax in the interest of fairness, decency and tax justice - but we also need to focus on the skills gaps that are emerging and the fact that, for example, we have one of the lowest levels of in-work training in the OECD, at 5.5%, as compared to Denmark, that is up at 33%. In the July stimulus under the national economic recovery plan, we need to focus on that, making sure that people are ready for the jobs of the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_553"> Finally, we need to be mindful of the advice from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, published today. It has drawn attention to the fact that the international corporation tax regime will change over the next few years. Ireland needs to lead that and work with the OECD. I was one of the Ministers in the mid-2010s who signed up to the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process in the interests of tax justice and fairness. We need to be conscious and mindful that IFAC has stated there will be a diminution of corporation tax receipts over the next few years in the context of both the BEPS process and changes to the international corporation tax system. The people of this country are entitled to expect decent public services. We need to be able to pay for them with a tax system that is objectively fair to everybody, and by "fair", I mean that multinational corporations should pay their fair share, as well as the hardworking people of Ireland and small businesses across the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_555">My ask is straightforward. On the weekend of 3 and 4 July, the Taoiseach discussed all aspects of the Cowen case with the former Minister, Deputy Cowen. On what date did the Taoiseach give full information or have a full discussion with the Tánaiste and with the leader of the Green Party? On what date did the Taoiseach make them fully conversant with all of the facts? That is all I want.</p>

            <p eId="para_557">In one sentence, could the Taoiseach comment on the second half of the question I raised about the idea of tapering next year's leaving certificate in order to give more choice and options to students who have lost a significant amount of teaching time and give his view on that?</p>

            <p eId="para_558">I would take on board what Deputy Nash has said. I do not disagree with the Deputy's point. The participation in the BEPS process is an important process. Initially, the corporation tax rate was very important. There is no point in pretending it was not. The Deputy does not suggest that but, as a former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, particularly on the life sciences front, many companies wanted certainty around our tax proposition and it was a competitive world in terms of tax offerings. The Deputy is absolutely correct that skills are equally important now in my view; the level and quality of our education system. I always remember Craig Barrett of Intel saying in his speech that three things are critical for any government: education, education, education. Fourth level, in terms of research, is vital now as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_559"> The BEPS process is key. There is a global issue around this in terms of governments having the wherewithal to fund services and underpin the social contract. That is key. That said, in Ireland, the corporation tax yield is going up and up, although there is a vulnerability in terms of the limited number of companies that account for a very large volume of the corporation tax receipts that come in. I certainly take the Deputy's point in relation to William Norton's historic role - a good man who made a good contribution to Irish public life.</p>
            <p eId="para_560"> In response to Deputy McDonald, the question is phrased in such a way as if I had full knowledge on 3 and 4 July, and I did not have full knowledge. I have stated repeatedly that Deputy Cowen was of a view and he took his own actions in relation to that. He did not have any document that weekend and I think it took the following week for him to get access to the document. I had a number of conversations throughout the period with the Deputies concerned and, as I said, this week I had a comprehensive engagement on the issue as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_561"> In terms of the fifth years, it is a fair point. Arrangements should be made to try to facilitate those students who have lost out so much this year in terms of their preparation for the leaving certificate next year. That will have to be kept under constant review as well because the possibility is that we will be living with Covid for quite some time; maybe not at the levels that occasioned the shutdown of the schools but we can never be too sure. We have to constantly devise new ways of helping and facilitating students through this difficult process.</p>

            <p eId="para_569"> I had a video conference with the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, on 1 July, ahead of this week's meeting of the European Council. President Michel set out his approach to negotiations on the next generation European Union recovery proposal and on the multi-annual financial framework for 2021 to 2027 and suggested where compromise will be necessary to make agreement possible. I set out Ireland's support for an ambitious European Union recovery fund and emphasised that the fund should be targeted at those regions and sectors most affected by the Covid crisis. On the multi-annual financial framework, I reiterated Ireland's strong position on the importance of an adequately resourced Common Agricultural Policy. I also stated that the European Union should be in a position to offer support to those member states most affected by Brexit, including Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_570"> I spoke to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, on 30 June. I noted the strong alignment between the programme for Government and European Union priorities, including climate action and the digital agenda. We also agreed that it was important to reach early agreement on the recovery fund and the multi-annual financial framework. On Brexit, I expressed my appreciation for the support Ireland has received from the Commission and for the excellent co-operation with the Commission team led by Michel Barnier. I expressed my appreciation directly to Michel Barnier in my call with him.</p>
            <p eId="para_571"> I spoke with the German Chancellor, Dr. Merkel, on 2 July, when we discussed Brexit and the European Union's response to Covid-19. I took the opportunity to wish the Chancellor well with Germany's European Union Presidency.</p>
            <p eId="para_572"> My calls with the Prime Ministers, Mr. Rutte and Mr. Costa, and President Nauseda of Lithuania, covered current European Union issues, including the recovery fund and the multi-annual financial framework, as well as the Covid crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_573">Where appropriate, in my calls I sought support for the Minister for Finance's successful candidacy for the presidency of the Eurogroup. I congratulate him on his success. I spoke with the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, on 30 June. Our discussion covered Covid-19 and our respective plans to deal with its impact on the economy, employment and society. We also discussed Brexit. We agreed to work closely with regard to Northern Ireland as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement and on strengthening bilateral relations, especially in the post-Brexit era. We look forward to meeting in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_574">I thank the Taoiseach. As he will know, I come from and represent a Border constituency. It is no exaggeration to say that Brexit is a massive concern. It is always in the background. Those concerns have only been compounded by the current public health and economic crises caused by Covid-19. What precisely did the UK Prime Minister say to the Taoiseach about the prospect of a deal during their phone call? Did the Taoiseach raise with the German Chancellor Irish concerns about the size of the EU financial package and the prospect of a special €5 billion fund for the countries, such as Ireland, which will be most adversely affected by Brexit? Does the Taoiseach expect that the EU budget and recovery package will be agreed at the next European Council meeting?</p>

            <p eId="para_575">The Taoiseach mentioned the discussion he had with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. Did the issue of the Apple tax judgment come up in that discussion? He mentioned in the previous round that he felt the left has been niggardly in acknowledging the role of foreign direct investment. I would argue that the right has been niggardly in accepting and acknowledging that the level of tax paid by the Apple corporation in this State was unacceptable. I understand that the General Court of the European Union in Luxembourg today ruled that Ireland did not give Apple illegal state aid. I do not believe the court challenged the level of tax Apple paid in the period from 2003 to 2014 in particular. The Taoiseach can correct me if I am wrong. It paid corporation tax at 1% in 2003 and at 0.005% in 2014. In fact, the court seems to say that, rather than being illegal, that completely, totally and absolutely unacceptable level of tax was legal. That would say something about the law in this country and the way in which it is fixed in favour of big multinational corporations at the expense of society. This tax, even if paid at the low rate of 12.5%, would represent a serious sum of money which could and should be used for our health service, our education service and to reduce inequality within society. Did that feature in the Taoiseach's discussion?</p>

            <p eId="para_576">For the record, I wish to reflect on the fact that the Taoiseach has not answered the very straightforward question I put to him. From the record of the Dáil, we now know the Taoiseach knew that Deputy Cowen had made an incomplete statement to the Dáil. We will therefore have to ask the Tánaiste and the leader of the Green Party, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, whether they also knew that the statement made was incomplete. I will pursue that matter with them since the Taoiseach will not answer.</p>
            <p eId="para_577"> I raise the issue of the failure to include workers in the North, by which I mean Antrim, Armagh, Derry, Down, Fermanagh and Tyrone, from the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment. This matter was raised repeatedly by many Deputies on the last Government's watch. Every time it was raised, the former Minister hid behind EU regulations. I fear that the new Minister will take the same tack. The position of the former Government was that EU rules relating to cross-Border workers determine that the member state of the resident is competent for the payment of unemployment benefits. Of course, this is not the case. In response to questions put to the Commission by my colleague, Chris MacManus MEP, it has been confirmed that EU regulations do not provide for a harmonised social security system in the EU. It was also confirmed that, under EU regulations, workers living in the North should have access to the same social and tax advantages granted by the member state in which they work as are granted to workers resident in the South.</p>
            <p eId="para_578"> Is the Taoiseach concerned about this matter? Did he or will he raise this matter with the European Commission? Does it not concern the Taoiseach that, contrary to EU regulations, residents of the North who work in the South have been significantly disadvantaged financially by not receiving the €350 pandemic payment to which they are entitled? Will the Government now reverse this decision and ensure that these workers receive the full unemployment payment to which they are and have been entitled? Will his shared island unit tackle the deeply embedded partitionist approach to public administration evident in the previous Government? I hope this approach will be rooted out within this Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_582">I thank the Acting Chairman. I challenge what the Taoiseach said earlier about the Apple tax ruling. The ruling clearly states that the tax rulings made by Revenue were ineffective and inconsistent. The court does not contest that the level of tax on chargeable profits was totally out of line with the amount of tax that would be paid anywhere else under normal market conditions. In other words, the court accepted that Apple was involved in aggressive tax avoidance here. It only said that it could not quite prove that the inconsistent, ineffective and incredibly low tax rate Apple enjoyed through tax avoidance strategies represented an advantage deliberately conferred on that company, because that is a difficult thing to prove. The point is that we were being used as a tax haven and that Revenue's rulings were inconsistent and ineffective. Unless we think Revenue is stupid, which I do not believe it is, it is clear that we were colluding with these tax avoidance strategies. It is shameful that we did so because it means we have put the interests of a super-wealthy corporation ahead of the interests of the ordinary people who could badly do with that €13 billion in cash.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_583">Deputy Nash's question was first. During my conversation with the British Prime Minister, on Brexit he said and we both agreed that it was in the best interests of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Europe that a comprehensive trade deal be agreed. We also agreed that we needed to get moving and introduce momentum to the talks. In my earlier conversation with Michel Barnier, there was a sense that momentum had not yet been injected into the talks and that it was necessary to make more rapid progress than has been made thus far. The British Prime Minister was very much taken with the idea of getting a deal done that would be comprehensive, good for the future relationship between the UK and Europe and that would be tariff free and quota free. I made the point that it would have to be subject to access to the Single Market and a level playing pitch. That was the nature of the discussion. It remains to be seen what will happen. The talks are still slow enough. There has been some progress with regard to the Northern Ireland protocol. More progress is needed on the other key issues that have held up talks to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_584"> With regard to my conversations with Angela Merkel and the size of the overall package, the Chancellor was very anxious that a deal be done at this meeting of the Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_585">I said we supported the overall size of the package, that we felt that Europe needed to make a significant response given the crisis we are in and that that was important for confidence across Europe. We export to countries all over Europe and it is important that there is a strong eurozone and European recovery because that would benefit Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_586"> I think there is a 50:50 chance of success. It is not going to be easy. Some countries are very much against the size of the package. Some are against the nature of what has been proposed but progress has been made and the most recent negotiating box put forward by Charles Michel is reflective of some of our concerns, in particular the Brexit compensatory fund but also the idea of changing the allocation key in respect of the 70% to 30% split so that now 30% will be used later to deal with the impact of Covid. It will take some time.</p>
            <p eId="para_587"> In response to Deputy Barry's question, no I did not raise the Apple judgment with the President of the Commission, nor did he raise it with me. Obviously, that was a matter for the courts. The court has ruled and we either have regard for the rule of law and the courts or we do not. I heard Deputy Boyd Barrett's remarks as well. It is as if the court did not rule at all. The court annulled the decision of the Commission and essentially stated that Ireland did not collect any tax to which it was not entitled, nor could we collect tax to which we are not legally entitled.</p>
            <p eId="para_588"> I also make the point that 6,000 people work in Apple now. That matters. They are ordinary people. They never get mentioned. The relationship between Ireland and Apple from 1980 onwards has been a strong one. Ireland has to live in the real world. Approximately 245,000 jobs in this country have been created by multinational companies. That is not insignificant. Those are ordinary people working in those companies. We have had to compete for those industries.</p>
            <p eId="para_589"> I do take the overall point, as I stated in response to Deputy Nash earlier, in respect of the global framework and the necessity to work with the BEPS process and to get a fairer system globally in respect of the revenue of multinational corporations. However, we have to be sensible as a country too in the sense that we have to retain jobs here. These are subjects that rarely get discussed in this House. The debate is always in one direction. That is the basic argument I make to Deputy Barry and to Deputy Boyd Barrett. The other side of the story never gets discussed. Ireland is a much different country now than it was 30, 40 or 50 years ago. We are very good at manufacturing – high level and high-end manufacturing. We are very good at technology and software. We have a good indigenous sector. We have an emerging entrepreneurial sector. I put a significant amount of that down to the fact that there has been a significant spin-off from the presence of multinationals here, more than just money, funding and corporation tax. Many of our companies have grown on the back of that and are now themselves major companies as a result.</p>
            <p eId="para_590"> It very often depends on whether one believes in an enterprise economy or not. I believe we do need to change. We need to increase the level of focus on indigenous companies and try to grow them and help them more but, equally, we must be conscious that we are in a mobile, global world where other countries are competing. We have to keep our eyes open in that regard and not be naive about it either. I agree with what Deputy Nash said earlier, that there are other issues such as skills, education and research that can help to attract people in and embed them here as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_591"> I do not accept the assertions made. The Deputies are now changing the goalposts in terms of what the court did or did not do. The court was asked to assess whether illegal state aid had been provided in a deal done by Ireland with Apple and the court has annulled the conclusion that the Commission came to some time ago. In essence, that is what has happened. It is open to the Commission to appeal that. I think it has up to two years to appeal the decision and the funding will stay in the escrow account.</p>
            <p eId="para_592"> In response to Deputy McDonald's questions on the pandemic unemployment payment, I will pursue the issue with the Minister concerned. Things are never as simple as they are presented in terms of issues of this kind. To be fair to the outgoing Government, the pandemic unemployment payment, with which party leaders in the Opposition all agreed, was an important intervention to protect livelihoods. It does involve significant resources, as did the wage subsidy scheme. It got refined over time as anomalies emerged in the application of both schemes. I will have the matter examined.</p>

            <p eId="para_594">The Cabinet committee on health was established by Government decision on 6 July last. The first meeting has been scheduled for 23 July. It will oversee implementation of programme for Government commitments on health and will receive detailed reports and identify policy areas and consider the implementation of health reforms, including Sláintecare, and the development of mental health services. Its membership will comprise the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for enterprise, employment and trade, the Minister for climate action, communications networks and transport, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Other Ministers or Ministers of State shall participate as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_595"> The Cabinet committee on the Government response to Covid-19 has met once under the new Government on 3 July. In addition to the meetings of the full Cabinet and of Cabinet committees, I meet Ministers on an individual basis to focus on particular issues. I met the Minister for Health and the Secretary General on 6 July to discuss priorities in the area of health.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_596">One of the driving rationales for the Cabinet sub-committees that we have discussed is to achieve what the Taoiseach called a coherence in government and cross-departmental working. That is important and it is very challenging for public administration to reach that point. In the case of health, a number of immediacies need to be recognised. The first is the reality that because of the public health crisis, the Covid emergency, many services were compromised and therefore, people's needs, necessarily in many cases, got put on the long finger. There is a shared concern across the Oireachtas regarding the morbidity effects of that and we need to have a really concerted effort not just to get service provision back to where it was but to invest more heavily. I believe that means investment in the public system. I do not believe that the route of privatisation or putting public money into private provision is the way forward. I think we have had that for too long.</p>
            <p eId="para_597"> Many of the section 39 organisations that provide essential services, albeit at arm's length from the State, have really felt the pinch and pressure in these times of emergency. We need to look again at the entire model of provision, as to how those services are supported. I raise with the Taoiseach the stark reality that for many section 38 and 39 organisations, their ability to independently fundraise has been very seriously compromised because of the emergency provisions and this needs to be taken into account.</p>
            <p eId="para_598"> The protections and rights as employees of those who work within those organisations providing services also need to be comprehensively reviewed. We must be absolutely sure that in every respect, including pension entitlements, these workers are fully respected, recognised and protected.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">The Taoiseach knows, as I do, that this is not currently the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_600">On health, I suggest the Taoiseach start taking French lessons. In recognition of the heroic work of healthcare workers, the French Government have just announced an €8 billion package of pay increases for them because of their tremendous work in protecting people and French society in the face of Covid-19. Healthcare workers in this country have done work every bit as heroic to protect us all, to protect our society, and to prevent our health system from being overrun. As a consequence, they have suffered from some of the highest infection rates, in percentage terms, of healthcare workers anywhere in the world. Are we going to follow the example of France and reward them for that fact? They deserve it themselves for what they have done, but if the Government is going to establish the permanent increases in capacity that we have to have to do Covid and non-Covid care - to be able to deal with a second wave and to do all the non-Covid healthcare - we need permanent increases in capacity and that means large-scale recruitment. The big impediments to recruiting healthcare workers are the pay inequalities for new entrants and the low pay generally that nurses, midwives and some healthcare workers have to put up with. There is a double advantage in pay increases and pay equality for healthcare workers. First, it will record the heroes and, second, it will help us establish the permanent increases in healthcare capacity that we need to deal with the post-Covid world.</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_601">Deputy McDonald's question referenced section 38 and section 39 organisations; I understand the previous Government did make an allocation from the Dormant Accounts Fund to try to ease the pressure that many of them are under. That said, it is clear that their capacity to fundraise has been significantly reduced. Others have developed novel ways of trying to raise funding but it is not at the level it was for them. In addition, there will be a review of that sector. It is a long-standing model whereby the organisations have considerable autonomy but essentially perform services as agents of the State in terms of contracts and so on. They look after very vulnerable people and people in need in our community and society.</p>
            <p eId="para_602"> We are concentrating and focusing on the other key issue I mentioned earlier, namely the resumption of services for the treatment of non-Covid illnesses and the development of diagnostics and so on. Last Friday, the Minister for Health and I met HSE officials with a specific focus on the winter initiative and the need to deal with the resumption of services for non-Covid illnesses and that strand of services. It will be challenging, of that there is no doubt. Emergency attendance bed capacity is back at 94%, which is too high, particularly in the context of any resurgence in Covid or the arrival of the flu season. That is why I wanted to meet with the HSE, to drive home early the need for early measures to try to ward off the challenges that will undoubtedly be faced by the health service over the next number of weeks and months.</p>
            <p eId="para_603"> On Deputy Boyd Barrett's questions, at that meeting I was connected to health service workers all over the country via teleconference. I thanked all of them for the outstanding contribution that our front-line healthcare workers and those working in administration behind the scenes have made to the country in addressing the Covid-19 emergency. I acknowledge the innovation and the commitment they showed as well as the trauma many workers endured when communicating with families who lost loved ones and could not be with them at the time of their passing. Anyone who saw the "RTÉ Investigates" programme about the impact of Covid-19 in one hospital would have been very struck by the emotional experiences of the front-line workers, apart altogether from their professional contribution, so we are very conscious of that.</p>
            <p eId="para_604"> The French package is perhaps in a different context as well. There were other issues in terms of the wider package. As a country we have had to deal with an enormous issue here. We will have a deficit of approximately €30 billion at the end of the year. These are issues that we continue to examine, and there are continuing pressures. The July stimulus is about trying to help people get back to work and supporting livelihoods of those who have no job at all at the moment and whose prospects are uncertain because of the continued prevalence of Covid-19 in our community. This is a step-by-step approach. Covid is not over. Where financial and economic planning is concerned, we have to plan not just for the next three months but for the next 12 months. We must plan also how we allocate resources now to try to deal with the range of impacts that Covid is having on different sectors of our society and our economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_605">The previous Government allowed the HSE to implement a cut of 1% to the 2020 budget for disability services. I raised this matter on behalf of the Disability Action Coalition during the lockdown and the HSE insisted that these so-called efficiencies, which amount to €20 million, had to be found. Far from trying to cushion the blow or give additional support they insisted on this very miserly cut. More recently, the Minister for Health conceded that the cut to disability services was now considered problematic given the huge pressures on the sector and services because to Covid. However, he has not yet clearly stated that the €20 million cut will be reversed, nor has he informed the organisations affected that their budgets will not be cut. I would be very grateful if the Taoiseach clarified this situation for the Disability Action Coalition and the many organisations that they represent.</p>

            <p eId="para_607">We should not set the need to recruit health workers to increase the capacity of the health service against the need to stimulate other parts of the economy. Recruiting health workers should be part of the stimulus for two reasons. First, if our health service is overwhelmed, then we can forget everything else. The stimulus will mean nothing if we have to lock down our economy again. A precondition, therefore, for the reopening of the economy is to get the public health service up to capacity levels that will allow us to continue to function economically. The two go hand in hand.</p>
            <p eId="para_608"> Second, paying health workers properly and recruiting more of them will in itself be a stimulus to the economy and to every part of the country that has health service facilities or hospitals. In Dún Laoghaire, St. Michael's Hospital holds the local economy together. I am sure that is true for Tallaght and many other parts of the country where there are hospitals, so the two are not set against one another; they are intimately connected. It is very important that the Government recognises that in the July stimulus from both an economic point of view and from the imperative of getting our health service up to the capacity levels we need to be able to function alongside Covid-19.</p>

            <p eId="para_609">To respond to both Deputies, we are no longer talking about amounts of €20 million where health is concerned. We are talking about billions of euro being required by the Department of Health.</p>
            <p eId="para_610">The Estimates for the next 12 months will be quite staggering relative to what was spent prior to the emergence of the virus and issues to do with personal protective equipment and a variety of other measures to support hospitals and staff. Deputy Boyd Barrett is correct; I did not mean to juxtapose the two. Of course, recruitment to health is very important and we need not only to continue to recruit but also to make conditions better and enhance our human resource service and performance in the health service in general so that not only do we recruit people but we retain them. This is something on which I will be particularly strong.</p>
            <p eId="para_611"> With regard to disability services and the cut, I will again engage with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, on this. There will be substantial increases in health funding. We have already seen the Supplementary Estimate but more will be needed to deal with many of the issues that Covid is bringing on board.</p>

While EU leaders have met five times in recent months by videoconference, and twice by videoconference with leaders from neighbouring regions, this will be the first time that leaders will meet in person since the special European Council held on 20 February and since the start of the current Covid-19 crisis. It will also be my first time to attend a meeting of the European Council as Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> The essential focus of this week's meeting will be the proposed budgetary package for the EU for the next seven years, that is the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and a new recovery proposal, Next Generation EU, to support and accelerate economic recovery across the EU in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> In advance of this week's meeting and in preparation for our discussions, I have engaged with a number of my counterparts, including Charles Michel, President of the European Council, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, and fellow leaders, Angela Merkel, Mark Rutte, Gitanas Nauseda and António Costa. In these engagements I have expressed my strong support for an ambitious MFF focused on economic recovery and the green transition, and a recovery fund to match the scale of the greatest challenge we have faced for decades. An unprecedented challenge demands an unprecedented and collective response.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> I will approach this week's meeting in a constructive manner and with the aim of reaching agreement. As I told President Michel, I very much hope that it will be possible to reach agreement. In recent times, the EU has experienced considerable division and discord. It would send a strong signal to our citizens if these divisions could be set aside in the interests of reaching a compromise outcome that sets the EU on the path to recovery and to a better future. However, I will only sign off on a package that is fair, balanced and meets Ireland's needs. Of course, political agreement in the Council is a first step. Once it has been achieved, the consent of the European Parliament is also required for the MFF to come into operation from the beginning of next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> President Michel presented his new proposal, or negotiating box, last Friday in the form of draft conclusions for this week's meeting. The revised negotiating box is receiving careful consideration by all relevant Ministers and Departments. We had an initial discussion of it at Government on Monday and the Cabinet committee on Europe will consider it further tomorrow. What is clear is that President Michel has set out an ambitious proposal for strategic recovery for Europe. It focuses on repairing the damage caused by Covid-19 while also setting clear direction for a fairer, greener digital future grounded in shared EU values.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> President Michel recognises the need for the right overall balance in any final package that can be agreed by 27 member states. From his discussions with European leaders, including my own constructive exchanges with him on 1 July, he has identified six building blocks as a basis for possible political agreement. The first is the overall size of the package, whereby he proposes a new multi-financial framework of more than €1 trillion in 2018 prices, based largely on the package considered by leaders in February. The second is broad continuity with the current position on the issue of rebates, an issue of significant concern for a number of member states. The third is the size of the new recovery fund, whereby he proposes retaining the ambition of a new €750 billion instrument funded by exceptional one-off borrowing on capital markets, as proposed by the European Commission in May. The fourth is the balance between loans and grants in the new instrument, whereby he proposes retaining the balance proposed by the European Commission of €500 billion in direct funding through EU programmes and €250 billion in new loan-based financial instruments. With regard to the fifth, on allocations from the recovery and resilience facility, which forms the bulk of the new fund, he proposes that 70% be committed in 2021 and 2022 using the methodology proposed by the Commission in May, with the remaining 30% of funds committed in 2023 when further data will be available, allowing greater responsiveness to the evolving economic impact of the crisis. The sixth is governance and conditionality, on which he proposes that these new arrangements be embedded in the existing European semester process and aligned with the country specific recommendations adopted by the Council each June.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> President Michel also proposes ensuring appropriate linkages between funding and the rule of law, an issue I have raised with him, and setting a 30% target for the share of the overall package meeting climate-related objectives consistent with climate neutrality by 2050, the Paris Agreement, and the do-no-harm principle of the European Green New Deal. This will undoubtedly be an important aspect of our debate when we meet. The EU is not simply an economic partnership or a trading bloc. It is a community of values and laws to which all member states must be committed, and by which they must operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> These six building blocks are accompanied by important proposals in two further areas. Alongside its proposals for spending, the Union must also provide itself with the revenue it needs. To date, this has largely been provided by member state contributions and it is my view that this should continue to be case. However, in addition to current sources, President Michel is proposing a new own resource starting in 2021, based on the weight of non-recycled plastic packaging waste. I have signalled that this is something I can support. However, I remain to be convinced about other proposals in the new negotiating box, including one based on the emissions trading system possibly reformed to include the maritime and aviation sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> I do not believe that now is the time to consider further sources, such as the carbon border adjustment tax or a digital levy, on which President Michel 's text asks the Commission to bring forward early proposals. Ireland's position on digital tax is well known. We support the work under way at the OECD. Furthermore, with the EU in the middle of a severe economic crisis, we should be very careful about introducing innovative new taxes, the consequences of which are unknown and which could seriously impede Europe's economic recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> In my discussion with President Michel and others, I also highlighted the economic impact of Brexit on Ireland. In all scenarios, Brexit will have a negative impact on important sectors in our economy, which are already dealing with the unprecedented challenges of Covid-19. If we do not succeed in reaching agreement with the UK on a free trade agreement, the impact will be all the more severe. No set of arrangements will replicate the access and benefits of the UK being a member of the EU and being within the Single Market and customs union. I expressed my strong view to President Michel that just as we as a Union are all standing in solidarity with those most impacted by Covid, so we should be able to support those most impacted by Brexit. The inclusion in this latest negotiation text of a proposal for a new Brexit adjustment reserve to counter the adverse consequences in worst affected member states and sectors is, therefore, most welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">While the details of this new proposal remain to be worked out, we are ready to work constructively with partners to ensure that it is targeted where the need is greatest and that the consequences of Brexit for Ireland are fully understood and reflected. In summary, I welcome President Michel's proposals as the basis for negotiations at this week's meeting. They are an advance on previous proposals in meeting Irish concerns, although there are other elements on which we will need to see further progress before a final agreement is reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> In line with the priorities in our programme for Government we will work constructively to agree a package focused on Covid-19 recovery and which sets out an ambitious strategic agenda for Europe. We will seek to maintain the Common Agricultural Policy budget at current levels and meet other priorities such as climate action, Horizon Europe, Erasmus and programmes such as PEACE PLUS. The negotiation of the new CAP will be critical for the next decade of farming, especially with so many pressures on the Irish farming sector and on family farms at present. As they have shown, our farmers and rural communities are ready to meet the challenge of the climate transition. A properly funded Common Agricultural Policy is a vital tool in this regard. The CAP is an important, long-standing and well-functioning policy. A strong, progressive, sustainable and resilient agrifood sector will continue to provide European consumers with high-quality and secure food into the future. I will be making this case strongly at the meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> Ireland is now a net contributor to the budget, reflecting the strong economic growth we have witnessed in recent years. As a country that has benefited from the solidarity of our partners in almost 50 years of membership, including in providing us with vital funding at times when it was needed most to drive our economic and social development, Ireland remains prepared to offer the same solidarity to those countries that continue to lag behind in economic terms. As our history shows, contributing to growth in one member state helps to build prosperity and markets for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> In recent months Covid-19 has caused a crisis without precedent at global and European levels. As well as managing and controlling the pandemic, mitigating and recovering from its impacts, including the extensive economic damage it has inflicted, remain at the top of our agenda. Reaching early agreement on the next MFF and recovery fund will be a strong signal that the EU is determined to chart the pathway to recovery together at this difficult time. I hope it will be possible to make strong and positive progress at this week's European Council meeting.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_271">
          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_627">I am sharing time with my colleague, Deputy Brady.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> This weekend the European Council will meet to discuss the multi-annual financial framework for the EU, as the Taoiseach said. The MFF will shape and direct the financial policies and priorities of the EU for the best part of the next decade. It will have a significant impact on the lives of ordinary workers and families in Ireland. The discussions on the MFF come at a time when member states are still reeling from months of battling with the Covid-19 epidemic and with the significant social and economic shocks that have arisen as a result of the pandemic. This is, therefore, perhaps the most critical multi-annual budget in the history of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> It is essential that the mistakes of the past, made in the face of another seismic crisis, are not repeated. Ten years ago we faced a different crisis, an unprecedented recession as a result of the banking crisis. The decisions taken and the political choices made at that time were undoubtedly the wrong ones. Austerity was chosen over stimulus and investment, and across the EU ordinary citizens paid the price. Economic recovery was stifled, jobs and incomes were obliterated and the draconian fiscal rules allowed right-wing governments to cut vital public services when investment was so badly needed. In Ireland, we are still living with the devastating results of those bad choices. The scale of the harm done is most acutely felt in the profound damage inflicted on our health services and housing system. The austerity era also shaped an economy that is deeply unfair and where hard-working people see their incomes hoovered up by the crippling cost of living.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> The experience of ordinary workers and families over the last ten years shows us that the EU's budget for the next decade, and its response to Covid-19, cannot be shaped by the policies of slash and burn. Covid-19 is a crisis. Crises bring challenges and tragedy, but they also bring opportunities and hope for the future. With this multi-annual budget the EU has a big opportunity to turn away from the dead-end fiscal policies of neoliberalism and privatisation and to take the first steps in creating a new era of investment in the well-being of workers and families and delivering prosperity for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> The President of the European Council has prepared a revised plan, and it is not fit for the purposes I have set out. The proposal combines the recovery fund with the seven-year budget. This creates a financial muddle in which essential programmes, such as the Common Agricultural Policy and social expenditure, are put in direct competition with Covid-19 recovery funding. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a worse outcome for workers, farmers and small businesses in Ireland and across Europe. The proposed rebates for Germany, Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands miss an opportunity to spend the not inconsiderable resources of the EU on the basis of genuine, targeted, objective need.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> I too welcome the new €5 billion Brexit reserve, but I am deeply concerned about the new EU taxes that are proposed. It appears that those in the EU who are resistant to progressive change are determined not to let a good crisis go to waste. Of course, marrying the recovery, our climate objectives and a new green deal is the correct path, but that in turn must also be married with social justice. We cannot have a regime of taxation that falls on those least able to pay and which does little, if anything, to deal with the real climate crisis coming down the tracks. I am concerned that the pathway we are seeing is the wrong one. Ordinary families and workers cannot be made to shoulder the cost of this emergency, as they were forced to carry the cost of the banking collapse. That would be unjust, unfair and reckless for the future of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> The Irish Government must be to the fore in arguing for a new departure for the people of Europe. The choice is clear. We can have a new decade shaped by the failures and hardships of the past or we can have a new decade of opportunity, growth and prosperity. This time of crisis can be the time when the work of building a new and equal Europe finally begins. This is a rare chance for real change and it is a chance that should not be wasted.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnBrady" eId="spk_272">
          <from>Deputy John Brady<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_634">As this is the first time I have had the opportunity to meet the Taoiseach in the Chamber since his election, I congratulate him and wish him well in all his endeavours in the time ahead. I also congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, on his recent promotion to a new role at the heart of what he terms to be the economic engine of Europe. In his own words and those of the Government, he assumes his role with a pledge to fight Ireland's corner in Europe and being freshly possessed with an infusion of assumed attributes which he believes mark him out as one of the shining lights of the Government. It gives me pause for thought. Given the difficulties with a certain project here at home, I wonder if the Taoiseach might consider the possibility of charging the Minister for Finance with responsibility for the completion of the national children's hospital, as it appears to be beyond the abilities of both the former and current Ministers for Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> The forthcoming European Council meeting has potentially massive implications for this country. That this is a small country which has had to face two serious crises in the space of ten years and now waits to face the implications for this island of the folly that is Tory Brexit is well ingrained in all our minds.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">I cannot say with conviction, however, that the same is true of our colleagues in Brussels. Under the original proposal, Ireland would receive less than one quarter of 1% of the overall fund. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, has spoken in the past week of how we have entered into the worst recession in 100 years, an economic forecast that predicts an 8% contraction in the year ahead, with the probability of only a partial rebound in the following year. Within this, President von der Leyen speaks of the themes of togetherness and solidarity, sentiments I applaud but which were sadly absent when Ireland was left to shoulder an unequal burden during the financial crisis of a decade ago. The mendacity of the banks revealed in the past week reminds us of the need for constant vigilance over the financial sector - a decade and a bailout later and still nothing but contempt for the Irish people. When President von der Leyen speaks of the fears of youth unemployment across Europe, of young people leaving in droves to find jobs elsewhere, it is all too painfully familiar for us in Ireland. Recently, when our airwaves were inundated with heartbreaking stories of how our young people in Australia and elsewhere were struggling to get home, we were again reminded of the ongoing price the lost generation is forced to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> Europe must be made to hear our pain, a pain which does not echo in the columns of the spreadsheets that give the detail of our economic performance. The fears of small businesses up and down this country cannot be reduced to quantitative terms. Ireland has more than earned its right to a fair and equitable share of the recovery fund. While I welcome the €5 billion reserve to address the impact of Brexit, we must resist any attempts to conflate the Brexit fund with the next generation fund. When the European Council President, Charles Michel, talks of repairing the damage caused by Covid-19 or reforming our economies and remodelling our societies, we must point to the damage wrought on our society and our economy not just by the pandemic but also by a decade of austerity, with a health system that was on the point of being completely overwhelmed before we had even heard of Covid-19, a housing crisis impacting on family organisation and social structures in a way perhaps not seen since the 19th century and, again, the pain of emigration. We must fight for every single cent we can take back from Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> I wish the Taoiseach better luck than the last Fianna Fáil Taoiseach, who went to Europe looking for a deal but ended up taking home the troika.</p>

          <p eId="para_640">Indeed. I hope Members can hear if not see me up here. I wish the Taoiseach well in his first face-to-face European Council meeting. It is really important that he meet his colleagues face to face because personal relationships are extremely important in European Council affairs, as the Taoiseach knows very well.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> This is, as he rightly says, a Council meeting that will be focused exclusively on money. The last time there was a negotiation for a multi-annual financial framework, we in this country were at the heart of it. I listened with interest to the contribution Deputy McDonald made, and she was right to an extent. It had nothing to do with the multi-annual financial framework in terms of supporting us during our economic crisis. The disastrous mistake was made at the heart of Europe when predominantly conservative governments that dominated, and still dominate, the European Council required the socialising of banking debt, a process that was obviously not in Europe's interest, caused great hardships and was not supported by the International Monetary Fund, which would have assumed that banks would be allowed to fail, that the pillar banks would be protected and that bondholders would take the consequences. That is an argument for another time.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> The euro area now faces an unprecedented crisis, as the Taoiseach rightly says. It is expected that the GDP of the area will shrink by 8.7% this year and the GDP of the EU as a whole by 8.3%. GDP in Europe has collapsed by a massive 17% in the first six months of this year. A 17% recession in GDP terms in six months is unprecedented. The plan is therefore of critical importance. As the Taoiseach has outlined, it has a number of components.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> The multi-annual financial framework is unchanged from the February, pre-crisis presentation. It consists of €1.074 trillion. There are rebates for a number of countries, including Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden, with the new recovery fund of €750 billion to be paid through MFF programmes: loans, guarantees and grants. Of course, the devil will be in the detail. As I said in my last contribution, offering loans to countries such as Ireland right now is of little value. We can borrow at less than 0.25% interest, and did borrow €6 billion last month. Our short-term treasury bills are in negative interest rates. Access to cheap borrowing is not what we need. We need to ensure we have grants. I would be interested to hear what exactly the Government expects to achieve in financial terms. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy McConalogue, will indicate that. What will be the Government's objective when it sits down with its colleagues in the coming days?</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> The allocation of the recovery and resilience facility, RRF, will be critically important. Its stated objective is that the money will go to countries and sectors most impacted by the pandemic. As the Taoiseach indicated in his contribution, 70% of the money is to be committed next year and the following year, in 2021 and 2022, with the balance of 30% being allocated in 2023 and the whole sum being disbursed between now and 2026. Some 30% of the overall fund is to be devoted to climate-related issues. This is a really exciting prospect for us. We could potentially be the offshore wind engine of Europe, and the Commission is excited about this. We need to get on with that. I hope the Government will be very ambitious in the expenditure targets it sees for offshore wind and hope it will recognise, if I may be parochial for a second, Rosslare Europort as the ideal location for east coast wind. There are already significant proposals that need support to bring that about.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> Just by way of an aside, I wish to mention the additional conditionality, which I welcome because it is really important, particularly in the context of the presidential election in Poland on Sunday, in which President Duda was re-elected. The maintenance of the rule of law and of European values will be one of the criteria used to determine eligibility for European funding. It is not good enough for any country to abandon the fundamental principles of the rule of law, freedom of expression and the separation of powers and expect to be part of the European family when it comes to the divvy-up of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> From 2026, repayments will have to be made, an issue the Taoiseach touched upon. What is set out in President Michel's plans is a plastic waste tax, which I think we would welcome, although I think we have all been looking with horror in recent months at the billions of pieces of single-use plastic and disposables we have been generating, whether masks, gloves, shields or gowns.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Billions of pieces of disposable waste are being generated right now, which is a cause of concern. Others referred to the digital levy President Michel touched upon. He envisages this will be introduced by the end of next year, which is not in the distant future. I would be interested to hear the Taoiseach's view on how that is to be brought about and what his attitude to it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> On the €5 billion Brexit reserve fund to be created and, to quote President Michel's, "to counter unforeseen consequences in the most affected Member States and sectors". That is very welcome. Some €5 billion is a significant sum but it is not that significant if it is to be divided up between a number of countries. We will see the details of how that is to be distributed in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> The Commission member, Paolo Gentiloni, in an article in the <i>Financial Times</i>, pledges to revive plans for a digital tax on big tech companies. In May, despite legal changes we have made in the past ten years in this country, the Commission warned that features of our tax law, together with that of Cyprus, Hungary, Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands, still facilitated "aggressive tax planning". We cannot have a situation where we are perceived to facilitate aggressive tax planning by anybody. Some have categorised us as a tax haven. We need to be very clear. We have made substantial changes but other changes need to be made. I strongly support the OECD process because we cannot change the conditionality of the competitive advantage of Europe <i>vis-à-vis</i> countries like Israel or Singapore by having a uniquely onerous tax regime. However, we need to ensure that multinational companies pay their fair share of tax and that has not been the case. Let us acknowledge that and let us bring - I hope with a new President in America - the whole base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process to a successful conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> I am concerned generally with the propensity of the Commission in recent times to use Single Market rules designed to protect competitiveness in the Single Market as Trojan horses to attack states' taxation regimes. That has come into sharp focus in the Apple judgment today. We need to have an open and frank discussion about that and the Taoiseach might facilitate that at a future date.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> My final point relates to PEACE PLUS. I was involved in negotiating the PEACE IV programme as part of the last multi-annual financial framework. It was not easily won, let me say. There was no enthusiasm from the UK at that time to support it. It opposed any increase and any measure and wanted the overall budget decreased. We fought that but without the UK, has the Taoiseach a commitment that there will be an ongoing peace fund to tackle the difficulties that will continue to be faced by people North and South of the Border on the island of Ireland, particularly in the context of Brexit?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CianOCallaghan" eId="spk_275">
          <from>Deputy Cian O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_652">I warmly congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy McConalogue, on his appointment. I am concerned after listening to the Taoiseach's comments, specifically around the recovery fund allocation and the new proposals being put forward which will be discussed at the European Council meeting on Friday and Saturday. Under the new proposals, 70% of the funds would be allocated straight away in a formula that is not at all favourable to Ireland and the remaining 30% would be allocated in 2022, depending on economic performance. Under these proposals, Ireland will receive one of the lowest shares of the fund despite having the third largest negative revision of GDP in the Commission's autumn and spring forecasts.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> The European Commission formula relies on GDP being an accurate measurement of economic activity. As all of us know, Irish GDP and GNI are heavily skewed by the investment activity of foreign multinationals and investors rather than by the activity of the domestic economy. The Commission proposal is therefore heavily skewed against Ireland owing to foreign direct investment in Ireland and the resulting GDP distortion. In addition, as a small open economy, Ireland is more vulnerable to global trade shocks than other countries and this should be taken into account by the EU when coming up with these formulas for allocation of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> I am concerned by the comments of the Taoiseach, from which it appears that the Government is more or less happy with this proposal to be put before the European Council meeting on Friday and Saturday, so I ask the Minister of State to clarify this in his comments in the wrap-up. Is the Government essentially happy with these proposals, which are very unfavourable towards Ireland compared to other EU countries, or will we be seeking a substantial change to the formula? This is the crux of the European Council discussions that will take place and this question is at the crux of how Ireland will fare in the allocation of these resources. It is very important for our general interests, so I ask for clarification on that in the closing comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> On the proposed revenue raising measures, I welcome the comments from the Taoiseach on support for the plastic waste tax. That is a sensible proposal and we are 100% right to back it. However, I am concerned about the lack of support for measures in terms of carbon. I am surprised, with the Green Party now in government, that the Government is not supporting these measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> On the digital tax, the US has walked away from the OECD process on digital tax and threatened the EU with retaliation measures if the EU brings in a digital tax. I note the comments of Benjamin Angel, acting Director General of the European Commission's Directorate-General Taxation and Customs Union, on Monday, when he told a hearing of the European Parliament that we had to accept the OECD process is not moving as quickly as we hoped. He also said there would need to be a plan B on digital tax. We have seen that a number of corporations in Ireland and across the world are beginning to stand up to the digital platforms and to withdraw their advertising revenue in protest at hateful and misleading content. It is time Ireland showed some leadership on this and insisted digital corporations paid a fair share of taxation. Furthermore, it is important that the Government stops resisting attempts to bring in an effective digital tax. We must show leadership regarding digital platforms which are lax on stopping hate speech and cyberbullying and which are not paying a fair share of taxation and making a fair contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> On the Brexit funding and the proposed allocation of €5 billion for countries badly affected by Brexit, we need to know if the Government thinks this is sufficient funding, given that we are still looking at a potential worst-case scenario in terms of Brexit. We also need to know how much of that €5 billion we think will be allocated to Ireland. Will there be any constraints or conditions attached to that €5 billion funding?</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> In terms of the measures on climate, I welcome the 30% of the recovery fund that will be targeted at climate-related projects. However, on the one hand, while the EU is correctly investing that funding into climate-related projects, on the other hand we know that a lot of the other proposed funding will continue to go into toxic and polluting industries, in many ways cancelling out the climate-related investment. Research by Greenpeace has shown that a lot of funding at EU level continues to go into those industries. There is a strong case that all the EU budget and all of the recovery fund should be climate-proofed, so we are not investing on the one hand and undoing that with investment and with other measures. There has been no reference as to whether Ireland will raise this at the European Council meeting but I ask that we make the case that all the investment from the EU budget and recovery fund is climate-proofed.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> The EU's response to the pandemic has made it very clear that its competence in respect of transnational pandemics is too weak and must be strengthened. It is also very clear that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control needs to be beefed up. There must be substantial learnings from this pandemic. Is Ireland making the case for greater investment in public health at an EU budgetary level?</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> The situation in both Hungary and Poland gives cause for concern. One third of Polish municipalities, which include 90 towns and cities, have established so-called LGBT-free zones. There are ongoing attacks on the rights of trans people in Hungary as well as attacks on civil society organisations. Noting the results of the presidential election in Poland and that the country is about to receive some €16 billion from the EU's recovery fund, it is of critical importance that the rule of law, democracy and respect for human rights be explicitly tied into the EU budget and the fund. There is a great deal of ambiguity around that and, therefore, I ask the Taoiseach to press the issue at the European Council. I note there was no confirmation in his comments of an intention to do that. I have raised this issue previously, including in writing, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I would like some meaningful action on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> Following the election of the Minister for Finance as president of the Eurogroup, it is worth noting that this body started life as essentially a dining club for eurozone finance ministers before morphing into a forum where the fate of nations, including Ireland was, in effect, decided. No minutes were taken at the meetings where the terms of the bailouts during the eurozone crisis were agreed. Irish public services, including healthcare, childcare and housing supports, have been starved of much-needed investment partially as a result of decisions that took place at Eurogroup meetings, which were not minuted. Economists have pointed out that meetings of the Eurogroup are unaccountable and opaque and have no proper legal status. Now that Ireland has a leadership role in the Eurogroup, the Government should insist that transparent legal structures be put in place to underpin the workings of the body.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> We should, furthermore, seek policies that will bridge the gap between stronger northern European economies with strong public services and the weaker southern economies. That is necessary to ensure a level playing field, and the Taoiseach's comments in this regard are welcome. He is absolutely right that any weakness in the EU affects all of us in economic and social terms. Doing as much as we can to ensure there is strong economic and social recovery across the Union, at the European Council meeting and through the Eurogroup, is fundamentally in our interests as trading partners and EU members. The stronger every country in the Union is, the stronger Ireland will be. I welcome the Taoiseach's comments to that effect and I urge him to make that case as strongly and forcefully as he can at the Council meeting and through the Eurogroup.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_663">I am sharing time with Deputies Barry and Paul Murphy.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> The advent of Covid-19 has put Europe and the world at an existential crossroads. There have been a lot of woolly words of recognition about the need to move forward to a new normal, something different and better, and to learn the lessons of the Covid pandemic. However, I fear that a lot of that talk is rhetoric that masks an inclination simply to move as quickly as we can back to where we were before the advent of Covid. My fear is that we will fail to learn the lessons we should learn from the pandemic and the existential threat it poses to humanity.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> One instance of that failure is the comment by the Taoiseach that he is not convinced about the need for a digital tax on corporations. That he needs convincing on this point gives the game away about the attitude of the Government to the Apple ruling and its commitment to large corporations that are flagrantly involved in aggressive tax avoidance for which the rest of society pays. This is not just an isolated case of trying to defend the particularities of Apple's aggressive tax avoidance because that company provides important jobs. The jobs in Cork are important, but the giveaway is that the Government does not just want to side with Apple over the tax dispute ahead of collecting taxes from the company that could go into funding jobs, infrastructure and services. The giveaway that this is not an isolated instance is the Taoiseach not being convinced about the need for a digital tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> I do not understand how the Taoiseach can claim to be supportive of tax reform measures on an international level, in recognition that those corporations have grown bigger than states, are enormously profitable and are hoovering up vast amounts of the surplus wealth in the world, but not be in favour of imposing a little bit of tax on them to fund the services and infrastructures throughout Europe on which they depend. It is another example of how Ireland, in particular, is subservient at the feet of enormous multinational companies and does not recognise the need to move forward to a new normal where those corporations pay their fair share of tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> This is important and relevant to the lessons of Covid because we have learned that if we do not fund our health services to the level where they are capable of dealing with surges of the sort we saw during the pandemic, the entire economy shuts down. That is what the famous curve is about. The level of healthcare capacity was too low to deal with surges. In the case of Ireland, it was too low even before Covid, when we were already operating at 100% capacity. If we do not address that capacity problem by taxing large and very profitable corporations to fund health services, childcare, education, water infrastructure and all of the areas that are deficient in investment, our economy will shut down at the first crisis it faces, as we have seen with Covid. If we do not recognise the need for a fundamental shift away from neoliberalism in the aftermath of Covid-19, we are heading for another disaster sooner or later, whether as a result of Covid, the next pandemic or another crisis. There needs to be a fundamental recognition of that, even in the July stimulus. It is not just about stimulating small and medium enterprises, which we have to do to sustain the jobs they provide. Unless we finance massive investment in key public services and infrastructure, we have an accident waiting to happen in this country and across Europe. I hope the European leaders and our new Taoiseach recognise the need for that change.</p>

          <p eId="para_668">I live in Blackpool on the north side of Cork city. The Apple headquarters in Hollyhill are a 30 minute walk from my front door. If I take a walk there, I am high up above the city and can see schools that are underfunded, where parents have to organise fundraising drives at Christmas time to keep the schools patched up. I can see hospitals that are underfunded, with patient waiting lists and increasing numbers, once again, in their emergency departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">In other words, from that vantage point one can see with one's own eyes the need for serious taxes to be levied on those who can afford it, on the super-wealthy and the big corporations in Irish society, like Apple, which make super profits. They are meant to pay a 12.5% tax rate on those super profits. The European General Court in Luxembourg found today that the Republic of Ireland did not give Apple illegal state aid but it also found that Ireland charged Apple tax at the rate of 1% in 2003 and 0.005% in 2014. All it has said is that that was legal. It says a lot about the law in this country if fabulously wealthy multinationals can be charged tax at that rate. While the court found that it was legal, it put it a slightly different way by saying that it could not say with certainty that it was illegal. The Commission should appeal that ruling and everyone who wants to see better hospitals and schools and less inequality in Irish society will support that sentiment. </p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_670">The headlines read "Ireland wins appeal in €13 billion Apple tax case". It is some victory when one of the richest corporations in the world gets to hang on to €14.1 billion and add it to a cash pile of over $100 billion. That money is not available to tackle the problems that exist here, where one in four people is unemployed, 10,000 people are homeless and we need urgently to invest to avoid climate catastrophe. It raises the question of which Ireland has won. Who does the Government represent? This brings to mind an article by James Connolly from 1899, called "Let Us Free Ireland!", where he writes: "Let us free Ireland! Never mind such base, carnal thoughts as concern work and wages, healthy homes, or lives unclouded by poverty". He goes on to talk about the rack-renting landlord and the profit-grinding capitalist. It is their Ireland that has won this court case and the profit-grinding capitalists in this case are Apple and the other multinationals that use Ireland as a tax haven. This is a victory for the political establishment that wants to continue to use Ireland as a tax haven regime. It is utterly immoral due to the robbery of some of the poorest countries in the world and those who live in them and it is utterly unsustainable because one cannot win a race to the bottom. The only winners are the corporations that do not have to pay any tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> As Deputy Barry pointed out, the judgment does not say that Ireland is not a tax haven or that it was not crazy that Apple could benefit from a tax rate of 0.005%. It just says that that treatment was available to all multinationals. The Minister for Finance has stated that what we have is equality of treatment for all taxpayers. I am sure many workers will be knocking on Revenue's door tomorrow asking if they can please have a tax rate of 0.005% too. It proves Connolly's point that "governments in capitalist society are but committees [for] the rich". We need to clear them out and fight for a socialist green new deal and a Government that acts in the interests of working-class people, ends this race to the bottom, ends our tax haven status and develops a socialist industrial policy based on democratic public ownership and control.</p>

          <p eId="para_672">I am sharing with four of my colleagues, le dhá nóiméad an duine.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> I am glad the Taoiseach has had his first meeting, but it is time we asserted ourselves in Europe. We must insist we get the loans, bonds and supports that will assist all the different communities throughout the country, and the SMEs especially. I do not often agree with the Deputies on the left, but I agree that the big corporations and conglomerates are fine. They are all right, Jack. It is the ordinary people, such as small businesses, pubs, undertakers, shopkeepers, hackneys, small contractors, delivery men with vans and so on, who need the supports. They need to be able to get them. I am not a big advocate of borrowing but we should get the money. It should not be like the last EU bailout, or the clean-out as I called it, when we paid almost 6% interest to our EU masters. We have been exemplary Europeans. We have done everything they wanted and have been the good boys of Europe. Now it is payback time. All of Europe is in the same situation, which makes it even more difficult for our young people and our workforce who may have to or want to emigrate. They will not be able to get work in many places because of this pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> I question this pandemic and if it is really serious. The former Taoiseach wanted us to be good Europeans and I often questioned him about closing the airports and ports to non-essential people, especially tourists. Our people have taken the punishment and pain and we did not mind doing it for the sake of our country, our people and our front-line workers. Now, we see the tourists flooding in. They are wanted most of the time but at the moment, while it is still Ireland of the thousand welcomes, táimid dúnta. We are closed because having people come in from Covid hot spots is just madness. We must seal our borders. Hungary can do it. Many of the parties here might attack the President of Hungary but I admire him. He did it, he kept Covid out and he has looked after his people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Collins<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_675">I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him the best going forward. The European Council meeting of 17 and 18 July will have to tackle many issues that are of huge concern to the Irish economy. We need clarity on where Irish fishermen stand regarding Brexit and the serious fallout from Irish and European trawlers being asked to vacate British waters, as it looks like will happen. That is a two-tier worry for Irish fishermen, first because they are being forced to vacate British waters and second, if Irish and European trawlers are forced out, they may all turn to the already overfished Irish Sea. This needs clarity and I hope the Minister will bring some back from that meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> Ireland currently produces more than 50% of our electricity from gas and we import gas via interconnectors from the UK. We have no existing gas storage on the island of Ireland. The Corrib gas field will be gone within ten years and we are now fully reliant on the UK for gas imports. The UK is also reliant on gas imports and has experienced its own decline in gas production in the North Sea. The UK is exiting the EU, meaning new risks to our economy. While the UK and Ireland are good friends now, the same cannot exactly be said for the EU and the UK, which are going through what looks like a messy divorce at the moment. If trade talks between the EU and the UK were to take a turn, there is not much preventing the British national grid operator from increasing tariffs on the interconnectors between the EU and the UK, which will in turn directly hurt the Irish economy. I urge the Minister to work on a solution when he is in Europe and if a solution is not forthcoming, I ask him to improve our security of supply for natural gas. At the minimum, he should consider a floating liquified natural gas, LNG, import terminal, which can guarantee our security of supply while developing offshore wind power and renewable energy sources. </p>

          <p eId="para_677">I again condemn the dropping of the Shannon LNG project, which will come back to bite this Government and future Governments because of the security we would have had from that vital infrastructure. It has been thrown out the window quite simply because it was demanded by the Green Party upon entering into government. A very high price will be paid by the Irish people with regard to that issue in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> Over the next few months, we have to ensure proper funding is secured and put in place, now more than ever before. Providing a proper rural environmental protection scheme, REPS, and a proper retirement scheme are in the programme for Government, and funding for them will be part of the next few months of negotiations as we deal with our counterparts in Europe. Funding is in place at present to be allocated to fishermen, and that has to be dealt with. There are fishermen operating out of Kenmare Bay, the Cromane harbour and bay, Tralee Bay and Dingle Bay.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">These people deserve to be treated properly. They deserve to know whether the funding is there, when it can be distributed and how it is going to be distributed. We are hearing much about this issue, but the people who need this money, and need it now, are not getting it. Regardless of whether a person is a fisherman, a farmer or a small businessperson, the decisions and the speed of these decisions in the coming days, weeks and months will be of paramount importance. I urge the Minister of State to take this role very seriously because many people are relying on what happens in the next couple of months and they are relying on us as politicians to come up here and demand answers from the Minister of State and his Government, and I thank him very much for answering these questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_680">It is great to see €500 million being used for environmentally friendly projects. I note, however, that nothing has gone to agriculture, which is always being wrongly blamed as the cause of emissions in Ireland. Some €8.5 million is being provided for a gas project; €15 million is going to Irish Rail to reduce the number of diesel engines; €20 million is going to Dublin City Council for green heating systems; €4.5 million being provided for Tallaght district heating systems; €17.5 million is going to council street lighting; and €1.4 million is going for fuel efficiencies in heavy goods vehicles. Again, there is nothing for the farming sector, which is working very hard to bring down emissions and has embraced several simple measures. The replacement of a fertiliser like calcium ammonium nitrate with stabilised urea formulations, for example, reduces emissions but costs the farmer €40 per tonne. This is under the Teagasc marginal abatement cost curve guidelines. Farmers are also using low-emissions slurry spreading to reduce emissions, but there is no funding. All of this is Dublin top-heavy. Let us think of the rest of rural Ireland. Let us think of where we are getting our food every week in the shops. Let us think of Ireland as a green area and let us start with farming. Let us invest in farming and give something to farmers to help them to bring us a greener environment. The Government must stop always coming down on farmers with all the legislation and regulations. Would it not be better to improvise and give them something to go forward?</p>

          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_681">I am glad to get a short time to talk on behalf of the people we are representing, including small business people, farmers and fishermen. We know the talks that are coming up are critical for all our constituents. I want the Government to spell out a clear message to the people it is dealing with in Europe. The myth is out there that farmers are getting gift cheques in the post. We want to make people realise that these cheques in the post are not gifts at all. The cheques in the post are supposed to compensate farmers for not being properly paid for their produce and to ensure the consumers of Europe get cheaper food. That is what has been happening. Many farmers are at a crossroads, especially the small suckler cowmen, the men who produce good-quality beef and the people who are up in the middle of the night calving cows and trying to keep them alive. I know what it is like. There is just a bare fraction between keeping a calf alive or it being dead at a certain time if the farmer is not there to do everything right.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> I appeal to the Government to see after the small farmers because they are at a crossroads. I wish the Minister of State well. He is from the same type of county and terrain as ourselves. I wish him well in whatever talks he is involved in. We need these talks to go well for the small farmers, the fishermen and the small businessmen. There is a chance to borrow money cheaply for infrastructural projects, such as sewerage schemes. There are people out there, even this morning on the radio, saying that no one should build out in the countryside and that people should be building in towns or villages. I remind the Minister of State that there is hardly a sewerage scheme in any part of Kerry. All of the existing schemes are gone beyond what they can process or deal with. There is a need for extensions and new schemes. Many villages are without any sewerage scheme at all. I refer to places such as Currow and Scartaglin. Castleisland has been waiting for an extension for 40 years.</p>

          <p eId="para_684">I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy McConalogue, on his appointment. I wish him and the Taoiseach well at the important meeting on Friday. It is the Taoiseach's first meeting and there will be many intricate negotiations ahead on the MFF, Brexit and all of that in the shadow of the Covid-19 pandemic. I hope the Minister of State will be part of a good outcome for Europe and for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> I am pleased to see President Michel's proposals on the new negotiating box. It shows that if leaders from small member states come together, perhaps they can achieve positive outcomes. I support his proposal on the 2:1 balance of direct funding versus loan funding. I have real concerns, however, about the formula being used by the European Commission to calculate the amounts that will go from the recovery funds to different member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> As we know, Ireland is coming off badly in this respect. Using GDP as a measure skews the situation in Ireland's case, of course. GDP has always been a double-edged sword for Ireland. Like other Deputies, I would like the Minister of State to give the Government's perspective on the European Commission's proposal and the way in which it intends to divvy out the recovery funds. The €5 billion Brexit reserve is welcome. However, is it included as a sweetener for Ireland getting less from the recovery fund? I know this is the negotiating phase, but I would like to see if we could nail down those two issues because they are going to be hugely important here.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> Taxation will be high on the agenda and in many ways Ireland is skating on thin ice in this regard. I agree with the decision of the General Court of the European Union in the Apple tax case. I will return to that issue at another time. I was concerned at the time, however, and this has been confirmed by the General Court of the European Union, that the Commission's decision that Ireland had breached state aid rules was an overreach and an example of what is called "competence creep" on the part of the Commission. State aid rules are the sole competence of the Commission. Taxation is the sole competence of member states. We had a referendum on that issue here.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> Ireland has a major responsibility concerning tax justice and in ensuring multinationals pay their fair share, but that is a separate issue. We need to be careful sometimes about what we wish for. I do not want the European Commission to have the power to dictate our tax policy, but I do want Ireland, as a nation, to play a strong role in ensuring European and global tax justice. We can do that through the OECD and the base erosion and profit shifting programme, and by engaging proactively with our European colleagues in pursuing a digital tax strategy which, crucially, does not disadvantage Ireland's tax take.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> I spent 15 years in the European Parliament and time after time I saw one proposal after another coming forward on a common consolidated corporation tax base, which would disadvantage Ireland's tax take compared to other member states. We have to work with our partners, but we also have to ensure any new digital tax is balanced and fair. It must deliver for our citizens, but we must not be left between a rock and a hard place.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> Finally, given that taxation will be high on the European agenda, there is much talk about the Commission looking at Article 116. That would allow it to make decisions on tax policy based on qualified majority voting and it would allow the European Commission to get rid of the veto. As I stated, that is the thin ice on which Ireland is skating. In the response from the Minister of State, I would like him to give me his perspective on that matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_692">I am coming in now. Deputy Thomas Pringle was supposed to speak but I am stepping in for him.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> I wish to focus on our health services because that topic is high on the agenda given the pandemic we have been facing in recent months. A report published last month found that the European Commission made 63 individual demands of member states to cut spending on healthcare provision or privatise or outsource healthcare services between 2011 and 2018. The reason was to meet the arbitrary debt and deficit targets enshrined in the Stability and Growth Pact. These demands affected the peripheral economies of Greece, Spain, Italy, Portugal and ourselves that were hit by the sovereign debt crisis with particular harshness.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> The Stability and Growth Pact has proven to be one of the most contested and controversial features of economic and monetary union and the broader EU. The pact imposed two numerical ceilings on government expenditure. The first was the debt-to-GDP ratio, over which there is a major question mark now. The ratio must be below 60%. The second is that the annual deficit of member states must be limited to 3% of GDP or less. The power of the European Commission to surveil and control the national budgets of member states was significantly strengthened in 2011 by the adoption of the six-pack and in 2013 by the adoption of the two-pack. These policies have driven nation states to outsource more healthcare rather than invest in our public elder care, mental health services and other services on which there is continued serious pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> From the introduction of the European semester running from 2011 to 2018, the Commission made 105 separate demands of individual member states to raise the statutory retirement age and reduce public spending on pensions and aged care. It made 63 demands that governments cut spending on healthcare and outsource or privatise health services. This is why we are in the situation we are facing now in a pandemic. There has been a conscious ideological front in the EU to privatise rather than pump money into our public services. This is the reason many countries throughout Europe had to go into lockdown as nursing homes were badly affected by Covid-19. They were trying to get older people out of the hospitals and into nursing homes. Our nursing homes were unable to deal with this surge in many cases. All of that will come out in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> This is about taxation and big corporates being able to pay their way to society rather than getting off with low tax on profits. While the Apple tax ruling today probably justifies the behaviour of multinationals and the Government in that they operated within their remit, it is immoral that a multinational with billions of euro paid only 0.005% in tax. The ordinary man and woman on the street cannot believe it. They cannot face that such a thing can happen when we are all under the cosh of the Revenue and the State to pay our taxes. Most people do not mind ordinarily, but they do when we see the contradictions and how the neoliberal ideological idea allows these things to happen. It is morally wrong wherever an outcome like the ruling today arises.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> This has to change, as does the idea of private being good and public being bad. That has been the future of the EU in recent decades but it has to change. I support the idea that we need a socialist outlook to society that meets the needs of everyone and not only the few. That has to be done through progressive taxation across the board and up to and including multinationals. That should be brought to the European Council this week.</p>

          <p eId="para_698">I thank the Deputies for their statements and contributions to this important debate. As the Taoiseach outlined, discussion on the MFF and the next generation EU recovery package will form the focus of this week's European Council. The goal of the Council President, Mr. Charles Michel, is to bring to a conclusion the process that began with the Commission's presentation of its proposals for the MFF in May 2018. Since then, discussions have taken place at the General Affairs Council and at successive meetings of the European Council. The last time the European Council met physically to discuss the MFF was in Brussels on 20 February. In the weeks and months since then, the EU has been faced with the extraordinary circumstances of the global pandemic and the associated unparalleled economic impacts. It quickly became obvious that the MFF proposals would not be sufficient to meet this exceptional challenge and that additional measures were required to support Europe's recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> On 23 April, EU leaders agreed to ask the EU Commission to make a proposal for an ambitious recovery fund that would be commensurate to the scale of the challenge as well as a revised proposal for the MFF. The European Commission subsequently published a package in response on 27 May. Leaders had a first opportunity to discuss these proposals at the European Council meeting on 19 June. Further discussions have taken place since then at the General Affairs Council, which has held detailed discussions on the MFF from the outset.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> Today, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, is attending a meeting of the General Affairs Council by videoconference with the main aim of preparing for the leaders' meeting this Friday.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> As the Taoiseach said, Ireland's strongly supports an ambitious MFF and recovery fund. We recognise that the unprecedented challenge we face demands an unprecedented and collective response. Ireland will approach these discussions in a constructive manner with the aim of reaching agreement. However, the final package must be fair and balanced and must reflect Ireland's needs. The Taoiseach has set out Ireland's priorities in these discussions. We will seek to maintain the CAP budget and ensure that other priorities such as climate action and programmes, including Horizon Europe, Erasmus and PEACE PLUS, are properly funded. The CAP continues to be vital to Ireland. The collapse of exports and prices as a result of the Covid-19 crisis has created considerable difficulties for farmers. Farmers also face further disruption by the prospect of Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> Our strong economic performance in recent years means that Ireland is now a net contributor to the EU budget. That strong economic performance has been facilitated by our EU membership. It is appropriate, therefore, that we should contribute more. However, we should not take our economic strength for granted. In addition to the impact of Covid-19, Brexit will affect Ireland disproportionately in the period ahead. I join the Taoiseach in welcoming the proposals of the Council President, Mr. Michel, for a new Brexit adjustment reserve as part of the overall package that leaders will discuss this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> I reiterate our hope that it will be possible to make positive progress at this week's European Council meeting in order that the EU and all member states will have the tools and supports necessary to meet the significant challenges ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_709"> Section 2 deals with the circumstances for the application of section 8, that is, a European Investment Bank, EIB, guarantee fund being formally established when states representing at least 60% of EIB capital have made appropriate commitments. Section 8 will not apply until that occasion. Can the Minister of State inform us when it is likely that this mechanism will be triggered when states representing 60% of EIB capital will have made appropriate commitments? What commitment will be required of Ireland - this State - in that regard? How will it be realised? I ask the Minister of State to provide some clarification on that point and I will come back on the section itself.</p>

          <p eId="para_712">I wish apologise to Deputy Doherty, the other Members of the House and the Acting Chairman. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is not available because he is at a Cabinet meeting. He sends his apologies. I was asked to take Committee and Remaining Stages of the Bill at the last minute. As the Deputy will appreciate, I only became aware of the size of the Bill late in the day. I am most familiar with the Committee Stage amendments. Deputy Doherty asked at what stage do the provisions of the Bill become effective. Is that correct?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PearseDoherty" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_713">I acknowledge that we are in difficult times. The Minister of State who dealt with this on Second Stage has moved portfolio, given the sacking of the former Minister, Deputy Cowen. There is an urgency in passing this legislation. I did not hear anybody on the Opposition benches say so but I can speak for Sinn Féin in saying that we are willing to support the passage of the Bill. Scrutiny of the Bill and an earlier stage was waived, which was correct because the Bill is about supporting SMEs. Given that we waived such scrutiny, it means we must have proper scrutiny on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> I know the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is at a Cabinet meeting. However, this session does not just deal with the amendments but also with all sections. It is important and, indeed, crucial that we fully understand each and every part of the Bill given that it commits the State to being in hock for €750 million</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> As the Minister of State said, I appreciate that this is complex legislation. The Bill is 130 pages long and was published on Wednesday. We did not have the usual opportunities to scrutinise it through briefings with the Minister or his officials or through accepting submissions from sectors or other interested parties. We are where we are. The real question is when we are likely to hit the trigger mechanism of 60% of capital commitments from member states. What is Ireland's commitment in that regard? How is it realised in the Bill?</p>

          <p eId="para_717">How will our capital commitment be realised? Will there be a call in the event of a default on a proportion of the loans that will be shared equally by member states for that portion? How will that call be accessed? Will it happen after a period of time or after a quantum of loans are defaulted upon? What is the mechanism of the notification to Parliament regarding that?</p>

          <p eId="para_719"> The commitment refers to the proportion of the holding in the EIB. Deputy Doherty asked when the measure would be triggered in the event of a default on a loan. It will happen once there is a default and the calls on the member states are in proportion to their holding within the EIB.</p>

I will ask a number of questions on the section and his officials could write a note for him. Sometimes it is beneficial to go into private session and allow officials to respond in order to speed up the process. I will leave that at the discretion of the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> How will the guarantee fund interact with current lending schemes, such as the proposed guarantee scheme for which legislation is being drafted? Can the Minister of State spell out how a certain quantum of contribution to the fund would translate into extra financing through the credit guarantee scheme if, for example, EIB financing under the fund was exercised through portfolio risk sharing as provided for in appendix A to Schedule 2? What will the schedule of payments from the State to the Commission be under this fund? These are some questions I have in respect of the EIB guarantee fund.</p>

I do not have a difficulty with that. I appreciate the Acting Chairman's tolerance. I literally became aware of this as a result of what the Deputy alluded to earlier, that is, the changing of Ministers within the Department of Finance, of which I am not a Minister of State, and which resulted in my being here this evening. If it is helpful to the House and to Deputy Doherty, I have no difficulty with a suspension in which issues can be raised.

          <p eId="para_732">I am not sure what ruling the Acting Chairman will make but I see where Deputy Doherty is coming from in order to facilitate the matter. This is serious legislation that must be debated in public and the Minister should be here. Last night we had a motion to extend maternity leave and the Minister for Justice and Equality in her reply, among other things, told us it was not possible because the legislation would be complicated and would involve retrospection and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> This legislation is one of the most complicated pieces I have ever tried to read. The Bill itself is short and is only made up of 12 sections but the Schedules attached to it are extremely complicated. In total, there are 140 pages. This must be debated in public. I do not know how we get out of the fact the Minister responsible is not here but questions must be asked on this matter. I am no expert and I have struggled to understand it. When I put it in the context of last night's debate, it beggars belief that something as simple as extending maternity leave was refused mainly because the legislation would be too complicated.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> This legislation is to facilitate two particular schemes as well as other technical matters to allow us to access funding. In order to access that funding, one of which is €100 billion and the other €200 billion, we must make certain guarantees and certain written agreements. We need details on all of this. The question asked by Deputy Doherty is a simple one. When does the 60% become activated? The reply has been that the 60% has already passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> There are other practical questions with regard to this, for example, have we already spent money and are we now applying under that fund? They are simple practical questions here, not to mention the complicated ones. I am not in agreement with us going into private session.</p>

For clarification, if we suspend for 15 minutes the House will not be going into private session. It is to see if we can get some answers or a roadmap forward from our present dilemma. Is it agreed to suspend for 15 minutes?</p>

          <p eId="para_737">For clarification, what does the suspension entail? There have been occasions - and I am not one to push this, although other views have been expressed - where a Minister when dealing with questions on some complex scenarios, although I would argue that these are not complex questions, the committee has gone into private session to allow officials to speak openly and freely. If we suspend, that will not allow that to happen. I can continue to ask these questions. Some of them are quite simple, but I am conscious the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, might not have the answers because he is not the Minister with responsibility for this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> The Dáil has been left without adequate representation from Government and it is not acceptable. We have facilitated, supported and allowed this legislation to be fast-tracked. It is like saying that everything will be okay and that we should just turn up and it does not matter. There are serious questions here. We have tried to put a lot of work into this and we need to make sure the terms and conditions and the details of this legislation are correct for the needs of businesses throughout the State.</p>

The timing could not be more unfortunate. We know and I recognise, having received a briefing on the Bill, that the timing of this is important. It is complex and it is a massive piece of legislation. The Government appreciates all the different groupings that have facilitated it. However, a short suspension might allow me to talk to my officials and in return talk to the Department of Finance, which might be helpful to try to get the remaining Stages completed tonight.</p>

          <p eId="para_744">I thank the Acting Chairman for facilitating the brief adjournment during which we could speak to the Minister of State and the officials. I thank the officials for their engagement with myself and others on this Bill, and for any notes that were sent to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> On section 2, I will focus, particularly at this point, on the EIB guarantee fund. I understand the total amount we are likely to be able to draw down from that fund is €1.4 billion to €1.5 billion. We have concerns in Sinn Féin about what is being earmarked in the Schedule to the legislation. It provides a breakdown of the fund across Europe, 65% is for SMEs, 23% is for companies with more than 250 employees, 5% is for public sector companies and entities active in health and health-related research, and up to 7% for venture and growth capital and venture debt. I understand those are European-wide targets as opposed to member state specific targets, but can the Minister confirm those are not the targets this member state will be chasing because, in my view, that would be completely out of kilter with the number of SMEs in this State? The most affected sector within the State is the SME sector. It is to this sector we need this type of funding to flow as opposed to venture capital and venture debt, which is what some of this will be targeted towards at a pan-European level. The Minister of State might comment on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> My understanding of the scheme is that this funding will be raised by EIB. It will leverage up to €200 billion. As I said, up to €1.5 billion could be drawn down by the State and will be channelled through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. While it may have the word "bank" in its name, that issue comes back to haunt us, as the former Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, pointed out at the time when he argued with the previous Minister for Finance that that company should get a banking licence. We have a situation where Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, will not be able to lend to SMEs because it is not a bank. It is a company. It is a non-lender. Therefore, it will lend to AIB, Bank of Ireland and other banks operating in the State providing the low interest rate from EIB. I must say the SBCI's operational costs are extremely low, with a small number of staff. Its additional costs are likely to be quite restrained.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> I have absolutely no trust in the Irish banks given what they have done during this pandemic in terms of profiteering from payment breaks, what they have done in terms of the tracker mortgage scandal and the litany of other issues I could rehearse. What guarantee do we have on triple-star rated institutions such as the EIB which will lend, probably at negative interest rates, passing that on to SBCI, which will then pass it on to AIB and Bank of Ireland? What guarantee is there that they will not lump on a couple of extra percentage points to feather their own nests using this 100% guaranteed lending, which is guaranteed by the member state, basically the taxpayers of this country?</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> Given that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, is bringing forward a credit guarantee scheme which fails to hit the target because of the low level of 80% guarantee being provided, this guarantee fund we are talking about, which has us on the hook for €164 million potentially, is guaranteed at 100%. How will the banks operate this because they will have potentially two different funds - one fund that is guaranteed at 80% and the other fund that is guaranteed at 100% - and the same SME looking for credit? Both funds would be available to the same SME. What is likely to happen? In the case of AIB, for example, will it be that the bank will exhaust the 100% guarantee fund to make sure it is taking no risk whatsoever and then start lending under the other scheme? I am interested to hear if any consideration has been given to that in the credit guarantee scheme that is to be legislated for soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> The last point I want to make on this section is that while my party supports this legislation and I have been extremely critical in the past in terms of European member states, on this occasion what we are seeing before us is the harnessing of the credit rating of Europe to assist member states and that is beneficial. That should have happened a long time ago. There is more that needs to be done, but we are entering these schemes without any understanding of the interest rates that will be charged and the duration or maturity of the instruments. We are acting blind in what is before us.</p>

          <p eId="para_750">I thank the Acting Chairman and the other Deputies for facilitating the brief interruption where we were able to discuss with officials some of the issues raised by Deputy Pearse Doherty.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> In relation to the issues Deputy Doherty raised, particularly around the start of the point, the Deputy is correct that the percentage of the fund that will be available to SMEs is not necessarily that which will be available to Ireland. It is available to the European Union as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> On Deputy Doherty's last point, before I get into the some of the other issues, the Deputy is correct as well in relation to the European response to this. There has been much criticism of Europe's response and it is noteworthy that, from an Irish perspective, as the Minister for Finance has stated previously, we must be seen to respond to those countries in the greatest level of need. While the initial response from the EU was rightly criticised, there is now upwards of €0.5 trillion over three different instruments, two of which are subject to the legislation we have here before us this evening, and those countries that are in the greatest level of need will have the greatest level of access.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> Deputy Doherty asked in relation to the SBCI. The Deputy is correct again that it is via the pillar banks those moneys can be accessed from the scheme before the House this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">The Deputy also asked whether there would be memoranda of understanding with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI. There will. These will determine the extent of the administrative charges. This applies to all schemes for which the SBCI will act as intermediary. That is the case as it stands.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> The last point the Deputy raised related to the credit guarantee scheme on which the Tánaiste began interfacing this week. He is quite correct in his assessment. We want to make sure all instruments that are available, including the SBCI instrument and any of the other instruments for which we are legislating this week, provide the greatest level of access to those with the greatest need. I again thank the Deputy and the other Members of the House for their indulgence. I again put on the record of the House my apologies on behalf of the Minister for Finance.</p>

          <p eId="para_757">I have one final question on this matter. It relates to the pillar banks' ability to use this guarantee to lend. They can lend to SMEs and larger companies. We went through that and through my concerns about how it needs to be targeted earlier. Will the banks be able to use this guarantee to lend only to companies that are tax-resident within the State? Will they have the capacity to support a business located in, for example, Strabane?</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> As a result of Brexit, the people of the North have been dragged out of the European Union without their consent. We have been very vocal here in trying to ensure that European Union supports are provided to the greatest degree possible to citizens, businesses and universities, in respect of research and development and so on, in the North. That is challenging. The State needs to stand up and make sure that cases such as this are dealt with. We saw the situation with regard to the pandemic unemployment payment. I will make that point again. It has been made by myself and many of my colleagues. People who live in the North but who live and pay their taxes and social insurance contributions here were not able to get the pandemic supports available to others who pay their taxes and PRSI here in the same way. Many companies are located just on the other side of the Border in our country. They employ many people on both sides of the Border. They need support. They may not be getting it. They will not be getting this European support through Westminster. Will this scheme be available to a hypothetical company in Strabane that employs 100 people, comprising 50 on either side of the Border? Will such a company be able to go to AIB or Bank of Ireland and, everything else being equal, access this type of fund?</p>

          <p eId="para_759">Unfortunately, the Deputy probably knows the answer before I give it. The legislation applies to those companies that are domiciled, registered and fulfil every other legal requirement in this jurisdiction. I do not disagree with anything he has said about people being taken out of the European Union against their will but, unfortunately, this is a European Union instrument. The instrument will not be available to those in jurisdictions outside the European Union, including the United Kingdom.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_760">I will speak on this section. I thank the Minister of State for the time he and his officials gave us beforehand. It helped to clarify some matters. I will say again, however, that although this Bill is extremely short with only 12 sections, the three schedules attached to it pose a great difficulty. It brings into acute focus the democratic deficit that has arisen in the European Union. We are really back to a patriarchal situation in which we are told this is good for us but are given very little time to discuss it. The Minister of State will agree with that. I realise that there is a pandemic under way and that this presents difficulties but we have had a number of months. We have not had a chance to tease out this at committee level. This Bill is approximately 140 pages long and, despite my own background, I found it extremely difficult to read. On occasions the English is not intelligible. It has been obviously translated from various instruments in Europe. It does not make for easy reading. I now have to depend on the word of Government, in which I have little trust, that this is very good for us. On the positive side, Europe is finally acting in unison, though belatedly, as best it can to allow us to access funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> I will refer to this particular scheme, which is operated through the European Investment Bank, EIB. I understand from reading the Bill and from the clarification just before the break that we are in this for a commitment of up to €167.5 million. That will be our liability as set out in the legislation. It is capped at that. That is part of a fund of €25 billion which will allow the EIB to leverage up to €200 billion, which all of the countries may then apply to access. The criteria for applications for moneys are not yet clear. The Minister of State has pointed out that this money will then come through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, which is just a medium through which it will be accessed by the other banks. As guarantees are being given all around, including that in respect of the €167 million, I presume there is a guarantee that any bank which is given the privilege of loaning to the SMEs and other entities will make no profit on that loan and will simply make back its administrative costs, given that the money will be borrowed at zero or negative interest. That is my first question.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> To move to my second question, I understand that health entities can benefit from this scheme. Will the Minister of State clarify this in simple English? All Deputies are inundated with calls from people whose loved ones have senile dementia or disabilities and who are not able to access day centres because they are closed. There are myriad examples; I will not go into them. Will the Health Service Executive be able to benefit from a loan at an interest rate of 0% to enable these entities to open? Am I reading the legislation incorrectly? I am reading it as best I can.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> What oversight will the Dáil have of this measure? At what stage will it come back before the House? Reading the Bill, it seems to be coming back after the event. If somebody defaults, our guarantee is called upon and we pay up, a report will come back to the Dáil afterwards. Will the Minister of State clarify that point?</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> Section 7 confers on the Minister the power to enter into a contribution agreement. At what point would such an agreement be drawn up? Will we see it? The section goes on to say that if there is an amendment to the agreement, it will come before the Dáil. Who decides that the agreement will be amended and how it will be amended? Will the Minister of State deal with those three issues for me?</p>

        <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" eId="spk_325" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Patrick O'Donovan<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_765">On the Deputy's initial point about this Bill being patriarchal, I do not disagree with the sentiments she has expressed. In fact, criticism of the lethargy with which the European Union's institutions responded to Covid is very justifiable. Member states and Members of this House have made such criticisms. The Deputy is quite right. It has taken a long time. Perhaps it took the infection hitting some of the larger and wealthier states harder than the Mediterranean states for Europe to wake up and realise it needed to respond to the plight of those in the greatest need. The Minister for Finance has said this on the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> During the interaction we had in the short recess, many of the Deputy's points were discussed. Again, I apologise for the fact that the committees are not up and running.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">If the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform had been up and running we would have had a greater level of scrutiny than we have been allowed to have here this evening. That is regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> Deputy Connolly is correct in what she said about the €167 million odd . That is the capped amount that has gone in from an Irish point of view. She is also correct in saying it is almost like a virtual insurance policy that the State is providing.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> We discussed oversight, which was the subject of Deputy Doherty's amendments. I am sure we will come to them at a later stage. Oversight is envisaged as happening after the fact because, unfortunately, the instrument has to operate as a whole. As referred to in Deputy Doherty's amendments as well, there is a five-day provision for the trigger to be pulled; in other words, if a state needs assistance or if there is a need to draw down from a fund, unfortunately there is not sufficient time for each individual member state to debate the issue in parliament. That would lead to a situation where we would not be able to respond in the spirit of these instruments, which is, with speed.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> Deputy Connolly also mentioned oversight. It is hoped that the Minister for Finance himself will make a statement on this matter in the Seanad debate tomorrow. He is committed to laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas any report which is deemed necessary to provide a response or justification for decisions he has made under the provisions of the Bill to which the Deputy referred, which I think is section 11.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> The Health Service Executive is already eligible to apply for funding through the European Investment Bank. There is cheaper funding available at the moment. It depends on what rates they go out to the market at and where the greatest level of money is available. I do not disagree with the Deputy at all on the impact Covid has had on carers and those in care homes. One of the points the Deputy made is the fact that many respite centres are not able to open.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> The contribution agreement is the State's agreement to contribute to the scheme. I can confirm that the total is €167.5 million. I think they were the main points the Deputy raised.</p>

          <p eId="para_773">I am pleased to get the opportunity to ask the Minister of State a few questions. We have read and heard stories that the Germans have applied for massive amounts of money, with the interest rates at practically nil, for infrastructural projects and for any deficiencies they have in their country or economy. They have it done for many weeks. They are ahead of us. It appears to me that they are ahead of the posse. It is interesting to think that a country as financially advanced as Germany is availing of funding for several different projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> Can we look for funding for infrastructural projects such as roads, for example? The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, is from a neighbouring county. I refer to projects such as the Adare bypass and the Killarney bypass that we have been promised since 2004, 16 years ago. It has even been going on longer than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> Another project that is needed is the Kilcummin sewerage scheme. Our county is in an awful state due to the lack of sewerage schemes. Let us take Brosna, for example. One will only get permission for one house in Brosna to connect to the sewerage scheme. In Kenmare, which is a large town, likewise, one will only get permission for one house. No development is permitted because of the deficiency in the sewerage treatment system. A place such as Curra does not even have a sewerage schemes. It has fallen between several stools. The same is true of the neighbouring parish of Scartaglin. Then we hear whizz kids saying on the radio this morning that no more planning should be granted on farms or in rural areas and that everyone should be moved into villages. We do not have sewerage schemes in the villages to cater for the plan the man on the radio had early this morning. I cannot think of his name. I think he was a Mr. Gilligan.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> Can the Government access funding now that we badly need it for roads, sewerage schemes, water schemes and group water schemes? They are needed in several parts of Kerry where they will pay their way but the State is not able to advance their applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> I was very disappointed to hear that rural publicans are not allowed to open until 10 August.</p>

          <p eId="para_783">I have just one other point to raise, which is about the banks and mortgages. AIB has deferred the granting of mortgages to couples because one of the parties is on the Covid payment, even if the other person is quite entitled to draw a mortgage but because the application is a joint one AIB is deferring their application. That will nail small builders as a result and it is holding up progress. Could we access funding the same as the Germans are doing? Surely we are as good as them.</p>

          <p eId="para_785">Deputy Healy-Rae is correct; we can access funding in the same way. Many of the infrastructural projects that are under way are funded by European Investment Bank funding. He will know from the national development plan that we have €116 billion worth of a plan over a period. Some of the funding will come from the Exchequer, some of it will be borrowed, some of it will come from the European Investment Bank, some of it will come from the Council of Europe development bank and some of it will come from elsewhere. We are already seeing large infrastructural projects that are being funded in that mechanism. I can think of one off the top of my head, namely, the redevelopment of the city centre in Limerick, which is being led by the city and county council and is being funded by both of those agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> Deputy Healy-Rae made a very valid point about rural sewerage schemes. That is something I feel very strongly about. The Deputy might have heard me speak about it in this House before. There is provision in the programme for Government so that the very towns and villages the Deputy talks about will be looked at differently under the new programme because under the rural development fund there will be specific targeted funding for those towns and villages that currently have no scheme with a view to trying to get them.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> I will make three points for the purposes of clarification on how we ensure that the needs of Ireland are not submerged by the demands of bigger countries. The three member states that have received the most financing should not exceed 50%, which is fair. The 15 member states who have received the least financing should exceed 10% of the fund. That ensures that areas with a small population will not be forgotten and it underlines the financial structures that are by their nature multi-country, covering two or more member states, that are not included in the above. It is designed to be as fair as possible and to respond to as many as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">Deputy Danny Healy-Rae is correct about the issues he has raised and that is why the provisions that have been made in the national development plan and the programme for Government are clear as to what he has asked about there.</p>

          <p eId="para_793">I do not want to be an irritant to the Minister of State and I do not expect him to apologise for it again but it is utterly shameful that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, is not here today to take this session. It is an insult to the House. I understand it is because there is a Cabinet meeting. We asked during the suspension about the timing of this Bill because it is being pushed through. As Deputy Doherty said, we are going into this with a certain amount of blindness, which is not a healthy state for Members who are supposed to pass legislation to be in. Nevertheless, we accept the blindness on the basis of the urgency. We were told during the suspension that this has to be done and dusted, signed up to by all member states and backed up by legislation before it can be enacted. However, France, Estonia and Germany have still not signed up to it and we are told they will not do so until the end of this month. This House will be sitting until the end of this month and it is utterly disgraceful that we are pushing it through today in this manner, without proper scrutiny and without a proper sitting committee that could scrutinise and delve into this highly complex Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> A point was made about Germany looking for a lot of funding. I have no particular axe to grind with Germany but the experience in this country of the European Union and the banking system within Europe has left a bitter taste in our mouths. For us to go into this without being able to scrutinise it properly is unwelcome and unfortunate and, at the end of the day, may not be the healthiest thing we have ever done in this Parliament. The question asked by Deputy Doherty was not answered sufficiently. Will funding be available to businesses that operate on both sides of the Border or are we excluding businesses because, as was said, people on the northern side of the Border were forced out of the EU against their will? They have suffered the pandemic like the rest of us. They straddle the Border in their economic activity, as workers have long done, and they were let down in respect of the Covid payment. Will businesses that operate on both sides of the Border also be left out in the cold? That hugely important question needs to be clarified, as do many other questions that we have about the Bill, which we will come to in other sections.</p>

          <p eId="para_795">I appreciate and accept the frustration that the Deputy has expressed. It is not a position that I am overly enamoured with either but the Business Committee set out to try to put in place the legislative agenda between now and the recess. This Bill was identified as priority legislation. Although I could be wrong, it is my understanding that it was so identified in the absence of a finance committee.

It cannot be owned, operated, registered and so on north of the Border because that is a different jurisdiction. In the same way as we are going to have Irish SMEs trading with the United Kingdom into the future, trading with the UK will not debar them from accessing the funding. However they have to be Irish companies because this is a European Union mechanism and the United Kingdom will no longer be a European Union country.</p>

          <p eId="para_797">I wish to raise a point that my colleague in the Seanad, Senator McCallion, has raised quite a lot about the supports that are there.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> What the Minister of State says about it being outside the jurisdiction and that it is a European fund for European companies is all fair in a normal scenario. This, however, is not a normal scenario. We are dealing with Brexit, with a part of our island which is now under the same customs guidance as the rest of the EU and is different from Britain. That has happened because we actually asked for it to happen, because we believed that the island had to be treated as an all-island entity. There are other things there that also apply to the North that will not apply to Britain because we recognise the importance of it. As such, we have to look at it both ways and my understanding is that there is a huge amount of goodwill across Europe for the situation in which the people of the North have found themselves, which is being taken out of Europe against their will. I would argue strongly that if a case were presented by the Government on this scenario, it would be looked on favourably. This is because we are not just talking about an ordinary jurisdiction outside of the European Union, we are talking about the North of Ireland, which already has got exceptional status in European law as far as customs and other matters are concerned. I could be wrong but I guess that the Minister never raised these issues. Even at this late stage, I ask the Minister of State to bring it to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and to raise the point that supports are needed for companies that operate on the other side of the Border. I come from a Border constituency, Donegal, and thousands of our workers are employed on the other side of the Border, just as thousands of people from counties Derry, Tyrone and Fermanagh are employed in County Donegal or the neighbouring Border counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> If the request has not been made, I encourage the authorities to make it. They should do so not just in relation to this issue but also to ensure that European supports, where practical and sensible, be extended to a part of this island that never wanted to leave the European Union in the first place, which voted to remain in the European Union and which, because of Tory infighting and Tory politics, has been left, particularly during the pandemic, without the European supports on which it would have been able to rely in the past.</p>

          <p eId="para_800">In response to Deputy Doherty and to reinforce what I said earlier, this scheme is designed to be available to European Union countries. He is absolutely right that the United Kingdom has made the decision to withdraw but that does not negate its need to look after the people within its own jurisdiction. Deputy Doherty, being from an Ulster constituency, is very cognisant of the people who, as he said, go back and forth across the Border every day. They are people who have to be brought into the discussion here. It is something that I will bring to the attention of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe. I have asked the officials that are here to bring it to his attention and to that of the Tánaiste because there is an upcoming North-South Ministerial Council meeting and there has been a bit of a vacuum there. The Deputy may agree with me about the voicing of concerns given that the North-South Ministerial Council has not been able to function due to the Covid situation. There is an Executive now, which probably created a vacuum as well, so there might have been an unfortunate delay in voicing the concerns of the people to whom Deputy Doherty refers. It is important as well to draw attention to the references in the programme for Government that set out what this Government wants to achieve on an all-island basis into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">Certainly future leadership can be taken from the harmony in the response of the Chief Medical Officer and the North's chief medical officer to the pandemic, with regard to other directions, whether supports or otherwise, that might be needed from an economic point of view. Lessons have been learned about what can be achieved when an all-island approach is taken. The Government has not been, and will not be, found wanting on articulating the views of the people of the North who, as the Deputy has quite rightly said, voted to remain in the EU but are being taken out of it. It is not just the people in the North; the people in the adjoining counties in the Southern jurisdiction who travel to work there will also be impacted. We are very conscious of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> The Deputy is correct that significant goodwill has been expressed by the EU. We only need to consider all of the visits done in the immediate aftermath of the deadline for the first crash-out, when Ministers with responsibility for European affairs and finance and Prime Ministers stood on what is a borderless border and saw it for themselves. The Government is in a strong position to articulate on behalf of the people of the North. We have taken a position on the programme for Government on how we hope to achieve this. The North-South Ministerial Council is a vehicle to do this. The voices of Northern businesses, chambers of commerce and business associations are articulating through their MLAs and the Executive that they want to see co-operation and this is all helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> At the end of the day, no more than the pandemic and virus did not recognise the difference between Tyrone and Monaghan, it does not matter whether a person's income is in Tyrone or Monaghan. They still have to raise children, pay a mortgage and go out to school in the morning. The Government is a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, which ultimately underpins all of this. The Deputy is absolutely right that there is a compulsion and an obligation on us and we take this seriously. If the House can respond to what the Deputy has suggested in the all-party mechanism available to the House we will be doing the people of the North some service.</p>

          <p eId="para_805">I will try and not take the full 20 minutes. Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said earlier this funding is very welcome and wanted but it must be given in a responsible way. I have no confidence in giving funding to Irish Water as it has wasted what money we have had in the country to date. It put in meters throughout the country and used all of its funding but was able to keep back €500,000 to top up wages when the money was running out last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> This funding has to go into rebuilding Ireland. The Minister of State can see in his own constituency that for the past 30 years Askeaton has been promised a sewerage system. Every Government has promised it a sewerage system and no one has delivered. This time there will be a task force. I welcome this and I will look forward to it but will it happen? Oola is the same, as is Fedamore. Five towns on boil notices are waiting for €1 million for five bore wells for water. Irish Water is looking for €4 million for a pipe from the Shannon Estuary to Croom. It cannot pump the water from the Shannon Estuary because raw sewage is going into the estuary from Askeaton. I do not want to waste money unless we fix the infrastructure and I have no confidence whatsoever in Irish Water.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> I am very concerned about the tourism sector, which generated €9 billion in revenue last year. Since the recession, it has created 90,000 new jobs. Earlier, we spoke about Apple, which has 6,000 jobs in Ireland. Prior to Covid, 270,000 people were employed in tourism and now those jobs are at risk without support. There are practical steps that could make a major difference to the survival of industry. One of these is a continuation of the wage subsidy scheme, which is due to finish on 10 August, until April 2021. The tourism sector is very labour intensive and more than 40% of the turnover goes on wages.</p>

          <p eId="para_811">I thank the Acting Chair. All restaurants were closed for 105 days during this time. There was significant cash burning. Large hoteliers were out of pocket by €2,000 at day. Local authority charges need to be waived. This funding needs to be given to local authorities so they can waive the rates system to get our businesses back up and running. That is one way to do it. The money needs to be given back to our councils to invest in housing voids so we can put people back into our towns and villages and use the housing stock we have. The Government talks about building new houses left, right and centre. We haves massive stock that could be rebuilt.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> It is about the here and now and this summer. In Northern Ireland, gatherings, including weddings, are determined on the size of the venue. Last week, we spoke about churches, which had a limit of 50 people but then it was decided that this could be increased depending on the size of the church. This also needs to be done for hotels. We must be very conscious of the funding coming through and ensure the cost of the money is not borne by the companies keeping us afloat during the pandemic. We want to make sure the funding gets in now and is continued for 12 months to ensure these companies come back strong.</p>

          <p eId="para_816">I want to take this opportunity, because I did not have one already, to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, and wish him nothing but good luck in his role in the Government. I sincerely congratulate him.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> This is a very important time, as I said in an earlier debate, because the decisions taken and the legislation being passed by the Dáil in the coming days and weeks before the end of July is very important. Every bit of funding that can be got for the July stimulus must be used wisely, which is the main point. I am very upset this evening because I believe the Government has shot itself in the foot by delaying for another 25 days the opening of our public houses. People might say this is straying from the debate but it is not because what we are speaking about in this debate and other debates is how to get the wheels of our economy going, whether through borrowing money from Europe or getting people in Ireland to spend money again. If the doors of our public houses were to open next Monday, it would put money back into circulation. I truthfully believe the decision to delay this for a further 25 days will endanger people's health because it will concentrate where we send people to spend money; in other words, only to places that serve food. It will also stop the wheels of commerce from rolling again. All these people had taken in stock in recent days. People were rostered to work from next Monday. All of this has now been stopped. I see this as a negative financial impact on our country and I do not see it saving one life or one person from getting ill. It is ill-founded and wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> To return to the debate and where we are going with regard to securing funding and all that involves, if we look at the lessons we learned from an economic point of view, and the economic cycles we go through in life, and if we look at the previous downturn in the economy and the previous burn-out we had when we had nothing but austerity, now we have an opportunity to deal with the problem in a different way because we can access money at an affordable rate and we should be doing so. We should plough on with building more roads and putting in place more infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">There is so much we can do in this country. We have a workforce. People have returned from America, England and Australia. They are here and ready and able to work. All we must do is get them back to work. We can do that by getting money rolling into the economy and getting major infrastructure projects, many of which are shovel ready, started.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> There was much talk earlier about sewerage schemes. I appreciate the Minister of State's interest in this. He has always been a promoter of sewerage schemes in small villages and towns to facilitate orderly growth. The late Jackie Healy-Rae went to a place called Fieries in Kerry and demanded that a sewerage scheme be established there. At the time there was nobody there to be connected to that sewerage scheme, but today there are hundreds of young families living there simply because the infrastructure was put in place. Caherdaniel is crying out for a sewerage scheme. There are many other such villages. They have rightly been prioritised by members of Kerry County Council, not just now but over the years. These must be delivered. People are being told not to live in the countryside yet, at the same time, if they want to live in small towns or villages they cannot do so. For example, no more planning permission is being granted in Kenmare. We are told that until there is a proper upgraded sewerage scheme we will not be allowed to build any more developments there. It is crazy.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> I thank the Chairman for giving me this brief opportunity to speak.</p>

          <p eId="para_822">I thank the Deputies. I will start with the pubs. I have a vested interest as I have family members who are publicans. There are mixed views on this and it is probably not something to get involved in this evening. With regard to the tourism element, and I was formerly a Minister of State with responsibility for tourism, it plays a major role in the economy of the country. It is in every part of the country. It is for that reason and for the SME sector, in particular, that instruments of this nature are so important. Europe is responding to a pandemic that has affected the tourism industry not only in Deputy Healy-Rae's and my constituencies but all around the Mediterranean and elsewhere. It relates to industries such as that.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> Deputy Healy-Rae is also correct about the July stimulus. It is the Government's intention to put a great deal of money into circulation through a variety of methods, such as through addressing the temporary wage subsidy scheme, which people want to see addressed, through grants and ensuring that the maximum amount of money can be released as well as through the credit guarantee scheme. With regard to the demands that exist, and both Deputies referred to this, approximately €80 billion in demands have been clocked up from the various sectoral interests in respect of the July stimulus, so there will inevitably be disappointment. However, it must be looked at in the round. The Government has already put €13 billion into the pandemic response, which is approximately 7.5% of our national wealth. That is mid-table from a European point of view and the fact that this is a small country must be acknowledged as well. The Government did so through the pandemic unemployment payment and the temporary wage subsidy scheme initially and we have said there are other measures we are prepared to consider. On top of that we gave an additional €2 billion directly for health, which Deputies voted through the House in the last week or so, to ensure we had coverage there.</p>

          <p eId="para_827">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_828">In page 4, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_829">“(2) Payments referred to in <i>subsection (1) </i>may be paid out of the Central Fund, or the growing produce thereof, subject to a resolution passed by Dáil Éireann.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I still would like to hear from the Minister about what guarantees or protections there are for the Irish taxpayers, who are providing a 100% guarantee, that the banks will not try to profit from this. Can he inform me, with regard to what is likely to be zero interest rate loans, that they will not add a couple of percentage or partial percentage points on top of that? What dialogue has there been? I understand there was dialogue today with regard to guarantee schemes, so I would be interested to hear about that. I would not support the State providing guarantees only for banks to profiteer on the back of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> This amendment deals with oversight by the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is about ensuring payments, and in the SURE scheme we are talking about payments potentially reaching close to €0.5 billion, and makes the point that they may be "paid out of the Central Fund, or the growing produce thereof, subject to a resolution passed by Dáil Éireann". The issue I have is that there is no oversight of the scheme in the legislation presented to us for what could potentially be a payment of close to €0.5 billion in respect of a liability under this scheme. I do not believe that is appropriate or right. I heard what the Minister said regarding the fact that interest rates would apply if we do not pay within five days and the potential €483,000 that could be called upon. I am not sure what those interest penalties are; I do not think that has been worked out either. However, when the House is sitting it should be a matter of course, if it is not in legislation, that the Minister would accept that he would bring a resolution to the House for payment or partial payment of the funds from the Central Fund to meet our liability. When the House is not sitting, at least a report outlining the criteria should be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> Amendment No. 2 is a similar amendment. It is important that we deal with both at this point.</p>

          <p eId="para_833">I support the amendment. The Sinn Féin amendment calls for oversight on this, and it is completely lacking anywhere else. It was said earlier that we could not pass an extension of maternity leave last night because it was too complex, but what we are looking at here is seriously complex and we are not getting the clarity on it that we deserve. To be honest, what is going on here is beyond the understanding of most of us in the House. We understand the urgency and accept that this is a gigantic stimulus package that is necessary to ensure that during Covid-19 and afterwards, whenever we emerge from it, small and medium businesses and workers can begin to operate again following what will probably be a recession from the pandemic. One could not argue against it or oppose it.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> It seems that we have a Dáil made up of born again Keynesians who now see that stimulating the economy and putting money into public services and into jobs with small and medium businesses is how one does what the left has been saying for years, which is that one injects resources into the economy to stimulate it. That now appears to be the wisdom of the hallowed halls of the finance ministries. One would not know it from the debate in this House, but in Europe there is another debate raging. That debate has much to do with how these funds should be spent, how much should be loans and how much should be grants. Interestingly, there is talk about reforms being attached to them. This is where I wish to make my most important contribution. People in this country remember the word "reform" well, particularly those who were described by the former Minister for Finance as the low-hanging fruit - those at the bottom of society who depended on the welfare state, those who suffered from disability and public sector workers. Reform always equals attacks on pensions, labour rights and the welfare state and the privatisation of public services. Clearly, that debate has not ended.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> I know I will hear the cliché being trotted out that there is no magic money tree. I accept there is no magic money tree, but we seem to forget that when it comes to tax havens, such as what we saw with Apple today, the Cayman Islands, the double Dutch and, indeed, the Irish tax haven.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">The European Commission is floating other clever ideas, including a suite of environmental taxes such as carbon and plastic taxes. Who could argue with that? The problem, though, is that it does not do what it says on the tin. The tax is usually passed on to ordinary people and not the big companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> Because the details are scant, it is very important we have a level of scrutiny applied to the Bill and I think we will need the State to answer questions. We were told earlier that the wage subsidy scheme, for example, could apply retrospectively. We have giant companies in this country such as Ryanair and Boston Scientific that put their hands out for the wage subsidy scheme. We have no scrutiny over their profits, cash reserves or anything else yet we paid out the wage subsidy scheme to them. There is therefore a concern as to how this fund will be used and where it will go to. As individual responsibility is demanded of all of us, we must also demand corporate responsibility and have some kind of scrutiny over how this money is given out. It is important for us to comment here on what the debate raging in Europe is about and how it will impact on whether we pass this Bill. We have to come out of this pandemic with a notion of a caring society that wants to repair the damage done. If we are to learn lessons, we need to learn lessons about investment in our public services. We have seen the void and the gap that has been created in health, childcare, public transport and education, all areas that need to be invested in. We do not want to end up, when we strip the spin away from this scheme, looking back at something dressed up as a package of funding but which is really austerity and corporate bailout, mark 2. We need to understand how that debate is taking place in Europe and how it will impact on what we do here.</p>

          <p eId="para_838">Unfortunately, I cannot accept Deputy Doherty's first amendment. We had a discussion during the interruption. Article 11 of the SURE regulation states that member states' guarantees must be irrevocable, unconditional and on demand. The proposed amendment would in effect make the SURE guarantee agreement signed by Ireland a conditional rather than an unconditional one, as is required. It would have the effect of pricing additional risk into the borrowings the European Commission seeks in the market, making the cost of borrowing higher and defeating the purpose of the instrument, that is, to make loans available to pandemic-hit members states and to support their citizens. On receipt of a demand notice from the Commission under the SURE guarantee, guarantors, including Ireland, will have a maximum of ten business days to make payments. In passing the legislation, the Oireachtas will accept this stringent timescale, which was agreed after lengthy negotiation between the member states and the Commission. Should a demand be made, for example, during a period of Dáil recess, it would be impossible to comply with the provisions of the guarantee if the amendment were agreed to. In the case of the SURE guarantee, failure to meet the timeframe for payment under the guarantee would put Ireland in a technical sovereign default.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> To respond to the point Deputy Bríd Smith raised, tomorrow's European Council meeting will focus exactly on what she has referred to, that is, the balance between grants and loans and how that will play into the multi-annual financial framework, which will be the European Union's budget for the coming years.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_840">I have raised this issue twice now. This is the third and, I hope, last time I will raise it. The Minister of State did not respond to it the first two times. I refer to the guarantee scheme. How will the Government ensure that lending from the SBCI to the pillar banks - more than likely at zero interest, given the lending capacity and the credit rating of the EIB - will not be lent on to SMEs that are struggling during this pandemic at higher interest rates that are above the operational costs of the pillar banks? How will we ensure the pillar banks do not profiteer from this 100% guarantee, just as they are doing with the mortgage interest break? I want to hear the Minister respond to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> Can the Minister give us any indication as to when the Government will make a decision on whether it is likely to apply to draw down lending from the SURE scheme? There is no limit to the quantum of lending that any member state can borrow. Theoretically, we could apply for the whole €100 billion. That is obviously very unlikely, but the lending is for Covid-related expenditure on job retention and job supports. Therefore, there is eligible expenditure already incurred in respect of the temporary wage subsidy scheme. Other expenditure could be also applied, and future expenditure will be incurred by the State in supporting employment in the coming weeks and months. Given the favourable rates available and the fact that the State is borrowing at negative interest rates, which is to be very much welcomed, and I commend the NTMA on the debt management functions it has provided, particularly in refinancing a number of debts, and given that our profile looks very healthy for the coming years, when will a decision be made on a commercial basis as to whether it will be more beneficial to us to access borrowing through the SURE scheme or to paddle our own canoe and go to the markets and raise debt, as we have been doing, to levels that are very healthily oversubscribed and at rates that are very beneficial to the State?</p>

          <p eId="para_842">I apologise to Deputy Doherty. I should have made this point to him earlier. The mechanism between the SBCI and the pillar banks is not included in the legislation because it is factored in through memoranda of understanding between them.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> As to when it is envisaged the Government may wish to access the scheme, there is no date, but what I can say is that access to the SURE facility will depend on market rates and the maturity of loans offered by the Commission, and the Government will make a decision at the appropriate time. Having briefly discussed the matter with my officials here, it is anticipated the Government would access these instruments in the autumn. If the Government chooses to do so, it will be in the autumn.</p>

          <p eId="para_844">The Minister said in response to my question about the banks profiteering from the EIB guarantee scheme that there will be a memorandum of understanding between the relevant parties. I presume the relevant parties in this case are each pillar bank and the SBCI. Has that memorandum of understanding been drafted? Will it be laid before the Houses? Does it actually prevent the banks from profiteering from this pandemic in the way I have outlined by increasing the rate they will on-lend to SMEs? I would like to have sight of the memorandum because, as I have said on numerous occasions, and like the former Taoiseach, not only do I not trust the banks, but I would also like to see things for myself and check and double-check them. I ask the Minister of State to answer those questions. Has the memorandum been drafted? Is it available for us to scrutinise here? I mentioned that we are asked to take this on good faith. What is the understanding as to whether the memorandum of understanding will actually prevent the banks from charging anything above the operational costs of distributing this money to SMEs?</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Malcolm Noonan)<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_850">Go raibh maith agat.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> I move: “That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> I am delighted to address the House for the Second Reading of the Bill. The Bill is important in that it provides for the use of petroleum product levy funds, also known as the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, levy, collected on the consumption of oil products, to be used to fund the climate action fund. This fund will support a range of climate action projects which will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and be of benefit in terms of employment opportunities and economic development in communities throughout the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> The repurposing of the NORA levy for climate action is timely in the context of the overriding need to provide a stimulus for the economic recovery. It is one of a number of measures the Government intends to put in place over the next few months to kick-start economic growth. However, we need increased ambition in leveraging every mechanism at our disposal to ensure we can deliver every type of innovative project that will place Ireland at the forefront of the green economy and develop our green infrastructure. While doing this, we must at the same time be sure that all regions of the State benefit from the new sustainable economic and employment opportunities that have emerged, including within the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors. There is a strong need to ensure no region of the State is left behind as Ireland transitions towards a low-carbon society. This has come into sharp focus recently with the announcement that Bord na Móna will suspend peat harvesting and concentrate on enhanced peatland rehabilitation. The Department is examining the potential of the climate action fund to provide support for this activity, which will have the effect of transforming bogs damaged as a result of industrial milling of peat for power generation into effective carbon sinks. At the same time as providing for sequestration of carbon, this work will generate replacement employment for workers previously employed in the milling of peat.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> The climate action fund is one of four Project Ireland 2040 investment funds established to support the whole-of-Government stated ambition on climate action. This Bill provides for the financing of the fund by way of using funds generated by the NORA levy left over after the funding requirements of the NORA have been met. The Bill also establishes the fund, which is currently set up on an administrative basis, on a statutory footing, as advised by the Attorney General. The transport sector, excluding aviation, is dominated by passenger cars and freight and represents appropriate one fifth of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions. It is, therefore, appropriate that the surplus NORA levy funds, which are levied primarily on the use of petrol and diesel in road transport, are repurposed to assist in the wider decarbonisation of our society. This is consistent with the establishment of the polluter pays principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> While the primary purpose of the climate action fund is to support projects and initiatives in the area of climate mitigation, the fund also offers the considerable potential benefit of supporting sustained post Covid-19 investment in relevant technologies and infrastructure with resulting positive impacts on economic growth and job creation in communities throughout the State. The first call for projects led to the fund committing up to €77 million of support to successful projects. These projects are expected over the lifetime to leverage a total of €300 million of investment in the State. The projects supported under the first call of the fund will include: the nationwide roll-out of a high-powered ESB charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, EVs, supported up to €10 million; Dublin City Council's district heating system, supported up to €20 million, an innovative programme of which there are not many exemplars in this country; Gas Networks Ireland's green renewable agricultural zero emissions gas, supported up to €8.5 million; Irish Rail's hybrid drives for InterCity railcars, supported up to €15 million; a local authority public lighting energy efficient project, supported up to €17.5 million, and the benefit of which I have seen in my own constituency where the pilot of this programme commenced; South Dublin City Council's Tallaght district heating scheme, which uses excess data centre energy, supported up to €4.47 million; and the Three Counties Energy Agency project to increase efficiency in the road haulage sector, supported up to €1.37 million, another project I had close association with.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> These projects will enable decarbonisation in a number of sectors, including transport, heat and agriculture. On the enactment of the Bill, it is envisaged that a second call for applications for support from the fund will open as soon as possible in 2020. The advance work of the Department and continuous engagement with different sectors as well as experience gained from an analysis of the first call applications indicate that considerable scope exists for supporting projects that will provide climate benefits. At the same time, the fund can contribute to investment and economic growth across society, thus making an important contribution to our national recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> The overall purpose of the Bill is to amend the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007 to provide for the establishment of the climate action fund on a statutory basis, extend the purposes for which the NORA levy is paid to include providing funding for the fund and to provide for the payment of a portion of the levy moneys collected by the NORA fund. The NORA levy is collected at a rate of 2 cent per litre on most oil products on the market and is used to fund the activities of NORA, primarily in the maintenance of the State's strategic oil reserves. The amendments to the 2007 Act provided for in the Bill will allow for the repurposing of NORA levy monies to support projects and initiatives from the climate action fund and contribute to achieving the State's climate action goals in a cost-effective manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> The Bill also amends the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000 to provide for NORA and Irish Water as designated bodies to whom the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, may provide central treasury services. This allows the NTMA to make deposits from and-or to make advances to NORA as an alternative to the current utilisation of the commercial banks. It also facilitates the restructuring of Irish Water's funding arrangements, whereby existing funding from mainly commercial banks can be replaced with more competitively priced State funding debt facilities. This NTMA facility to Irish Water is intended to cover short-term and temporary timing-related funding requirements. Provision is also made in the legislation to provide for technical changes to the biofuels obligation scheme and for fixing of the rate of the biofuels levy to a nominal amount to incentivise the use of biofuels.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> The legislation contains 28 sections. I will turn to key provisions and explain what each is designed to achieve. This is not intended to be a definitive explanation of the contents of each section. The explanatory memorandum gives a more detailed account of each provision. </p>
          <p eId="para_860"> Section 4 revokes existing provisions of secondary legislation that set the rate of the NORA levy, which is required as the Bill will insert a new provision into the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007, which fixes the rate of the levy at 2 cent per litre by statute.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> Section 5 amends section 8 of the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007 by expanding the functions and powers of the agency to enable it to pay levy funds it has collected to the climate action fund, as directed by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> Section 13 of the Bill amends section 37 of the 2007 Act by expanding the purpose for which the levy is paid from the current purpose of funding the expenses of NORA to also include contributing to the climate action fund. This section also sets the rate of the levy to 2 cent per litre by statute.</p>
          <p eId="para_863"> Section 14 is an important component of the Bill which amends the 2007 Act to permit the Minister to issue an annual direction to NORA to pay a specified amount of levy moneys to the climate action fund. The section provides that only levy moneys collected and recovered after the legislation has commenced may be paid to the climate action fund. Prior to making a direction, the Minister is required to consult with NORA, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance. The Minister is also required to be reasonably satisfied in making a direction that NORA will have adequate financial resources remaining after payment has been made to meet its expenses during the remainder of the current financial year. In addition, the Minister must consider the amount specified to be appropriate, having regard to any future expenditure that may be required by NORA in subsequent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> Section 15 fulfils the important function of establishing and providing governance arrangements for the climate action fund. The fund shall be controlled by the Minister or by persons to whom the management and control of the fund has been delegated by order of the Minister. The fund will consist of such accounts that the Minister will determine as necessary, with provision made for submission of the accounts of the fund to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit and the laying of a copy of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and audited accounts before each House of the Oireachtas. The purpose of the fund is outlined and includes supporting projects, initiatives or research that seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to increase the production or use of renewable energy or to improve energy efficiency in the State. In addition, provision is made for projects or initiatives to support regions and sectors of the economy impacted by the transition to a low-carbon economy. Provision is made for the Minister to invite proposals to avail of moneys from the fund. Moneys may be paid from the fund only to persons who have conducted projects in accordance with the guidelines specified by the Minister in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Provision is also made for the establishment of a committee to advise the Minister on any aspects of his or her<i>
						</i>functions related to the fund. Further arrangements are made for the payment of any expenses incurred in connection with the administration of the fund, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> Section 22 makes a technical change to the 2007 Act in regard to the administration of the biofuels obligation scheme. The amount of the biofuels certificates from the two previous obligation periods which may be used in the current period is reduced from the previous cap of 25% to 15% of the total obligation.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> Section 24 amends the 2007 Act by setting the rate of the biofuel levy at one tenth of a cent per litre of biofuels placed on the market. Setting the rate at a nominal amount removes an anomaly which currently exists whereby the levy placed on biofuels is the same as that on petroleum products placed on the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> Section 28 amends section 18 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000 to provide for the designation of both NORA and Irish Water as designated bodies to which the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, provides central treasury services. This allows the NTMA to take deposits from and-or make advances to the agencies as required. NORA will be permitted to deposit moneys with the NTMA as an alternative to the current utilisation of the commercial banks. This provision also facilitates the restructuring of Irish Water's funding arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> In conclusion, this Bill serves to repurpose surplus NORA fund levies to make them available to the climate action fund, thereby supporting projects that will assist the State in its progress towards net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It also establishes the climate action fund on a statutory basis, enabling it both to receive levy funds and administer the provision of those funds to projects that will further decarbonise our society. In addition, the fund offers real potential to support employment and economic development by exploiting the opportunities of the expanding green economy and developing green infrastructure while, at the same time, supporting the just transition of regions formerly dependent on high-carbon activities. The climate action fund provides the opportunity to support economic growth while also delivering significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The Bill establishes the fund on a sound basis and provides it with access to the funding it requires to achieve its goals. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#DarrenORourke" eId="spk_368">
          <from>Deputy Darren O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_869">I am sharing time with Deputies Seán Crowe and Buckley.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007 to provide for the establishment of the climate action fund on a statutory basis. It also provides for the 2 cent levy that currently funds the National Oil Reserves Agency to be redirected to support the fund. It is proposed that the climate action fund will be used to support projects aimed at reducing emissions, increasing renewable energy production, improving energy efficiency and helping regions and sectors hit by changes that cut carbon emissions. Such a fund, constituted correctly and fairly and spent wisely, could really assist the State in its response to the climate crisis. Therefore, Sinn Féin is happy to support the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> The National Oil Reserves Agency was established as a stand-alone agency under the 2007 Act. Its function is to arrange for the holding of national strategic oil stocks at a level determined annually by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, for supply in an emergency. NORA is currently funded by a levy set at a rate of 2 cent per litre on the sale of most petroleum products at the point of sale. The levy is collected by the oil companies each month and paid to NORA to fund its activities, including operating expenses incurred in the purchase of petroleum products and securing storage in Ireland and abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> The NORA levy was increased by the then Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in 2009 from 1 cent to 2 cent by way of SI 214 of 2009. That statutory instrument imposes a 2 cent levy on petrol, green diesel, diesel oil, fuel oils and kerosene, but specifically excludes jet fuel of the kerosene type. Will the Minister of State explain why jet fuel was specifically excluded from the provisions of the 2009 statutory instrument? According to the European Commission, direct emissions from aviation account for some 3% of the EU's total greenhouse gas emissions and more than 2% of global emissions. If global aviation were a country, it would rank in the top ten emitters. In 2020, global annual international aviation emissions are already approximately 70% higher than they were in 2005. The International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, forecasts that, in the absence of additional measures by 2050, they could grow by a further 300%. Given the huge emissions the aviation industry contributes, should jet fuel be excluded from the levy that will support the climate action fund? Why should ordinary motorists be obliged to pay that levy when large airlines are not? I ask the Minister of State to address this point in his response.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">The NORA levy was increased in 2009 to reduce the €440 million in debt NORA had accrued. According to NORA's 2018 financial statement, a programme of debt repayment was undertaken between 2012 and 2017. By 31 March 2017, NORA's loans were nil, and this position has been maintained since then. As of the end of August 2019, NORA held a cash balance of €221.7 million. Over the period 2019-23, average levy receipts are expected to be €141 million per annum, while average NORA expenses are expected to be €76 million per annum. Section 44(3) of the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007 states: "In determining the rates of levy, the Minister shall seek to ensure that (taking one year with another) the sums realised by applying those rates to the volume assessments meet but do not exceed the estimated expenses of the Agency and of each designated subsidiary". However, this levy has obviously far exceeded the expenses of NORA. Has there been a breach of legislation to date due to NORA collecting an excess amount of money via this levy? The Comptroller and Auditor General was asked this specific question by the Committee of Public Accounts last year and he said it was a legal question. Has the Minister received legal advice on this?</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> I also raise the issue of the up-to-date cash balance of NORA. The 2019 financial statements are not available online. Will the Minister outline the current financial state of NORA? Section 14 of this Bill includes the provision that any levy moneys collected or recovered prior to the commencement of the Bill "shall not form part of any payment into the Climate Action Fund under this section". On what exactly will NORA be spending the large sum of money that has accumulated in its accounts? I ask the Minister to address that at some stage. I have outlined the figure of €221 million from last August, but does the Minister have an updated figure? Considering that NORA accumulated debts of €440 million just a decade ago, is the Minister satisfied that this will not happen again? Will there be transparency and oversight here, given the significant cash balance? </p>
          <p eId="para_875"> This Bill will convert a levy on fossil fuels, which was introduced for the specific purpose of paying down a debt and funding NORA, into a levy on fossil fuels that will fund climate action initiatives. Taken in combination with the Government’s proposed punitive carbon tax, this will now be a double tax on fossil fuels, on which people rely to heat their homes and run their cars. Has the Minister considered this? We already have 400,000 people living in fuel poverty in this State, and this Administration wants to quadruple the carbon tax over the next decade. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, confirmed that to me earlier today. Does the Minister agree that this will push more people into fuel poverty, as real affordable alternatives are simply not available for most people? Similarly, the Minister previously proposed a fee and dividend approach to carbon tax, but this has since been abandoned by the Green Party. Will the Minister outline how he will assist those already living in fuel poverty and the many more who will be at risk of it due to the severe hikes in carbon tax the Government is proposing? How will those people be helped?</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> The Bill also amends the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000 to provide for NORA as a designated body to which the NTMA may provide central treasury services. This allows the NTMA to take deposits from NORA, make advances to NORA, or both, as an alternative to the current utilisation of commercial banks. Irish Water is also to be given the same designated body status under the NTMA legislation. This facility is intended to facilitate the restructuring of Irish Water's funding arrangements, whereby existing funding from mainly commercial banks can be replaced with more competitively priced State-funded debt facilities. Are there any estimates of how much these changes could save Irish Water and NORA?</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> The Bill also proposes two substantive changes regarding the use of biofuels in Ireland by providing for technical changes to the biofuels obligation scheme, in addition to setting the rate of the biofuel levy to a nominal amount. Biofuels are intended to assist EU member states in meeting their emissions reduction targets. However, ensuring that biofuels are produced in a sustainable way is central to them reducing greenhouse gas emissions without adversely affecting the environment or social sustainability. Will the Minister provide further details about the Government’s plans in this area?</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> It has been stated that the climate action fund will provide €500 million in support to projects over the period of the National Development Plan 2018-2027. It was previously announced that the annual expenditure will be approximately €10 million in 2020, €30 million in 2021, €40 million in 2022, €80 million per annum in each of the years from 2023 to 2026 and €100 million in 2027. Has the Minister considered front-loading this investment to stimulate the economy post Covid-19 and to make quicker progress on our emissions targets?</p>

          <p eId="para_881">There is common agreement that we all need to do more as a country to combat climate change and that Ireland has dragged its feet and been a laggard in that fight for far too long. Having said that, we need to bring people along with us and we need to engage with the public. It is a huge local, national and global issue, but the biggest impact it has globally is on communities that are already marginalised. That is where I am coming from on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_882"> The Minister of State spoke about some of the projects that are being proposed and supported. He mentioned one in my constituency in Tallaght, which relates to the excess energy coming from the Amazon data centre on the Belgard Road. The plan is to tie in the heating system in order that excess heat would go to the council, the local IT, and eventually Tallaght Hospital. The idea is to tie it into the heat coming from the square, the Garda station and so on, and to use that excess heat. The plan would save some 1,900 tonnes of carbon in that general area and heat 339 student units.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> We can do many positive things to support communities and structures in the area but I am concerned about who is paying for it. An appropriate level of consideration has not been given to the communities and individuals the 2 cent levy will be put on. I know from experience in my own community that for many of the families paying the most to heat their homes during the Covid pandemic, as well as at other times, often the heat is going out through the roof. They are the families with old cars who cannot afford a new one, who cannot afford to get their houses insulated, and so on. That is where the focus needs to be when supporting those families. No one takes delight in having a less efficient heating system or an older car that does not get the same mileage as newer models. It has to be about bringing people along and that is a concern because we need to see a rapid and just transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> I am confused about certain elements of the Bill, such as jet fuel specifically being exempt from the levy. That question has been asked already. Why have airlines been left out of paying their fair share into this new climate fund?</p>
          <p eId="para_885"> I have run out of time and my colleague wants to come in. There are many positive aspects to the fund, but how the money goes into it is the big concern. There is much we can do with this fund but we need to look at where it is coming from.</p>

          <p eId="para_886">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I do not like to use scripts but I have edited it down since our time has been cut short. Projects aimed at reducing emissions, increasing renewable energy production, improving energy efficiency and helping regions hit by changes to cut carbon emissions are expected to be the beneficiaries of funding from a climate action fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> I will cut straight to the chase. There is much welcome detail in this Bill, but my bugbear is the notion of the carbon tax. This was raised already by one of our speakers. I do not want it to be the same, but this is similar to the bailout and austerity with it being the poor will who end up again paying the most. Regarding the last carbon tax rise of €6 in September, it was revealed then that there was no poverty review. That is one thing that will be absolutely vital in securing fairness in this document. Will the Minister of State commit to ensuring that a poverty impact review will be carried out and that the terms of reference for review will go beyond the impact on those worst off in our society and extend to low earners struggling to make ends meet above that very limited threshold? </p>
          <p eId="para_888"> We cannot claim to care about justice of any kind if our first concern is not on the impact of a policy on those who have the least voice, the least power and the least protection against bad policy. That is the one thing I am worried about and this issue has been raised before. Ordinary workers have no choice when it comes to energy-saving costs. This issue has also been raised before. People in rural communities have to drive and a new electric car is not an option. Many people are living in old, damp and poorly insulated homes. As many of those are also rented, it is not even possible to renovate. There are no advantages for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> We know that these people on the bottom rung are not the problem. Whatever we want to call austerity, whether green, otherwise or whatever, it is certain that we need to do better to really change anything. The one thing we do not want to do, however, is to make those less fortunate even less well off and still be climate poverty poor when this is finished.</p>

          <from>Deputy Duncan Smith<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_890">I congratulate the Minister of State on his role, which I am sure still feels very new to him. I know he has been flying the flag down in his constituency for a long time, so congratulations on all his success. The Labour Party will support this Bill and we broadly agree with the repurposing of the existing levy for ring-fencing and the funding of the new climate action fund. It is something that my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, raised last year when he was our spokesperson on climate and it is encouraging to see it implemented in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> We have some concerns regarding the collection of funds for the climate action plan in general and to ensure that the country is not placing itself in a position where it will be relying solely on the surplus or levies from the sales of oil products to fund vital climate action. We see this very much as a positive first step but it cannot be the only step. We cannot base our progress and efforts to end Ireland's status as a climate action laggard on the revenue collected from burning fossil fuels. To me, this seems to be in the long term rather counterproductive, but I understand that in the short term it is, I suppose, a good first step. I hope that the Minister of State, whether in this debate or future ones, will articulate further plans to better fund the climate action plan and put it on a sustainable basis. </p>
          <p eId="para_892"> Will the Minister of State address the issue of 11.5% of Ireland's oil reserves being located in Britain? Will the fact that these reserves are held in Britain present challenges, as Britain is, as we know, set to leave the EU either with or more likely without a deal in January 2021? Further to that aspect, I will be interested to hear the view of the Minister of State regarding the EU obligation for Ireland to store 90 days' worth of oil reserves. Does the Minister of State believe that this practice should be continued as we hopefully transition towards a greener economy? In a country where residents are suffering from such fuel poverty, is it not a skewed situation to maintain such large oil reserves, much of which is off our shores?</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> First and foremost, we must ensure that Ireland meets or, in the best-case scenario, exceeds its climate targets with the policies that this Government takes. We have less than a decade to change completely not only Ireland's course but the global path for emissions reductions. That said, the greatest concern for our party is that workers and households do not bear the brunt of the costs of meeting our targets and changing Ireland's course. The programme for Government states that we will be "spending €3 billion on targeted social welfare and other initiatives to prevent fuel poverty and ensure a just transition". </p>
          <p eId="para_894"> That statement seems vague and I understand such statements can appear vague in a document such as a programme for Government. Will these initiatives, therefore, go towards green jobs, green economic creation and the expansion of Ireland or is the Government planning to expand the welfare base rather than focus on the employment of people displaced through closure or bailing out of carbon-heavy businesses? By expanding the welfare base, does the Government envisage major job losses or does the Government want to truly ensure and commit to a just transition for workers?</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> Can the Minister of State ensure that a just transition will ensure that workers employed in high-pollution industries will have reskilling, retraining and alternative job opportunities before these jobs disappear in order to give them some light at the end of the tunnel and let them know that their futures are not only going to be ones where they survive but where they will thrive? I suggest that the vast majority of people in Ireland recognise the need for action, recognise that change must happen and recognise their responsibility to have a decent environment for the generations to come. What the people of Ireland do not accept is that the cost of this transition should be placed solely at the door of ordinary people, while companies and large industry in these sectors and other sectors, which have been mentioned previously as being the biggest contributors to the current situation, find themselves getting off relatively scot-free. Ordinary people must not be the first soldiers on the beach in the fight against climate change. We all have our part to play and we are all in this together but others have a greater responsibility and a greater capability to ensure that we meet our targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> As the Government introduces carbon taxes, and taxes on high emissions, I am sure the people of Ireland will do their bit. Ireland as a nation is not one of climate change deniers and we very much value our environment and our beautiful island. As I said, however, the Irish people will not accept the task for large multinationals and covering up poor governance and failure to enact radical and progressive green policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> The Minister of State should elaborate further on his plans for a just transition in respect of all the regions of Ireland. I refer to the large urban areas, but also our rural areas. Many of us acknowledge that some jobs in industry will have to be phased out as we transition towards a green economy and this may have less effect on urban areas where other industries and sectors exist. How will the Government and this Minister of State deal with the closure and phasing out of high-emissions industries in our rural regions? We have plenty of precedents of Irish government neglecting rural Ireland, particularly in respect of jobs. There is massive concern, particularly in the midlands, about this issue at present. We cannot simply say to people living and working in rural Ireland "tough luck, we have to do this". They must be looked after and they must be given a real future.</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> I will finish by stating that we must ensure that the infrastructure of green transport, green farming and green jobs is in place or comes in parallel with the removal of jobs in high-emissions industries. The worker must not be punished for being employed in these industries now and the worker must be central to the Government's strategy in a just transition to a green economy.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jennifer Whitmore<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_899">I congratulate the Minister of State on his new role, I wish him well in it and I look forward to working with him over the next few years, particularly on issues of biodiversity. I am delighted to speak on this legislation, which I hope paves the way for the suite of legislative measures required if we are to meet our national and international climate action obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> This Bill has many remits, including the establishment of the climate action fund, which I will focus on in my contribution today. While I welcome the Bill, I have put forward amendments which will be discussed on Committee Stage tomorrow and which seek to further strengthen the capacity of the climate action fund. My amendments will ensure that funding from the climate action fund is sustainably channelled across various climate action projects that aim to reduce our carbon emissions, mitigate climate change and facilitate a just transition. My amendments also outline the need to increase our focus on the protection and preservation of biodiversity and natural heritage. This is something I feel strongly about and which has been the poor relation to climate action policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_901"> As a legislator, I am dismayed that climate action in all its variety has been split between three different Departments. At present, climate action remains in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, while responsibility for the environment is now being spread across others, including water within the Department of housing, where heritage and biodiversity have also found their new home.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">Waste, environmental awareness and climate are with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment while forestry and the marine are within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Environmental groups and organisations campaigned throughout the lifetime of the previous Government to have all aspects of climate and climate action under one Department. They now face another Dáil term doing the same all over again. Our first battle against climate change is with our ability to manage our response as a nation. This requires a unified Department for climate and nature under one Minister to ensure cohesion across all climate and biodiversity spheres.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> For now, it is important that we strengthen the Bill as much as we can. I believe it presents an opportunity to address the policy and funding gap that exists between biodiversity and climate action which has plagued this country's response to climate change. One does not work without the other. They are two sides of the same coin but are often treated like different currencies altogether. For too long biodiversity has been viewed as an entirely separate process to climate action. The siloed nature of national climate action policy reflects this notion. To date there are separate plans, reports and actions both for biodiversity and climate. A widening gap is emerging between biodiversity and climate action with little communication between the two processes. I hope this is addressed somewhat in the forthcoming climate action Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> A more balanced national approach means incorporating the ecosystem into cross-sectoral adaptation policies and not treating them as separate processes but as complementary to our technological and economic measures. If we can do this it will make for more sustainable adaptation and a more comprehensive approach to climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> Too often national policy has been predominantly focused on the technological and economic aspects of climate action, resulting in a human-centric approach to climate change. Adaptation measures are decided by their impact on our economy and not on the environment while mitigation measures are focused on technological solutions as opposed to natural ones. While these are important, the Government has been too quick to overlook the major role nature can and must play in our response to climate change. We need to shift our national response towards a nature-based approach to climate action, building in nature-based solutions and moving away from viewing climate action entirely through an economic lens. If we continue to view climate action in this way we risk failing to identify the role nature-based solutions can have and we will fail to identify the impacts our climate actions are having on biodiversity and nature. If we do not integrate climate action and biodiversity effectively in national policy we could do more damage to nature in our bid to save the planet.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> Emerging scientific research on biodiversity continues to endorse nature's role in the carbon cycle. Not only does nature help to regulate the climate, it contains myriad nature-based solutions for both climate adaptation and mitigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> During the elections this year I had the pleasure of launching the Social Democrats biodiversity policy document on protecting our fauna and natural environment. It sets out exactly where we believe we need to go in terms of biodiversity. I urge the Minister of State to consider it as part of the climate action fund. The policy includes initiatives such as a requirement that State bodies first examine upstream natural-based solutions when considering works required to deal with flood relief and protection; a voluntary purchase scheme for unprofitable farmland to be converted into protected native woodland; incentives for the practice of agri-forestry and silvopasture; and incentives for the planting of native trees on private land and for sustainable felling and harvesting practices. We need to develop a blue carbon strategy that will identify blue carbon sites such as seagrass, kelp and salt marshes. We need other projects to incorporate biodiversity policy, as promoted by the Social Democrats, including the promotion and expansion of wildlife corridors across our country. We recognise the potential of rivers, canals and the road network as potential natural corridors. We need to encourage our local councils to create native woodland walks and wildflower meadows in existing and new parks. We need national legislation to significantly reduce or eliminate the non-agricultural use of pesticides and herbicides outdoors. There are many other proposals. I will not go through all of them today but I believe the Minister of State would agree with me on many of these measures and would probably have considerable interest in them as well. I am more than happy to sit down and discuss them further with the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_908"> The climate action fund presents us with an opportunity to address the financial shortfalls that plague our attempts to address climate change. No one is in any doubt that funding needs to be increased to protect our natural world. Since climate action has finally been put on the political agenda - and even long before that - Irish organisations and institutions tasked with conservation, environmental education, advocacy and protecting our biodiversity have all been underfunded, understaffed and under-resourced especially compared with our neighbours in Europe. We need to start treating the natural environment on a par with climate action and afford it the appropriate support. Some of our State agencies are struggling with the current funding deficit. The National Parks and Wildlife Service continues to be drastically underfunded. It is difficult for the service to proactively carry out the functions and duties under its remit, despite the best efforts of its staff, due to resourcing pressures.</p>
          <p eId="para_909"> The National Biodiversity Data Centre, which is tasked with the important role of monitoring our impact on biodiversity, cannot carry out the necessary research to inform us on policymaking. Its funding is based on short-term funding mechanisms but it needs a long-term funding strategy. If we cannot measure our biodiversity and identify a baseline, we cannot identify whether we are improving, or how we are impacting on our environment. The role of the Environmental Protection Agency needs to be expanded further to enable it to manage and inform the impact developments are having on our environment. For environmental NGOs funding is a constant struggle. The environmental NGO community has done incredible work with the little they have in fostering community engagement to protect biodiversity at a grassroots level. I am aware that members of the Irish Environmental Network receive approximately €1 million each year in core funding. The fact is that they need closer to €10 million to make the impact they believe is required to adequately protect our natural heritage. When we compare the €1 million for environmental NGOs, or the €16 million that the National Parks and Wildlife Service gets, with the €16 million that Bord na gCon receives annually, it really paints a bleak picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> I want to go into greater detail on what incorporating biodiversity with climate action looks like and what kind of initiatives the climate action fund could help to support. These are initiatives promoted by the Social Democrats for the conservation of endangered and vulnerable native species. They include funding for councils and inland fisheries to map and remediate barriers to fish migration as well as State funding for the monitoring and eradication of invasive species.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> The marine is another poor relation when it comes to climate action policy. It is time the Government stood up for marine biodiversity and coastal communities and committed to ending overfishing. Our network of marine protected areas needs to expand considerably to protect our rich vibrant marine ecosystem. This needs to be done on an ecologically coherent basis. That is why we need to ensure we have enough investment in our research so that we know what we are protecting and why we are protecting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> Water pollution must be a thing of the past through the full implementation of key European directives that protect our freshwater sources from pollution and invasive species and ensure good water quality and healthy rivers, lakes and groundwater. We also need a new vision for our forestry to ensure timber production is in line with social, biodiversity and climate obligations. The current outdated tree farm timber production model is not working. A motion on forestry that was put forward in September 2019 called for a "fundamental change in forestry policy away from" the current emphasis on clear-fell short-rotation monoculture to the promotion of natural, diverse and long-term woodland plantations of neighbourhood and farmland trees.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> The Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated how critical our food security is and how fragile our export driven model is to external shocks. We must ensure that as a small island we are able to feed ourselves. In addition we must halt the catastrophic losses of farmland biodiversity and reward primary producers for restoring it, for protecting water quality and for meeting our climate change commitments. Affordable locally produced food must be at the heart of future plans and agrifood strategies. We must also consider the final recommendations of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action, which placed considerable emphasis on the role of hedgerows in our ecosystem. The committee called for a national hedgerow conservation strategy which recognises the rich climate and biodiversity benefits of our natural hedgerow resource.</p>
          <p eId="para_914"> Of course none of this can be done unless we bring everyone with us. First and foremost, our duty is to protect vulnerable communities from the effect of climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy. The climate action fund can help to prioritise projects that aim to facilitate a just transition. The climate action fund should prioritise such projects. Investing in nature-based solutions for climate mitigation will force us all to share the burden of climate change and thereby help vulnerable communities to withstand the disruptive transition to green jobs, new economic models and changes in our weather patterns.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> I believe that now is the time to get serious about adopting the EU green deal. I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, about it this morning. Its targets devise a comprehensive approach across all aspects of climate action to enable a fair and effective transition to a low-carbon economy. The targets we must implement will require a concrete shift towards a circular economy where waste and excessive consumption is targeted by national policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">This will require greater investment and initiatives at a community level, encouraging the roll-out of reuse and repair workshops, as well as zero waste and upcycling businesses, particularly in rural areas where jobs can be created and communities upskilled through wiser sustainable use of our natural resources. We need strong target-driven legislation to be implemented and this needs to be backed up with science and nature-based solutions to help us achieve our climate action and biodiversity targets. Fundamentally, biodiversity and nature, and the capacity of a nature-based solution to deal with climate change adaptation and mitigation, is important. It is an area that has not been given the emphasis it requires. Its value and potential has not been recognised. </p>
          <p eId="para_917"> Climate change and biodiversity are intrinsically linked. We are not be able to address climate change without addressing biodiversity and the use of nature-based solutions. Our biodiversity will be impacted heavily by climate change and we need to address these two issues in tandem. Biodiversity and climate change are not two separate languages or currencies; they are, in fact, two sides of the same coin.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_918">Like the Bill that was passed earlier, if we accept the rhetoric of this Bill, it is hard to argue against it on the face of it. Money from the current 2 cent per litre levy on petrol and diesel will now go to the climate action fund if we pass this Bill. We are told that fund will be used to help to reduce our emissions and reach our climate targets. What is not to like about that? However, a number of questions arise and there is a fundamental weakness in the logic behind this kind of policy, which becomes clear when one examines it closely. Anyone who reads about the history of the levy would be forgiven for thinking that the oil companies pay it. The association representing oil companies threatened to take legal action if the levy was used for climate action and put into a separate fund instead of being returned to the industry. Oil companies do not pay the levy, however, motorists do on every litre of petrol and diesel that they use. The oil companies simply collect the money. Like the general drift with carbon taxes, it is not industry that pays. Rather, it is the people, who often have no alternative but to use petrol or diesel cars. The €500 million fund trumpeted by the Government for years as a key plank in its climate action plan depends on the continued use of petrol and diesel to fund it. To me, there is a degree of irony in that. In fact, the recent Covid-19 crisis probably highlighted it, insofar as the reduction in the sale of petrol and diesel would have meant, I assume, a reduction in the amount that would have gone into the fund. I point this out to highlight the weakness in the policies that appear to be clever wizard ideas. It seems to me that behind this sort of logic that these kinds of funding streams propose, there is an element of rearranging the deckchairs on the <i>Titanic</i>. We are all aware of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report on the dire timeframe for the far-reaching and radical action required in our transport, energy and entire social system to avoid catastrophic climate change, a wish that is increasingly impossible for the many parts of the globe which are currently experiencing that catastrophic climate change. These policies do not suggest that we understand the scale and pace of the change that is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> Projects currently being funded by the climate action fund present another problem. Should the emphasis in policy be, for example, on charging points for electric vehicles or facilitating a massive boom in the sale and use of electric vehicles rather than a revolution in public transport? Equally, I am unsure that funding for so-called environmentally friendly gas projects is anything other than wishful thinking. </p>
          <p eId="para_920"> In its work on climate action, the emphasis of Gas Networks Ireland on biogas projects will not result in our targets being reached or the kind of radical and far-reaching policies that are needed for our climate. There are logical problems with biogas, which relies on a supply of animal manure and plant biomass. I want to quote from the acclaimed non-governmental organisation Food &amp; Water Watch. Its recent publication states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_921">Despite claims of environmental benefits, biogas is primarily made up of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. And the focus on the supposedly renewable nature of biogas ignores the many environmental and health threats posed by a major source of this gas: manure from massive factory farms. Biogas has no place in the world's clean energy future.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> I want to comment on the proposed changes to the biofuel obligation. I again wish to point out that on paper it seems like an eminently sensible policy, but in reality it exposes weaknesses in the general overall approach. The obligation is meant to encourage the use of alternatives to fossil fuels in our energy use. It seems that has been the case. When it was introduced it was hoped there would be a boom in the local indigenous production of various forms of biofuel. In fact, because of the logic of the market it resulted in the closure of dozens of budding projects, as most of the biofuel ended up being imported from Holland. To quote one commentator, the biofuel obligation scheme has been the death knell of indigenous biofuel production in this country. As with biogas, there are major question marks over the sustainability of biofuels of all types and whether they result in any savings in CO2 emissions if we look at the entire life cycle of plants etc., and how they are used and transported. One report found that plans to shift Europe's coal plants to burning wood pellets could accelerate rather than combat the climate crisis and lay waste to woodland equal to half the size of Germany's Black Forest every year. Another study indicated that the sustainability of rapeseed biodiesel in the interpretation of the EU's renewable directive is, at best, questionable and in most scenarios is simply unjustifiable. </p>
          <p eId="para_923"> My overall point is that neither the NORA levy nor the climate action fund nor biomass and biofuels are delivering the far-reaching and fundamental change that the climate crisis requires. Ultimately, tinkering around the edges will not result in global reductions in emissions or tackle the causes of the crisis which, at its heart, remains the hold of the fossil fuel industry on energy, transport and the need of our current economic system to continually grow and provide profits over other concerns, whether that is sustainability or the sustainability of the lives of people on this planet.</p>

          <p eId="para_924">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. On my way to the convention centre, I remembered that it is now three years since I originally put forward this particular concept. I want to thank the current and former management and board of the National Oil Reserves Agency. They put in a tremendous effort to deal with a deficit, outstanding debt and the fact they did not have oil reserves available to them. Since the establishment of the fund, they have dealt with all of that and, as a result, have created the surplus that we are discussing today.</p>
          <p eId="para_925"> The Minister will know that there is a shortfall of €700 million in the fund. The original concept with which I came forward would have ensured a fund of €1.2 billion, something we will address on Committee Stage tomorrow. I hope we get support from the Government on that. While acknowledging the work of the staff, management and board of NORA, the issue of energy security still represents a major vulnerability for Ireland today. We cannot just brush it under the carpet. I ask the Government to consider the issue of energy security policy because we need to achieve set targets for indigenous energy supply in order to reduce or eliminate the importation of energy into this country, increase the Exchequer reserves and protect Ireland's energy security. </p>
          <p eId="para_926">The Government needs to create an energy security advisory committee to develop that policy and the associated action plan that will be needed post-Brexit to protect our energy security. That is a role and capacity that NORA could have going forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> The climate action fund was announced as part of Project Ireland 2040. Project Ireland 2040, despite criticism at the time, was a significant step forward in the approach, both in terms of scale and ambition, in investment in the whole area of climate change. The big difference between the promises that had been made by previous Ministers with responsibility for the environment was that the commitments were backed up by the funding to deliver on what was set out in Project Ireland 2040.</p>
          <p eId="para_928"> Some €22,000,000,000 went directly into climate-focused investment and a further €8.6 billion in sustainable mobility. That is €1 in €4 of capital spend by the State and State agencies over the next decade that is focused on climate action and emissions reduction. This is significant, not just in European terms but, in fact, in global terms. For Ireland, it represented a huge leap forward in our approach to addressing the issue of climate action. Of that €22 billion, some €4 billion went into energy efficiency upgrades, getting rid of dirty fossil fuels from our heating systems within a 200 month period, taking dirty fossil fuels of out power generation by 2025 and rolling out the smart farming initiative across the country which evidence has shown reduces emissions in agriculture by 10%.</p>
          <p eId="para_929"> If one wants to put another name on this particular legislation it is the "bring people with us" law, because that is the objective behind the climate action fund. From my experience as Minister with responsibility for the environment, environmentalists, in many instances, were far too focused on the vehicle rather than the end result to reduce emissions. Bringing people along the climate action journey was and is completely alien to many environmentalists. Instead, they want to take a continental European climate solution and shoehorn it into an Irish situation. One will not get a replica result by doing that. On top of that, the communities across this country in rural Ireland are firmly of the view that environmentalists are only interested in taxing people in rural Ireland to try to force them into our congested cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_930"> The objective and goal behind the climate action fund was to come up with innovative solutions to Irish climate problems because we have, believe it or not, unique challenges here. It is an alternative to the approach advocated by the Green Party leader of carpooling for people living in rural villages which is not realistic or practical. However, the climate action fund can fund initiatives that are practical, can be implemented in urban and rural areas and will have a direct impact on our emissions profile.</p>
          <p eId="para_931"> We need to acknowledge the fact we have by far the most dispersed rural communities anywhere in Europe. Some 37% of our population lives on 96% of the land mass of Ireland and the environmentalists need to wake up and realise that is not going to change any time soon. Live with the facts and let us come up with solutions that deal with those facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_932"> In 2018 in the city of Dublin just 50% of people used public transport. Huge public investment is going into it. That public transport solution is not available in rural Ireland but we should look at how we can maximise the utilisation of public transport in urban areas. Carbon tax will not do that because people in rural areas disproportionately pay more of that tax without any alternative. However, congestion charges, which have been dismissed to date by some people within the Green Party, are a solution to that. We also need to acknowledge that across the midland counties solid fuel is the only source of heating for one in five homes. That is a huge problem that needs to be overcome and we need to come up with a solution. District heating will not resolve that particular problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_933"> Ireland is unusual compared to other EU countries in terms of our emissions profile, because the greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture make up a much larger share of our emissions than anywhere else in Europe. In fact, one third of our emissions come for agriculture. Even though 90% of the beef we produce is exported, Ireland is penalised for being the most carbon-efficient beef exporter within the European Union because the rules state responsibility is on the producer rather than the consumer of that product. Relatively carbon-efficient beef production can, therefore, be replaced throughout the European Union with beef that is 35 times worse from an environmental perspective from the Amazon basin. That is okay according to climate mathematicians, but not our atmosphere.</p>
          <p eId="para_934"> Another challenge we have, bizarrely, here in Ireland is air quality. While we cannot see air pollution, it is a big problem. Four people per day are dying as a result of poor air quality. Air quality concerns people's health today. Climate action and climate change concerns the next generation's health in the future. It is two sides of the same coin and we need to be focused if we are going to bring people with us on the issues of air quality. Some 122,000 beds per year are taken up in our hospitals because of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD. One in 12 people in Ireland suffer from COPD. One in five children in Ireland suffer from asthma. In fact, we have the fourth highest rate of asthma in the world. Improvements in air quality which reduce our carbon emissions profile has a direct impact on the health of Irish people today and on the impact of Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_935"> The concept behind the climate action fund is to turn innovative ideas into climate action using the fund to support larger-scale projects that would not otherwise be developed without the support of Government. The fund is about a new way of problem solving in both urban and rural communities, in business and enterprise, on climate and environmental issues. I recognise that the Government does not have a monopoly on good ideas. That is why I was determined to have this particular fund established with its primary goal to drive innovative projects that will reduce Ireland's carbon emissions and deal with the unique challenges we have. The fund was planned to open up to support joint ventures, harness creativity and support initiatives coming from local communities and business as well as global corporations. The objective behind it is that it will be a blank canvas for everyone here in Ireland to come forward with innovative ideas that can help meet our climate and energy targets. It will be a blank canvas for anyone with a global interest in this area who is prepared to come to Ireland and try out that initiative which will have a direct impact on our overall emissions profile.</p>
          <p eId="para_936"> The core behind this fund, which was taken on board by Government and replicated into three other funds, namely, the rural regeneration fund, the urban regeneration fund and the fund within the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation on new innovative ideas, was that there would not be a plethora of terms and conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">My view was that the criteria being laid down by civil servants and Ministers were choking creativity. The idea was to keep eligibility broad, to focus on the end result, which was reducing our overall emissions profile and let people come up with the ideas because effective climate change is about putting the levers of action into the hands of ordinary people the length and breadth of this country, and delivery requires fundamental transformation in our thinking as a society. The climate action fund, when it was announced, was the largest <i>per capita</i> fund of its type in the world, and there is some international interest in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_938"> The opportunities provided by the fund are endless, whether they be community-led electricity and energy or other projects. Earlier, the Aire Stáit mentioned the Three Counties Energy Agency project. As Minister, I was determined to reduce the overall emissions profile and electricity demand for local authorities throughout the country and through the climate action fund, we will reduce the electricity bill of every local authority by replacing all of the public lighting in the State. These are practical measures for which there was no Government funding but they could make a real difference to our emissions profile. I hope when this fund is established on a statutory footing that this core principle is accepted and that we do not have a situation where the fund is used by the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance to wallpaper over other deficits or to fund projects that should normally be funded through other mechanisms of Government. Having listened to the Minister of State's contribution, I am concerned that the tentacles of Government Buildings are already getting into that fund. That was never the intention and should not be allowed to be the intention of that fund. That is why I will table amendments relating to the fund tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_939"> Another amendment I will table seeks to have the fund increased to €1.2 billion. If one were to go back through the substantial file on this legislation within my former Department, one would see that my objective all along was to increase the levy from 2% to 3%, bring in an extra €700 million, paid for by the oil industry through the distributors, and in tandem with that reduce the amount consumers pay in carbon tax. The end result to the public in terms of fuel costs is that they would see no difference but it would mean that this tax was put on the oil industry. I cannot believe that a Government that is supposed to have such a green agenda and that has such a green hue is bringing forward legislation that does not increase the taxes on the oil industry but the Minister will get the opportunity to do that tomorrow. I look forward to him accepting my proposal tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_940"> Finally, I want to bring up another aspect of this fund. This time last year I proposed that part of the fund would be specifically ring-fenced to support the rehabilitation work that was needed on the cutaway bogs in the midlands and to support employment of Bord na Móna staff, in particular, in east Galway, Roscommon, Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly, that had been badly impacted upon by the fact that no harvest has taken place this summer. All of those seasonal staff are currently in limbo. They have received no communication whatsoever from the board or from Government as to if or when they will have a job. The only indication that this fund will be used is in the proposal on the day it was announced.</p>
          <p eId="para_941"> Nobody has bothered to address those staff who are living in limbo today. Some of them are in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment while others are in receipt of the wage subsidy. All of them want to be back working on the bogs and are available and willing to do that. Unfortunately, some of the seasonal staff, who were not called back earlier in the year along with their colleagues, are getting absolutely nothing. These people have worked for ten or 15 years on these bogs, did not get called back in the early part of the season and as a result, they are living on fresh air, and that is being ignored. At the same time as we the taxpayers are paying, through Bord na Móna, the wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment to those who have been temporarily laid off, we have staff drawing those payments who have applied to Bord na Móna to take redundancy and their application is not being processed by the company. I believe that it is a public scandal that we are using taxpayers' money, which we are borrowing, to subsidise staff who have applied for a redundancy package, who want to leave and cannot get out the door, to remain on the books within Bord na Móna. I hope that the Minister of State will specifically address that issue. I have raised it with his predecessor, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, all of whom are quite prepared to justify the paying of public money, but that is not a just transition. It is not a just transition for the taxpayer. It is not just for the employees who want to get out and it is not just for the employees who are living on fresh air and want to get back to work.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelCollins2016" eId="spk_377">
          <from>Deputy Michael Collins<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_943">Indeed, with three other colleagues - Deputies Michael Healy-Rae, Danny Healy-Rae and Richard O'Donoghue. I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, the very best in his new role.</p>
          <p eId="para_944"> NORA exists in its present form to ensure that Ireland maintains its minimum stockholding requirements for oil and petroleum products. With regard to the proposed amendment of the principal Act, the Minister wishes to increase levies on oil and petroleum products to establish the climate action fund. These amendments will increase costs for consumers in Ireland at a very difficult time. While the ambitions of the fund are admirable, the fund amounts to a blank cheque for the Minister to hit each and every consumer directly in the pocket, and especially in rural areas, in a major area of cost to consumers, namely transportation and heating.</p>
          <p eId="para_945"> While we all have aspirations to have a world-class public transport system in Ireland, the main mode of transport for most people today is the car. This will increase costs for people at a particularly challenging time. Would it not be better to introduce an income tax increase to show citizens what the Government's climate action fund will cost instead of a sneaky levy? For example, under the proposed amendment to section 8 of the principal Act, the Minister proposes to pay the proceeds of a levy collected and recovered into the fund. Can the Minister of State confirm that this levy will be capped, and at what amount? Can he confirm that the levy will not remove or reduce funding for other critical parts of our economy?</p>
          <p eId="para_946"> Under the proposed amendments of section 37 to the principal Act, the Minister proposes to have dedicated expenses for the set-up of the fund. Can the Minister of State explain how much is budgeted for the management of the fund and whether there will be a cap on expenses for his Department in respect of the running of the fund?</p>
          <p eId="para_947">I will also raise the critical issue of our security of supply for natural gas, which is dire. The Minister of State wishes to increase energy efficiency through his proposed amendment to the operation of the climate action fund but I believe we need to get our house in order first. While Ireland has an agency to safeguard a minimum volume of oil reserves, it has become increasingly clear that it is severely exposed to security of supply issues with regard to natural gas. As the Minister of State may have seen in the news, the Kinsale gas platform, one of our only indigenous sources of natural gas, was recently turned off. This will result in a loss of jobs in Cork but also means that we are now in an extremely vulnerable position with regard to our national security of supply for gas. </p>
          <p eId="para_948"> Ireland currently produces more than 50% of its electricity from gas. We import gas via interconnectors with the UK. We have no existing gas storage on the island of Ireland. The Corrib gas field will be exhausted within ten years. We will then be fully reliant on the UK for the importation of gas. The UK is also reliant on gas imports and has experienced its own decline in gas production in the North Sea. The UK is also exiting the EU, leading to new risks to our economy. While the UK and Ireland are now good friends, the same cannot be said of the UK and the EU, which are going through a messy divorce. If trade talks between the EU and the UK were to take a turn, there is not much preventing the operators of the British national grid from increasing tariffs on the interconnectors between the EU and the UK, which would directly hurt the Irish economy. </p>
          <p eId="para_949"> I strongly ask the Minister of State to improve the security of supply of natural gas and propose that he considers a floating liquefied natural gas, LNG, import terminal, which would guarantee our security of supply, while we develop offshore wind power and renewables. While we will make that move towards renewables in the coming years, it is clear that it will take time and we must be realistic. Gas can, and will, play a key role as a transition fuel and in the balanced power production from renewables in Ireland. Once offshore wind power production and other renewables are in a position to replace fossil fuels, we can either use a floating LNG terminal as purely a security of supply option or disconnect it entirely if that is desirable for our country. A floating terminal allows for this and we will not be left in the lurch while we make our move towards renewables.</p>
          <p eId="para_950"> I am aware of proposals from a company owned and located in Ireland, which is ready to put world-class LNG infrastructure in place and which will commit to importing conventional LNG as opposed to fracked gas. This will help to put Ireland's energy transition and economic competitiveness first rather than outsourcing our energy needs to the UK and other countries. </p>
          <p eId="para_951"> As the Minister of State will be aware, we are in very challenging times. Higher energy costs will hurt our economy. I, therefore, ask that he seriously considers a floating LNG terminal as a viable option to support our economy with competitive energy and to diversify and ensure our security of supply of gas to ensure practical implementation of the energy transition.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelHealyRae" eId="spk_378">
          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_952">I wish the Minister of State well in his new role, which is very important. This debate, however, is the start of the knocking of, and the campaign against, people in rural Ireland. Early this morning on Newstalk, I had to defend people who want to build homes in rural areas because the Green Party has a policy whereby they will be asked to pay for the broadband they might receive in the future as a condition for the grant of planning permission by the local authority. This evening we are talking about more impositions being put on people in rural Ireland in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_953"> With regard to energy security, there is a gaping hole in the fabric of our society because of the problems we will have with energy security in the future. There will be an over-reliance on energy from overseas, particularly in the post-Brexit era. Nobody knows what is coming down the road or what our relations with other countries will be in the future. Climate change, and what is proposed to deal with it, comes at an enormous cost. There is, again, an over-reliance on hitting the people who least deserve to be hit, the people living in rural Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_954"> This new Government has capitulated to the Green Party in dispensing with the proposed LNG terminal at Shannon. I was instrumental in ensuring that this project was promoted in the previous programme for Government. Not only is it not in the current programme, the Government is actively campaigning against it. Everybody must realise the enormous amount a private company spent on the Shannon LNG project. It did not have to be fracked gas. Nobody ever said it had to be fracked gas.</p>
          <p eId="para_955"> While we are talking about energy, we had a great supply of energy in our turf and in our peat industry. What is the Green Party doing in that regard? It is ending that industry and knocking it. I think back on all of the great people who worked in the midlands and around the country over the past 100 years, both harvesting and saving turf for themselves and working for the peat industry. We are now willing to flood, or rewet to use the polite term, the bogs. Such nonsense and baloney I have never heard in all of my life. It is the same as ending the beet industry. Every politician now rightly recognises that the beet industry in this country should never have been stopped. In the exact same way, the people of Ireland in the future will ask what was wrong with politicians when they shut down the peat industry. It is a stupid decision by stupid politicians who do not know what they are talking about. It is a horrible thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_956"> As I said, rural Ireland is being asked to pay a large price with regard to changing our "emissions profile". That term sounds great. It is lovely language but we must look at the cost and the imposition on people. Whether one lives in a town, a city or rural Ireland, one will be asked to pay a high price for this. </p>
          <p eId="para_957"> I compliment our farming community, the people who have genuinely been protecting our environment and who have been playing their part. They have improved their slurry storage facilities, built new sheds, put up new yards, and improved methods for spreading the slurry that must be spread every year. They have upped their game. They are playing their part as the custodians of our environment. They know a hell of a lot more about protecting our environment than any member of the Green Party ever will. I again compliment those people and the IFA, which has worked so diligently to defend our family farms.</p>
          <p eId="para_958"> The ending of exploration for oil and gas and the harnessing and harvesting of the great reserves we have around our coast was another stupid decision. Again, it does not make sense. Every other country in the world can go into its seas to look for gas and oil but we cannot because politicians think it is the wrong thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_959"> In my honest and humble opinion, the extra carbon taxes that are to come are unbelievable, unsustainable and unfair. Time will prove what I have said here this evening to be right. I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DannyHealyRae" eId="spk_379">
          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_960">I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this very serious matter this evening. As I have stated several times, this proposal claims to be about national oil reserves or whatever but it is about raising carbon taxes and increasing the amount the ordinary punter will have to pay. The ordinary motorist, farmer, haulier and bus operator will have to pay more. All of those sectors will have to pay a sum to provide a shiny new fleet of electric buses for Dublin. Rural Ireland is being asked to pay for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_961"> I should have congratulated the Minister of State and wished him well in his new post but I will not support or vote for this Bill tomorrow evening. I will vote against it. In trying to come up to the mark and obey the rules that will pertain, people are trying to make electric excavators.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">The fact is that they have made them already but they have to charge them all night with diesel generators. What is going on is absolutely ridiculous.</p>
          <p eId="para_963"> There is talk about electric cars but already the price for charging them has gone up. The cost of travelling 100 km in an electric car is €3.80 compared to €5 for a small diesel car, but we must take into account the cost of an electric car. Where will people charge electric cars? Where will they plug in an electric car to recharge when it stops? There is no place to plug it in. All of these things will cost people in rural Ireland because one cannot get anywhere there without a car and farmers cannot do anything without a jeep or a tractor. The Government had better realise that. What will this do only hurt the old people, who for one reason or another cannot cut turf any longer? What has been happening is wrong. Traditionally, we cut turf all around the county of Kerry to keep ourselves warm and we will keep doing that while we can but the Green Party does not want us to do that. It is wrong to make people do things or not do things that they have been doing for generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_964"> The Green Party is promoting public transport. In the past ten to 15 weeks, I only saw one or two people inside in the 51-seater or 52-seater buses and coaches. A massive Luas passed me the other day with only two people inside it. We are told to use public transport. That is what the Green Party is saying. At the same time, we are looking at advertisements on the television every night telling us not to use public transport, if at all possible. There is a complete contradiction there. I want the Minister of State to know something I have said several times: if we put out the lights altogether in this country and each and every one of us left, it would only make 0.13% of a difference in the worldwide context. There are other continents and big powers doing nothing at all about climate change.</p>
          <p eId="para_965"> I wish to speak about criticism of farmers and methane gas. The scientist who argued that farmers were creating so much methane gas emissions has now come along and said that he was two thirds wrong in his estimation. The Minister of State must be honest with people about what the Government is trying to do. People rang me from around the country tonight even from as far away as Kerry and Donegal about the problems that we have in rural Ireland. Rural pubs are being denied the right to open their doors while two thirds of pubs are wide open here in Dublin. The Government is hitting rural Ireland again. This is what the Bill is all about.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardODonoghue" eId="spk_380">
          <from>Deputy Richard O'Donoghue<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_966">This oil Bill has already raised €3 billion in carbon taxes since 2010. The Green Party has included certain projects that its members want rural Ireland to pay for. Some €8.5 million is being provided for gas projects. Dublin City Council is to get €20 million for green heating systems. Some €4.5 million is being provided for the Tallaght district system, €7.5 million is being provided for local street lights and €1.4 million is being provided to improve the efficiency of heavy goods vehicles. Do Green Party members understand what happens in rural Ireland? Do they understand how food products get onto the shelves? It will be their fault when people are charged between €3 and €4 for a litre of milk because they are taxing rural Ireland, the same people who are feeding them every single day. All the food for people, whether they are vegan or otherwise, comes from rural Ireland, but the Green Party is taxing us.</p>
          <p eId="para_967"> Every new truck at the moment costs approximately €150,000. That is the minimum cost. A trailer for a truck costs approximately €90,000. What does the Green Party do? It gets everything into Dublin and lets rural Ireland pay for it. The Green Party has no concept of rural Ireland. I look at it from the point of view of all of its ministerial appointees. They are Dublin-based. The Minister of State should come down to Limerick for a full day and I will show him what is needed to get food onto the table in rural Ireland. All the bus infrastructure to schools is bust. Deputy Danny Healy-Rae mentioned an issue a moment ago. I am in the construction industry. The Green Party now wants every construction job to have an electric digger which gives two hours working time and needs to be charged by a generator for eight hours. Again, the Green Party members do not have anything between their ears because they have no experience of rural Ireland. They have no experience of how real life works. There is no infrastructure in rural Ireland, so we have to travel.</p>
          <p eId="para_968"> Farmers work 365 days a year, and 366 days in a leap year, to provide for the people in Ireland. All the Green Party can do is tax them and send all the funding into Dublin. The funding needs to come down the country. The Government has raised enough taxes. Why not incentivise farmers to produce a greener product? I know farmers who have been working for generations waiting for the next generation to take over farms, but they cannot do it because every time there is a change of Government it takes a full generation to get the next generation started. It should only take two generations to set up a family to go forward and to rebuild. Farming cannot rebuild with the amount of taxes the Government is putting on it. The Government must incentivise farmers and help them. They are helping the Government by paying €40 a tonne extra for fertiliser to help with emissions. What does the Government do? It puts on more tax to get the milk into the co-ops and it charges farmers more to go to shops to get their own food. When farming goes well, the community goes well. Every town and village has been closed down and no infrastructure has been put in place because the Government is moving all the funding to Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_969"> When the Minister of State goes home this evening he can think about it. When he sits down to have a cup of tea he will want a small drop of milk. He will bring out the butter and the bread and everything else. He will think about where that comes from. Farmers are working 365 days a year, yet all the Green Party wants to do is tax them more for its greener way. The Minister of State should come down to Limerick and cycle 15 or 20 miles to get his litre of milk. It is great to cycle into the Dáil and look good but the Minister of State should come down to Limerick and he can cycle every day if that is the way he wants to do it, but he will go nowhere and there will be no television to show the Government up for what it is doing. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, on the position he is in, but if he wants to be educated, he should come down to Limerick for a day and I will educate him about real living and real life.</p>

          <p eId="para_978">I am beginning to doubt myself, but am I correct in saying there is no increase in the levy? Okay. That is the first thing to correct, that there is no proposal to increase the levy. What we are doing here is putting the climate action fund, which is already in place on an administrative basis, onto a statutory basis. Then we are extending the remit of the fund to use that money better and for more projects. The 3 cent is exactly what is there at the moment and we are now putting that on a statutory footing and taking it away from the power of the Minister to increase or decrease it. Is it the case that it can only be changed by legislation? Okay.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">I welcome that it is going on a statutory footing. Like other Members I ask for clarification about what happens to the money that is held by NORA, because this Bill is not retrospective.</p>
          <p eId="para_980"> My ears are ringing so I have to go back to basics to look at this. I come from a city and I represent a constituency that includes what we like to think is a big city. My constituency also contains a rural area. The constant pushing of a divide between the rural and the urban is unhelpful. It is not going to help us to meet our climate change challenges. There is of course an obligation on both sides. There is an obligation on speakers to stand up for rural areas which I agree have been neglected. There is a lot of hypocrisy regarding the development of sustainable regional and rural areas and we really have to learn to make our words mean something. We have no choice but to face our obligations in combating climate change. The fact that we are a small country does not make a difference; it is time to show leadership on that. Our footprint is of course much bigger than that of the poorer countries which will suffer the most. I do not have time to go into how we have declared a climate and biodiversity emergency. We have to take action and that is it.</p>
          <p eId="para_981"> As I said, I welcome that this is going on a statutory footing. I share Deputy Bríd Smith's concerns about the levy. If we are really serious about tackling climate change then that levy should be reducing because there should be less and less fuel being used. We are reliant on €500 million - €50 million a year for ten years - and that is not sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_982"> I despair that we are sending out a message on a daily basis that people should avoid public transport. I used public transport for the last four years and I am now back to driving a car because there are no buses running for me from Galway. The train service is not convenient as far as the timing of the Dáil is concerned. I make no complaint. I simply wonder how we are going to recover from the message that is being sent out on a daily business that people should not use public transport. This is at a time when we should be building up our capacity, encouraging, facilitating and making it much easier for people to use public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_983"> I thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service again for its very detailed digest and the work that has gone into it. On the final page of the digest, there is a quote from the Irish Petroleum Industry Association, IPIA, that is of great concern. The IPIA, which represents 95% of Irish oil industry companies, did not want this to happen. I found myself in agreement with the previous Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, when he rejected the IPIA's criticism. The IPIA did not want this to happen. It wanted the money and the surplus to support oil users in the transition to low-carbon alternative fuels. Last year, the then Minister said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_984">The IPIA suggest that the NORA surplus could be used to create a fund to support current users of oil based fuels to transition to low carbon alternatives. That is exactly what the government is doing through the establishment of the Climate Action Fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">I welcome that. It is very good, but I have a difficulty. I am looking forward to the next round, which I gather has not been done yet. I think the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, mentioned in his speech that a committee will be set up. Perhaps it has been set up. If so, how representative will it be? What regional balance will be on it? Ultimately we want to sell this to all of our citizens and residents. I would love to see an emphasis on communities in Galway, in Connemara and in the rural areas of south Mayo to show what we are doing with this money and put it back into renewable energy as well as many other ideas that I will not go into.</p>
          <p eId="para_986"> The shouting about this issue prior to now has impacted on me. I want to use that, because it is a never-ending narrative that is not helpful to us in this House. We need to start acting responsibly and taking actions together. I have made the point repeatedly that we can only do that if we make language mean something. Theoretically we have a wonderful fund here at the moment, notwithstanding my reservations about what it is based on. How do we use that to the maximum effect to show people that they can benefit from the levy on fossil fuels? We should do it in the most transparent way possible and with proper advice from a committee that properly represents most people.</p>
          <p eId="para_987"> As I have said, I would prefer it if this were an interactive session because I wanted to ask a few questions on the Bill and to get some things confirmed. It is welcome that in governance terms, NORA comes under the Comptroller and Auditor General on a statutory basis and that the provisions of the legislation allow for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_988"> My final question is on Irish Water. It is also included here regarding getting advice and services from the NTMA which I welcome. At what stage is Irish Water going to come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts? Perhaps the Minister of State might address that in his closing speech. It is absolutely vital that there be public oversight of Irish Water. It will have oversight of NORA, as it has over all public bodies, and it is time for Irish Water to come under scrutiny.</p>

          <p eId="para_990">I will try to give a quick summary of some of the points that have been raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_991"> The comments of Deputy Connolly in particular are most welcome. I wholeheartedly agree with her. This fund will be driven largely by communities, it is very much open-ended and it will range from small community grants of €5,000 up to large-scale projects. That is what is innovative and unique about this approach. We certainly do not want the narrative that it is anti-rural or that there is an urban-rural divide. I disagree wholeheartedly with some previous comments that this is anti-rural. It is, if anything, the opposite. It is going to support rural communities to enable them to make the transition to low carbon. It certainly is a reducing levy. If it is effective, it will be tested by the reduction in the revenue coming from the oil industry over time. The NORA fund will reduce if it is working well as we decarbonise our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_992"> Comments were made about the levy increasing. There is no increase - it is a fixed 2 cent levy. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said that this is the start of it, and it is. It is the start of a revolution in this country. It has been recognised as such and as a very innovative fund. It is about the rehabilitation of bogs. Deputy Whitmore mentioned nature-based solutions and that is what this fund will support as well. We certainly have no place for Shannon LNG and the importation of fracked gas into the country, or for oil and gas exploration to be continued. We have to keep it in the ground and this fund will support that.</p>
          <p eId="para_993"> I welcome the comments made by Deputies and the work done by the former Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, in initiating this Bill. I will not say any more. Some of the more detailed questions that have been put to us will be teased out on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_994"> In conclusion I want to say that the Government's aim is to enact this Bill quickly. While it is quite short, it serves two very important purposes. It establishes the climate action fund on a statutory basis and provides for the use of the NORA levy fund to finance it. Therefore, it is an important vehicle to support the State in achieving the overarching need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while at the same time providing support for projects that will make a real impact on our economic recovery over the next few years. These projects will span urban and rural settings, public transport and biodiversity. All of those projects will be considered in this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">The projects supported by the fund will be sustainable and innovative. It will upskill our workforce through apprenticeship programmes and the green economy and provide real benefits to communities in every region of the State.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_997">That Dáil Éireann:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_998">recognises:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_999">— the structural problem of low pay in the Irish economy, resulting in many people living on the breadline, denying them the opportunity of a decent standard of living;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1000">— the precarious nature of many jobs, resulting in many workers being underemployed and dependent on welfare support;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1001">— the lack of entitlement to basic protections such as sick pay and statutory leave for many workers;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1002">— the increasing casualisation of work, with uncertainty about hours and days of work;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1003">— the absence of the right to collective bargaining and representation in the workplace;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1004">— the recent High Court decision to strike down a sectoral employment order, leaving many workers unprotected, and while the Government intends to appeal this judgement, the ultimate need for legislation; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1005">— the need for a clear pathway to the living wage;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1006">acknowledges:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1007">— that since the emergence of the Covid-19 crisis, there is an even more urgent need to recognise the valuable contribution to our State of the large number of essential workers who are in lower paid and precarious jobs;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1008">— the exceptional efforts of such workers involved in our food production and supermarkets, care assistants, those who collected our waste throughout the crisis and those who provided support services to our frontline healthcare workers to enable them to carry out their duties in conditions that were sanitary and safe, amongst many others; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1009">— that the Irish State owes a debt of gratitude to its workers, particularly those on low pay and in insecure work; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1010">resolves:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1011">— to ensure an enhanced focus within Government on creating good jobs and protecting workers’ rights;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1012">— that access to jobs, where workers have a voice that provides a level of autonomy, a decent income, security of tenure, satisfying work in the right quantities and decent working conditions, should be integral to public policy given how this contributes to better health and well-being by tackling inequalities, building self-efficacy and combating poverty; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1013">— to establish a task force to give effect to this Resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">Allow me to begin with a simple truth: a state should never have to afford standard rights to its citizens as a form of thanks. This is not the intention of the motion we have tabled. My colleagues in the Social Democrats and I will speak about a contribution made by some of our most vulnerable workers that is unquantifiable. We will speak of a debt that remains unpaid. That contribution from our workers and the debt the State owes them for the manner in which their labour has been undervalued was prevalent in our society long before Covid-19. We hope and expect the motion we have tabled will give Deputies throughout the Chamber the opportunity to turn words into action, give substance to the applause and take meaningful action that will improve the pay and conditions of workers, which is the end point of the appreciation that has been expressed over recent months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015"> At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic and in the midst of our national lockdown, I stood in the Dáil and thanked front-line workers, many of them in low paid and precarious employment, for risking their lives and health to keep our society and economy going. These workers are all over Ireland, in every one of our constituencies. They have been essential in ensuring our food production lines remained operational and our supermarkets remained open. They collected their wages throughout the crisis and ensured our hospitals were clean and our essential workers could carry out their duties in conditions that were sanitary and safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016"> My words are similar to those of many other Deputies who stood in the House during the first weeks of the new Dáil, many of whom find themselves in government now. Together we promised that when the opportunity came, we would offer more than thanks. Today is the first opportunity we have to live up to this promise. This is a chance to ensure an enhanced focus in government on creating good jobs and enhancing workers' rights. We can recognise that access to jobs where workers have a voice and to jobs that provide a level of autonomy, a decent income, security of employment and decent working conditions are an integral part of public policy, given how they contribute to better health and well-being and tackle inequalities, build self-efficacy and combat poverty. We have sought to be constructive in the motion to achieve this aim. I hope the wording as originally presented will look familiar. The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, will recognise it as being almost identical to that which was part of the New Decade, New Approach agreement that restored devolved Government in the North of Ireland and was approved by the previous Government in January.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017"> Our request in this regard is very modest. We accept that the Social Democrats and Fine Gael view the world with a very different gaze and have sought to meet Fine Gael at its level, because the advancement of better workers' rights is all we seek in the motion. We ask that workers in the Republic be afforded the same recognition and promised protections as those in the North. We thought that while we can disagree on many issues that pertain to Government spending and taxation, the advancement of workers' protections during these unparalleled times could be a point of unity throughout the Chamber. However, the Government's needless amendment has clearly sought to deny even these modest gains.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018"> Establishing a task force to give effect to this resolution and to propose concrete actions is essential given how weak the programme for Government is on workers' rights and how silent it is on the issue of collective bargaining. According to the document, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party have absolutely nothing to say about trade union rights, workplace representation and collective bargaining. The section in the programme for Government on a better work-life balance contains a measly two sentences comprising only 30 words, which in themselves are vague and non-committal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019"> The Minister of State's amendment has purposely sought to remove any reference to collective bargaining, workers' protections and workplace representation so as to completely undermine the spirit of the motion and leave behind something that is self-serving and meaningless. This is in keeping with Fine Gael's market force <i>laissez-faire</i> approach to workers' rights that we have witnessed over the past nine years of Government, which has been to the detriment of our lowest paid workers. This is not the change that Fianna Fáil and the Green Party promised the electorate in February. If the Green Party will not take a stand for workers so that environmental justice can truly go hand in hand with social justice and a just transition for our workers then what is the use? If Fianna Fáil is not going to be a more socially conscious worker friendly version of Fine Gael in government then who exactly does it intend to be?</p>
          <p eId="para_1020"> Recent research by Oxfam indicates that Ireland has the fifth largest number of billionaires <i>per capita</i> in the world. Ireland has the second highest incidence of low pay in the EU, affecting 23% of our workers in 2019. In further contrast, last year also saw Ireland registered the highest GDP in the Union for the third year in a row. This is directly connected to the fact that only 32% of employees in Ireland are covered by a collective agreement. This drops by almost half when considering only workers in the private sector. This is compared to an average in our EU peer group of 76%, with 78% in the Netherlands, 90% in Sweden and Finland and more than 95% in Austria, Belgium and France.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021"> This is not simply a moral issue; it is an economic one. There is a very strong correlation between countries with higher trade union density and levels of collective bargaining coverage and countries with lower levels of income inequality. Labour's share of income has been falling in most of the western world in recent decades and this phenomenon is particularly prevalent in Ireland. This means those on lower and middle incomes, those who tend to spend a much higher percentage of their incomes and, in turn, boost our local economies have much less money to spend. Collective bargaining, therefore, does not damage our economic competitiveness but enhances it. Ireland is ranked 24th in the global competitive index, lagging behind those aforementioned countries with much higher levels of collective bargaining, including Austria, Belgium, France, Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland, despite those countries often also having premiers who consider themselves to be radical centrists. Ireland is unusual in the European context in that employers are not legally obliged to engage with trade unions to negotiate pay agreements or other conditions of employment. This explains much of our lower level of collective bargaining coverage. We are simply way out of line with EU norms in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022"> It is an undeniable fact that the State owes a debt of gratitude to its workers, particularly those in low paid and insecure work. However, let us be very clear that while Covid-19 has made this invisible work visible, this does not mean the work did not exist before Covid-19; it was merely that those in power placed little value on it. Those who work in low pay and precarious work, among whom women, migrants and younger workers are over represented, have always done the most crucial work to keep our economy and society thriving. They have always received the least recognition for it. Although this recognition changed somewhat during Covid, the pay and conditions of workers did not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023"> Despite increases in the national minimum wage in recent years, it is wholly inadequate and, currently, it is 18% less than a living wage. We have an opportunity to turn this around, starting tonight, and to turn our claps for these workers into secure jobs with at least the security of a minimum wage and access to collective bargaining rights. There is a structural problem with low pay in the economy, resulting in many people who work living in poverty or working multiple jobs to give themselves and their families a decent standard of living.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">We have a shameful situation where too many workers are in precarious work or underemployment and dependent on welfare support. For many women working part-time due to childcare costs or care responsibilities, the work simply does not pay and is a major contributing factor to increasing child and family poverty. In many sectors there is a lack of entitlement to basic protections such as sick pay and statutory leave and an increasing casualisation of work, with uncertainty about hours and days of work. </p>
          <p eId="para_1025"> A task force is critical because of the interlocking and reinforcing nature of these individual issues. For example, if a living wage were to be introduced overnight, if an employee is on a precarious contract his or her hours will just be cut. We know this. It is for this reason that a task force must look at a holistic approach to examine the issues as a whole and institute a suite of measures to ensure that workers are paid well in secure jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026"> We must also acknowledge the gender implications of low pay. The majority of those in low-paid and precarious work are women, and the motion would be an important measure in going some way to help to close the gender pay gap. In the midst of the critical Black Lives Matter movement we should also acknowledge the critical role played by migrant workers in keeping our economy going, again often in insecure and underpaid work. It is critical that alongside the trade unions and employers on the task force we envisage, there would also be women's groups, migrants' groups and representatives from civic society. All should be around the table to discuss how we can improve the lives of our workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027"> It is time to turn a collapse into action. This is a chance for the Government parties to show that their failure to make substantial commitments on progressing workplace protections and collective bargaining in the programme for Government was simply an oversight and that this Government will not adopt the same old approach when it comes to workers' rights.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1028">I wish to reiterate the point made by Deputy Gannon, that the actions we are seeking on foot of this motion are exceptionally modest, as part of the New Decade, New Approach agreement in Northern Ireland. We remember that agreement in January very well. I am sure the Minister of State remembers it. It was just before the general election was called and it got the institutions back up and running. The agreement was signed by the previous Government as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement. The last Government committed to focus on creating good jobs and protecting workers' rights. This motion calls on the Government to demonstrate the same commitment to workers' rights in the Republic as was signed up to in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029"> Yesterday, the Tánaiste said to me in response to a question that there is no crystal ball to show how long the Covid-19 pandemic will continue or its long-term effects. Of course, that is true. However, while we might not be able to see the future we should not allow ourselves to forget the very recent past. We must aim to recover in a way in which we have learned lessons from the past. There are obvious structural weaknesses in the way work has been developing in a precarious way, whereby people cannot make decisions for themselves because they are never sure of their income.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030"> The Covid-19 crisis has had a devastating impact on public health and the wider economy. The ongoing pandemic has amplified and shone a light on the many issues affecting workers in this country. Throughout the pandemic every Member of the House has given praise to workers and especially to low-paid and precarious workers, such as the people who deliver the food to our supermarkets, who stock the shelves and who we meet at the check-outs. People refocused what they saw as being essential. However, it cannot be enough just to acknowledge that and to thank and congratulate people. Those workers cannot live on our platitudes. We owe them a debt of gratitude and we must deliver real and practical solutions to vindicate their rights. That has to be the legacy from this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031"> When the Covid-19 crisis passes, employers in both the private and public sectors will be judged on how they treated the most vulnerable workers during these unprecedented times. This Dáil has an equal responsibility to ensure that workers' rights and conditions are enshrined in law and have full statutory backing. The latest Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, statistics show that 23% of the Irish workforce are low paid. That is the third highest in the European Union. Moreover, a 2018 report from the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, found that 44% of the workforce was in precarious employment. Most of them were at an increased risk of poverty. They have no guarantee of hours or income, no sick pay, no annual leave and no pension entitlements. We saw a report published today on the pension time bomb. I wonder to what extent the precarious nature of employment has been built into that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032"> This is bad enough in and of itself, but we must consider the knock-on effects it has on workers' lives. They do not have the security to aspire to buying a house, for example. Often they postpone things like forming a family. Even where somebody has a well-paid job in contractual employment, something like a mortgage can be out of reach. It is not just impacting on their weekly wage and conditions but also on their quality of life and the choices they can make. In a country as wealthy as ours, this is unacceptable. Moreover, it is uneconomical. At the end of last year, 108,400 part-time workers were categorised as underemployed. According to EUROSTAT projections the chances of an Irish part-time worker transitioning to full-time employment in 2017 was as low as 3%, the lowest in the EU countries that were surveyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033"> This is a huge resource of skills, talents and human potential that we are allowing to be wasted because we remain wedded to an out-of-date, outmoded model of employment that, frankly, belonged to the middle of the last century. It was not fit for purpose before the pandemic and it certainly is not fit for purpose afterwards. Until we take decisive action, and it will not happen by accident, there will continue to be inequality and shameful poverty rates. One in five children lives in poverty. One in six people who are employed lives below the poverty line.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034"> None of that is acceptable, yet the Government has proposed an amendment to the motion that strips out all the practical actions that need to be taken and will make a difference. It is particularly telling that the amendment removes all references to workers' rights and collective bargaining. This is an area in which this country is distinctly lacking. We are the only EU member state in western Europe that does not have binding collective bargaining legislation. It is very troubling to see the Government take this tack especially when we are seeing the erosion of workers' rights. Obviously, we must rebuild differently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035"> In the last few weeks I have received a number of messages from workers who are finding themselves under pressure to reduce their pay and conditions to facilitate their employers. It is really a David and Goliath fight. We have seen that with the Debenhams workers outside the House today. We see how unprotected they are. We saw it a few weeks ago with CityJet. Essentially, our examinership process is working to the advantage of the parent company in the Cayman Islands at the expense of the employees here. Indeed, we will end up with a shell company here with very little employment. The Instant UpRight workers comprise another group. They are seeing their jobs outsourced to China and Latvia. Even in the shopping malls one sees places that are not open and will not open. Much of what was heretofore direct employment in this country is disappearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">There needs to be a significant focus on job retention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037"> The workers in this country deserve far greater ambition. We must strive for our country not just to recover from the economic impact of the pandemic but to recover as a better country than when we went into it. We need to see good-quality jobs in which workers have a voice and a level of autonomy, a guarantee of a decent income, security of tenure and decent working conditions as the bare minimum every citizen in this country should be entitled to expect. This will require a clear roadmap and legislative plan. The task force we are proposing certainly would not be a panacea but would at least move the focus of attention in the right direction. We need wide-ranging structural changes. What we need is a tangible pathway to deliver something better. We do not want to be here in two or three years' time talking about the continued precarious nature of work. Anyone who looks at those who are impacted will find that young people, who are talked about as being the group we need to be most concerned about in the future, are the most likely to be in the most precarious of jobs. According to a recent survey, they take up those jobs because, they say, they do not have any other option.</p>

          <p eId="para_1038">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this very important debate and I thank the Social Democrats for tabling the motion. It gives us an opportunity to debate where we are going with workers' rights and sustainable employment. I, too, acknowledge the essential work that has been carried out by so many different workers in the public and private sectors during the Covid-19 public health emergency: our front-line healthcare workers, the people who work in our supermarkets, our home carers, people working throughout retail, people who collect our refuse and so many more. I thank those workers for their continued efforts. They have carried us through these very challenging times, made so many people feel safe and done so much for so many people. It is also important we acknowledge all workers who have made the necessary adjustments this health emergency has required. I know that remote working has imposed its own challenges through these difficult and continuously changing times. We are all learning and doing our best to stop the spread of the virus. I thank those people also. The time for adjustment is not over. We must continue to balance public health concerns with economic and social challenges. Collectively, we have a responsibility to work together to address those challenges and the other challenges facing our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039"> It is for this reason that my party signed up to the programme for Government and to participate in government in order that we can influence change. Within the programme for Government there is a commitment to progressing a living wage over the lifetime of the Government. There is, however, an immediate challenge this year and next year for sectors such as hospitality, retail and tourism, where much of the low-paid employment is apparent. Anyone who walks through the streets of Dublin or any provincial town will see, unfortunately, that many people in these sectors are still not working. It was in this context that the previous Government introduced the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the temporary wage subsidy, to ensure that people who had been working on the lowest incomes were protected during this pandemic. Our priority as a Government must be, in the short and medium term, to get these people back to work and restore employment. That is why next week's job stimulus is so important, to ensure that measures are introduced to support business to bring people back from unemployment and into employment. That is why this week the Cabinet approved a credit guarantee scheme and next week we will see improvement to the restart grant and a commitment to extend the wage subsidy in order that people can have confidence that their jobs will be protected into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040"> The intention of the Government is to restore employment, and as we work towards that we will move towards realising the ambition of a living wage. This will require cross-party support, and I welcome suggestions on how this can be achieved. The living wage is an estimate made by a number of NGOs, civil society groups and academics doing research in this area. It is based on research identifying the income required for the minimum essential standard of living for a single adult household in Ireland. This research is conducted by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice. The programme for Government is committed to a move to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041"> In this context it is important that Ireland's statutory minimum wage and the living wage concept are not conflated. The living wage is a voluntary societal initiative centred on a social, business and economic case to ensure that, wherever it can be afforded, employers will provide a rate of pay that provides an income that is sufficient to meet individuals' basic needs, such as housing, food, clothing, transport and healthcare. It is for this reason that we are addressing the costs of childcare and housing and making affordable housing a key priority of the Government. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is already out making the case for the provision of affordable housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042"> The national minimum wage has a legislative basis and confers a statutory entitlement on employees and a statutory obligation on employers. The national minimum wage is a legally binding lowest average hourly rate that can be paid by an employer to an employee. The rate is set and governed by the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, which applies to all employees, including full-time, part-time, temporary and casual employees, with some exceptions. Legislation on the setting of the national minimum wage has existed since 2000. The Low Pay Commission was established in 2015 and its primary function is, annually, to examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage with a view to providing for adjustments which do not negatively impact jobs or competitiveness. The commission takes an evidence-based approach to its recommendations, having regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels. Since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission, the Government has accepted all recommendations it has made for the national minimum wage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043"> The national minimum wage approach seeks to find a balance between a fair and sustainable rate for low-paid workers and one that will not have significant negative consequences for employers and competitiveness. It has to be a pragmatic approach, providing a clearly defined minimum hourly rate for employers, giving them the freedom to pay higher rates while providing a measure of security for low-paid workers. As it is legally enforceable, it provides protection for workers. More broadly, the setting of wages is a matter between employers and employees, which takes place in the context of the market, and the Government does not interfere unduly in the process. There is widespread evidence that shows that a minimum wage is a blunt tool for reducing poverty as many minimum wage earners are sometimes located in households higher in the income distribution. This was found in the ESRI's report on the impact of the minimum wage on household income distribution. Therefore, it is integral that other work supports are in place for low-income families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044"> We should have learned from recent months, however, and we have learned through striving together against something that threatens all of us that we can work together to shape our common future. All the economic initiatives must be centred on employment, retaining existing jobs, creating new jobs and providing a strong focus on quality employment with good terms and conditions and a work-life balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">The Government is asserting its ambition to meet these challenges, repair the damage that has been inflicted by the pandemic and take renewed spirit arising from these challenging times and translate it into action - action that can deliver a better quality of life for everybody, equality within society and a deeper sense of connection to the natural world around us and to each other. That is the most effective response to concerns about poverty and inequality. It is the best way to provide more and better opportunities for all our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046"> The Government supports an approach to the minimum wage which seeks to find a balance between a fair and sustainable rate of pay for low-paid workers and one that will not have significant consequences for employers and competitiveness. The Government will continue to be guided by the evidence-based recommendations from the Low Pay Commission when considering changes to the national minimum wage. The Programme for Government: Our Shared Future, in its commitment to valuing those in low-paid employment, includes a commitment to progress to a living wage over the lifetime of this Government and this important work will commence shortly. The best antidote to poverty and inequality is to focus on employment, ensuring people have access to jobs and that those jobs are of good quality with a strong social insurance safety net for when it is needed. Before we make greater strides for the benefit of our workforce, our initial and unrelenting focus must be on getting people back to work and preserving and protecting people in precarious situations at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047"> I am confident we can achieve a better life for all. We must take the good things we have learned from the pandemic and employ them towards a resilient future. This Government will facilitate and support remote working, reduce the time wasted in our cars and ensure families have more time together. I commend the Government’s countermotion to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#JenniferWhitmore" eId="spk_395">
          <from>Deputy Jennifer Whitmore<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T21:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1048">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Democrats' first Private Members' motion in the new Dáil. I am delighted to be in a position to contribute to the debate as a Social Democrats Deputy for Wicklow. Our motion recognises first and foremost the incredibly important role essential workers in many different sectors have played in giving us the certainty and safety we craved during Covid-19. Be they our local shop assistants, our care assistants, our waste collectors or our takeaway deliverer, they all had to navigate the unpredictable and uncertain nature of working under Covid-19 so that we did not have to. We recognise and acknowledge the valuable contribution these workers make to the fundamental running of our economy. Now that the roadmap to exiting Covid-19 is under way, we need to face a hard truth in this country. We have relied on some of our most precarious and lowest paid workers to keep the country going during this crisis. The fact is that many essential workers are in low-paid and precarious jobs. They lack decent wages, statutory protections and the certainty that most of us take for granted. Praise and gratitude are not enough. Workers deserve a living wage, a decent standard of living, statutory protections and the right to collective bargaining. The State can no longer take advantage of these workers and it is for these workers and their families that we have tabled this motion today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049"> The structural problem of low pay in the economy is also a gendered one. I want to use my time today to focus on this aspect of low pay and workers. According to a 2016 report from the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, 29% of female workers are in low-paid jobs, in comparison to 19% of male workers. Some 46% of these women are the main earner in their household. Who minds one's children when one earns a decent living? Who educates them? Who nurses one's sick, elderly parent or cares for a loved one in a hospital? They are primarily women and they make up a large proportion of the workers who have kept this economy running while we were safe and protected in our homes during lockdown. It is no coincidence that the sectors experiencing chronically low pay are those made up of mostly female workers. Governments past and present have devalued care in this country and have taken advantage of the competing demands in women’s lives. It is no wonder that female workers make up 55% of the workforce earning the national minimum wage or less, with men making up 45%. That is a 10% difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050"> The childcare sector is an example. Early childhood educators are among the lowest paid of all our professional groups. A survey of more than 3,000 childcare workers found that 94% of them cannot make enough money to make ends meet. The average hourly rate for staff in the sector is just €12.55 and 90% of childcare workers question whether they have a future in the sector. These are the people who we rely on to educate, nurture and take care of our children and yet we do not value them enough to pay them a proper wage. </p>
          <p eId="para_1051"> It is not just our children. It is also our elderly and vulnerable. According to CSO figures, women represent 80% of healthcare workers in Ireland. Low pay and difficult working conditions are plaguing the sector, particularly for home care workers. Most private home care assistants are qualified with a minimum of a Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, level 5 qualification. However, the average rate of pay is less than the living wage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052"> These women have children too, families who depend on them for income and support. It is important that we acknowledge the impact low pay has on families because the two are interlinked. Female workers often need the flexibility of hours that comes with low-paid jobs because they simply cannot afford the high childcare costs but flexibility suits the employer more than the worker. The casual nature of the work makes it difficult to unionise and with family in the background the demands on women’s time and energy make them further disadvantaged. To add to the insecurity these women have to deal with, they are at increased risk of poverty with no guarantee of hours or income from week to week, no sick pay, no annual leave and no pension entitlements, leaving them open if circumstances change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053"> Governments past and present have presided over many policies that have consistently left behind women who work in these sectors. It is time to break the cycle of discrimination and establish a task force so we can move forward towards a living wage, enforce more rights for workers with better pay and conditions and include the right to unionise. </p>

          <from>Deputy Holly Cairns<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T21:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1054">I too welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Democrats' first Private Members' motion in the new Dáil. The pandemic has highlighted how undervalued so many of our essential workers are. Like my colleague said, we all owe them a debt of gratitude but gratitude is not just paying lip service. Real gratitude is providing them with fair pay, better conditions and basic rights. Another motivation for putting this motion forward is that by addressing workers’ rights we not only ensure their livelihoods and dignity, we help solve so many other social and economic issues too, from poverty and food insecurity to family health and vulnerability to unregulated loans. </p>
          <p eId="para_1055"> Everyone deserves decent working conditions and to be valued. We know this leads to increased health and well-being and, therefore, increased productivity. It is in everyone’s interest - workers, employees and the State - that people are guaranteed safe, secure and positive professional environments. Dependable income, security of tenure and decent working conditions enable people to put down roots, settle in communities and help those communities to thrive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056"> Covid-19 demonstrated who our essential workers are. They are nurses, carers, cleaners, food producers, postal workers, public transport drivers and so many front-line workers. The wages and working conditions of these groups and others have been eroded over the past generation. Wage cuts, recruitment freezes and subcontracting are becoming established practices. These policies create uncertainty and precarity. They only benefit the few, not the many. Research by Social Justice Ireland based on CSO figures found that in 2018, almost 110,000 people at work fell below the poverty line, as did a further 82,000 people on home duties, such as parents and carers. Their children and dependants are also living in poverty as a result. This is a systematic failure and we should do everything we can to fix it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057"> Today, unfortunately, gender still impacts on wages and conditions. A paper by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service shows that the Irish gender pay gap was 13.9% in 2016. That gap is worse for older women, women from ethnic minorities and higher earners. It estimates that, at the current rate of decline, it would take Ireland another 55 years to close the pay gap. Words fail me.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">The proposals in our motion will help to tackle these issues at source. They focus on the casualisation of labour, the precarious nature of many jobs and the absence of collective bargaining.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059"> Media reports on the clusters of Covid-19 infections in meat plants and the statements given to the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response by witnesses from Migrant Rights Centre Ireland last Friday are a harrowing example of how some workers are treated. Workers have consistently told journalists that they are frightened to talk about conditions in the sector. They have stayed anonymous in media reports for fear of retribution. This paints a shameful picture of the conditions people are working in today. Outbreaks in these factories raise serious health and safety concerns, as do the absence of sick pay for many workers and the subcontracting practices which leave people more vulnerable to exploitative labour conditions. Migrant workers in this sector are at particular risk because their immigration permissions may be tied to their employer, leaving them in an even more precarious and vulnerable position. Language barriers, institutional racism and a lack of social capital exacerbate their circumstances. I have called separately for a review of the meat processing sector. This motion aligns with that objective and with the recommendations by Migrant Rights Centre Ireland regarding worker rights in meat processing plants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060"> Our motion calls for fairness. It proposes a rights-based framework to ensure workers get fair pay and conditions and everyone can live a dignified existence. Precarious employment and the gig economy are increasingly common in different sectors, including healthcare, retail, customer service, deliveries, childcare and universities. We are calling for the introduction of basic safety nets which were taken for granted a generation ago. Basic entitlements, dependable hours, collective bargaining and a decent salary are the minimum workers should expect. Good employers will welcome these requirements. Indeed, they are already practising them. Many small companies and family-run businesses in my constituency of Cork South-West and across Ireland provide these conditions for their employees. This motion will help to create a level playing field, where decent employers will not be undercut by others who place profit above workers' rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061"> We want work to be valued. We believe everyone should have access to basic conditions and entitlements which reward good work. When those conditions are in place, employers benefit, the State benefits and families benefit. We all benefit. I am asking my colleagues from all parties to support our motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_1062">I thank the Social Democrats for bringing forward this important motion. It is a very broad motion but it has sparked a very necessary conversation. When the Fianna Fáil Minister of State, Deputy Troy, took us through the greatest hits of the minimum wage, he left out a very important part, which is that the last time Fianna Fáil and the Green Party were in government together, they cut the minimum wage. When their backs were to the wall, as they would say, the first people thrown under the bus were low-paid workers. It is important that those parties which have any concern for workers' rights use their time in the Dáil Chamber to ensure we put those rights front and centre. We cannot have enough conversations, let alone too many, about the need for workers' rights to be protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063"> I will focus my remarks on three specific issues referred to in the motion, namely, tactical insolvency, precarious employment and the striking down of sectoral employment orders. We know that the practice of tactical insolvency is happening. The Tánaiste and I discussed it in the Chamber earlier this week. Large companies with access to resources can use loopholes in the law to evade their responsibilities and treat their workers disgracefully. They have been doing this for quite a while. We only have to look at the litany of company closures, which include TalkTalk, Clerys, the Paris Bakery and La Senza, to see the evidence of it. Every single time this happened, the Government said it needed to do something to ensure it could not happen again. It is happening again with Debenhams. The good news is that Sinn Féin has already drawn up legislation to tackle this issue. That legislation, which we introduced during the last Dáil, was described by Fianna Fáil as worthy of support and was not opposed by Fine Gael. Our Bill is ready to go and I have sought leave to introduce it. I will be asking all parties to support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064"> What is happening to the Debenhams workers is an absolute disgrace and it is not good enough for us simply to say that we need to make sure it does not happen again. It keeps happening because successive Governments facilitate it. It keeps happening because successive Governments have shrugged their shoulders, said we should do something about it but not actually followed up on it. The workers who find themselves in this situation deserve a bit more respect than that. As I said, the Bill we brought forward was not opposed. We must resolve to make sure it passes all Stages in this Dáil as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065"> I have said on the record of the Dáil that precarious employment destroys families and wrecks people's lives. People in precarious work never know from the end of one week to the start of the next whether they will be working, what hours they will be working, how much they will earn, how much childcare they will need and whether they will need transport to and from work. That situation destroys people's lives. The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, referred to the need for a work-life balance. It is hard not to laugh at that. For people in precarious employment, work-life balance is not even a pipe dream. They cannot even imagine what that would be like. We know there are hundreds of thousands of workers on these types of contracts but, yet again, the Government is shrugging it shoulders and nothing is being done about it. What these workers need is action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066"> I raised the issue of the striking down of sectoral employment orders with the Minister of State, Deputy English, last Tuesday in the Dáil. There is a very real need for action to be taken on this matter but the response from the Tánaiste when it was put to him was very telling. When I told him that action needed to be taken, he reminded me, although I did not need any reminding, that the workers who would ordinarily have been covered by the orders, who will turn up for work tomorrow or the next day or change employment, have the benefit of the National Minimum Wage Act. None of us in this House works for the minimum wage. I am sure that very few family members of the Minister of State, Deputy English, work for the minimum wage. For the Tánaiste to say that those workers have the benefit of the minimum wage legislation is to say they are entitled to the absolute minimum. This evening we have had a Fianna Fáil Minister of State come in here and eulogise the minimum wage. Workers deserve more than this. The minimum wage is a floor, not a target. The way Government members talk about it, one would think people were living it large on the minimum wage. They absolutely are not living it large, because the cost of living is out of control.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067"> Workers need to know who is on their side, who will stand up for them and who has their back. This evening, every Deputy from every party, regardless of their previous record in or out of government, has an opportunity to stand with workers. I am proud to say that Sinn Féin will be supporting the motion. I commend the Social Democrats on bringing it forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_1068">I welcome this motion in support of workers' rights. The Covid crisis has brought many employment rights issues to the fore. In May, 176 job losses were announced at National Pen's European headquarters in Dundalk. This was a huge blow to the workers and their families. Some of those workers came to me and told me of similar positions being advertised by National Pen in Tunisia two days before they were told about the lay-offs. I brought this issue to the company and the job advertisements were taken down from one website and put on another. During the negotiations with management, workers were refused union representation or to have third parties with negotiations experience speak on their behalf. The workers were given training for the negotiations but that is hardly best industrial practice. In fact, it is outrageous. Union representation and collective bargaining are fundamental rights but the situation of the National Pen workers, like that of many other workers, flies in the face of best practice across the EU and is in defiance of a number of Labour Court recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069"> Many good employers have absolutely no difficulty with meeting the conditions I am talking about. However, the continuation of a situation where employers can pick and choose who to deal with is totally unacceptable, particularly when we are talking about the legal rights of employees. It is a farce to have people who may not have experience in human resources, employment law or negotiations facing off against globally experienced management teams. What makes it worse is that some of these firms have received huge benefit via state aid and grants. National Pen has received €1.5 million in grants since 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">We need Government action to protect our workers and families. These are the people who work in this economy and maintain and sustain it. These are the people who maintain and sustain this very society. We cannot have no Government action, or have cases where the Government stands not with National Pen and Debenhams workers but with Apple. We need people to make absolutely sure that we have a Government that protects their basic rights. What we need to offer people is decent, secure work and protections.

          <p eId="para_1071">I thank the Social Democrats for bringing forward this motion. In the short time available to me I will address comments made about the living wage. In the previous Dáil, I brought forward a Sinn Féin motion to introduce a living wage of €12.30, which was passed. The Minister of State referred earlier to the Government's commitment to delivering a living wage during the course of this Dáil term and he spoke about the minimum wage in terms which sent a chill through my spine. I was deeply concerned by his emphasis on the Low Pay Commission delivering a living wage. I do not believe that will happen over the course of this Government because the Government will hide behind the Low Pay Commission and go with whatever it comes up with. The commission has form in this. In 2016, it proposed an increase in the minimum wage of 50 cent, of 20 cent in 2017, 30 cent in 2018 and 25 cent in 2019. It was not moving forward when the economy was booming.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072"> A living wage is important and we need to make the distinction between it and a minimum wage. A living wage is one where people can actually go to work and live decently. It is based on the price of rent, travel and childcare. We are aware that we cannot move straight to a living wage, but the commitment the Government set out earlier deeply disturbs me because it is going to hide behind the Low Pay Commission. The Government is not interested in a living wage and we will be back here at the end of this term when it has not moved forward in any way to a living wage, having hidden behind the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073"> During the height of the pandemic, when certainty was a rare commodity and worry was prevalent, our health professionals sacrificed and suffered to keep us safe. However, they were not the only ones stepping into the bearna baol. Cleaners, porters and many others stood up with them, far too many of them on a low wage. The pandemic has shown the need for a living wage, and workers' protection has never been more important. We must honour the risks they have taken and ensure all workers are given a decent wage.</p>

          <p eId="para_1074">I support this motion on workers' rights. In particular, I support a living wage, the right to unionise and the right to collective bargaining, which is being denied to so many. Today, Debenhams workers held a protest outside this building to highlight the mistreatment and abuse they have received from the Debenhams UK company. These workers are only looking for fairness, their entitlements and fair redundancy. I am proud of them because what they are doing is standing up for all workers in this country who are in the same position. A number of years ago, we had similar issues in Cork with companies like Vita Cortex and Coca-Cola, and workers had to have sit-ins and protests for months before they finally got a fair redundancy package. If the Debenhams workers have to do the same, they are right to do so because, at the end of the day, this is all about fairness and justice. Low-paid workers in this country kept the country going during the pandemic. I have asked the Minister in both this Government and the previous one what we have done to show them our gratitude. When this country was at its most vulnerable, these people stood up and went out to keep the country, shops, supermarket and hospitals going. It is about time we recognised this effort and respected them for the work they have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075"> During the pandemic I was contacted by a number of people who are 65 years of age and who were retired through letters and notifications. That is wrong. People have an entitlement to work if they wish and they should not just be let go with a piece of paper that says "thank you but goodbye". We need to ensure people have that right to work if they wish to do so. When workers in this country look for justice, they get the law and the law is against workers and for big business.</p>

          <p eId="para_1076">Nine years ago, the workers of Vita Cortex in the south side of Cork city sat in for 160 days to try to get the pay and redundancy to which they were entitled. At the time, they were visited by many public figures, maithe agus mór uaisle, including the current Taoiseach, who gave them very strong support, vocally if not practically. We are now in the same situation nine years on in that workers who are made redundant due to insolvency are way at the back of the queue. The language might refer to preferential treatment and so on but the reality is very different. In that time there have been numerous other similar cases, such as Game and La Senza, and now we have Debenhams as well. The Duffy Cahill report was also published in that time but its recommendations have not been progressed. We urgently need legislation on this. Workers are often left without any answers, poor communication and are denied their pay and entitlements. That should not be the case. It is a brutal way of treating workers and the Government has to address it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077"> There are those who believe, including unfortunately some on the left, that the objective is to give people the opportunity to get whatever employment they can over the course of years or generations and achieve social mobility. That is not the objective. While it can be part of it, the objective should be for everyone in any job to be able to live a secure, fulfilling life and to be able to pay for whatever they need and have that security. Crucial to that is ensuring that every worker has decent pay, and the greatest guarantee of decent pay is joining a union. Our unions are not perfect and I have had many disagreements with them, but the fact is that union workers are better paid and better protected. I urge anyone listening and people generally to join a union. Our legislation needs to be resolved. It is unacceptable that employers have the option to just disregard a well-organised, legally constituted union, set it aside and force it out the door. That needs to be fixed. We are an outlier in Europe on this matter. We need legislation on collective bargaining.</p>

          <p eId="para_1078">It is clear that we are facing massive problems as regards the underemployed or the working poor. Many workers have contacted my office to say they are now working similar or increased hours but with no increase in pay, meaning their income in real terms has taken a serious hit even with the assistance of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS. Some employers have been unable or unwilling to top up the TWSS and there is also a problem with it in that it does not allow employers to pay more than the top-up payment. If they do that, the payment is scaled back until the employee is deemed to have come off it and appeals to Revenue have fallen on deaf ears. Seasonal workers, who already have few or no rights, were also shut out of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and full supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079"> The Government's amendment emphasises job creation and retention, but too often workers are asked to carry an unfair share of the burden to keep businesses open. We must implement a living wage to ensure people do not dip below the poverty line through poor pay. It is something Sinn Féin has consistently called for and it is only right and proper that it be recommended by any task force. It is telling that the Government amendment expresses gratitude to workers. Retail workers in particular have been the unsung heroes of this pandemic, but they often survive on low pay and poor conditions. The legacy of the pandemic must be the improvement of their material conditions and the defence of collective bargaining rights and workers' protection. Before I was elected, almost every time I met with a client who had a work difficulty, that person had no workplace representation. This continues in Kerry with McCauley Chemists laying people off and refusing to recognise the union.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">Workers have also been treated very poorly by Debenhams and Mothercare. This must change and now is the time to do it. Taking action would be appropriate as this is the weekend on which the Tolpuddle Martyrs are usually commemorated. Their struggle was the beginning of most union rights. Much has been said about the judicial decision on sectoral employment rights. Those workers have been left vulnerable and the ultimate protection will be strong legislation in this area and not just an appeal. As legislators, we must face up to this responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081"> I am interested in the possibility of remote working for people in Kerry and other rural areas, but affordable and reliable broadband is sadly lacking and the technical support from all companies, including Eir and Vodafone, is shockingly bad. A person could be left waiting half an hour. It is interesting that the Tánaiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation has been tweeting from his home while looking at his new monitor. I invite him, however, to try to do a video call from Gneevegullia or Caherdaniel and see how that works out for him.</p>

          <p eId="para_1082">I welcome this motion put forward by the Social Democrats. It speaks to the reality faced by many and highlights the fundamental inequality that exists between those on higher incomes and the majority of people who are just about existing and getting by on low incomes. The reality for too many people in employment is that they are earning barely enough to exist and many are living from wage packet to wage packet. Many have no safety net of savings or have insufficient income to deal with an unforeseen problem such as a domestic appliance breaking down and needing repair. Many families also do not have sufficient income to be able to set aside a portion to cope with any emergencies that might arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083"> These are the realities of the financial pressures faced by many people in Ireland as they live day to day and week to week, according to what is in their wage packets and the bills they have to pay. Many are struggling to pay rent or mortgages and, before the lockdown, to pay the cost of childcare, which was often beyond the means of many parents. Such financial stresses can lead people into a spiral of debt and poverty. A proper living wage would go some way to address such inequalities in society. Sinn Féin has always advocated a living wage so that families can at least have a minimum standard of living. We have called for legislation on a national living wage to be enacted in order to ensure that workers receive proper remuneration for their labour and are given a proper living wage that would relieve the financial stresses and exploitation that many face daily.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084"> Any proposals for the recovery of the economy should not involve regressive measures such as the exploitation of workers through low pay and contracts that lead to financial and social insecurity. In the past, we have seen how those most impacted upon by measures supposedly for the recovery of the economy have been the lowest paid and the most vulnerable in society. The burden of these recovery measures in the past fell disproportionately on those in society who are least able to shoulder it. This must not be allowed to happen again. From an economic point of view, a living wage will ultimately benefit the economy in the context of greater taxable income and increased spending power for the consumer. Decent pay for decent work is the very least that a worker should expect to get.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T22:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1086">I thank and congratulate the Social Democrats for putting forward this motion, which the Labour Party will be supporting. We absolutely reject the amendment put down by the Government. I will refer to that in a moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087"> I would like everybody listening to this debate to pause for a second and realise where we are. We are in the north inner city in the geographical birthplace of the workers' rights movement in Ireland. We are in the shadow of Liberty Hall and we are within walking distance of where Jim Larkin once spoke to striking dockers. It is possible to take a trip down Henry Street and see the plaque commemorating where the Dunnes Stores' women, they were predominantly women, went on strike in the 1980s. This is not a history lesson of course because, as has been referred to, the Debenhams' workers are just the latest example of how the struggle for workers' rights continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088"> I find the amendment put down by the Government to be an insult. It is an insult to what the Social Democrats' motion is attempting to achieve, an insult to those who believe in workers' rights and an insult to those who have struggled for long years to obtain workers' rights and to enshrine those in legislation. I am not, however, surprised, because the Tánaiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Varadkar, actually insulted myself, my party and our efforts to deal with the High Court judgment only yesterday when he said that what we were engaging in was "virtue signalling". That is what he said and this is the same individual who, when launching his Fine Gael leadership campaign three years ago, stated that he intended to introduce legislation to ban those in the public sector who work in essential services from striking. This is the type of political ethic with which we are dealing with the Tánaiste. That was enough to get some political support for his candidacy for the leadership of the Fine Gael Party three years ago and yet these are the same essential workers that he was happy to applaud during this pandemic and to state that without them our country would have fallen apart. That is classic dog-whistling.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089"> The Labour Party and other parties in the Oireachtas have gone to great lengths to introduce legislation to improve the lot of workers in Ireland in recent years and that legislation has been rejected by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. I refer to the Industrial Relations (Joint Labour Committees) Bill 2019 put forward last year by then Senator and now Deputy Nash. That Bill was rejected by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. The Protection of Employment (Measures to Counter False Self Employment) Bill 2017, put forward in June 2019, was again galling because the Government at that time stated that it would introduce its own bogus self-employment legislation and yet there is no sign of it a year later. The issue here is that bogus self-employment actually cheats us all. I go back again to the Tánaiste's political ethic. When it comes to welfare, he is quite happy to put on the side of a bus a sign saying "Welfare cheats cheat us all". Bogus self-employment costs this country hundreds of millions of euro each year because of losses in PRSI, yet nothing was done about it in respect of the legislation which we introduced and a commitment was not lived up to.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090"> Regarding workers' rights, we live in a low-pay, low-tax economy. We live in an economy where, before Covid-19 hit, 23% of Irish workers were on statistical low pay. That is an OECD figure. It is a scandal and it is a statistic that should shame us all, because living on a low wage is humiliating. It grinds people down, burrows into the marrow of their bones and could stay with them for life. As has been referred to by my colleagues in the Social Democrats, it is disproportionately migrant workers and women who are affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091"> Of course, low pay is, naturally enough, unprotected by collective bargaining rights. That is because we have some of the weakest collective bargaining rights in Europe. Inevitably, an employer that has a veto on collective bargaining negotiations has no interest in lifting up the 23% of our entire workforce who are in low pay. This is not just a low-pay issue, because 40% of young people under 30 years of age are in insecure work. Insecure employment leads to insecure accommodation which in turn leads to insecurity in a whole range of other areas of life, including educational prospects. That is the economy to which the Government is telling us that it is hoping to return.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092"> With the greatest of respect to the Minister of State and what he is trying to achieve, suggesting that welfare cheats cheat us all but that bogus self-employment is not something we need to worry about immediately is wrong. I suggest to him as well that anybody who stands in front of a microphone and states that it is necessary to introduce legislation to ban those in the public sector who work in essential services from striking has not got a clue what he is talking about and should not have the gall some years later to applaud those same workers when they are saving lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093"> I also want the Government to recognise that we have a low pay economy within which we need collective bargaining rights. If it is unconstitutional to have this - I imagine the Attorney General will advise the Government that it is the case - then let us have a constitutional referendum and a citizens' assembly on the matter. The Government is justifiably organising an assembly in respect of the drugs issue and education. A task force has been recommended by the Social Democrats. We could go with that. If a constitutional referendum is required to change the Constitution to allow for collective bargaining rights and to break the employer veto, then let us go with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094"> I put it to the Minister of State that for the Tánaiste, the Minister who is in charge of this area, to stand in Dáil Éireann and accuse members of the Labour Party or any other party of virtue signalling because we introduced legislation to protect those who need legislative protection is beneath him, his ministerial office and the dignity of this Government. This is especially the case since the people are looking to the Government for help, support and protection. What the Social Democrats are proposing and what Sinn Féin, the Labour Party and others are supporting is not virtue signalling. It is about workers rights and the ongoing struggle. I really hoped that the Government produced a better and more thought-out amendment than the effective insult it has brought forward this evening.</p>

          <p eId="para_1104">No, I will speak myself. I will speak briefly because there is only one issue I want to focus on this evening. It is the question of the striking down of the sectoral employment orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105"> The Government has decided to appeal the decision of the High Court to the Supreme Court, and I welcome that. The High Court decision represented a clear and present danger to the wages and conditions of 120,000 construction workers, including electricians, mechanical engineers, plumbers, pipe fitters and others. The fact that there is an appeal to the Supreme Court is positive in two senses. First, in the sense that it allows the possibility that the High Court decision will be overturned. Second, in the sense that the wages and conditions of these workers are protected in the interim. However, the Government must make provision in case the Supreme Court appeal is lost. This can easily be done by preparing legislation that would give the three sectoral employment orders in question the full force of law through an Act of the Oireachtas. That is what needs to be done. It cannot simply be a throw of the dice on one court case. We must ensure and guarantee that those orders are protected and the wages and conditions of the 120,000 workers are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106"> I commend those construction trade unions - there is more than one or two - that are balloting for industrial action on this issue. They are right to do that. I would not trust the Supreme Court, the Government or the Dáil majority on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107"> Should the Supreme Court strike down the Government appeal and should the Dáil fail to pass legislation that would provide cover, as it were, for these sectoral employment orders, then industrial action to defend wages and conditions would be necessary and justified. I understand that one trade union, Connect Trade Union, has said that there will be war - those are the words of the trade union, not mine - if those orders are struck down. I would add that such a war would be a just war and would command a high level of support among construction workers, trade unionists in the construction industry and the general public. I hope it will not come to that. I hope the Supreme Court will uphold the appeal. If it does not, I hope the Dáil will pass the legislation. However, if it comes to it and it is necessary for construction workers to stand and defend their wages and conditions, then I have every confidence that we will stand behind them 100%.</p>

          <p eId="para_1109">Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I are sharing time, with four minutes each.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110"> If this pandemic has taught us anything it is how we need to invest in our front-line workers. We can see it from all the front-line workers who came home and all the trainee nurses who helped the front-line services while getting paid during the Covid-19 crisis. Up to the outbreak of Covid, they did not get paid for the time they spent training. When the pandemic ends, the Government wants to stop paying them again. Trainees in the construction industry or any other apprenticeships get paid while in training. Yet, the very people we have depended on during the pandemic do not get paid while training.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111"> Not all companies are bad but we have some companies that treat their workers disrespectfully. I acknowledge that. We have seen the Debenhams workers protest outside the Dáil today. They are protesting in Limerick too. The company is still trading in the UK. It is basically giving the two fingers to Ireland. We should be picketing the company in the UK. We should be stopping its online trading in this country if it is not willing to look after its former workers. I have seen the workers in Limerick standing on the picket line. It is the last thing they need to hold on to because of what is in the store in stock. They are being treated with so much disrespect in this regard having given great service to Debenhams.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112"> We also look at people who live in rural Ireland and who are working. We debated the question of increasing the carbon tax in the context of the Bill that was just before the House. Let us imagine how it is for a person living in rural Limerick. Most of the industry is located in west Limerick. A person living in east Limerick who has to drive to work must drive to a childcare facility with the children first. The family needs a second vehicle at home because if a student is living within 2 km of the school, he or she does not qualify for public transport. Parents must drive their children to school. The Government does not acknowledge that to which I refer. It amounts to a carbon tax on a minimum wage. Everyone within rural Ireland is suffering double because of the minimum wage, the cost of living and the expenses imposed on us when trying to get to work. Yet, we are being penalised again. The majority of the funding for this is being spent in Dublin. Again, the Government does not understand Limerick or rural Ireland. If the Government learns one thing from the pandemic, it must be that we need investment in our workers, infrastructure and companies. We need them to open up in Limerick in areas where there is no industry. That way we could actually help to reduce the carbon taxes and help our workers throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">It has to listen to the people. There are 19 Independent Deputies in this Dáil and they should be listened to.</p>

          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T22:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1114">I thank the Social Democrats for giving us the opportunity to talk about workers. I thank all of the front-line workers who went to work at the height of the pandemic in hospitals and nursing homes. I commend all of those who went to work, including nurses, doctors, staff in canteens who bought food to patients, home helps who visited houses and tried to keep older people going, shop workers who held the fort while working behind counters to ensure people could get food and supplies and all of those who worked in the emergency services. However, some people have been left behind by the pandemic unemployment payment. If lockdown had not started for another week or two, some seasonal workers would have been paid by their employers and would have received the pandemic unemployment payment. Many of these workers are still not back at work and their stamps are nearly gone. The Minister of State was part of the Administration that introduced the payment. I ask him to deal with this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115"> Many people over 66 years of age are working and have created employment. All we are asking is that their payments be increased from the current old age pension payment to €350 per week because they have bills to pay due to the employment they are in and the employment they created. Sadly, they were left behind. All of the tour buses in Kerry are lying idle and the drivers did not receive the payment. </p>
          <p eId="para_1116"> There is an anomaly in the wage subsidy scheme that has to be addressed. It only applies to firms with employees who worked in January and February. Those who were not working are not entitled to the subsidy. Those who employed people for perhaps 20 hours a week during quiet periods cannot get any more money for them now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117"> The Minister of State, Deputy Robert Troy, said it is the duty of the Government to get people back to work. A great opportunity was missed today when publicans in rural Ireland were denied the right to bring back their workers and open their doors. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy English, to tell me what those publicans did wrong. Did they add to the pandemic or virus? They did not, because their doors have been shut for 17 or 18 weeks. It is as though they are being blamed for the virus. They played no role in creating or expanding the virus. Certain things that may have happened in Dublin, where over two thirds of the pubs are open, did not happen in rural Ireland. Publicans, workers and those who would like to go to a pub and enjoy a pint or two, but cannot do so without travelling 15 or 16 miles to the nearest large town, are being discriminated against.</p>

          <from>Deputy Marian Harkin<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T22:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1122">I am happy to speak in support of this Private Members' motion from the Social Democrats on the issue of decent work, workers' rights, inequality and precarious work. The motion highlights the structural problem of low pay in the Irish economy. </p>
          <p eId="para_1123"> Many people are not aware that Ireland has one of the most unequal distributions of market income in the European Union. It is true that when our tax and welfare systems kick in as a safety net we have a more equal outcome, but our tax and social welfare systems should be focused on the provision of basic services for our citizens and on investment in our economy and social systems rather than propping up the very low wages of a significant cohort of workers. That is why this motion calls for a clear pathway to a living wage. It cannot be an issue for the Government, as it has already made this commitment in the programme for Government. According to Social Justice Ireland, the at risk of poverty rate in Ireland is 14%, but without our tax and social welfare system that rate would be greater than 40%. This clearly illustrates the systemic issue of low pay. In fact, 110,000 people live below the poverty line despite having a job. </p>
          <p eId="para_1124"> According to the OECD, Ireland has one of the highest rates of low-paid employment in the OECD. The rate is almost six times that of Belgium and is second only to the United States. According to the labour force survey of national minimum wage estimates for quarter 4 of 2019, 122,800 employees or workers were in receipt of the minimum wage or less.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125"> Many Deputies have spoken about the fact that the motion calls on the Government to make precisely the same commitments to workers in the Republic of Ireland as they have made to workers in Northern Ireland in the New Decade, New Approach agreement reached in January of this year. I reiterate that very important point. Another important issue is the increasing casualisation of work. This is partly driven by the unparalleled pace of change in production, research, development and innovation. The buzzword is "disruption". This disruption is having an extremely disruptive effect on workers and their employment. There is often no certainty or anchor, and less and less stability in people's working lives. </p>
          <p eId="para_1126"> How are workers supposed to plan? How do they know they can pay their rent in six months' time or their mortgage in two years' time? How can they plan for their or their families' futures? I agree with Deputy Louise O'Reilly, who she said that precarious work destroys people's lives because it takes away their ability to plan. It undermines people's hopes for the future and leaves them on a treadmill. No matter how fast they run, they do not make any progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127"> Another issue is the fact that our labour legislation no longer covers the consequences of the major changes that are taking place in the world of work. That is why this motion calls for the right to collective bargaining and representation in the workplace and recognises the lack of entitlement to basic protections such as sick pay and statutory leave for some of our workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128"> Senator Elizabeth Warren coined the phrase "gig economy", and as the numbers in the gig economy increase, workers' rights are being eroded. More and more holes are appearing in our basic safety net of employment that helps to hold our society together. Our focus should be, as the motion calls for, on creating good jobs and protecting workers' rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129"> The International Labour Organization, ILO, has a phrase that covers a lot of what I believe in, namely, "decent work".</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">Decent work sums up the aspirations of people in their working lives; a plan where they can move forward, have security and plan for a family. Decent work delivers a living wage and provides security in the workplace and opportunities for people to participate in decisions that affect their working lives. We are always told that access to work and to employment is a way out of poverty but this is not the case for a significant numbers of workers in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131"> It is not mentioned in this motion but flexible work - working from home - now needs to come within the remit of some kind of labour legislation and I am sure that is something we will come back to again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132"> This Private Members' motion is modest in what it asks for. It asks for a focus on the creation of good jobs and the protection of workers' rights. It calls for decent income, security of tenure, decent working conditions and the setting up of a task force to help deliver those modest aspirations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133"> Others have commented and used stronger language than me but I am disappointed at the Government amendment. It reiterates the Government's commitment to delivering a living wage and it assures us that the July jobs initiative and the national economic plan will support the creation of good quality jobs. I really hope it does. However, it minimises the legitimate concerns raised in this motion by the Social Democrats, especially on the issues of precarious work, the casualisation of work, systemic low pay in the Irish economy and the real need to improve collective bargaining for those on low pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134"> If the Government felt the need to amend this motion and, politically, I understand why, it should have dealt with those issues in a decent and comprehensive way.</p>

          <from>Deputy Damien English<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T22:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1135">I thank the Social Democrats for the opportunity to have this debate and all the Members for their contributions. I gather some Members have concerns about the countermotion but that is their right. The motion put forward certain views. We do not share all of those views so we tabled a countermotion but we all support developing and improving workers' rights. We are trying to get that balance right for decent work and decent workers and employees. We must also recognise there are many decent employers. Most contributors recognised that, although we know that, in some cases, some are not decent. We will try to make sure we get the balance right to protect everybody who is trying to do the right thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136"> It is just over months since we took the first emergency measures to respond to the public health emergency caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. As we adapted to the reality of life during the pandemic, businesses shut and families and friends stayed apart. Many developed a deeper appreciation of the sacrifices and determination shown by the essential workers who steered us through the crisis, including our doctors, nurses, porters, cleaners, carers, gardaí, transport workers, emergency services, those working in our shops, in haulage, logistics, those keeping the shelves stocked and our cupboards full, those in our NGOs, those providing homeless services, our postal workers, farmers and all those involved in producing food and drink for the country. I thank all of them and acknowledge all those who have worked so hard to get us through the most difficult times since February. </p>
          <p eId="para_1137"> I am also conscious that whenever we single out one group another is often missed. We should be wary of dividing workers between those who are categorised as essential and those who are not because, if anything, we have learned in the past few months that people are often categorised in the wrong areas. Everyone has a role to play in our national response to this public health emergency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138"> We all recognise the period ahead is going to be difficult, certainly over the next 18 to 24 months as we try to recover and get back to where we were pre-Covid-19. We must build on that to grow more new jobs and jobs that might pay more money with better conditions, and so on. We are all committed to that. It will not be an easy road but I recognise that everyone here is genuine in their efforts around that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139"> In doing that we must balance the public health concerns with economic and societal challenges. We have gotten the balance right to date but we cannot take this for granted. The people successfully suppressed the virus with a spirit of solidarity. Everyone played his or her part. We recognise that we are in this together and can get out of this together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140"> The public health emergency has left an economic crisis in its wake. By working together we can overcome this enormous challenge for the good of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141"> At the start of the year the economic outlook was positive. Unemployment was at record low levels. Wages were growing and inequality was falling. Of course, we recognise there is always more work to be don and, that we need to push to get better rights, better services, to grow more jobs and to secure more companies. We must recognise also that we have to plan for the future when it comes to creating jobs. Jobs are constantly evolving and moving. We must invest in innovation, research and development. We must invest in our companies, employees, workers and students. That means investing in their education and skills development and investing in our communities to bring it all together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142"> A number of speakers referred to the role our small businesses and their employees often play in bringing our communities together and providing that local service. We again recognise that during Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143"> To go back to where we were pre-Covid-19, seven months later it often feels like we are living in another country. Despite the enormous challenges we now face, the early interventions taken by the Government in responding to the Covid-19 crisis and the efforts of the residents of this country clubbing together to ensure we responded in the right way have paid off.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144"> The Government has introduced €12 billion worth of measures on behalf of the taxpayer, including wage subsidies, increased welfare payments, direct grants to businesses and low-cost loans to get our country through the worst of the crisis. However, we recognise that is not enough in itself and we must go further. We are now starting to emerge in the darkest days of the emergency and we must keep on that path.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145"> Figures published this week show the number of people depending on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, has, thankfully, fallen by 42% since its peak. That accounts for a quarter of a million people. More than 67,000 people came off the payment in the last week alone, the biggest weekly drop to date. That is good steady progress. We are making progress but we have much work to do. I am happy to work with all parties in this House to achieve that and to build on that work, and so is the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, our Department and other Departments. We will certainly lead on this from a jobs point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146"> Next week we will publish the July jobs stimulus. It will be of scale and speed to meet the challenge. As we know, there are still many challenges. The stimulus will help businesses to reopen, save jobs and create new ones and get our people back to work. It will also give hope to the many sectors that have struggled over the past couple of months and need that extra bit of help to reopen, restart and to survive and to thrive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147"> Some Members referred to seasonal workers and other categories that have missed out in the supports and I am hope the July stimulus plan will address all of that. It will be published next week and every effort will be made to do that. We recognise that in many parts of the country seasonal work is important and the seasons were disrupted this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148"> It will include an enhanced restart grant, an extension of wage subsidies and a focus on retraining and upskilling. If we want job security, high wages, good conditions and so on, the best way we can ensure that, as well as designing and creating those jobs with companies, is by investing in our employees and their skills and training. Certainly, the big argument is always for constantly upskilling and I am glad now we have another Department with responsibility for education to focus on further education and training and to have a greater focus on higher education. Two education Departments fighting at the table for more money to invest in education is a positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149"> As set out in the programme for Government, the July stimulus will be followed by the national economic plan in October to be published on the same day as the budget. It will take a longer-term view over the next two to three years as we build on the supports announced already. It will set out our long-term approach to restoring employment and our broader economic approach. All these economic initiatives must be centred around employment, retaining existing jobs, creating new ones and providing a strong focus on quality employment with good terms and conditions and good work-life balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">We are absolutely committed to that. That is the most effective response to concerns about poverty and inequality and it is the best way to provide more and better opportunities to all of our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151"> While the economic critique put forward by the Social Democrats is well founded for other countries, it does not necessarily hold for Ireland. The Irish economic story of recent years is not categorised by falling wages, rising inequality or increasingly precarious employment. That is not a true picture of Ireland. Before the onset of the Covid emergency incomes were rising, inequality was falling year on year and the minimum wage was increasing constantly. It does not mean we still do not have challenges and work to do, but it is an untrue picture to paint of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152"> Within the programme for Government, there is a commitment to progressing to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government. Ahead of us, there is an immediate challenge for this year and next in relation to the sectors, such as hospitality, retail and tourism, where much of the low-paid employment is provided. Our priority in the short-to-medium term must be to restore that employment and to secure it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153"> However, our intention and that of the Government is that once we begin to restore employment, we will move towards realising that ambition of the living wage. How we do that is not yet decided upon and I would welcome the thoughts and consideration of Members opposite on this. In fairness, the motion talks about having a task force. That is one way of doing it. There are other ways of doing it. There is no point in Deputy Shortall shaking her head. We are here to listen and work with everybody. The Deputy might bear that in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154"> Another option, apart from the task force, is to utilise the Low Pay Commission, which has been quite successful, and the minimum wage. The history of the minimum wage over the past 20 years, and particularly over the past nine years, shows the significant progress towards a substantial living wage can be made through the minimum wage and through that process. Twenty years ago, the first minimum wage was brought in. In 2000, it stood at £4.40, the equivalent at that time of €5.58. In 2008, it stood at €7.65. Since then, it has increased to €10.10 today - steady progress we are certainly willing to build on and make happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155"> Over the past nine years, the minimum wage has grown by 32%. This growth surpasses by a considerable distance the growth in the cost of living and broader wage growth. During that same period, inflation has grown by 6.1% and median weekly wages by 9.2%. Everybody else wants to quote statistics; we can also quote them. As a result of those changes, the minimum wage in Ireland is the second highest on a monthly basis in the European Union, second only to Luxembourg, according to EUROSTAT. When accounting for purchasing power, Ireland's drops to sixth - we accept that - but ours remains among the highest minimum wage rates in the EU. This gives us confidence that we can, once we get the economy and employment back on track, achieve a living wage during the lifetime of this Government and I am happy to work with all parties to achieve that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156"> Poverty and deprivation rates have fallen dramatically since the end of the previous economic crisis through a strong focus on employment and getting people into work, and sustainable jobs. Some on the Opposition benches may claim jobs were poorly paid, with high rates of in-work poverty and on precarious terms. That may be true in other countries but it is not here. Ireland's in-work at-risk-of-poverty rate in 2018 was 4.8%. The EU average was 9.3%. Of the countries that provide data, Ireland has the third lowest in-work at-risk-of-poverty rate in the EU behind the Czech Republic and Finland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157"> When we look impartially at recent experience in Ireland, at the facts rather than everyone's interpretation of the facts, there is much that is positive we can take from what has happened in the Irish economy in recent years. We can see from this experience that the best antidote to poverty and inequality is a focus on good-quality employment, on ensuring people have access to jobs and those jobs being of good quality with a strong social insurance safety net for them when they need it. That is also an area we want to build on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158"> There have been recent improvements in the minimum wage, public sector pay and conditions, reducing income tax levels, social insurance benefits such as paternity benefit, parental leave benefit as well as the extension of social insurance benefits to the self-employed, including invalidity pension, jobseeker's benefit and treatment benefits. These are all positives. It shows positive actions over the past couple of years of Governments that my party was a part of and work we want to continue on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159"> As I will probably run short on speaking time, I will reference the legislation that failed in the High Court and that issue there. Some people have taken issue with the Tánaiste's approach to that. I remind this House that one of the first discussions I had with the Tánaiste, the new Minister in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation where I am as well, was whether we would launch an appeal or not to that High Court decisions because we are concerned about that. That legislation came in with a Fine Gael-Labour Party Government in July 2015. It was a positive development, trying to strengthen the laws around collective bargaining that many speakers here claim we do not have. That is what it tried to do and that is now being called into question. We will appeal that. We have been clear on that. The Tánaiste was absolutely clear on that in the discussions on Thursday last in the Dáil, this week on Question Time, and would do it again tonight if he was here. We are determined to fight that on behalf of the workers of this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1161">I am proud that it is the Social Democrats who have tabled the motion defending the rights of those on lower pay and in precarious work. I commend my colleague, Deputy Gannon, who has taken a lead in preparing this motion. I also thank the Deputies from Sinn Féin, the Labour Party, Solidarity-PBP and the Independents for supporting this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162"> If there ever was any doubt in anyone's mind about the crucial role that our care workers, cleaners, shelf stackers, retailer workers and everyone in essential and front-line work play, this pandemic will have put that doubt to rest. The best and the most appropriate and fitting tribute we could pay to those workers for their contribution during this crisis is to agree that we will have universal healthcare, access to affordable housing and a living wage for everyone. If we were serious about solidarity, nothing short of this is acceptable. Rhetoric that we are all in this together is all well and good, but action is what we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163"> I am disappointed with the response from the Government to the motion that we have put forward. The Government is, through its amendment, effectively seeking to delete our motion pretty much in its entirety. It is a deliberate attempt to remove any reference to collective bargaining, workers' protections and workplace representation. I appeal to all Deputies, especially to Green Party Deputies, not to vote for the Government amendment and instead to support this motion and stand with low-paid workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164"> I will address some of the comments from the Minister of State, Deputy English. The Minister of State correctly stated we should be wary about dividing workers into different categories and yet tonight the Government is putting forward an amendment to our motion that exactly seeks to do that and seeks to introduce language about dividing workers into different categories of public and private. Why is it the Tánaiste, every time he makes a contribution, is always dividing workers into public and private? What is that about, when we should be wary, and I agree with Deputy English, about dividing workers into different categories? It is right to point out and put emphasis on the rights of workers who are on lower pay and in precarious working conditions. We are right to highlight that. In relation to some of the facts, contrary to what the Minister of State, Deputy English, has said, 23% of Irish workers are low paid, according to the OECD. We, in Ireland, are the third worst in the European Union. Young people, women and migrants are particularly affected by low pay and precarious work, especially those working in retail and services. We have also seen that continued privatisation, outsourcing and casualisation in healthcare have increased the numbers in low paid and precarious work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165"> As to the comments earlier of the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, which I must say were contradictory, first he told us that the Government is committed to a living wage, but not now, not next year, sometime in the future. He then argued against the introduction of a living wage and said it should be a voluntary measure. Deputy Troy then admitted, and defined, a living wage as a wage that is required so that one can meet the basic costs to live and then he attacked the idea of increasing the minimum wage on the basis that it is a blunt tool for addressing poverty, his argument being that not everyone on the minimum wage lives in a household suffering from poverty. What about all the people living on the minimum wage who are in a household suffering from poverty? Why should they not have a minimum floor when they go to work so that they can meet the basic costs of childcare, housing, putting food on the table, being able to participate fully in their local community, and being able to say to their children that they can go on that summer camp that is being run and they can go on that school trip? What about those people on the minimum wage? Why do they not come into the equation when we are talking about increasing the minimum wage?</p>
          <p eId="para_1166">We face a very simple choice this evening as to what to do. I want to address one final point before handing over to my colleague. There is no better way to achieve a recovery than by addressing low pay and putting money into the pockets of low-paid workers who will spend it in the local community and local shops. There is no better way forward.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_421">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T22:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1167">I thank everybody who has contributed to this debate and those parties and Independent Members who have indicated their support for this motion. In the view of the Social Democrats, this motion is very important. It sets out clearly the weaknesses in our employment protection provisions which give rise to the kind of low pay and poor conditions which, as a modern society, we simply should not tolerate. It also proposes means by which to address these weaknesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168"> The Minister of State spoke about the true picture of Ireland. I will tell him what that is. It should be a matter of shame that almost one in four workers is low paid and struggling to survive in poverty. It should be a matter of shame that such a significant number of our workers are in insecure employment and do not have access to the statutory entitlements many of us take for granted. How does one survive without an entitlement to sick leave, for example? The answer is that one does not survive and ends up either going to work while sick or not being able to pay one's rent or other bills. How does one operate when one does not know the hours one is expected to work from week to week or even from day to day? How does one plan childcare or arrange other activities outside of work? </p>
          <p eId="para_1169"> The truth is that we are becoming an increasingly two-tier workforce. On the one hand are those in established secure employment with decent pay and conditions, while on the other hand are a growing number of predominantly younger lower-paid workers in precarious conditions with limited protections. The absence of collective bargaining and the denial of the right to representation in the workplace have undoubtedly led to this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170"> Before the election, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions appealed to all parties to commit to including a specific paragraph in the programme for Government which would ensure an enhanced focus on creating good jobs and protecting workers' rights. It is incredible that not one of the three parties in government regarded this issue as sufficiently important to include in the programme. Not only that but, on examination of the programme for Government, it is revealed that there is no reference at all to workers' rights, collective bargaining or the right to representation. It beggars belief that the section entitled, A New Social Contract, says nothing about workers' rights. The section, Reigniting and Renewing the Economy, does not say anything about workers' rights either and, bafflingly, no reference to workers' rights is to be found under the heading, Social Dialogue. One really has to ask whether anybody in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the Green Party is remotely interested in workers' rights. </p>
          <p eId="para_1171"> The commitment requested by ICTU was a short paragraph, which is reproduced in our motion. It is taken from the New Decade, New Approach document drawn up by the Irish and UK Governments to restore power-sharing in Northern Ireland, which was accepted by all five main parties there. That document commits to an enhanced focus on creating good jobs and protecting working rights. Parties to the agreement "agree that access to good jobs, where workers have a voice that provides a level of autonomy, a decent income, security of tenure, satisfying work in the right quantities and decent working conditions, should be integral to public policy given how this contributes to better health and wellbeing by tackling inequalities, building self-efficacy and combating poverty." </p>
          <p eId="para_1172"> The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and then Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, actually negotiated that document and called it a fair and balanced package. Where is the Minister tonight? Where are he and his Government colleagues who said we should support these rights in Northern Ireland? How can they not do the same in the Republic? Do people in Ireland not deserve the same protections as those in the North? Is there no recognition on this side of the Border that these rights are integral to a fair and equal society which rejects the normalisation of inequality and poverty? Does this Government believe that only applies in the North?</p>
          <p eId="para_1173"> The motion before us tonight is about workers' rights. It is a disgrace that at no point in the Minister of State's contribution did he engage on that issue or use the term "workers' rights". We strongly appeal to Government to withdraw its meaningless amendment, honour the resolution it itself drafted, show respect to workers, and support the motion proposed tonight. I strongly commend the motion to the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_1177">The Covid crisis has, for good or ill, led to a significant re-evaluation of what our communities can offer, what kind of public realm we have access to, and the primary role our immediate neighbourhoods play in keeping us healthy and safe during this crisis. Local authorities have a vital role in this regard. They now shoulder the great responsibility of making space available for people to prioritise public health in the public realm and to do so in a way that is universally accessible for every single person. A considerable disparity is beginning to emerge between local authorities in their response to the crisis. While towns, villages and cities throughout the country have risen to the challenges, some are falling very far short.</p>
            <p eId="para_1178"> I see protected bike lanes and newly pedestrianised streets springing into existence. I see traffic speeds limited to 30 km/h in the area of Dublin City Council. I see families sitting out and enjoying meals on the streets of Cork and shoppers wandering and enjoying the space for people in Ennis. However, I also see local authorities such as Limerick City and County Council taking decisions that are, quite frankly, worrying in the context of the pandemic and the best interests of the public in the future. This local authority is offering free parking to encourage car use in the centre of the city at weekends and is hanging novelty forks and spoons off lampposts while putting even small decisions on pedestrian space and infrastructure for active travel on the longest of fingers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1179"> We know that businesses are worried about their futures and that these kinds of changes can seem like yet another thing they have to contend with and worry about. We also know, however, that research indicates that pedestrianised areas actually see increased footfall and turnover.</p>
            <p eId="para_1180">We know that local authorities do not always have the expertise to implement the changes that we now need. Perhaps this is the problem. It seems the upper echelons of local government is bursting with road engineers but crying out for talented urban designers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1181"> Ireland recently supported the Stockholm declaration on speed to make 30 km/h the default unless the relevant authority, in this case our local authorities, could prove it should be increased above that on any road. We know that making places where people gather, whether it is the local village square or a big city main street, more pedestrian friendly and safe for active travel is the responsible thing to do right now.</p>
            <p eId="para_1182"> We are aware from in-depth reports from the Environmental Protection Agency in 2019 that air pollution is already at worrying levels in Ireland due to our high rates of car usage and our continued failure to ban smoky coal nationwide. Given that, and in light of the recent spike in pedestrian deaths, prioritising people, not cars, on some streets and in some public places is not in reality a lot to ask for. It would protect walkers, cyclists, people with disabilities, people with asthma, those with underlying conditions, and small children. It would protect all of us.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183"> Covid has delivered us into a new world. It is not necessarily a world that we would have looked for but there are some challenges facing us that we may be able to transform into opportunities if we are brave, steadfast and if we plan well now and put people first. What plans has the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government put in place or can it put in place to develop and issue guidelines to local authorities as a matter of urgency on the best practice implementation of pedestrian and active travel measures in the Covid-19 pandemic? Regarding future transport strategies and planning decisions, what are the plans to address public health requirements in villages, towns and urban areas for increased space in the public realm in a post-Covid world?</p>

          <speech by="#PeterBurke" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Housing,_Planning_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_425">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (Deputy Peter Burke)<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T23:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1184">I thank Deputy Hourigan for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity to highlight the importance of active models of travel and the public realm now more than ever in the light of what we know about the Covid-19 pandemic. It is vital to ensure that timely and appropriate measures are put in place to support public health advice and best practice in response to the pandemic, including social or physical distancing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185"> On 22 June, my Department, working in collaboration with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, issued a circular to local and regional authorities alerting them to updated advice in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The design manual for urban roads and streets, DMURS, which was jointly launched by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in 2013, was updated on 23 June 2020 with an interim advice note. The interim advice note supports the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's announcement of funding to deliver improved walking and cycling infrastructure throughout the country in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and supplements correspondence from the National Transport Authority, NTA, on 22 May offering technical and financial assistance to the 31 local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1186"> The interim advice note highlights a range of practical measures that can be quickly implemented to address the challenges posed by the pandemic and in particular the immediate steps towards ensuring a city, town and village centre, and other areas where pedestrians may converge, can provide an environment that is safe and welcoming in support of communities and the reopening of business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1187"> The advice note encourages local authorities to engage with local stakeholders and communities to monitor, test and adapt schemes in the coming months to address the issues that may arise. To date, 19 local authorities have engaged with the NTA on various Covid measures, resulting in 13 formal applications requesting approximately €7 million from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The NTA is working with all cities to develop a Covid mobility framework which sets out the plans to provide widened footpaths, temporary protected cycle facilities, including new contraflow routes, revised bus routings and bus priority measures, and enhanced pedestrian priority zones.</p>
            <p eId="para_1188"> The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to be felt for some time and the support provided acknowledges the many challenges authorities face to ensure that streets and transport networks can safely operate. I understand that a number of local authorities are working closely with the NTA and have issued or are in the process of developing temporary transport and mobility plans and have set up teams to oversee their implementation. I encourage all local authorities to develop mobility plans as an immediate response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Deputy may be aware that Dublin City Council has published such a plan, which is quite comprehensive, and the scale of ambition contained within it may be replicated across other cities and towns, of course factoring in local scale and context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1189"> A positive outcome of the current circumstance is that there is now a unique opportunity for all local authorities to assess how urban spaces are being utilised and how various improvements can be made to better support local communities and businesses, not only to deal with issues arising from current restrictions but that could also have a longer term beneficial impact for everyone who uses our cities, towns and villages. I therefore call on all local authorities to take full advantage of the NTA offer of assistance, which, along with their own local expertise, will contribute to the development of the unique solutions required to maintain our way of life and deliver a safer and more sustainable urban environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1190"> It is also acknowledged that the broader policy context will inform and guide us as we endeavour to address the emerging consequences of Covid-19. The national planning framework, NPF, is endorsed in the programme as critical to underpin the towns first principle of balanced regional development and sustainable connectivity and mobility. It is Ireland's long-term national planning strategy to accommodate Project Ireland and the population growth for economic growth over the 20-year period to 2040.</p>

            <p eId="para_1192">I thank the Minister of State. Part of the worry is that perhaps the roll-out or response from particular local authorities is somewhat erratic and that perhaps there needs to be communication in order that local authorities that do not have the specific expertise know that the NTA is there to help them and that they can access those supports easily. I thank the Minister of State very much for his response.</p>

            <p eId="para_1193">Thank you for your good wishes, a Cheann Comhairle. This gives me a key opportunity to highlight these issues and to show that this funding is available. I thank Deputy Hourigan for raising the matter and bringing it to our attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1194"> There is a funding stream within the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport from which the Covid mobility framework can be drawn down. Essentially, the current mobility funding is approximately €700 million for 2020, so there is a substantial fund available. I encourage all 31 local authorities to access this funding and to think outside the box in terms of what can be available to respond to this challenge. We all acknowledge that it is a significant challenge for business as well. We have changed the way we live and how we go about our daily lives. We can get easy wins by taking advantage of the challenges.</p>
            <p eId="para_1195"> The national planning framework is the roadmap for how towns and villages will be developed in the coming years, right up to 2040, and how the population will be spread through the towns first initiative. There are significant advantages and I thank the Deputy for raising this Topical Issue matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy Emer Higgins<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T23:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1197">Comhghairdeas to the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan. In recent months my local parks in Lucan, Clondalkin, Palmerstown and Rathcoole have become littered with strange shiny silver bullets. Many people were shocked to discover that these objects are the residue of a new drug abuse craze among young people. Teenagers are inhaling nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas, from these bullets to get high.`</p>
            <p eId="para_1198"> While this craze is new in Ireland, we can see the path it leads to from the experiences of other countries. In the UK, one in 11 young people now use nitrous oxide. That is higher than the proportion of young people who use cocaine or ecstasy there. Young Dutch people started experimenting with one or two cartridges but this escalated to the point where abuse is running rampant and is now out of control in the Netherlands. A report by the National Information Centre on Poison in the Netherlands highlights a shocking increase in the number of people consuming 50 cartridges a day. Some young people are consuming as many as 100 cartridges a day through balloons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">It is becoming the drug of choice for young people and the consequences are chilling. In the Netherlands the number of recorded cases of nitrous oxide damaging health has increased tenfold in a four-year period. More than one in three Dutch partygoers now uses nitrous oxide on a regular basis. Some 64 young adults in the Netherlands have been hospitalised in the past two years alone. While too many young people see it as harmless fun neurologists are crystal clear about its long-term consequences. The gas depletes the body's store of vitamin B12. This can cause spinal cord damage and is leading to young people being diagnosed as paraplegic and becoming wheelchair-bound. The average age of Dutch patients confined to wheelchairs as a result of abusing laughing gas is just 22 years of age. In the UK, according to its official statistics, nitrous oxide has been linked to 17 deaths within three years. Tragically, we have suffered our first deaths as a result of this scourge with the media reporting deaths in Millstreet in County Cork and Tallaght in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200"> The easy availability of nitrous oxide really is shocking. If one types "buy nitrous oxide" into a search engine now one will see an ad displayed, which the search engine is paid to show, for a website hosted in Ireland, selling these capsules. They are sold under a brand called "Whip-it!" as a 50 pack of whipped-cream chargers. While this appears to be a business supplying the product for legitimate reasons, the comments on the website by purchasers gives the game away. One customer testifies that they "...had zero problems. Works good for whip cream and to trip out...". Another jokes: "This stuff really 'whipped' my cream, if you know what I mean!". "Feels good..." says another happy customer. This comes from a <i>.ie</i> registered website and that site should not be selling a product that is clearly and obviously being abused. We need to nip this in the bud by acting now. We need a clear strategy to tackle this problem head on before it escalates out of control.</p>

            <p eId="para_1201">I thank Deputy for raising this very important issue and for giving me the opportunity to address it as the newly-appointed Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy. I also want to take this opportunity to affirm the Government’s full commitment to implementing the national drugs strategy and its commitment to a health-led approach to drug use and the development of harm-reduction interventions. Nitrous oxide is a colourless gas that is most commonly found in pressurised metal containers and canisters and has a number of medicinal and industrial uses. Deputy Higgins rightly outlined all the various issues associated with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202"> The gas can be misused to get euphoric effects and it can make users feel intoxicated. I am aware of the recent media reports of the increased use of nitrous oxide during the lockdown period which is of grave concern to me. However, it is important we have evidence-based information regarding the extent of its use. As a result, the HSE is currently in the process of gathering information on the prevalence of its use to inform any future actions that may be sanctioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203"> As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Health works with the HSE to raise awareness of the dangers associated with drugs through the <i>drugs.ie</i> website. This website provides a comprehensive range of information and supports related to substance use, including nitrous oxide and other substances. The HSE also operates a drugs and alcohol helpline which is a free and confidential active listening helpline and an email support service offering non-directive support, information guidance and referral to anyone with a question or concern relating to drug and alcohol use. The helpline can be used by directly and by their family members.</p>
            <p eId="para_1204"> The Department of Health, as part of the introduction of the health diversion programme, is providing €100,000 in 2020 to develop a national harm reduction campaign to raise awareness of the risks associated with drug use. This will include the use of club drugs, festival drug use and new trends such as nitrous oxide. While this campaign was originally scheduled for the latter part of 2020, this timetable may need to be revised given the draw on resources in response to the challenges arising from Covid-19.</p>
            <p eId="para_1205"> Recently, the HSE launched Know the Score, the first national evidence-based resource on alcohol and drugs for senior cycle students. It aims to engage young people in exploring and considering a wide range of topics related to the risk associated with alcohol and drugs. While these sources of information are most definitely helpful, it is also important to emphasise the crucial role played by parents in educating young people about the risks of substance abuse. Evidence-based content is available on<i> drugs.ie </i>regarding nitrous oxide, as well as the HSE booklet providing advice for parents on how to talk to young people about the risks associated with drug and alcohol use.</p>
            <p eId="para_1206"> As Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I believe addressing the drug problem requires a multi-pronged approach that includes prevention initiatives in tandem with targeted harm reduction and treatment services. Particular vigilance is required in protecting young people from threats to their health and wellbeing from misuse of substances, including nitrous oxide.</p>

            <from>Deputy Emer Higgins<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T23:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1207">I thank the Minister of State for his response. It is very encouraging that he has acted quickly by seeking a report from the HSE around the prevalence of nitrous oxide use in Ireland. Young people seem to have no idea that this product is killing and paralysing their counterparts elsewhere in Europe. I agree we need and education campaign so that they are aware of the consequences. We also need to start recording how many people are affected by abusing nitrous oxide. At the moment we are relying on media reports to tell us of hospitalisations and deaths. There should be official HSE data recording this problem so that we can understand it and the extent of it and I welcome the Minister of State’s move to gather this kind of information.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208"> We need to limit the availability of this product. Due to the fact that it has genuine uses in the food and medical industries, it is freely available to legally purchase. I am not aware of any law banning its sale to persons under 18 years of age. It is illegal to sell it for human consumption but it is impossible to prove that that is the case and that leaves gardaí powerless to act. Belgium is planning to ban the sale of nitrous oxide to persons under 18 years of age and we should follow suit. The Netherlands is investigating banning nitrous oxide altogether and perhaps there is a point in us establishing whether its legal uses can be fulfilled by other means. If so, then maybe we should move to do the same.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209"> Search engines should not be profiting at the expense of our children’s health by selling ads encouraging people to buy this product online. In fact, this product should not be available for purchase online at all. Our young people need to be aware that mild symptoms like a headache, tingling in the arms and legs or numbness can be the first step to ending up in a wheelchair or worse.</p>
            <p eId="para_1210"> Will the Minister of State commit not just to working on a strategy that communicates the dangers of nitrous oxide but to work on a strategy that reduces access to the purchase of these gas canisters which are on sale right now online for as little as €1? I did not have to search very hard last night to find this used canister. They litter my local parks in Lucan, Clondalkin, Rathcoole and Palmerston. We need to act now to protect our young people.</p>

            <p eId="para_1213">I thank the Deputy once again for raising the important issue of nitrous oxide. She raised issues regarding the banning of this substance and the fact it is freely available on the Internet. I share her concerns about the apparent ease of purchase of this gas. I assure her that as the Minister of State with responsibility for this area it is an issue I am taking very seriously. I will take the points she has raised this evening back the officials in my Department tomorrow morning. However, I reiterate the HSE is currently in the process of gathering the required evidence-based information on the prevalence of this drug and its use in Ireland and that will inform future actions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1214"> I will conclude by stating that the Government’s policy on drug and alcohol addiction services is set out in the national drugs strategy document Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery: A health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">The programme for Government commits to continuing to resource harm reduction and education campaigns aimed at increasing awareness of the risks of using this drug. As the Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I am committed to implementing an integrated public health response to substance misuse and I am confident this will lead to better outcomes for individuals and society.</p>

            <p eId="para_1216">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter and I join in the congratulations for the new Minister of State, Deputy Feighan. I would say that at one stage he felt he was down, but he was not out and he made a great comeback, and I congratulate him on his appointment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217"> I am disappointed that the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, is not here. This is an important issue with regard to the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise. Page 47 of the programme for Government states additional capacity is required throughout the health system to deal with the growing population and, of course, Covid-19. Nowhere is this more true than the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise because it is dealing with the expanding population of County Laois, the fastest growing county in population terms outside of the Dublin region, and that of some of the surrounding areas, such as south Kildare and east Offaly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1218"> Going back three years, there was a plan to remove the emergency department and other key services from the hospital, but a campaign was mounted which stopped it in its tracks. The then Minister, Deputy Harris, promised me and the two other Deputies from the county a quick public consultation, but three years later that public consultation has not happened. I said at the time that I thought it may be a stalling mechanism to get the then Government over a general election period and, unfortunately, my fears were confirmed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219"> When the Taoiseach was in opposition he met the Portlaoise hospital action committee and promised to deal with this issue and the lack of certainty about the hospital. Fianna Fáil made great play of it and great noise about it at the time. We still do not have it. Successive Governments have kicked the can down the road on Portlaoise hospital. This has gone on for decades and it cannot go on any longer. The one thing the staff, management, patients and the communities of Laois and the surrounding counties need is certainty. We need a clear plan for the future of the hospital. We have not had this and it cannot continue the way it has been going.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220"> We need the Government to commit to putting in place a plan for the future of the hospital. This must include retention of the emergency department. Prior to Covid-19, on average 40,000 people used the emergency department in Portlaoise hospital. I must commend staff, management and everyone throughout the hospital for the way they have dealt with the Covid crisis. They have managed to keep it virtually free of Covid and it has been a huge effort. Recently, a relation of mine spent weeks there and could not heap enough praise on the staff. It is an elderly relative who, unfortunately, is in bad health at present. The hospital has a great track record.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221"> If the Government does nothing else with regard to Laois and Portlaoise, will the Minister of State, along with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, commit to putting a plan in place that gives certainty regarding the emergency department and the other key services in the hospital?</p>

            <from>Deputy Frankie Feighan<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T23:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1222">On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, I thank Deputy Stanley for raising this matter regarding Portlaoise hospital. I also thank him for the kind remarks he made about me.</p>
            <p eId="para_1223"> The Minister would like to reassure the Deputy that the most important issue regarding the consideration of services at the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise is that patient safety and outcomes must come first. As the Deputy is aware, the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise has been the focus of a number of reviews, investigations and reports in recent years. The reports points to the need for a reconfiguration of some services to ensure patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff who can safely meet their needs. With these reports in mind, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, is committed to securing and further developing the role of the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise as a constituent hospital of the Dublin Midlands hospital group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224"> Since 2014, the focus has been on supporting the hospital to develop and enhance management capability, implementing changes required to address clinical service deficiencies, and incorporating the hospital into the governance structures of the Dublin Midlands hospital group. Significant work has been undertaken to strengthen and stabilise current arrangements for services at the hospital to ensure sustainable services are safely assured and adequately resourced. Funding has increased by 50% relative to the 2012 budget and staffing levels have risen by 36% from the 2014 base.</p>
            <p eId="para_1225"> In addition to resourcing at the hospital, governance and management arrangements at the Midlands Regional Hospital Portlaoise have been strengthened. Additional clinical staff have been appointed and staff training, hospital culture and communications have improved. The Dublin Midlands hospital group has been working for some time on a draft plan for a new model of clinical service delivery at Portlaoise hospital which takes into account the need to develop services at the hospital in the context of developing the model of service provision for the entire hospital group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1226"> The HSE group involved in developing the draft action plan for Portlaoise hospital focused on the risk issues and the interdependencies of the various clinical services in the emergency department, general surgery, general medicine, general paediatrics, obstetrics, gynaecology and neonatology. The draft plan has been submitted to the Department of Health but I would like to clarify that no decision has been made on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1227"> I emphasise again that patient and public requirements are paramount and have underpinned the Department's consideration of the draft plan. The Government is committed to investing in services, capital projects and staffing at Portlaoise hospital. The hospital has made considerable infrastructural improvements in recent years to improve the service user experience. These capital developments allow considerable service developments and additional recruitment of staff, and further solidify our commitment to securing and developing the role of the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise as a constituent hospital in the Dublin Midlands hospital group.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Stanley<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T23:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1228">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I welcome the fact there has been increased funding and I acknowledge it because I did complain in the Thirty-first Dáil about the budget for Portlaoise hospital, which was substantially reduced. I also welcome the increase in staff numbers. I report in a positive way that this has made a difference. There were investigations and reviews with regard to the maternity services. It is now acknowledged that Portlaoise has excellent maternity services and outcomes. The Minister of State is correct that it is part of the Dublin Midlands hospital group and this network has been beneficial. I acknowledge all of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229"> The missing piece of the jigsaw is to nail down and tie down once and for all the emergency department because if we take the emergency department out, we will lose other key services such as paediatrics, maternity and the ICU. Prior to the Covid emergency there were only two ICU beds in the hospital. This will need to be examined when we get to the far side of the pandemic, and I hope that will be soon. It is difficult to recruit senior medical staff. Staff have been recruited but it is difficult to recruit consultants and senior clinicians when there is no certainty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1230"> The Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, visited the Coombe to show Government support for front-line staff. According to his statement, he also wanted to underline the Government's full commitment to the implementation of the national maternity strategy. Portlaoise is part of the integrated maternity network with the Coombe, so where does Portlaoise fit into the national maternity strategy? I want the Minister of State to communicate to the Minister and the Government that this is an important issue. It is about a serious issue in the middle of the country in a very busy local hospital.</p>

            <p eId="para_1231">I reiterate that the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, is committed to securing and further developing the role of the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, as a constituent hospital within the Dublin Midlands hospital group. A number of reports point to the need for a reconfiguration of some services at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, to ensure that patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff who can safely meet their needs. As the Deputy said, significant work has been carried out in recent years to strengthen and stabilise current governance and management arrangements for services in the hospital to ensure the provision of appropriate and safe care for patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232"> No decision has been made on the draft action plan for Portlaoise hospital. The most important issue in the consideration of services at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, is that patient safety and outcomes must come first. I thank the Deputy for his support. I also thank the staff who worked so diligently. We are very proud of the staff in Portlaoise hospital and, indeed, all front-line staff in the Department of Health across the country. It is wonderful that we are all at one in agreeing that we are very fortunate to have them. I note the Deputy's concerns about the hospital and I will engage with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and the officials in the Department of Health on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1233">In welcoming the Minister of State tonight and saying we are grateful to you for being here, as it is inordinately late that we are discussing this matter, it might be no harm at this early stage in the process to communicate to the Department of Health that there will be a very unhappy Dáil if the Department does in this Dáil what it did in the last and sends in Ministers of State to deal with issues for which they do not have delegated responsibility.</p>

            <p eId="para_1234">I call Deputy Ó Murchú to discuss the matter of drug crime in Dundalk, County Louth. The Minister of State, Deputy McConalogue, is present. Congratulations on your appointment and we wish you well in your brief.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RuairiOmurchu" eId="spk_441">
            <from>Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T23:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1235">I also wish the Minister of State, Deputy McConalogue, all the best. I had a sheet of notes relating to this matter and every time I wrote something down I changed it because the entire process and my involvement with this issue just make me angry. We have never reached a solution. The reason I decided to raise this now was a number of recent events. At 3.35 a.m. on Sunday, 5 July, a family in Dundalk were very lucky to get away with their lives in Clontygora Court following an arson attack. I have been at a number of these attacks over the years but this was by far one of the most serious. In this case two of the family got out, luckily enough, and three of the family were upstairs, the father, a mother who was eight months pregnant and a four year old child. They were forced to jump out of the two-storey building. Obviously, some of them were injured, but luckily nobody was killed. That is the seriousness with which criminal gangs are operating in Dundalk.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236"> As regards drugs crime, one need only do a Google search to find that the Garda has been incredibly vigilant. Since it put a drugs unit in operation there have been finds of €30,000 and €35,000 worth of cocaine, crack cocaine and heroin. We have all seen the national drug treatment reporting system report which refers to an increase not only in cocaine use, which everybody is aware of, but also in the use of crack cocaine. When talking to community activists I have consistently been told about dealers being really sound to some of their customers and telling them: "I know things are not great now and I do not necessarily have a great supply of heroin, but do not worry because I have plenty of crack cocaine and I will sort you out with that". That is the reality, especially in working class areas. We have drug dealers who have been operating for many years but there has been a failure by the State to deal with them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237"> I welcome the operations that have been carried out recently, and in all my dealings with the gardaí I am happy that they are utterly focused. However, one will never have a meeting with gardaí in which they will not talk about the need for more resources. With regard to the attack I mentioned and a previous attack that occurred in my own estate in which a garda's home was attacked, I must commend the neighbours who were vigilant and called the fire service, whose members were spectacular. In addition, the gardaí are putting operations in place and they are carrying out the necessary investigative work and bringing it to a conclusion. That is to be welcomed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238"> My difficulty with the drugs problem is about who one should deal with at Cabinet level. I went to a meeting before the last election with the former Deputy, Mr. Gerry Adams, and the then Minister of State, former Deputy Catherine Byrne. She basically stated that one had to have somebody serious at Cabinet level who was willing to drive the project of dealing with dangerous criminals and ensuring there is a sufficient number of addiction services. Gardaí will state that they are constantly arresting people who need services and cannot get them. Services such as the Family Addiction Support Network are vital services that are not funded in any way. This issue crosses the areas of housing, health, education and justice. We cannot allow these dangerous criminals to operate. I want the Government to put somebody in charge. I welcome what is going to be done with the Citizens' Assembly, but we already know what has to be done.</p>

          <speech by="#CharlieMcConalogue" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_442">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Charlie McConalogue)<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T23:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1239">I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, and Deputy Ó Murchú for the good wishes on my recent appointment. On behalf of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and myself, I thank Deputy Ó Murchú for raising this serious matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1240"> I begin by strongly condemning the criminal damage by fire caused by the attack on the family on Sunday, 5 July, in Dundalk, County Louth, and the terrible distress for them and all members of the family due to the terrible danger in which they found themselves. It also caused distress to the local community. An Garda Síochána is conducting a full investigation of this matter. The Deputy will appreciate that as a result of that I am limited in what I can say in response to him. An Garda Síochána arrested four men last Monday, 13 July, in connection with the incident. The Minister understands that two of the men were released without charge and a file is being prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions. The other individuals were charged with regard to separate matters and appeared in court yesterday, 14 July. The Minister appeals to anybody with information on this matter to contact An Garda Síochána at the incident room in Dundalk Garda station or by using the Garda confidential line.</p>
            <p eId="para_1241"> We share the Deputy's concern about the serious issue of drugs crime as well as drug related intimidation in communities, which involves the targeting of persons who use drugs or their families or friends in respect of a drug debt. I appreciate that the threat of violence to enforce drug debt impacts people's lives and their communities. While the reality is that drug-related crime occurs nationwide, in many instances the communities most acutely affected are already marginalised and contending with other forms of criminality associated with the illicit drugs trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242"> Government policy is guided by the national drugs strategy, which represents a whole-of-Government response to the scourge of drug and alcohol abuse in the country. Implementation of the strategy is led by my colleague, the Minister for Health, and the Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy and health promotion, although obviously the strategy includes a wide range of actions for all stakeholders, including the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda Síochána. There is a specific action in the national drugs strategy in respect of drug-related intimidation. An Garda Síochána, in partnership with the National Family Support Network, developed the drug-related intimidation reporting programme which is being implemented at national level since 2013 to respond to the needs of drug users and family members who may be subject to the threat of drug-related intimidation. Ireland's national drugs strategy is unique among national drugs strategies across EU member states in recognising the need to address drug-related debt intimidation at community level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243"> Recognising that the issue of drug use and drug-related crime in communities is a complex and multifaceted one, the Deputy might be interested to know about the Greentown project, a research project to examine the recruitment by criminal networks of children in Ireland and to make recommendations for interventions to disrupt children being lured into criminality.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">The project is being led by the research evidence into policy programmes and practice project, REPPP, at the school of law in the University of Limerick. It is a strategic research partnership with the University of Limerick funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and supported by the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>
            <p eId="para_1245"> I look forward to Deputy Ó Murchú's further contribution. I will provide further information in my closing response.</p>

            <p eId="para_1246">I appreciate the Minister of State's response and I accept there has been a lot of good work and extra resourcing of the Garda. However, gardaí say they do not have all the services they require. A car belonging to the drug squad in Dundalk was attacked at the Garda station. That is the level of brazenness of the criminal gangs. They have operated for too long and we need to deal with them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247"> Gardaí say consistently that addiction services are insufficient. They lift people for sometimes minor and sometimes more serious crimes and those people cannot access addiction services, so we go around in a circle. I go back to the fact that we need a person at governmental level who takes in the people from health and even from the local authorities and housing because we have issues there. I can talk about my own town, where a large number of serious players and drug dealers own their own houses and have plentiful supplies of money. That is where the Criminal Assets Bureau needs to come in. These criminals use people who are vulnerable as their front end. That is what needs to be dealt with because we are talking about communities that have been living with this for ten or 15 years in a serious way. These criminals are becoming more brazen. We need to take them on.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248"> We also need to ensure we are serious about harm reduction. The superintendent in Dundalk said at a recent joint policing committee meeting that drugs are literally the most serious issue he has to deal with in his region and that he requires greater resources to give the drugs unit what it requires. We have had a chief superintendent who said we will lose an entire generation to cocaine. We need to ensure that this issue is dealt with at Cabinet level, somebody takes control and we can deliver a solution and look after our communities that are suffering from all this criminality.</p>

            <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2020-07-15T23:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1249">An Garda Síochána continues to tackle proactively all forms of drug crime. I know from Deputy Ó Murchú's contribution that it is making a tremendous effort in Dundalk, but that needs to continue and to be supported. The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs as well as organised crime groups. From the bureau's establishment in March 2015 until the end of June this year, it seized, for example, illicit drugs to a value of €182 million, cash believed to be the proceeds of crime to a value of €14 million and 122 firearms and over 5,000 rounds of ammunition. This work is supported by the divisional drugs units nationwide and, more generally, by all gardaí working in local communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1250"> With respect to Garda resources working with communities in Dundalk in particular, 184 gardaí were assigned to Dundalk as of the end of May 2020. This is an increase from 147 gardaí, or 25%, since the end of 2015. As the Deputy will be aware, however, a key principle arising from the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is that policing is not the responsibility of the police alone but also involves other agencies of government, such as health and social services, and other sectors of society. This principle is at the centre of a new policy on community safety which is being developed by the Department of Justice and Equality. The policy, which will be given a statutory basis in the new policing and community safety Bill, proposes to establish and support a system of community safety at local level across the country. Through cross-sectoral collaboration and by drawing on the available services, these systems will be best placed to identify support and implement community safety according to the needs of the local community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1251"> We hear Deputy Ó Murchú's contribution and are very much aware of the serious issues at play. I assure him that, working with and supporting the Garda Síochána, and working within government, we will do all we can to try to ensure that this issue is addressed in every way possible.</p>
