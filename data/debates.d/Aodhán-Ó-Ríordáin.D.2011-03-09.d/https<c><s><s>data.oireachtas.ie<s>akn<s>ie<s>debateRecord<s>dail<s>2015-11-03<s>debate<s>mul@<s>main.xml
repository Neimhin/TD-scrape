            <p eId="para_1">100. <b>Deputy Brendan Smith</b> asked the <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</b> the progress made in the all-party talks in Northern Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [37185/15]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_1">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_2">In recent weeks and months in Northern Ireland we have seen political instability reach a significant peak in the form of budgetary clashes on welfare reform and following more recent revelations on the assessment of the structure, role and purpose of paramilitary organisations by the PSNI and MI5. The political stalemate and the wider political and societal instability it fosters must not be allowed to continue. Every effort needs to be made by the participants, in particular the Irish Government in its role of co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to put the peace process on a permanent and sustainable footing and ensure the all-party talks will result in a successful outcome. I wish the Minister, the British Government and all the parties every success in these very important talks, which should be nearing a conclusion.</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">Following the request by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, and I, together with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers, facilitated a return of the five main parties in Northern Ireland to round table talks. The talks resumed on 21 September and are continuing in a constructive atmosphere. I have worked closely with the Secretary of State, Ms Villiers, in encouraging all parties to continue to engage in a constructive manner in the talks process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4">As well as round table sessions, the talks are taking place in bilateral and trilateral format and good work is also being done in discussions between the parties themselves. The more inclusive the engagement, the better the final agreement will be.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> My current assessment is that the talks have now moved to an intensive phase and we are making good progress around the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement as well as dealing with the legacy and impact of paramilitarism. The Stormont House Agreement, concluded in December 2014, offers a blueprint for overcoming current difficulties in the Executive, especially around financing welfare reform and dealing with the legacy of the past. It is also crucial that the work started by the Stormont House Agreement on establishing new institutions to deal with the legacy of the past be completed so that justice and truth can bring what healing is possible to victims and survivors of the troubles and their families. </p>
            <p eId="para_6"> It is essential that all five main parties in Northern Ireland, with the support of the two Governments, urgently advance full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and address the impact and legacy of continuing paramilitary activity. While significant challenges remain, I am hopeful that, with committed and collective engagement, we can make real progress on the critical issues in the coming days with a view to a successful conclusion of the talks. An agreed outcome, supported by all five parties, would be an important step forward, not just for politics, but for the further normalisation of society in Northern Ireland.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T14:05:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_7">I thank the Minister for his response and I hope this intensive phase of the talks will draw to a successful conclusion. The need for such a conclusion is evidently demonstrated by the report on paramilitary activity, which makes for stark reading, and the attendant problems for communities on both sides of the Border. As the House knows, that report points out that individual provisional IRA members remain involved in criminal activity, such as large-scale smuggling, and there have been isolated incidents of violence, including murders. The report also points out the illegal activities and the unacceptable activity of other paramilitary groups that have no place in society either, such as the UVF, the Ulster Defence Association and the INLA.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> There is an urgent need to have all of these issues dealing with the legacy of the past and ongoing criminal activity dealt with in a comprehensive manner. The Minister would be aware that last March, I brought legislation to the House calling for the establishment of an all-Ireland cross-Border forum. This would comprise members of An Garda Síochána, the PSNI, our customs service, the Northern Ireland customs service, the Environmental Protection Agency and its counterparts north of the Border and other relevant statutory agencies. I welcome the fact the Minister has indicated he is thinking along those lines. Will he assure us that the establishment of such an agency, with a remit and focus to deal with criminality on both sides of the Border, will be a central part of the ongoing all-party discussions in Stormont and will he assure us that such a body will have an important remit to deal with the outstanding issues arising from paramilitary activity?</p>

          <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T14:05:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_9">The recent assessment report makes for sober reading. It states that all the main paramilitary groups operating during the period of the Troubles remain in existence, including the Provisional IRA and a number of loyalist groups and organisations. The assessment adds that the structures of the Provisional IRA remain in existence, but in a much reduced form, and that the leadership of the Provisional IRA remains committed to the peace process and the group is not involved in terrorist activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> In the context of the ongoing negotiations and talks, it is important that we read these reports, not only the report of the PSNI but also the report of An Garda Síochána, in their entirety and not be selective in our quotes. Nevertheless, I agree with Deputy Smith that the continuation of any paramilitary activity is unacceptable and unsustainable and must be ended. We have the opportunity in the current talks process to ensure that all parties commit to that objective.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_5">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_11">Those of us who are privileged to be public representatives on this island should reflect that we all have a mandate to implement the Good Friday Agreement. That agreement received over 94% support in the referendum in our State and well over 70% north of the Border. It behoves all of us in public life on this island to work ceaselessly to ensure that its provisions and those of subsequent agreements are implemented in full. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that every effort is made in these talks to progress as many aspects as possible of the Good Friday Agreement and to implement measures contained in the other agreements without further delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> I am concerned by the legislation proposed by the British in respect of dealing with the legacy of the past. I think it was Mr. Mark Durkan, MP for Foyle, who stated very clearly that the proposed legislation in its present form fell short of the commitments that were made in the Stormont House Agreement last December. I ask the Minister to give us an assurance that such legislation will be adequate to ensure that the measures proposed in the Stormont House Agreement are implemented.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_6" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_13">It is important that all parties under the facilitation of the two Governments commit themselves to the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement. I am listening closely to what the Deputy has said in that regard. Let me assure the House that it was always the intention that the current round of talks would be focused and intensive. There is no doubt that in recent days the talks have intensified and I expect this to continue. Both the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, and I will be in Belfast between now and the end of this week. The urgency indicated by the First Minister, Mr. Robinson, and the deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, in recent days reflects my own sense that an agreement can be reached within a very short timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> I must acknowledge that some challenges remain, with a number of crucial gaps that need to be bridged between the participants. It is not just a question of timing or of bringing matters to an urgent conclusion. It is also an issue of substance. It is important that all elements of the talks - the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement on the one hand, including questions around finance and welfare reform, and dealing with the legacy of the past, with reference to what Deputy Smith has said, as well as the impact and legacy of paramilitarism - be fully addressed now while we have the opportunity. These matters must be addressed in a meaningful way in advance of any agreed outcome.</p>

            <p eId="para_16">As the Minister knows, conditions in Palestine are among the worst faced since its illegal occupation. We have all seen pictures on camera phones and cannot hide the reality of what is actually happening during the occupation. We have also heard eyewitness reports. Gaza is the world's biggest prison and the inhuman occupation of the West Bank and east Jerusalem negatively affects every facet of daily life. Since 13 September, 73 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli authorities while 2,200 have been arrested and 2,250 injured, many by plastic bullets. The international community has largely remained silent. I have not heard any statement from the Minister on the recent human rights and international violations. I know he is busy with the talks and so on but what are his plans in the face of such blatant violations? Has he raised the issue with the Israeli authorities or with his European counterparts?</p>

            <p eId="para_17">The clearly deteriorating situation in Palestine and east Jerusalem, which is now spreading to other areas, is a matter of very great concern. The main factors are the operation of policies on the ground intended to push Palestinians out of Jerusalem in favour of settlers, the absence of any political process that might promise an end to this situation and, among Palestinians, the consequent loss of authority by political leaders and loss of belief in a political path forward. Tensions have been increased in recent months by a provocative challenge by minority elements in Israel to the long-respected <i>status quo</i> of the holy places and sites in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p eId="para_18">To these now have been added a genuine alarm and fear among Israeli citizens caused by a number of sudden attacks, resulting in pressure for a tougher response by the authorities. The risk of an escalating spiral of violence is now very obvious. </p>
            <p eId="para_19"> In common with others, I deplore any resort to violent attacks on civilians, be they prompted by revenge or a sense of despair. Any response by the security forces needs to be proportionate. It is the job of local leaders on all sides to go beyond this and a mere security response and to address the underlying issues. I again urge all sides to refrain from any provocation and call on Israel to make clear - in practice as well as words - that the <i>status quo</i> on the Temple Mount will be restored and respected. I note that President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu have already taken some steps in this direction and I encourage them to continue. </p>
            <p eId="para_20"> More broadly, these events underline the message I have conveyed at international level since I took office. Political leadership, including from the international community, needs to address the problems of the relentless expansion of settlements and the absence of any process aiming at the end of the occupation.</p>

            <p eId="para_21">I do not disagree with anything in the Minister's statement. We all want to see an end to violence but the reality seems to be that the Israeli Government continues its occupation, oppression and apartheid policies and Palestinians are subjected to extra-judicial killings. This is the most extreme and right-wing government Israel has had and its promotion of hate and impunity continues to kill the hopes and aspirations of Palestinians. In recent weeks, we have seen the spectacle of Prime Minister Netanyahu seeking to shift the blame for the crimes of the Holocaust from Hitler to the Palestinians.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> I want to hear what we can do as a small country and what Europe can do. What will it take for Europe to act finally on these gross violations of international law? When will Ireland take a principled stance and demand an end to the preferable trade association agreement Israel enjoys? We can all see that it is getting worse. What action will we see, particularly from ourselves?</p>

            <p eId="para_23">Many of us have seen the most disturbing video clips in recent times of civilians on both sides being killed. Some Israeli citizens have been murdered in clearly sectarian attacks. A greater number of Palestinian civilians have been killed, many of whom have not been directly involved in any attack. There are also concerns that so many of the attackers, despite lacking firearms, were shot dead rather than captured. I agree with Deputy Crowe that if this spiral of violence is not stopped, these tragedies will continue to mount. I repeat my clear call for an end to attacks on civilians.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> Ireland continues to play a most important role at international level. The EU has stated clearly that all violence against civilians must end and that both sides should avoid any provocation. In addition, the EU has underlined that the lack of any clear political path is clearly exacerbating the sense of hopelessness that may have fuelled some of the recent attacks. I ask the Deputy and other Deputies to read carefully the content of an address by EU High Representative Federica Mogherini following her visit to Israel and Palestine two weeks ago.</p>

            <p eId="para_25">During the past ten years, more than 11,000 attacks have been perpetrated by illegal Israeli settlers against the occupied Palestinian population and their properties. Does the Minister not agree that settlements are one of the biggest obstacles to peace? Will he push for an EU ban on the entry into the EU of goods produced in illegal settlements? If we cannot get this agreement, will he push for unilateral action?</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> I raised this with the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and there was talk at that time it would be seriously considered. Would the Minister even consider the possibility of blacklisting illegal and violent settlers who want to enter the European Union? That has been suggested. The symbolism and impact of this would be very important. This is a call for action today. We can say we are concerned about what is happening and so on but unless we actually do something, the call for calm, peace and dialogue will fall on barren ground and we will not achieve anything. I appeal to the Minister to come forward with some unilateral action that Ireland can take on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_27">I confirm that as far as Ireland and the Irish Government are concerned, a negotiated two-state solution is our goal. It has been for some time and continues to be. It also continues to be the objective of the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> With particular reference to the settlements, the EU has consistently asserted that they are illegal and has condemned their continued expansion and all policies associated with that. I had the opportunity earlier this year to visit some of the land adjacent to the expanded settlement area and expressed my concern in a meeting with former foreign Minister, Mr. Lieberman. I do so on every occasion when I have an opportunity to register a complaint on behalf of the people of Ireland. I again assure the House that the EU continues to prepare guidelines to ensure that settlement goods may not be labelled in a misleading manner. I raised this earlier in the year. Following the intervention of the Irish Government on numerous occasions, this issue remains very much at the top of the agenda at European Foreign Affairs Council level. I expect to see progress on the issue of settlement goods on 11 November, and will be happy to report to the Deputy on that progress.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">I thank the Deputy for asking this question. It is one in which I have taken a very active role since becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade last year. Significant resources in Cairo and Dublin continue to be deployed in the provision of comprehensive consular assistance to this citizen. The key focus of our extensive engagement on this complex and sensitive case remains securing this citizen’s best interests in so far as we can, working to see him released by the Egyptian authorities at the earliest opportunity and providing consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention. I have had numerous discussions with my Egyptian counterpart about this case. My officials and I have extensive contact with the Egyptian ambassador in Dublin and there has been ongoing contact between our ambassador and embassy in Cairo and the Egyptian authorities. The Taoiseach also raised this case with President el-Sisi in September in New York. We continue to be in extensive contact with other international partners who have had citizens in similar situations.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> This exceptional level of action has been taken by the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade because of the exceptional nature of this case: he was a minor at the time of his arrest and the group nature of his trial gives rise to particular concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_33">I will continue to take all appropriate action that I believe to be in the best interests of this citizen. However, the reality is that any decision to release this citizen will ultimately be taken by the Egyptian authorities, not by the authorities in Dublin. Given that the trial is ongoing, the Government exercises care and caution to ensure its actions, both in public and private, will be well judged and not detract from our key goal of securing positive progress for this citizen at the earliest possible time. I am aware that there are those, including some in this House, who do not agree with the Government's approach, but I appeal to all those who have this citizen's best interests in mind to ensure their actions and public statements are not such that they could jeopardise our considered and concerted efforts to achieve positive progress for this citizen and his release at the earliest opportunity.</p>

            <p eId="para_34">Notwithstanding what the Minister said, is it not clear that far more pressure needs to be put on the Egyptian Government regarding the need for the immediate release of Ibrahim Halawa? He is not just an Irish citizen in an Egyptian jail; he is, to my knowledge, the only European Union citizen in an Egyptian jail on a political charge. Is it not clear that the Irish Government should demand action that will avoid a trial? This is not a normal country with a normal judicial process. It is a dictatorship where 400 or 500 people have been put in a cage and are being tried together on charges that carry the death sentence. Has the Minister studied the case of the Australian journalist Peter Greste who was held on trumped-up charges but who was freed under law 140 of the Egyptian code, which provides for the deportation of an accused foreign national in Egypt to be dealt with under the law of his or her home state? Should the Minister not call for a presidential decree that this law be invoked? The Minister said the Taoiseach had met President el-Sisi in New York on the margins of the United Nations. Can the Minister tell us what was said and what the President of Egypt said in response? This information has not been relayed to the family.</p>

            <p eId="para_35">I assure the Deputy that the Government has formally supported several applications that have been made by lawyers acting for and on behalf of this citizen for his release on bail and under a presidential decree. As an example of our ongoing interest in and commitment to this case, within the past hour I spoke at length to my colleague, the Egyptian foreign Minister, Mr. Sameh Shoukry. I spoke to him on a number of occasions during the summer. This afternoon my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Sean Sherlock, will meet the Egyptian ambassador in Dublin. We will continue at every level, including at the level of the Taoiseach, to raise this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> I assure the Deputy that the family of this citizen is being and will continue to be kept fully informed of all developments. We have made numerous visits to the citizen in prison, most recently by our newly appointed ambassador to Cairo earlier this week. Every opportunity will be taken, both legally and politically, to ensure an earlier return.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> I have studied the case of the two journalists and assure the Deputy that we have addressed the issue on the international stage. I have discussed it with my ministerial colleagues from the country of origin of the two journalists to whom the Deputy refers.</p>

            <p eId="para_38">The European Union has substantial trade and other links with Egypt. Has the Minister made any strenuous representation to those in the appropriate senior positions in the European Union that they should put pressure on the Egyptian Government for the release of Ibrahim Halawa? The British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, is scheduled to meet President el-Sisi this week. Has the Minister had the opportunity to raise this issue with the British Prime Minister? To my knowledge Mr. Halawa is the only European Union citizen under unjust political detention in Egypt.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> I understand the Minister was in Cairo on 12 October to discuss funding for the people of Gaza, which I fully support, of course. Has he brought back any first-hand report on the Ibrahim Halawa case from that visit?</p>

            <p eId="para_40">I have not been to Cairo in recent times. However, on my visit to Cairo last year I certainly had an opportunity to raise the issue. As recently as 1 p.m. this afternoon I had the opportunity of direct engagement on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> On the specific issue the Deputy raised regarding the international journalist, it is very clear to me from all the contacts I have made and from studying the various documentation that the position of the Egyptian authorities is such that the current trial process must be permitted to take its course before consideration can be given to any application for a presidential decree. Any decision is ultimately one for the Egyptian authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> I assure the Deputy that I have raised the issue on the international stage and will continue to do so. In particular I have raised it with High Representative, Federica Mogherini, high-level persons within the European Parliament and also with the foreign Ministers of the countries of origin of the journalists to whom the Deputy refers. Every effort will continue to be made until we see this citizen back on Irish soil.</p>

            <p eId="para_44">The establishment of a peacefully co-existent Israel and Palestine in light of long-standing violence in the Middle East would prove a substantial pillar of stability in ongoing efforts to stabilise that region. In recent weeks, High Representative Mogherini has taken part in meetings with the Quartet and bilateral discussions with the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, and President Abbas. Have new initiatives arisen from these interactions to bolster the Middle East peace process at European Union level in light of fresh violence in the Israel-Palestine conflict? We all know that stalemate in the peace process leads to increasing violence, despair and needless loss of life.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">I have long warned of the danger of a peace process that is effectively in suspension and not visible on the ground. As I have previously reported to the House, I have consistently argued in the Foreign Affairs Council that the EU needs to retain a focus on the conflict in Israel and Palestine and to do more.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> I am encouraged that High Representative, Federica Mogherini, has shared my concern, even in the face of many competing international crises.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">In recent months, the Foreign Affairs Council has begun to consider what more the European Union can do and I expect that discussion to continue at the Council in November.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> In her remarks to the European Parliament last week, High Representative Mogherini listed twin priorities of action on the ground to reduce tensions and rebuild confidence and to build the conditions for renewed negotiations for the resumption of the peace process. During her visit to the region in the previous week, she stressed that message to both Israeli and Palestinian leaders.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> We all know that we are at a most difficult point for the start of such an endeavour. Mistrust and misunderstanding between the two sides are perhaps higher now than they have been for many years. It is hoped the recent tragic events have opened the eyes of all responsible leaders to the price of the current inaction. If a political path is not laid out to bring an element of assurance and the current unacceptable occupation to an end, we will continue to see a further deterioration in relations in what is a tragic situation. I will have an opportunity to resume debate at European Union level at the next meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, which I understand is due to be held the week after next.</p>

            <p eId="para_50">I exhort the Minister to ensure this issue will be on the agenda for every single Foreign Affairs Council meeting. He is aware that violent clashes erupted in September between Israeli security officials and Palestinians at the al-Aqsa mosque compound in east Jerusalem. Unfortunately, we have since witnessed once again a new wave of violence and a number of fatalities on both sides of the conflict. The violence continues to put at further risk the viability of a two-state solution. The Minister is also aware that one of his predecessors as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr. Brian Lenihan Snr., launched that policy and that this was the first European Union country to outline the policy and commit itself to it. Will he inform the House of the efforts being made to de-escalate the violence and come to an agreement, in particular on the disputed holy sites, which have become an issue in recent times, with the many other issues of conflict and the necessity to protect innocent people from further violence to themselves and their communities?</p>

            <p eId="para_51">It is important that every effort be made on the part of politicians both in the region and on the international stage to ensure there is a meaningful process, without which people on both extremes resort to violence. It is important in the first instance that a measure of respect be shown to the <i>status quo</i> on the matter of holy places and sites. Full respect must be restored and maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> It is the continued view of the Government that a negotiated two-state solution is the objective and the most important goal of this country and the European Union. It is important that we ask the question of what the alternative is. There does not appear to be any convincing response other than the continued objective of a two-state solution. That will involve vision and leadership, which must primarily come from within the Israeli and Palestinian groups. The international community has a role to play. It is important that it continue to persevere and that we do not under any circumstance abandon hope, as we have a strong and positive role to play in bringing the parties together around the table. From our perspective on the island of Ireland, we may have a continued positive and active role to play in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_54">As the beneficiary of international support for its own peace process, Ireland has a moral duty to find its voice and to use it to oppose the continuing violence in Israel and Palestine. I reiterate that, together with colleagues in government, the Minister must take every opportunity in every forum available, be it at the United Nations, the European Union or other international fora, to continue to highlight the injustice being perpetrated on innocent people in that region, as well as the need to move that peace process forward in a meaningful way. While all Members are committed to the two-state solution, the continuous annexation of lands by the Israelis makes that particular solution even more problematic.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> To conclude, has the Minister engaged recently with either the Palestinian or Israeli representatives in Ireland regarding the present tensions in that region and, in particular, its escalation since September? Is the Minister aware of new initiatives being taken by the international community to try to progress some of the measures contained in previous agreements that would have brought some progress to different aspects of the conflict? Are efforts being made by the international community to advance or bring into being the aforementioned agreements that were signed some time ago?</p>

            <p eId="para_57">It is important that the international community continues to exhort, influence and advocate, in so far as it can, continued encouragement for the two-state solution. I believe it is important in the first instance that measures be taken to de-escalate the violent activity in Jerusalem and the region. The expansion of the settlements continues to narrow the window of possibility of bringing together both sides in an atmosphere of constructive engagement. I have raised these issues consistently in the context of my discussions with Israeli representatives and interlocutors. I keep in contact with representatives of the Palestinian mission in Dublin and of the Israeli Embassy. It is important that the international community continue to show engagement and I expect fresh initiatives in the coming months. I expect the matter will be high on the agenda of the forthcoming meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, after which I will be happy to report to the Deputy and the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_60">104. <b>Deputy Seán Crowe</b> asked the <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</b> if he is aware of the twin bombing attack on a peace rally in Ankara, Turkey, which was organised by the People's Democratic Party; that the death toll currently stands at 102, according to the public prosecutor’s office; that this is the third such attack at the party's rallies since June 2015; that it is the only party to be targeted like this; and his plans to express concerns over the apparent inability of the Turkish security services to protect its citizens attending such peaceful rallies, especially in the run-up to elections due to be held on 1 November 2015.

            <p eId="para_61">This question to the Minister was tabled before the elections in Turkey took place and concerned the attack in Ankara in which 102 people were killed. I asked whether the Minister was concerned about the lack of security services to protect citizens attending peaceful and democratic rallies, especially during the run-up to the election. I note that three months earlier, there was a bombing in Suruç after which the Turkish Government rounded up 2,500 people, the majority of whom were Kurds, who had been the victims of the attack in Suruç. In addition, 114 members of ISIS are supposed to have been lifted as part of that response. However, this has moved on to the question of the election itself and the next question I will ask the Minister is whether he is concerned about what happened.</p>

            <p eId="para_62">The appalling attack on the peace rally in Ankara on 10 October, in which 102 people lost their lives and many more suffered serious injuries, was shocking to us all. I wish to reiterate my condemnation of this attack, which the Turkish authorities believe was carried out by individuals linked to Islamic State. In a statement, I expressed my condolences to the families of the deceased, to those who were injured, and to the people of Turkey. I personally visited the Turkish Embassy and signed the book of condolences. I offer my condolences once more today in the House. The ambassador of Ireland in Ankara was among a group of EU ambassadors who visited the site of the attack on 12 October and laid flowers in tribute to the victims.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">I also condemn the earlier terrorist attacks, including on a People’s Democratic Party, HDP, rally in south-eastern Turkey on 5 June and a Kurdish youth centre in southern Turkey on 20 July. It is worrying that the terrorist attacks have largely focused on HDP-related events. I regret the resurgence of violence in Turkey. The integrity of the democratic process must be respected at all times. There is no place for violence in this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> The Turkish authorities have strongly committed to doing everything in their power to ensure the safety of all Turkish citizens, including by increased security measures. In this context, it is welcome that the elections which took place on Sunday, 1 November, were held in a largely peaceful manner. The breakdown of the PKK ceasefire is regrettable. I reiterate my call that all sides exercise the utmost restraint. Ireland is very supportive of the peace process between the Turkish authorities and the Kurds. Through the work of the conflict resolution unit of my Department, financial assistance is provided for an international NGO which has facilitated study visits to Ireland by Turkish and Kurdish MPs, journalists and advisers working for peace.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> Officials in my Department and at our embassy in Ankara will continue to monitor developments in Turkey closely.</p>

            <p eId="para_66">I am surprised by the Minister's reply. On Monday the elections observer, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, observed that the Turkish elections had been unfair and overshadowed by a climate of fear. This echoes the claim made by the HDP that it had been unable to campaign effectively because it had been busy trying to negotiate an end to violence in the predominantly Kurdish south east. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, PACE, went further and denounced the entire process as unfair. I have also heard reports that electricity was cut off in certain parts of the country and of the removal of ballot boxes by army personnel. There were a number of difficulties surrounding the elections, in the run-up to which thousands of people were arrested, many of whom had been the victims of violent attacks. Is the Minister concerned that these statements on how unfair the elections process was contradict his that the election campaign was relatively peaceful? As an outsider looking in, I would have the opposite view.</p>

            <p eId="para_67">Turkey is facing a very difficult and challenging situation, not least following the horrific bombing in Ankara on 10 October. It faces internal and external challenges. It is an extremely important partner of the European Union, in particular, as we frame our collective response to the current migrant crisis. The Turkish elections held earlier this week which followed the inconclusive result in June, therefore, took place in a particularly difficult and sensitive context. The fact that they were held in an open manner is, I believe, not unimportant. I welcome the peaceful conduct of the elections on Sunday and look forward to working with the new government in an open and constructive manner on many issues of mutual concern, both on a bilateral basis and in the context of Turkey's importance as a partner of the European Union. It is important that the elections have taken place in an open and free manner and in accordance with the norms of democracy. The preliminary OSCE report and assessment highlights that election day was largely peaceful, that the elections were organised in a professional manner and that the count process was transparent. However, I accept that there has been robust criticism of the lack of media freedom and that the incidents of violence which characterised the campaign period were real. Nevertheless, it is important that we continue to work with the new government in a spirit of positivity.</p>

            <p eId="para_68">There was a particularly brutal crackdown on the media in the days leading up to the elections. Also, there was an increasingly volatile political climate. Last Wednesday Turkish police raided the offices of the main opposition media company and forced two television companies to close, yet the Minister said there was relative calm. It may appear that there was relative calm from this side of the Irish Sea, but what seemed to be happening in many communities was far from calm. Also, from what we saw on our television screens and reports coming back, clearly there was a problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_69"> The main focus of the last European Council meeting was on the issue of refugees. Many European governments are seeking to use Turkey as a bulwark against refugees seeking to reach the European Union. Is it now part of the narrative that for some reason we ignore Turkey's deplorable human rights record, especially against the Kurds, and its permanent role in the Syrian conflict in dealing with the issue of refugees? Many of the refugees fleeing Turkey are Kurds and sending them back would lead to the creation of even greater human rights violations. Is the Minister saying we are rewarding the Turkish Government for acting as a bulwark against refugees seeking to reach the European Union?</p>

            <p eId="para_70">We will continue to engage with the new Turkish Government on a bilateral basis. I had the opportunity to visit Turkey earlier this year and also through the European Union. I assure the Deputy, lest there be any doubt, that Ireland continues to be a strong supporter of the peace talks between the Turkish Government and the Kurdish Workers' Party. We have been encouraged by the ceasefire which has been in place since 2013 and by a number of positive signals in the meantime. This only makes the recent breakdown of the ceasefire and subsequent violence all the more regrettable. I again urge all sides to exercise maximum restraint and work towards the reinstatement of the ceasfire as soon as possible. Ireland continues to believe a fair and lasting solution to the conflict can only be reached through democratic and peaceful means.</p>

            <p eId="para_72">The question I tabled is now probably dated. I Iistened to the Minister's earlier response to Deputy Brendan Smith's question when he said the talks had entered an intensive stage. There was concern about the lack of engagement. As the Minister knows, there is a crisis in the political institutions in the North which is being facilitated by the failure of the British Government to honour commitments made in previous agreements, the failure of the Unionist political leadership, particularly to face up to loyalist violence, and the British Government's refusal to provide the North with a workable budget. Given the fact that this impacts on the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements, has the Minister discussed this aspect with his British counterparts and urged them to live up to their commitments and provide the North with a workable and sustainable budget?</p>

            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_73">Following the request made by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, and I, together with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers, facilitated the return of all five main parties in Northern Ireland to round table talks. The talks resumed on 21 September and are still continuing in a constructive atmosphere.</p>
            <p eId="para_74"> I have worked closely with the Secretary of State in encouraging all parties to continue to engage constructively in the talks process, both in round table format and the various bilateral and trilateral meetings. My current assessment is that the talks have moved to a more intensive phase. There is a good measure of progress in the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, as well as in dealing with the legacy and impact of paramilitarism. The Stormont House Agreement offers a blueprint for overcoming current difficulties in the Executive, especially in financing, welfare reform and dealing with the legacy of the past. </p>
            <p eId="para_75"> With regard to the budget, the Agreement contained a commitment of close to £2 billion sterling in additional spending capacity for the Northern Ireland Executive. It also included specific financial commitments by the Irish Government in respect of the A5 road to Derry and the reconciliation work of the International Fund for Ireland. While financing and welfare reform is primarily an issue for the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, I have continually encouraged the parties to resolve their differences for the sake of Northern Ireland’s economic stability and the sustainability of public services.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">The British Government has a key role to play in this area and its engagement will, I hope, continue to recognise the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland as a society still addressing the legacy of conflict.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> It is also crucial that the work started by the Stormont House Agreement on establishing institutions to deal with the legacy of the past is completed to ensure justice and truth can bring what healing is possible to victims and survivors of the Troubles and their families.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T14:55:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_78">Sinn Féin is on record as saying it will not be part of the institutions if their function is to implement mass social spending cuts that the Tories in London are dreaming up. We would argue that the Tories have no political mandate in the North.</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> In recent weeks, we have also seen the British Government attempt to breach the Stormont House Agreement on legacy and victims issues. Last week, a group met with the Good Friday implementation committee on this. The Stormont House Agreement clearly sets out a need to provide justice and truth recovery mechanisms for the families of the victims of the conflict. This needs the Irish and British Governments to pass legislation. The draft legislation put forward by the British Government on dealing with the legacy of the past would allow it to regulate the handover of what it terms “sensitive information” to historical inquiries, however.</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> We believe this is a clear breach of the Stormont House Agreement. It is a blatant piece of stroke politics designed to hide the British State’s role as an active and central participant in the conflict, in particular its collusion with loyalist death squads, including those who planted the Dublin-Monaghan bombs. Elements of the British security establishment, with a political oversight that ended up in Downing Street, armed, trained, supplied intelligence, directed and controlled many of these death squads. Considering the British Government is failing to meet its legal responsibilities on dealing with the past, will the Minister urgently raise this issue with the British Government and tackle this latest attempt to narrow the options for truth recovery for families, victims and their representatives?</p>

            <p eId="para_84">I have no doubt we will continue to try to resolve this issue. However, on the legacy issues and the draft legislation put forward by representatives of the British Government, has the Irish Government had any input into that legislation? Is the Minister concerned about this whole area of sensitive security information that the British are putting forward? I know many of the victims’ groups which I have been talking to are certainly concerned about this element of the legislation. Has the Irish Government a view on this legislation proposed by the British Government?</p>

            <p eId="para_85">As Deputy Crowe rightly points out, the British Government has agreed, at the request of the five Northern Ireland parties, to introduce legislation for the various legacy institutions, as envisaged under the Stormont House Agreement. The Bill will be introduced in the Commons in the coming weeks with a view towards having the institutions established in the course of 2016. However, aspects of the status and functions of the legacy institutions are the subject of discussions among the parties. The outcome of these discussions will have an impact on the final shape of the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_86"> I understand the point raised by the Deputy in so far as there are certain concerns over aspects of the detail of the legislation. I, along with my officials, am following the discussions closely and we are contributing to the facilitation of the parties in overcoming any difficult issues that might arise as regards the setting up of these institutions. It is important that all parties continue to focus on the Stormont House Agreement, the promotion of reconciliation, upholding the rule of law, acknowledging and addressing the suffering of victims and survivors and facilitating the pursuit of justice. In the context of the current talks, it is important that all aspects of the Stormont House Agreement are implemented in the interests of everyone in Northern Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_89">I will not repeat fully the reply I gave to Priority Question no. 101. I agree it is important that we do everything we can to avoid a further escalation of the situation into a full-scale conflict. The surrounding region offers a salutary lesson of how much worse things could be. It is important in addressing the situation not to focus on the sufferings or shortcomings of one side because civilian deaths continue to occur on both sides. The address to the current violence must involve the leaders on both sides reacting responsibly and with restraint and reducing rather than stoking up the temperature.</p>
            <p eId="para_90"> Measures by the international community need to be carefully considered at such a sensitive time lest we ourselves contribute to the heightening of tension in the region. High Representative Mogherini, in a recent visit, stressed to both sides the need to de-escalate and avoid provocative actions on the ground as well as to re-open a perspective for political progress. A commitment by Israel to respect the <i>status quo</i> in holy places is clearly one essential element of this process. </p>
            <p eId="para_91"> Ireland has consistently argued for a stronger engagement by the international community, including the European Union, on the issues on the ground which we believe continue to heighten tension and thereby undermine the real prospects for peace. These centre, in particular, on the settlement enterprise. The EU has begun more clearly to follow a clear policy of differentiation between the settlements and Israel, including, so far, action on settlement goods and investment in the settlements. I assure the Deputy that it is my intention to see soon the promised EU guidelines on the labelling of settlement goods and I wrote last Friday to High Representative Mogherini in this regard. I expect the matter to be on the agenda for the forthcoming Foreign Affairs Council meeting. It is essential that such pressures continue beyond the current crisis. In the immediate future, it is important that measures be assisted by the international community to de-escalate the violent activity in Jerusalem and beyond.</p>

            <p eId="para_92">I thank the Minister for his response. Unfortunately the response puts blame on both sides for the escalation in violence in the area. This is the typical response of the Government and shows the failure of diplomatic efforts. There is no doubt but that any reasonable person looking at the context of what is happening will see that 42 Palestinians, including children, have been killed by the Israelis in recent weeks. Ten Israelis have been killed and more than 1,300 Palestinians have been injured. An Eritrean national was shot dead by Israeli security forces because he was mistaken for an Arab. The violence is disproportionate and I believe the onus to be on the Israeli side to engage in the peace process. Rather than publicly trying to derail the peace process, the Israeli side should engage in it.</p>
            <p eId="para_93">That should be the focus of European governments' and of the Irish Government's objectives in dealing with this process as well. The Palestinians have called for restraint and Palestinian security forces have been instructed not to participate in any of the protests, yet the Israeli armed forces continue to kill Palestinian civilians. The onus is on the Israelis to engage in the peace process. The Palestinians want the peace process and they want to talk, but the Israelis do not. Unfortunately, the European Union and the Irish Government through their stance are supporting the Israelis and ignoring the prospects for a peace process.</p>

            <p eId="para_94">I again repeat the call for all sides to exercise restraint. The Irish Government and the European Union continue to state clearly that all violence against civilians must end, that both sides should avoid any provocation and that both sides should respect fully the existing<i> status quo </i>in respect of holy sites and places. In addition, the European Union is underlining that the lack of a political path is clearly exacerbating the sense of despair which may have fuelled some of the recent attacks. All parties should recommit themselves to a renewed effort to work for a political solution to the overall conflict. Only two weeks ago the EU High Representative, Federica Mogherini, visited Israel and Palestine to underline these messages in person. Earlier this year I, too, had the opportunity to visit the region, and last Friday I committed myself to writing on the matter of having this issue high on the agenda for the forthcoming meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on 16 November next.</p>
            <p eId="para_95"> I urge Deputy Pringle to read the High Representative's address to the European Parliament on 22 October last, in which she elaborated on the approach of the European Union. She stated clearly that two goals must be pursued in parallel - first, de-escalation on the ground and, second, perspectives on a political process. These two must go together. This issue continues to be more urgent than ever.</p>

            <p eId="para_96">The Minister referred to despair. There is certainly despair in the individual who attacks civilians with a knife in the face of armed soldiers and armed police. That is the side where the despair is. Unfortunately, the European Union is building and contributing to that despair by continuously kowtowing to the Israelis and not forcing them back to the table and to the peace process. That is where the despair originates. The Israeli soldiers, armed to the teeth and standing at checkpoints and in the streets of Jerusalem, are not despairing. They are relishing the fact that they can take violent action on the Palestinian community. The Minister must stand with the people who are despairing and strongly reinforce the policy that the peace process must take precedence. That can only be done by talking to the Israelis, not by urging calm on both sides on the streets.</p>

            <p eId="para_97">Of course, I agree with the Deputy that any response from a security point of view must be proportionate in the circumstances. However, we must also look to the medium and long term. It is important that we reiterate our goal and objective. A negotiated two-state solution remains the objective of Ireland and of the European Union. It is also important that we acknowledge what some commentators have argued, that the continued expansion of the settlements means that a viable Palestinian state is heading beyond reach. As I said earlier, there is no alternative to the two-state solution, and certainly not one that has been advanced by way of any form of convincing response.</p>
            <p eId="para_98"> I believe viability in the future depends on the parameters and the detail of negotiations in terms of land swaps and other arrangements. A two-state solution is possible but it will require vision and leadership. That leadership and vision must come from, primarily, the Israeli and Palestinian sides. However, the international community continues to have a role to play and Ireland has an important role to play in that context, having regard to our experience of conflict on our island.</p>

            <p eId="para_100">Ireland has a long-standing and internationally respected tradition of contributing overseas aid in various forms, as peacekeepers, mediators and through the work of missionaries, medical and nursing personnel. The contributions of this country through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through other Departments and statutory agencies and, in particular, through Irish Aid in untied overseas aid have repeatedly received international praise.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">The Government commitment in 2011 to provide 0.7% of GNP for ODA has not been reached, although I welcome the increase for 2016. Will the Minister indicate the particular proposals he has to reach 0.7% of GNP, given this has been outlined once again by the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Flanagan?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Sean Sherlock)<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_102">The Government is strongly committed to Ireland’s overseas aid programme and to its place at the heart of our foreign policy. “One World, One Future”, our policy for international development, clearly articulates the Government’s commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP for official development assistance, ODA. This commitment was reiterated by the Taoiseach at the UN Summit in New York in September which adopted a new set of sustainable development goals to guide international development policy and action for the next 15 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_103"> Our track record in support of Ireland’s aid programme is clear. Over the past four years, we have protected and stabilised budget allocations at a time of extraordinary economic difficulty. In that time, we have provided over €3 billion for ODA. We have stated that we would make progress towards the 0.7% target, once economic conditions allow. Now, as our economic recovery gains momentum and becomes more widely established, we can begin to make good on that commitment. On budget day, the Government announced the first substantial increase in the aid budget in over seven years. For 2016, we have provided a total of over €640 million in ODA, an increase of €40 million or almost 7% on the 2015 level. We estimate this will entail a small increase in our ODA-GNP percentage from a projected 0.35% in 2015 to a projected 0.36% in 2016, so we still have a long way to go. The challenge now is to ensure Ireland continues to play a leading role in the comprehensive response to the unprecedented humanitarian crises throughout the globe, especially in Europe’s broader neighbourhood, while ensuring our aid programme remains effective in addressing the root causes of poverty and hunger.</p>

            <p eId="para_104">I thank the Minister of State. The 0.7% of GNP target is proportionate, whether we are in good or in very challenging economic times. The highest level of assistance provided at any time was €920 million in 2008, which was 0.59% of GNP at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_105"> Very respected non-governmental organisations, such as Trócaire, GOAL, Oxfam and Dóchas, have been advocating very strongly on the need for the Government to outline the roadmap to achieve the 0.7% target. This is an issue that needs to be addressed. We are aware the Irish commitment to overseas aid has widespread public support and a survey last year indicated that more than 75% of the public were very strongly in support of increasing ODA, if at all possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_106"> Is the Minister of State satisfied that ODA is going to countries where there is proper accountability and that the programmes are reaching the people most in need in the many countries where there are crises and disasters and where people are in need of practical, day-to-day assistance?</p>

            <p eId="para_107">We continue to maintain a very strong relationship with the NGOs, which are partly funded by the taxpayer through Irish Aid. The issue the UN and the multilateral organisations are trying to grapple with at present is the major challenge of how, globally, governments are going to be able to fund the commitment into the future. To answer the Deputy's question, one of the issues we are now looking at is that of how we manage the dynamic between long-term development goals, such as the eradication of poverty and hunger, and the numerous humanitarian crises that are breaking out, for example, in the Mediterranean, as well as how we manage the interoperability between long-term development goals and humanitarian crises. There is also the question of how we leverage the opportunities within the global private sector. The private sector has a role to play and, within the Department, we are trying to get a greater degree of traction in that relationship which goes beyond mere corporate social responsibility. At the multilateral level, through the UN and other organisations, Ireland has an important role to play.</p>

            <p eId="para_108">As the Minister of State knows, our aid has always been classed as untied aid, which is very important. A substantial part of ODA goes to international agencies such as the UN, the World Health Organization and so on. I read a report recently which suggested that GOAL was able to use the funding provided by our State as leverage to draw down very substantial funding from the British Government, the United States Government and other global players. As a result, there was an exceptionally good return on the seed funding the State provided to GOAL. Is the Minister considering giving momentum to that type of policy and perhaps reducing the assistance we give directly to the international statutory organisations?</p>

            <p eId="para_109">We would openly encourage organisations to interact with each other. We would really like to see a greater degree of consolidation of effort and we do not want to see any duplication of effort. Irish Aid has a track record, through its relationships with organisations like GOAL, of providing the seed funding that then allows GOAL to leverage the opportunities, such as in its response in Syria. If we can encourage a greater degree of that kind of leveraging effort and bring in the private sector, as I said, beyond mere corporate social responsibility, then I believe that pitches Ireland onto a greater global stage. We advocate that policy and we are working towards trying to get a greater degree of traction in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">Last February the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, confirmed "the Government is proposing a statutory framework which will introduce a rent certainty for up to four years". Throughout the year, month by month, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, is quoted as saying he will bring an end to rent instability, he will bring rent certainty, he will bring proposals before Cabinet, he will tackle spiralling rents, which are now his No. 1 priority, and he expects legislation by the end of the year. In June we read that he wanted to tie rent increases to inflation and to bring in temporary rent controls to assist families which are under huge pressure and which are being made homeless on a month by month basis. In September, we had leaks and headlines from Fine Gael sources, with senior Cabinet Ministers saying it will not happen and that they are against the Minister, Deputy Kelly's plan. Worryingly, in a José Mourinho-type response, he then went into the third person and attacked the "anonymous cowards" who are briefing against him.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">Meanwhile, there are 1,500 children in emergency accommodation and Threshold states the number of homeless families will increase from 700 to 1,000 by Christmas. The indecision of the Government is creating further instability in the rental market, with landlords shoving up rents to get in ahead of whatever proposals emerge from the Cabinet. The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, states well designed rent certainty proposals could bring stability and a degree of certainty to the market and that it is somewhat concerned by some of the leaks from the Fine Gael side in regard to the rent certainty and rent control agenda. The commitment last February was that we would see rent certainty by the end of the year, but there was nothing proposed in the budget announced recently. Will we see legislation shortly that will bring about the rent certainty on which the Minister has staked his reputation, saying its introduction is his number one priority, or is the story in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today correct, that his plans are dead in the water?</p>

          <p eId="para_117">We have referred to this issue on a number of occasions in the recent past. A number of issues need to be dealt with in respect of housing generally, including homelessness, whether of rough sleepers or those who do not have a place to stay because they are being put out of their accommodation. A great deal of work has been done on the issue. The Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government had a very good meeting yesterday when they discussed a number of issues that needed attention in both the short and longer term. The real problem is the lack of housing supply. The Government is looking at a range of options to supply the many houses needed, but they cannot be put in place overnight. Yesterday we made progress in our discussions on modular housing, the number of voids being returned to habitable accommodation, the targets set for the social housing objectives of the local authorities - the Minister has called on them to get on with the task of meeting them - and the renovations taking place, particularly throughout Dublin. I expect the progress being made in the case of rough sleepers will help us to meet the need in a bad winter. An extra 130 beds have been opened this year and a further 130 are to be opened. The money is in place to deal with this issue and I expect the issue of rough sleepers, particularly in Dublin, to be dealt with. I hope the two Ministers will conclude their discussions this week on what needs to be done in the short, medium and longer term to deal with the issue of housing supply.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">The Taoiseach hopes they can conclude their discussions this week. We have had the budget and the situation is chaotic. What is going on with the two Ministers is chaotic. They had a good meeting yesterday and we are all supposed to breathe a sigh of relief, after all the leaks, counter-leaks and antagonism of the past two months. This goes back to what happened in February. I asked the Taoiseach a simple question. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, said legislation would be introduced in September to deal with this issue. He said he would link rent increases with the consumer price index, CPI, to the rate of inflation. We are almost at the anniversary of the death of Jonathan Corrie by which the Dáil was appalled, as well as by the issue of homelessness. However, all that has happened in the past 12 months is that the position has got progressively worse. Many Deputies have seen in their clinics young families who have absolutely no certainty about where they will be housed. This is a shocking indictment of the Taoiseach's leadership-----</p>

All we get is the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government calling Fine Gaelers a load of cowards and, in turn, them calling him "Calamity Kelly". That is what we are getting in the media each week, yet families are coming to us to ask us to do something for them. They are spending three nights in a hotel, followed by three nights in a self-catering apartment, and the welfare officer only has €700 to pay out. The position is that bad. Rents have been increasing and are spiralling out of control, which means that families are being evicted.</p>

They will deal with a number of matters in the shorter term. Arrangements must be put in place to deal with the provision and supply of housing in the medium to longer term. As the Deputy is aware, the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, changed the regulations for the housing assistance payment, HAP, programme, which allows for an increase in rent through subsistence from the Department of Social Protection. This gives certainty of tenancy to a category under serious pressure. The provision of modular housing is under way, with a start on sites identified in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> I accept the point made by the Deputy. I am aware of many examples of people who are under serious pressure owing to rents being increased by landlords. Not all landlords are putting pressure on people; I am aware that many landlords show their humanity. The situation is not what we want it to be. There was a total collapse of the housing sector, with the figure falling from 190,000 units to less than 8,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_134">On three separate occasions the Taoiseach has claimed the Government was on the brink of deploying troops onto the streets and introducing capital controls. He told a Fine Gael fund-raiser in October, "The head of the Central Bank came in on a Wednesday and said, I have to tell you Taoiseach that it is probably likely that you will have to put the Army around the ATM machines on Friday. We may well have to print money. We may well have to introduce capital controls." On 20 October the Taoiseach told the Dáil a similar story. Two days later he repeated this tall tale to a meeting of the European People's Party in Madrid. We all know that there were contingency plans in place. We have read about them in Pat Leahy's book, <i>The Price of Power - Inside Ireland's Crisis Coalition, </i>while the banking inquiry was told by the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance that they were developed before the Taoiseach's time in office and continued to be developed during his time. However, what the Taoiseach is claiming is something very different. Both inside and outside this Chamber, he is claiming that, in the estimation of the Governor of the Central Bank, a moment had come when he thought it necessary to suggest to the Taoiseach that he should put these plans into action. The Taoiseach has given the impression that somehow within 48 hours, he had thwarted disaster and saved us all from catastrophe. Before we start erecting statues to his glory, will he finally clarify some matters for the Dáil and citizens? What was the event that led Professor Honohan on that Wednesday to suggest to the Taoiseach that he should deploy troops on the streets of the State on that Friday? What week is the Taoiseach talking about and how was this issue resolved?</p>

The reality, as the Deputy well knows, is that for a prolonged period in 2011 and 2012 there was massive instability in the eurozone with the economic circumstances that applied in a number of countries. People were openly questioning whether the currency would survive in its current form. That is why I make no apology to anybody for putting in place, as head of Government, with the agencies of Government, contingency plans to deal with the possibility of a total collapse of the euro currency.</p>

          <p eId="para_150">Emergency structures to manage that crisis, to be overseen by Government, were designed and designed very carefully and would have been activated if necessary. That work was carried on in secret by a small number of officials from the Department of Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency. Given the scale of what might have happened, which I am thankful did not happen, the full resources of the State would have been mobilised, including the Garda and the Defence Forces. It is always clear that in the change from one currency to another currency, or in a changed currency, these issues, including capital controls, are always discussed. It would have been necessary to pass emergency legislation providing exceptional powers to the local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> While it is not appropriate to give the details of the contingency plans, the issues considered would have clearly dealt with producing, supplying and circulating a new currency, supplying essential supplies of fuel, electricity and medicines and so on - the normal running of any country. It was absolutely appropriate that those discussions around those contingency plans took place. At the end of all of that, had it happened it could have happened very quickly. As the Governor of the Central Bank said, we do not talk about the details of discussions that took place here but there were those discussions that took place between the Department of Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Central Bank and the NTMA about very serious indications that it might have been necessary to introduce those contingency plans. I am glad it did not happen and we are now in a very different spot from those days of early 2011 and 2012.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_152">I asked the Taoiseach a direct question and he has been waffling about contingency plans. I made the point that it is not about the contingency plans. We already know that such plans were drafted. We questioned Professor Honohan on the contingency plans at the banking inquiry. The specific question is the Taoiseach's claims, made at Fine Gael fund-raisers, at his colleagues' meeting of the EPP and in the Dáil on 20 October, that the Governor of the Central Bank, somebody who sits on the General Council of the ECB, came to the Taoiseach on a Wednesday and told him of the need to execute this plan on the Friday. The Governor of the Central Bank has said that any discussions of a contingency plan were in the context of the breakup of the euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> It is important that the Taoiseach clarifies the statements he made on three occasions in the last month. Did the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, walk into the Taoiseach's office, as the Taoiseach claims, on a Wednesday and say that the Army needed to be deployed on the Friday? Did he say to the Taoiseach that he believed the euro was about to break up, or was this a fantasy of the Taoiseach? Was there a dose of reality in these conversations or in what the Taoiseach was saying at the Fine Gael fund-raisers, at the EPP and to the Dáil? Does the Taoiseach believe he needs to correct the record of this House? Did this conversation happen?</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> It is not about the contingency plan. I ask the Taoiseach not to insult my intelligence by referring to contingency plans and the need to have them in place. The question is very clear. The Taoiseach makes the claim that Professor Honohan said to him on a Wednesday that he would need to deploy the Army on the Friday and introduce capital controls. I sit on the banking inquiry. The State has spent close to €5 million getting to the guts of what happened in the crash and also examining the policy responses and the aftermath of what happened when trying to restore the credibility of our banking sector. It is crucially important that the Taoiseach clarifies the situation. Were we within 48 hours, as he claims, of seeing the break-up of the euro and introducing a new currency in the State?</p>

          <p eId="para_155">Maybe Deputy Doherty did not listen to me in the House. What I did say was that the context of these discussions took place against a background where there was a very serious set of economic circumstances applying right through 2011 and 2012. The discussions that took place within those circumstances warranted putting in place a strategy that would deal with an eventuality where the euro might collapse. Those discussions took place on a number of occasions and the participants in those discussions were officials from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance, the NTMA and the Central Bank. We referred to that in the past. That is where the discussions took place and against that background. As I say, I make no apology for having to deal with the clear warning signs that were there about the economic collapse and the collapse of the euro.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">Deputy Fitzmaurice raised a general point about transplants. It is a matter for people who may wish to supply organs for transplant, which is a very good thing to do. Not everybody has the courage or mentality to do that but it is something which is being constantly promoted and which I support.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> I am aware of the situation concerning Dr. David Hickey. The pancreatic transplant service has been transferred to St. Vincent's University Hospital in Dublin with support from Edinburgh. This is a specialist area. I do not think anybody who has been treated or has had a family member treated in centres of excellence for cancer can complain about the professionalism that applies in a centre of excellence. The new service for pancreatic transplants in St. Vincent's University Hospital will go live this month. St. Vincent's University Hospital has appointed a number of new consultants and the service will start in January. It is anticipated that heart and lung transplants will be up this year but kidney transplants will be down. It is important to say that the transplant programme requires the support of people who wish to be organ donors. The Minister has indicated that the new service in St. Vincent's University Hospital will be structured differently from that in Beaumont Hospital and will not be dependent on any one individual. It is expected that this new service in St. Vincent's University Hospital will be exceptionally high-level. </p>
          <p eId="para_177"> The Minister has also informed me about Organ Donation and Transplant Ireland, which is led by Professor Jim Egan with additional staff to identify suitable organs for transplant, and the living donor programme, which aims to get even more people to donate and involves the Department and the HSE covering the expenses involved. There is encouragement there for people to consider becoming donors. It is has always been difficult and requires specialist centres. What the Minister has done in transferring this service following the retirement of Dr. David Hickey to St. Vincent's University Hospital with consultants appointed and a first-class operation will add greatly to the comfort and health of those patients.</p>

          <p eId="para_178">Is it not ironic that what appears to be the first time the Taoiseach has heard about this is through bits of paper pushed in front of him telling him what is going on around the country? Let us not forget that Dr. David Hickey was pushed. He was forced to retire. The Taoiseach has now admitted that since 1 January, and we are now talking about next January, there have been no pancreatic transplants in this country. Is it not serious for the Taoiseach to say that the Minister has done nothing for a full year to resolve this issue? Dr. David Hickey pioneered transplants in Ireland, is recognised worldwide and has offered to help the next generation in a voluntary capacity, which is unusual. Why will the Taoiseach and the Minister not meet this man and drive this forward for the betterment of the people of this country?</p>

          <p eId="para_179">I resent the Deputy's comment about bits of paper. If the Minister for Health wishes to give the detail of an issue raised by the Deputy here, it is only right and appropriate that he does so. I am well aware of the change from Beaumont Hospital to St. Vincent's University Hospital and that the new programme is due to commence very shortly. There are difficulties in recruiting transplant consultants in Beaumont Hospital. The Minister, the Department and the HSE are working to make that situation more attractive. If the Deputy has an issue with Dr. Hickey being, as he said, pushed out, he should raise it directly with the HSE and the hospital management by way of a parliamentary question or Topical Issue matter. What is important here is that a new transplant situation applies in St. Vincent's University Hospital where consultants have been recruited and the programme is to start in January. It is expected that the pancreatic transplant programme will go live in advance of this. The projected date is mid-November subject to patients on the list being assessed by a multidisciplinary team, which will meet next week. I understand that arising from this meeting, seven patients who are suitable for pancreatic transplants will be listed.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_112">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_214">I propose take Questions 1 to 34, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_215"> For some time but certainly over the past four months, the European agenda has been dominated first by the negotiations over Greece's financial situation and now by the migration crisis which has seen such dreadful human suffering as people flee war and insecurity in search of a better life. It is no surprise that these two themes were the main focus of the European Council meetings in June, September and October. The Greek issue also necessitated three European summits - one in June and two in July. Of course, the European Council also discussed other issues on which I have reported to the House and which I will recall in this answer.</p>
            <p eId="para_216"> Going back to the first of those European Councils, I recall that I reported to the House on 1 July in some detail on the outcome of the European Council of 25 and 26 June. At that meeting Heads of State and Government had urged Prime Minister Tsipras to make every effort to conclude an agreement and put an end to the instability which was having such a detrimental effect on the Greek economy and people. At the time negotiations were being taken forward with the institutions and by Finance Ministers through the Eurogroup. However, following the breaking off of negotiations by the Greek Government, the holding of a referendum on 5 July and the radical deterioration of Greece's financial position, it was felt the situation in Greece required a special European summit meeting on 7 July.</p>
            <p eId="para_217"> It was agreed that the Greek Government would on Thursday, 9 July at the latest present proposals for a comprehensive and specific reform agenda for assessment by the three institutions and presentation to the Eurogroup. The Eurogroup considered these proposals at meetings on 11 and 12 July prior to the European summit. I attended the special meetings on 7 July and 12 and 13 July. After lengthy and difficult discussions the European summit reached agreement on a series of measures that enabled negotiations on a third programme of assistance to begin between Greece and the institutions. Satisfactory progress in these negotiations and the implementation by Greece of a number of very demanding conditions allowed for political agreement to be reached at Eurogroup level on 14 August and for a first disbursement of additional support on 20 August.</p>
            <p eId="para_218"> Throughout all of the European Council and European summit negotiations I expressed Ireland's understanding and empathy with the difficult situation faced by the Greek people. I highlighted our willingness to negotiate a way forward and achieve a sustainable solution that would take account of the realities of the situation in Greece, while also respecting existing commitments. I stressed our determination to ensure Greece could continue as a member of the euro area. At both of the European summits in July I intervened along these lines and participated in the summit's negotiations on the texts of the conclusions. The negotiations were, undoubtedly, very difficult and Greece remains in a very challenging situation. However, if the agreed measures continue to be taken forward swiftly in accordance with the commitments made, there is a real basis for Greece, with the support of partners, to return to stability and growth within the euro area. That is the objective towards which all countries have worked and will continue to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_219"> The issue of youth unemployment was not specifically discussed at the European summits. However, the importance of supporting growth and job creation in Greece as part of an overall agreement was fully recognised and is reflected, in particular, in the final paragraph of the 12 July European summit conclusions which deals with the funding of investment in Greece, in drawing on up to €35 billion from the EU budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_220"> I have had no scheduled bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Tsipras. I did, of course, see and speak to him at the European summit meetings and the European Council meetings and sent a letter of congratulations following his re-election on 20 September.</p>
            <p eId="para_221"> The extraordinary European Council meeting on 23 September was entirely dedicated to the issue of migration. The meeting of the European Council on 15 October dealt with several issues of importance to the Union but the discussion focused, above all, on migration. Over the course of both European Council meetings Heads of State and Government agreed to take a number of further steps as part of the European Union's comprehensive response to the crisis. These focused on co-operation with countries of origin and transit, particularly Turkey, strengthening the European Union's external borders, managing the influx of refugees to Europe and addressing root causes, including through seeking to resolve the conflicts in Syria and Libya.</p>
            <p eId="para_222"> There were also short discussions at the October European Council on the five Presidents' report on completing economic and monetary union and on the UK proposals for EU reform, with an understanding that the European Council would return to both issues in December. President Hollande made a presentation in advance of the Global Conference of the Parties on Climate Change, which will open in November in Paris, and the European Council also noted the publication of the international and independent report on the downing of flight MH17 over Ukraine. I delivered a comprehensive statement on the October European Council to the House on 20 October. </p>
            <p eId="para_223"> To turn again to the issue of migration, people have been shocked and saddened by the human consequences of the deepening crisis. The European Council has worked hard to meet the political and organisational challenges it poses. The Irish response to the migration crisis has been prompt and active and we continue to be engaged across a number of fronts. We have consistently emphasised the need for a compassionate, practical and comprehensive approach to tackling the crisis, aimed at achieving a Iong-term and sustainable solution. I set out the details in my recent statement on the October European Council. There is broad agreement that a comprehensive approach is required for this complex issue, one which addresses immediate humanitarian needs and the various factors which contribute to the huge flows of people. Progress is being made on many of the measures agreed at the June, September and October meetings, including in reinforcing internal solidarity within the Union, reviewing practical measures that can be applied to strengthen the European Union's external borders developing "hotspots", that is, specific locations for the processing of asylum appeals and increasing co-operation with, or support for, those countries from which most migrants originate or through which they pass. </p>
            <p eId="para_224"> As ever, Ireland stands ready to play an appropriate part in the collective EU response to the crisis. Although we are not a participant in some areas such as FRONTEX operations which consider the external borders, we will complement these efforts with our own national initiatives consistent with our common travel area with the United Kingdom and our non-membership of the Schengen area. For example, Ireland intends to provide six liaison officers to work on the issue of relocation from within the European Union. </p>
            <p eId="para_225"> The question of a possible future European border guard system was discussed at the emergency meeting of Heads of State and Government in September and again at the October Europe Council. This is, of course, for Schengen member states to consider in the first instance. It is clear, however, that much more remains to be done. The situation on the ground remains extremely challenging. </p>
            <p eId="para_226"> Follow-up work on the decisions already taken and the commitments made is being taken forward by Justice Ministers, in particular. There will be a further special meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 9 November. In addition, in Brussels on 25 October there was an emergency meeting convened by President Juncker of leaders from the countries, EU and non-EU, particularly affected by migration through the western Balkans route.</p>
            <p eId="para_227"> One of the central components of the European Council discussions was co-operating with third countries. Turkey is paramount in this regard. The October European Council in its formal conclusions expressed its condolences to the people of Turkey following the Ankara bomb attack and pledged its support to fight terrorism. The Commission has accelerated co-operation in recent weeks and on the eve of the October European Council negotiated an action plan aimed at supporting Turkey in its current challenge of hosting over 2 million refugees from Syria and enlisting its assistance in reducing the migration flow. The European Council gave its support to the Commission by welcoming the action plan and signalled its openness, in return, to helping Turkey to work within existing frameworks towards visa liberalisation and a range of enhanced political and economic co-operation measures. It was recognised that the accession process needed to be re-energised in accordance with the negotiating structures and relevant Council conclusions which set out the procedures and criteria which had to be respected. </p>
            <p eId="para_228"> The European Council underscored that this comprehensive co-operation agenda had to be based on shared responsibility, mutual commitments and delivery on both sides. No one is under any Illusion about how challenging it will be to achieve the substantive step-up in relations now envisaged. At the same time, Turkey plays a geographically and politically central role in its region and as an EU neighbour and candidate country, it is hard to imagine solutions to the current crisis which do not involve it very substantially. Therefore, we hope rapid progress can be made in the coming period on the issues set out in the action plan. </p>
            <p eId="para_229"> Discussions also touched on the upcoming Valletta summit. This summit will aim at finding agreement with African partners in a fair and balanced manner on tackling the root causes and supporting development, as well as on an effective return and readmission and dismantling the criminal networks that are exploiting the situation and putting lives in danger.</p>
            <p eId="para_230">The European Council discussions in September and October touched on the wider Middle East region, where seeking to end the conflict in Syria and creating conditions to allow for those in exile to return home obviously remain fundamental. The shared view of the Council that the Assad regime bears the greatest responsibility for the more than 250,000 deaths from the conflict and the millions of displaced people was clear. It was also made clear that the only path towards a solution will come through a political process on the basis of the Geneva communiqué of 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_231"> There were no formal items on other specific countries of the Middle East on the agenda of the European Council meetings in June, September or October. However, the situations in Lebanon and Jordan, as well as those in Israel and Palestine, in particular, were briefly mentioned. This was the case in June when there was a progress report on the development of the new European security strategy for the future and again in September when the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, briefed Heads of State and Government on his visit to countries of the region. From Ireland’s perspective, the deteriorating situation in Israel and Palestine, in particular in East Jerusalem, is a matter of very great concern. Violence will not bring a solution to the long-standing challenges facing the Israeli and Palestinian people. I deplore any resort to violent attacks on civilians and urge all sides to refrain from any provocative actions.</p>
            <p eId="para_232"> The October European Council did not discuss the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, report, but Ireland participated fully in the BEPS process and is committed to implementing those aspects which are classified as minimum standards. These relate to country-by-country reporting, tax treaty changes and transfer pricing. Budget 2016 already began making provision in line with some of the BEPS minimum standards and Ireland has now joined the working group tasked with designing the multilateral instrument which will give effect to many of the measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_233"> The European Council did not discuss homelessness in Ireland. I had no scheduled bilateral meetings in the margins of the euro summit meetings or in the margins of the European Council meetings in June, September or October. However, I did speak with several counterparts, including Chancellor Merkel, at those meetings. I met separately with the Italian Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, in Rome on 10 July. During that meeting we reviewed a range of issues on the EU agenda, including the situation in Greece and the migration crisis. We also discussed proposals to enhance our bilateral co-operation. I also discussed a range of important issues with President Hollande during our bilateral meeting in Paris on 3 September. These included the migration crisis, climate change and energy and development relating to Greece, as well as bilateral issues. I met the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, in London on 18 June. Our discussion focused on migration and bilateral co-operation. Of course, we also discussed the UK-EU relationship. </p>
            <p eId="para_234"> There is no doubt that the continuing effects of the economic and fiscal crisis combined with the ongoing challenges of globalisation and demographic change have had consequences for public confidence in EU institutions, as is also the case for national institutions in many countries. However, I believe that a large majority of Europe's citizens still look to the EU as indispensable in ensuring that Europeans can work together to face common challenges. We should also recognise that the current migration crisis has arisen in part because of the EU's success. The EU has evolved to become a beacon of security, stability and prosperity, so much so that people are prepared to risk their lives to seek sanctuary here. The European Council, the Commission and the Parliament have recognised that we must focus relentlessly on the key issues which affect citizens' lives and their futures and I believe that this is reflected in the policy and legislative priorities the institutions have set for themselves, most recently in the Commission's annual work programme which was published on 28 October. I am sorry for the long reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_235">The length of the Taoiseach's reply reflects the difficulty in answering 34 questions in one go. Such a number of questions creates logistical issues and many of these questions were tabled as long as three or four months ago, perhaps even six months ago in some cases. Question No. 1 on immigrants from Africa and the whole migration crisis was tabled when that issue was at its peak and families were travelling across the Mediterranean to seek refuge from war on European soil. Since then, Europe has witnessed the appalling vista of families leaving war-torn Syria, with enormous consequences for instability across the Middle East and creating huge issues for Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_236"> I pay tribute to the members of the Irish Naval Service for their outstanding work, their bravery and their courage in saving hundreds and hundreds of lives. They have spent many months away from their families on behalf of the State and they have done us proud. Can the Taoiseach confirm whether the Irish Navy's time on that mission will be extended? Will additional allowances for members of the Navy on those expeditions now be paid out? The Government has been very quick to bask in the significant afterglow of their achievements but people would like to see a concrete manifestation of that in terms of the claims that have gone in.</p>
            <p eId="para_237"> After years of an unprecedented financial and economic crisis, this is without question the largest humanitarian crisis faced by the European Union since it was formed. Can the Taoiseach outline the number of migrants Ireland will now accommodate from war-torn areas? There has been a lot of hype and publicity and people have spoken in terms of thousands of migrants. Germany received up to 1 million migrants during the summer. Ireland received approximately 100 at the beginning of the year and we are to take in a further 100 by the end of December. Comparing those figures with the headlines makes a mockery of all the hype we have heard over the past number of months. We need a realistic framework and some degree of certainty as to what will actually happen in the next 12 months. Are we really only talking about 200 migrants next year in addition to the 200 this year, or is there a schedule to help people fleeing war-torn areas, specifically the horrors of the Syrian conflict? I commend the efforts that have been made to broker a peace agreement in Syria but we must never forget what Assad has done to his own people, particularly in the most recent bombing campaigns which were quite horrific.</p>
            <p eId="para_238"> In the context of Question No. 2, the Greek leader, Alex Tsipras, was elected and the Taoiseach extended his congratulations to him. He said he was looking forward to working with him but I hope the Taoiseach took the opportunity to apologise for publicly lecturing him and telling him we did not have to increase taxes or VAT to bring down our deficit. That was clearly not true and was one of the Taoiseach's fables, one of the many stories he makes up from time to time. Many economists were surprised and tweeted accordingly when the Taoiseach gave Mr. Tsipras his advice so I hope the Taoiseach put his comments in context when he spoke to Mr. Tsipras. Has the Taoiseach met Mr. Tsipras since his election?</p>
            <p eId="para_239"> Youth unemployment is still very high in Greece, as it is in Ireland where 20.6% of 15 to 25-year olds are without jobs, according to the September CSO figures. The PricewaterhouseCoopers report on youth unemployment in Ireland, published today, does not make for pleasant reading either. PricewaterhouseCoopers found that Ireland was still in the bottom rankings of the OECD in how we are tackling youth unemployment. Was youth unemployment dealt with at European Council level and in the meetings covered by this series of questions? Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the EU, on a pan-European basis, is doing enough to deal with youth unemployment? It is still very high in Ireland, Greece, Spain and the United Kingdom. We compare very badly indeed with Germany, Switzerland and Austria within the OECD framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_240"> In Question No. 31, I asked whether the Taoiseach had been speaking with the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, recently and if he would make a statement on the matter. He was very supportive of the Chancellor in her attacks on Greece and in German intransigence towards Greece.</p>
            <p eId="para_241">Did the Taoiseach speak to her about his claim that the Army would be needed to guard Ireland's ATMs in 2011? If he met her recently, I presume he met her at the European People's Party meeting. At that meeting he spoke to a European audience and said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_242">The Governor told me, it looks like this weekend, a few years ago, you’ll have to put the Army around the banks and around the ATM machines [he used his hands and everything to graphically illustrate what was going to happen] and introduce capital controls like they had in Cyprus. So we’ve pulled back from that brink.</p>
            <p eId="para_243">The Taoiseach was subsequently interviewed and was asked when it happened. He said, "shortly after coming into office", which was in 2011. It is not the euro crisis of 2012 which was about Italy having difficulties or the bigger countries being an issue and Europe not being in a position to backstop any implosion or difficulties in terms of the bigger European Union countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_244"> The Taoiseach made those remarks very much in an exclusively Irish context and he spoke about a very specific meeting with the Governor where he said the Army would be needed. He came in on a Wednesday and he said, "You know, by Friday you might need the Army." I think the Taoiseach let the Irish people down when he said that to a European audience. The Irish people never needed an army to restrain them at any stage of the financial crisis. An army is not needed to guard ATMs; they only need to be switched off.</p>
            <p eId="para_245"> The bank guarantee had been agreed prior to that, as had the troika deal which guaranteed moneys for three years to the Exchequer and to the banks. That is why many people have been scratching their heads over the Taoiseach's remarks. The banks and the sovereign were funded in 2011 - all that had been agreed. When the Government came into office, the troika deal was done and dusted. The guarantee was in place and the Government carried on with the guarantee, bondholders were not burned and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_246"> There is no context for this alleged specific conversation between the Governor of the Central Bank in 2011 or in an exclusively Irish context, which is how the Taoiseach pitched it to his audience. He pitched it very much in an Irish context. Subsequently, I believe the story has been reinvented and to get the Taoiseach off the hook, people are now talking about the euro crisis of 2012, as if that was the context for his remarks.</p>
            <p eId="para_247"> When he was interviewed afterwards, he said, I think, that there was no specific conversation between him and the Governor on this issue. He can correct me if I am wrong in that. I read afterwards that there were denials that there was any specific briefing to the Taoiseach by the Governor regarding the Army.</p>
            <p eId="para_248"> Sources in the Department of Defence and the Central Bank are puzzled by the Taoiseach's remarks. I do not know about the audience in Europe. I do not know if the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, believed him. Did she say she believed him when he said that to the audience? Did she actually believe that in 2011, the Army would be called in that weekend? Did he alert her at the time when the Governor told him that we would need to call in the Army that weekend? Did he telephone her colleagues in Europe to advise that we were facing a crisis?</p>

            <p eId="para_250">I put it to the Taoiseach that it might be best to admit that no such conversation took place and that the Central Bank did not advise the Taoiseach that he would need the Army that weekend, that the Governor did not come in to him on a Wednesday and say that he would need the Army and the Garda to guard the ATMs by the weekend. The Taoiseach made it up, for whatever reasons. That specific conversation never took place. Will the Taoiseach confirm I am right in saying that he made it up? That might be the easiest way around it - that there was no specific conversation.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_116">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_251">I thank the Deputy for his questions. Obviously, the situation around the table at the European Council meeting was one of great seriousness in respect of what has been happening here in recent years. When we saw the first evidence of people losing their lives because of illegal trafficking across the Mediterranean, the efforts made by Italy in particular under the Mare Nostrum programme to save so many people spoke for itself about the flight from Libya and other countries in Africa and from Syria.</p>
            <p eId="para_252"> I accept the Deputy's commendation of the Defence Forces. Three of our naval vessels have rescued several thousand people from the waters of the Mediterranean. I have often made the point that this is part of our own history, having lost thousands to the Atlantic off Grosse Île and Ellis Island. While Ireland is not part of the protocol, I welcomed the Government decision that we should send a Naval Service vessel to assist in this humanitarian relief work. The personnel on those vessels have performed heroically and professionally in the course of their duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_253"> It is the first time in many years that Iran has been involved in investigating the possibility of bringing some conclusion to the war in Syria. As has been pointed out on many occasions by the Carter Foundation in America, unless Russia and Iran are involved in whatever solution can be brokered, this will not end. With more than 1 million people having been assimilated into a small country in south Lebanon, which the Ceann Comhairle visited, more than 1.25 million in a major camp in Jordan and more than 2 million in Turkey, it speaks for itself of the extent of the flight from Syria.</p>
            <p eId="para_254"> I have spoken to the Prime Ministers of some of the smaller Balkan countries who pointed out that 150,000 people have passed through their borders in a very short period of time. Given that they are supposed to be part of the Dublin Convention and the Schengen Agreement, the resources available to many of the smaller countries just do not stand up. It is an horrendous problem that the European Union has not been able to address successfully and practically and it has taken a long time to try to catch up. That is why these so-called "hot-spots" for registration and assessment of people who are coming into Europe are of great importance.</p>
            <p eId="para_255"> If a similar situation were to apply in Ireland where exceptional numbers of people came here for that purpose, the Deputy can imagine the kind of difficulty it would cause here. Obviously, others are now stretched to the limit in terms of the incessant flow of people wanting to come to the European Union. The majority of those in the camps would like to return to their own countries but that will not happen given the continuing war there.</p>
            <p eId="para_256"> As I said in my response, all the meetings since the early part of the summer have been taken up with migration issues and reports from the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms Mogherini, in regard to the situation in Syria and Libya and the very disturbing reports about the horrendous conditions in a number of camps in the Horn of Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_257"> The issue of youth unemployment was not addressed directly but it is a follow-on from other meetings that have been held. I am glad to say that the employment figure is improving in a number of countries, including youth employment. The rate of unemployment is still too high, in particular among young people. In our country, we need a changing analysis at all times as to the circumstances ahead where opportunities, training, apprenticeships, upskilling and appropriate courses for young people might be concerned. That is why the Minister of State, Deputy English, has introduced, through the new apprenticeship council, new areas for apprenticeships, new methods of connecting with business and new communications systems for young people in secondary schools to advise of the ever-changing opportunities that exist in the digital world, the IT world or in any other area.</p>
            <p eId="para_258"> I have dealt with the question of talking to other Prime Ministers. I dealt with the question from Deputy Pearse Doherty about the crisis in the eurozone. I say to Deputy Gerry Adams that I am sorry, as I took his name in vain. I said he was on his way to America. I withdraw that remark. I did not know that he was around.</p>
            <p eId="para_259"> It is true to say the troika was here when the Government was appointed in 2011, but throughout that period and in 2012 there was a crisis of confidence in the eurozone; this country was blocked from entering capital markets-----</p>

            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_293">I am here and I am reassured that the Taoiseach recognises it. However, he did accuse me of being disrespectful to the Dáil in going to the United States and he did not withdraw that accusation. However, I will move on to more serious matters. </p>
            <p eId="para_294"> Most of my remarks will be about refugees. I have often discussed the difficulties in dealing with so many questions and such a range of subjects in such a time. </p>
            <p eId="para_295"> I refer to the work done by the crews of the <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>, the <i>LE Eithne</i> and the <i>LE Niamh</i> which have rescued 8,000 people, the population of a town. It is a huge number of people. This year there have been at least 3,350 confirmed fatalities, which surpasses the entire death toll in 2014. The number of deaths off the Greek islands has surged with the advent of cold weather. Almost 500 men, women and children have died in the past three and a half weeks. The problem is that we have become fatigued by and numb to the number of deaths. We hear in passing that six children or a number of adults have drowned. The Taoiseach has referred to the millions of people fleeing from Syria and those living in horrendous conditions in refugee camps. He acknowledged there had been a drop in public confidence in EU institutions, which is important, but he then went on to say the success of these institutions had partly accounted for the numbers fleeing Syria. They are fleeing war and poverty. I am sure they would tell the Taoiseach, as would Irish people abroad, that they would rather be at home. Those whom I have heard interviewed have said this. In the past two months 250,000 human beings have made their way on foot through the Balkans into central Europe. It is one of the greatest mass movements of population in modern history on the European continent. I met Prime Minister Alex Tsipras in September and he told me about the significant difficulties his government had in facing up to the challenge, given the numbers of refugees arriving in Greece.</p>
            <p eId="para_296"> I offer my commendation to the Naval Service. Has the Taoiseach discussed an extension beyond December of the very worthwhile humanitarian mission? Second, has the issue of allowances for Naval Service personnel been resolved by the Government? I raised the matter at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_297"> On the decrease in public confidence in EU institutions, the Slovenian Prime Minister warned that the European Union risked falling apart. The High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said the European Union risked disintegrating but failed to produce a comprehensive programme. On the very day she gave that warning, Austria announced its plans to build a fence in an effort to stop the flow of refugees and it did not inform the European Commission before it made its decision. There have been rising tensions over many of these matters and how individual states have responded to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_298"> A big issue was made of the decision to increase co-operation with what are referred to as “third countries”, in this case Turkey. An action plan was agreed with Turkey. It seeks to provide financial support for the Turkish Government in its efforts to cope with the 2 million refugees from Syria in camps along its border. It is to stop people from making the journey to Europe. In return, EU leaders agreed to discuss visa-free travel arrangements for Turkish citizens and to resume negotiations on Turkey’s EU membership bid. All of this ignores Turkey’s deplorable human rights record, especially against the Kurds, Turkey’s role in the Syrian conflict, its illegal occupation of northern Cyprus and the recent decision of the Turkish Government to launch a military offensive against the Kurdistan Workers' Party. All of these issues must be judged in the round. In Turkey we see widespread attacks on journalists, while dozens of Kurdish media outlets have been gagged. Instead of building the peace process, in which some progress was being made until recently, the Turkish Government has put narrow political concerns first. I ask the Taoiseach to reflect on the carrot being offered to the Government of Turkey and the stick being offered to the refugees.</p>
            <p eId="para_299">It strikes me this is not a morally sustainable position. As some media sources claim the agreement is stalled, can the Taoiseach shed light on this?</p>
            <p eId="para_300"> I am pleased the Taoiseach mentioned the question of the deteriorating situation in Palestine, to which I wish to return. The death toll in that region is rising and Israel continues to seal off neighbourhoods in occupied East Jerusalem. When I was there recently, the local people showed me where this would develop in the future and they were right, as one can now see. I looked at a map on television the other evening and one can now see that Palestinian people are being evicted and are then being denied the right to travel in areas that are being placed under Israeli control. Moreover, there definitively is a shoot-to-kill policy on the part of the Israel Defence Forces. Some 61 Palestinians have been killed by these forces, whereas ten Israelis have been killed by Palestinians, mostly in stabbings, and the Palestinian Authority appears to be on the verge of collapse. While I was there, some older people who were long-standing community activists told me the younger people were no longer listening to them and again, unfortunately, that also has come to pass.</p>
            <p eId="para_301"> This Dáil passed a motion of support for the recognition of the Palestinian state on which the Government has failed to act. Were the Government to act on it, it would be a clear signal that we support, on a basis of equality, the rights of the people of Israel and the rights of the people of Palestine. I ask the Taoiseach to commit today to so doing.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_151">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_302">I thank Deputy Adams and did not wish to infer that he was in any way disrespectful to the Dáil. All Members can agree regarding the response of the naval personnel on the three naval vessels that have been deployed in the Mediterranean, one of which is still there, in which more than 8,000 people have been rescued. I have listened to the accounts of some naval personnel who rescued men, women and children and considering what has happened to those people, it has been an extraordinarily emotional engagement for them. One hears the High Representative indicate the trafficking of people in inferior boats, for which they are charged, simply means certain death in many cases. Would one overload a small rigid-inflatable boat, RIB, in Dún Laoghaire and state one was going to Holyhead in any kind of weather? One would not do that. In many cases, what happens when a large boat appears is the smaller RIB may be destroyed deliberately with the consequence that people end up in the water to either drown or be saved. This is going on between Turkey and within the proximity of the Grecian islands on a regular basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_303"> As for the pictures one sees of the flow of people, in many cases middle-class, well-educated people such as engineers and so on - coming from Syria but now mixed with economic migrants from some Balkan countries - who wish to make their way to Austria, Germany and Sweden, this has placed an unprecedented strain on the capacity of many small countries to process them and to deal with them as one would expect. Deputy Adams has raised the issue of a lack of confidence in the institutions on the one hand while on the other hand, people wish to come to Europe in the first place because of confidence in the institutions. The latter is true in the sense that the perception and image of Europe as being a place of order, prosperity and opportunity has meant that in the case of civil war, conflict or destruction, people wish to leave. When one considers the extent of the numbers of people who have moved from Syria in an Irish context - a couple of million people simply upped and left - it is extraordinary and one tries to imagine, in a family sense, what this means when one sees such people carrying their children, babies, buggies and elderly people. The overwhelming weight of numbers has meant that smaller countries have been unable to process these in an acceptable way and that is why it has taken the Union quite a while to catch up. While the image of Europe is as a place of work, opportunity and prosperity, its success has been undermined, if one likes, by its inability to deal with the numbers that have turned up.</p>
            <p eId="para_304"> One either has the principle of freedom of movement within the European Union or one does not. If one has freedom of movement within the countries, one then must protect one's external borders. This has not happened in the past, which has meant there have been many opportunities for people to enter the European Union by various routes. As the principle of free movement is fundamental to the treaties, the question now of dealing with FRONTEX and external borders was taken to the limit by Hungary, which has erected a serious fence. There are also pressures from other countries further east in which economic migrants may mix with the numbers coming from Syria who are asylum or refugee seekers and this is causing great problems. However, the last couple of meetings at EU level have genuinely have tried to focus on what needs to be done in this regard. Progress is being made but with the onset of winter and the serious cold, snow and poor weather in eastern Europe that many people from Syria and north African countries have never experienced, there is a great urgency to provide suitable accommodation for people.</p>
            <p eId="para_305"> Ireland has taken the view that while it is not part of the protocol, it wishes to play its part in a compassionate and practical way, as well as seeking to deal with the root causes of all of this, which in this case is the war in Syria. Ireland has made an important contribution on a number of fronts. The Government agreed that Ireland would accept approximately 4,000 asylum seekers and refugees under the resettlement and relocation programme, that is, well in excess of any sort of notional quota that might be allocated by the European Commission. This includes 520 refugees the Government has offered to resettle from existing refugee camps in Greece and Italy. Some of these, who have already been assessed, have now started to arrive in Ireland. The implementation of the decisions to relocate 600 people from Italy and Greece under the initial Commission proposal and a further approximately 2,200 people under the subsequent Commission proposal is work in train.</p>
            <p eId="para_306"> Ireland is on course to take an initial tranche of 20 asylum seekers from Italy or Greece before Christmas. Initially, persons coming to Ireland on relocation will be from Syria and from Eritrea. The remaining approximately 680 people will be taken on resettlement or on relocation with the final breakdown between the two yet to be decided. I have already dealt with the question of the<i> LE Eithne</i>, the<i> LE Niamh</i> and now the <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>, with 8,066 persons saved or rescued as of 28 October. I do not wish to comment on the question raised by the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA; this is a matter that is the subject of arbitration and work is under way in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_307"> In addition, the Government has provided from the Irish taxpayer financial supports to areas that are badly affected by instability, conflict and war. A total of €41 million will have been provided by the end of 2015 towards assisting those displaced as a result of the Syrian crisis, including through the regional development and protection programme in the Middle East, while €36 million has gone towards humanitarian funding in Somalia since 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_308">Furthermore, we recently committed to doubling, from €10 million to €20 million, our annual contribution to the World Food Programme over the next three years. All of these have been supported by a swift response from the Irish Government. The announcement on 10 September of the establishment of the Irish refugee protection programme and, particularly, the efforts of the interdepartmental task force, chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality, are important steps in the Government's contribution. The Irish Red Cross is working closely with the Government on this programme and is accepting offers of accommodation and other services through its website. Early in 2016 it is proposed to establish a series of emergency reception and orientation centres which will allow Ireland to receive approximately 100 migrants per month. It is worth noting that the number of people applying for protection through normal channels has also increased substantially. That figure, which was just under 1,000 in 2013, is estimated to increase to 3,600 in 2015. </p>
            <p eId="para_309"> In regard to the Deputy's question about what more can we do, we have consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to solidarity within the EU and externally. As already stated, we offered to take 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers and are advancing plans in that regard. The scale and complexity of the crisis is such that it cannot be addressed as quickly as member states would have liked. Ireland is one of the world's most generous donors of humanitarian aid on a <i>per capita</i> basis and we have not been found wanting in respect of this particular situation. </p>
            <p eId="para_310"> In regard to the 2 million people in Turkey, the position, in terms of political bargaining, is that there will be an assessment of the opening of some pre-accession chapters for Turkey and a request of €3 billion in financial assistance from Turkey to the European Union. Most of the people in Turkey would prefer to return to Syria if the situation there can be dealt with. I will respond later to Deputy Adams's question on Palestine.</p>

          <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_152">
            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_311">I have a couple of questions for the Taoiseach. He will be aware that across the world there is a growing chorus of voices outraged at the continuing persecution of the Palestinian people by Israel, including its continued seizure of Palestinian land, which is supposed to be designated for Palestinians as part of the so-called two-state solution, its demolition of Palestinian property in east Jerusalem, the three cruel assaults on Gaza over recent years, the siege and so on. The Taoiseach will be familiar with all of that. He will know also that those of us who believe this cannot go on are asking at what point will the European Union impose sanctions on a state that systematically and routinely violates the basic civil and human rights of the Palestinian people and has been accused, and is evidently guilty, of crimes against humanity. At what point will the European Union impose sanctions, say this is not acceptable and that it will not continue to treat Israel as a normal state? Is that possibility ever discussed at the European Council, particularly given the current escalation? In other words, is there any discussion at all about sanctions on Israel, including, for example, suspension of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement on trade or suspension of military trade sales with Israel? Is this ever discussed as a possibility given Israel's routine breaches of human rights, civil rights and war atrocities?</p>
            <p eId="para_312"> The Taoiseach may be aware that those of us who feel enough is enough believe that there should be a boycott of Israel. While he probably does not agree with that, I hope he and the European Union will agree that people should have the right to know where goods are coming from, such that they can choose whether they want to buy goods from states in which they believe routine and systematic human rights violations or war crimes are being committed. One such item, about which I feel the Irish public has a right to know, is diamonds. The largest export from Israel is diamonds. Will the Taoiseach raise this issue with the European Union as part of its involvement in what is known as the Kimberley Process, which relates to the regulation of the diamond industry around the world? At the recent World Diamond Council, it was proposed that the current definition of "conflict diamonds" be expanded to label as "blood diamonds" or "conflict diamonds" diamonds which originate in or - this is very important - were polished or processed in a state which was found guilty of human rights and civil rights violations. That proposal from the World Diamond Council was shot down by the Israeli representative on the council on the basis that it would be a disaster for Israel. I am sure Israel believes it would. Will the Taoiseach support, and raise with the European Union, the need for it to support, within the Kimberley Process in which it is involved, the expansion of the definition of "conflict diamonds" or "blood diamonds" to include diamonds from states guilty of civil and human rights violations and, similarly, the establishment of labelling for diamonds in this country such that people in this country purchasing diamonds would be able to determine not only where the diamonds originated but where they were polished and processed.</p>

            <p eId="para_319">The conflict between Israel and Palestine has taken up so much time over the years, and continues to do so.

            <p eId="para_321">Eleven Israelis and 68 Palestinians were killed in clashes with the security forces. The Palestinian attacks appear to be unco-ordinated at this point. A major concern is that the attacks on the security response could spiral out of control. There is no visible prospect of a de-escalation. The current wave of violence was prompted by rising anger among young Palestinians in occupied east Jerusalem. There is a growing fear that the Israeli Government might support attempts by radical Jewish groups to overturn the long-standing practices governing prayer rights at the shared holy site of the Temple Mount, Haram al-Sharif. We all deplore and utterly condemn attacks, in any shape or form, on religious sites. This is an issue that the European Council will have to consider.</p>
            <p eId="para_322"> In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's other question, I cannot recollect any discussion at the European Council on possible embargoes or restrictions on European trading links with Israel, although the issue may have been discussed at other Council meetings. I cannot recall any situation where it arose in the context mentioned by the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_329">On health legislation, in the past few hours I received a copy of a letter which has been sent to the chief executive officer of Tallaght hospital and copied to the Minister for Health and a number of other people. It details in an horrific way the circumstances in the emergency department in Tallaght hospital in terms of how senior citizens are being treated. It states that on one particular evening 79 people were in the emergency department. It refers, in particular, to the treatment of elderly people and how one elderly individual who was over 90 years of age was on a trolley for 29 hours and how painful and sore that was for the individual concerned. He was on a trolley in a conduit between the psychiatric rooms and some cubicles.</p>

          <p eId="para_333">The letter goes through the safety issues and previous experiences in Tallaght hospital when HIQA protocols were introduced. The Taoiseach may remember the case of the 101 year old patient. No. 42 in the Government's legislative programme is the health information and patient safety Bill. This represents an appalling indictment of the Minister for Health. The Government needs to respond urgently to situations such as this that are occurring in emergency departments across the country, particularly Tallaght hospital, where the consultant said all of the HIQA protocols were being breached, particularly in terms of patients not being put in isolation rooms when required. It is a very serious matter. When can we expect the health information and patient safety Bill to be introduced?</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> I take it that the Taoiseach has read an article in yesterday's edition of <i>The Guardian</i> - it may have been brought to his attention - on undocumented workers, how they are being treated on certain vessels in the Irish fishing industry and allegedly being paid half the minimum wage.</p>

          <p eId="para_339">It is a very well researched article in <i>The Guardian</i> and the workers in question are from Egypt, Ghana and the Philippines. There have been cases in the past when we brought forward legislation. The Government's legislative programme provides for the introduction of an international protection Bill. I respectfully suggest to the Taoiseach that there is a need to accelerate this legislation and for the Government to take this report seriously and liaise with the International Transport Workers Federation and labour agencies to ensure very basic and minimal standards of protection and rights are afforded to migrant workers and particularly to ensure they are not undocumented. There seems to be a very sorry tale in this context.</p>

          <p eId="para_340">Obviously, we do not need legislation to know that the situation that the Deputy has described is not tolerable. If the letter has been sent to the Minister for Health, I am sure he will respond directly to the Deputy. The health information Bill is due for publication next year, but as I said, we do not need legislation to know that there should not be a situation like the one the Deputy described. The Minister with responsibility for the marine has responded initially on the report in <i>The Guardian</i> which took a year to put together. He intends to form a working group on Thursday to respond to the issue. It will involve a number of Departments. This situation applies to a number of other countries, particularly Scotland, where the human slavery Act 2015, which is very modern legislation, has dealt with the matter in a very comprehensive way for those involved. There may well be problems in some parts of the pelagic fleet. The Minister will respond to them in a very determined way and will announce the forming of a working group involving a number of Departments which have various responsibilities to deal with the issue of migrant workers. The Garda has a very active unit which deals with the trafficking of people. Obviously, it will have a central part to play if the allegations contained in the report in <i>The Guardian </i>are true.</p>

          <p eId="para_341">Tá dhá cheist agam, an chéad cheann faoi promised legislation to provide for rent certainty and another on the misuse of drugs (amendment) (No. 2) Bill, but before I come to them, I asked the Taoiseach earlier if the Government would formally recognise the Palestinian state in keeping with the motion of support which had been passed by the Oireachtas but on which the Government had failed to act. As it may have slipped his mind, I am giving him an opportunity to answer it now. It would send a clear signal if the Government acted on this important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> On the misuse of drugs (amendment) (No. 2) Bill, the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, is quoted as having said in a speech made in London that he was confident the Cabinet would agree to legislation that would allow for the provision of medically supervised injection centres for use by intravenous drug users. It is a source of wonderment for me why he goes to London to make these statements, but leaving that aside, he has also indicated his support for the decriminalisation of the personal use of small quantities of drugs. Has this matter been discussed by the Cabinet and when does the Taoiseach expect the misuse of drugs (amendment) (No. 2) Bill to be published?</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> On the issue of rent certainty, we were promised legislation. On 28 September the Minister involved, Deputy Alan Kelly, made such a commitment on the back of others. The Ceann Comhairle will know that since the Government took office, rents have increased by 35% but nothing has been done to tackle these increasingly unaffordable rates. He will also know that there are 1,500 children living in homeless accommodation in this city.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">We are told the next election will be a choice between stability and chaos. How much chaos can a family put up with? What amount of chaos must there be in the Cabinet that it cannot settle its mind on such an urgent and important crisis issue? When will we see the Government’s emergency legislation to tackle homelessness? When will the Government publish its promised and proposed legislation on rent certainty?</p>

          <p eId="para_345">I dealt with this before Deputy Adams came into the Chamber. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Government have done a great deal of work in respect of rough sleepers and homelessness in general. The HAP, housing assistance payment, regulations have been changed, along with proposals for modular housing, the return of voided units to habitable condition, targets set and moneys put in place with regard to over 200 sites opened around the country for social housing to deal with the fundamental issue of housing supply. The Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government are talking about several other immediate responses, as well as medium and long-term proposals. I hope they can conclude these discussions this week. If legislation is necessary out of that, the Government will obviously give it consideration. I will come back to the Deputy on the work that follows through in respect of the motion passed on Palestine and what it actually means.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> The misuse of drugs (amendment) (no. 2) Bill is due for next year. However, there is a court case, the outcome of which I cannot determine, which may have a bearing on when this particular legislation may apply. We cannot do anything about it until that decision is made by the courts. The matter of legalising small quantities of heroin has not been discussed at Cabinet. In the past, there was reference to the supervision of needles for drug users but the question of the legalisation of small quantities of heroin for personal use has not been discussed.</p>

These are matters to which the Members of the House will be able to contribute. This is an issue of concern to the Government and one to which it has responded with requests from the Garda Commissioner to provide facilities and opportunities to deal with this. It will involve our communities in having information passed to the Garda at the earliest possible time.</p>

The councils, having gone through all the procedures and brought these families to task or to court, are not being facilitated. They are awaiting a statutory instrument from the Department of Justice and Equality. Will the Taoiseach advise the House when the statutory instrument will be signed by the Minister? I also asked a number of weeks ago about the independent Government rapporteur on child protection. Every year he lays his annual report before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I understand the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has the 2014 report since February. We are now in November and still awaiting it. This year's report will be with the Minister and we will not have had an opportunity to discuss the 2014 report. Will the Taoiseach advise me when that report will be laid before the Houses?</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_242">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_528">I welcome the opportunity to open the debate on Northern Ireland as we face once again into a critical juncture for the peace process. I can assure the House that the two Governments in Dublin and London remain steadfast and determined to support the parties in the North to reach agreement on critical issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> With the conclusion of the Stormont House Agreement in December 2014 after months of talks, it was hoped that a way forward was agreed on resolving the difficulties in the Northern Ireland Executive around finance, welfare reform and dealing with the legacy of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">Unfortunately, implementation of the agreement ran into difficulties, creating major challenges for the Northern institutions. The resulting political impasse was further compounded by the murder of Kevin McGuigan and the attendant implications for trust and confidence among the parties participating in the Northern Ireland Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> I made the Government's position clear when I spoke at the British-Irish Association in Cambridge in September and reiterate that, 21 years after the IRA ceasefire and ten years after decommissioning and the IRA announcement of cessation of paramilitary activity, it is past time that it should carry any capacity for threat. Statements to the effect that the IRA has gone away or left the stage are simply not credible. It is the responsibility of Sinn Féin, in particular its leadership, to address these issues and help to restore the trust that has been lost. We have become used to incredible statements, be they about past activity, current activity, murder, robbery or child abuse. There may have been a time when living with constructive ambiguity helped the peace process but that time is now past.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> It is not for Sinn Féin alone to help to make progress. All of the parties and both Governments have responsibilities to shoulder. The shadow of the gunman and the poison of paramilitarism are not just confined to so-called republicans; they are still deeply embedded in loyalist communities, often with nakedly criminal agendas. Paramilitarism, in all its vestiges, must be removed. We need clear, not blurred, lines between constitutional politics and criminality. There must be no shared platforms or strategies and no shady grey areas between right and wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> The peace we now have was built by the people of these islands through their commitment to non-violence and reconciliation. The institutions of the Good Friday Agreement were created by these same people through their democratic vote. Political representatives are elected and thereby duty bound to protect the peace and the democratic institutions the people have created. These words are as true now as they were when I first spoke them in Cambridge in September. We must face the truth that an event such as the brutal and savage murder of Paul Quinn in 2007 illustrates most graphically and awfully the very worst effects of the scourge of paramilitarism on individuals, families and communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> Devolution in the North is facing hugely significant challenges. That is why, on 2 September, the Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, and I agreed that the seriousness of the political impasse warranted the urgent convening of talks in Belfast involving the two Governments and the parties that had subscribed to the Stormont House Agreement. It was envisaged that these talks would be short, focused and intensive and advance implementation of the agreement, as well as addressing the trust and confidence issues arising from the impact and legacy of paramilitary activity. While the talks got off to a reasonably encouraging start, progress was delayed by several developments that further compounded the situation. The Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, with the support of the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, worked closely with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to facilitate the return of all of the five main parties in Northern Ireland to round table talks. They resumed in round table format on 21 September. Talks have intensified in recent days and, while significant challenges remain, good progress is being made across the main issues. I remain hopeful that, with committed collective engagement, we can make real progress in the coming days on the critical issues, with a view to a successful conclusion of the talks.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> I have kept in close contact with the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, and we last spoke on the telephone on 20 October. I expect to meet him again when in London next week to address the annual conference of the Confederation of British Industry. I am hoping that at that time we will be able to discuss significant progress in the talks process. I have also been keeping the US Administration informed of progress, most recently in my meeting with Senator Gary Hart on 14 October, when I expressed my gratitude for the continued US engagement in, and support for, the peace process. Of course, our No. 1 priority is to facilitate and encourage the Northern Ireland parties to find an inclusive agreement on these issues, a task to which the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, have dedicated much of their time in recent weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> In response to the concerns raised about the activities of paramilitary groups, the British Government commissioned an assessment of the various paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland to be carried out by the PSNI and the British security services. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, had also asked An Garda Síochána for an assessment of the status of the Provisional IRA in this jurisdiction. Both assessments were published on 20 October. In the first instance, the British Government's assessment makes for sobering reading. While acknowledging that the paramilitary organisations no longer represent a terrorist threat, it nonetheless presents a complex and challenging profile of unacceptable residual activities by various groups in Northern Ireland which are damaging to communities and which must be addressed. The assessment underscores the critical importance of the political talks process under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> There is substantial common ground in the findings of both assessments and both raise deeply troubling issues about the Provisional IRA and the legacy of paramilitarism. Both communities continue to be affected by the so-called dissident republican groups and their ongoing campaigns of terrorism. While these groups are separate from and at odds with the Provisional IRA, they have their origins in the Provisional IRA. These things have no place in our democracy and never did. As I have said before, the future of the peace process depends on their being removed from the life of this island, completely and forever. All participants in the Stormont House talks have a duty of care to the people of this island to bring an end to the remaining blight of paramilitarism in communities and agree outcomes that will provide lasting peace and political stability in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> A second aspect of the Provisional IRA's brutal legacy is the involvement in organised crime of a significant number of people who have been associated with the Provisional IRA and who, as the Garda Commissioner points out, are involved in organised crime and make full use of the reputations they acquired as members of the Provisional IRA and do not hesitate to use their previous terror tactics. The Garda Commissioner has made it clear that the close relationship and the successful record of co-operation with the PSNI will remain the cornerstone of tackling the cross-Border crime that harms communities, North and South. In that regard, both An Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland have my full support and that of the Government. An Garda Síochána is strongly committed to tackling crime of whatever sort, whatever its origin and whomsoever is involved. There was not, is not and cannot be any question of a blind eye being turned to any criminality and the Government is determined that there will be no hiding place for whatever manifestation of the IRA might be involved in it. Since the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau in 1996, a total of €28 million has been remitted to the Exchequer arising from proceeds of crime actions and tax assessments in respect of over 50 individuals who have had connections or associations with the Provisional IRA in the past. Other investigations and proceedings are ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> The Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, recently met the Justice Minister in the North, Mr. David Ford, to discuss what more could be done to tackle cross-Border crime. The two Ministers jointly hosted the annual cross-Border conference on organised crime which took place in Sligo on 30 September and 1 October, with over 100 delegates attending from the North and the South. It is one demonstration of the close and ongoing co-operation between the two jurisdictions in this regard. There is extensive operational co-operation to tackle smuggling and other Border-focused criminal activities. This co-operation involves the police and other law enforcement agencies from both jurisdictions, with the inter-agency, cross-Border enforcement groups on fuel and tobacco fraud being two examples of this joint work in action. We are looking at ways to build on the excellent co-operation that already takes place in this area and want to see an overarching and enhanced structure in place to support it. It is the joint working of all of the law enforcement agencies involved on both sides of the Border which will be crucial in tackling these issues. As a Government, we will support them in any and every way we can. The Government will maintain and intensify its focus on combating paramilitary activity and organised criminality, whatever its aims or origins, and will continue to work in close co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> Dealing with the past is also a key element of the Stormont House Agreement and the implementation of these elements is an important part of the current talks. Many families, including those bereaved by incidents in which collusion has been alleged, continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one but with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The impact of the many atrocities perpetrated North and South lives long in our memory and is felt to this day. Last July, this House adopted an all-party motion on the Ballymurphy massacre and only last week, we learned of further developments in the ongoing inquest into this case being carried out by the Coroner's Court in Belfast. I take this opportunity again to reiterate the support of the Government and this House for the Ballymurphy families in their quest for truth through an independent panel of inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> I know the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement also met recently with several representatives of victim and family groups and I am grateful to its Chairman, Deputy Feighan, for his initiative in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> I have always said there is no hierarchy of victims. They come from all sides of the community and from all strands of society. I understand and acknowledge the frustration of families who for too long have had to contend with inadequate mechanisms for addressing their cases. For that reason, the establishment of a new, comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, remains a priority of the Government. We believe that these mechanisms offer the best hope of helping the thousands of families touched by the Troubles, including those affected by collusion. I know that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, with the support of his officials, is working intensively with the Secretary of State, the Northern Ireland Office and the Northern Ireland political parties to ensure the rapid establishment of these institutions within the context of the ongoing round table talks. The Government is committed to ensuring full co-operation by the authorities in this jurisdiction with any new investigative body in Northern Ireland with appropriate policing powers and I have reiterated this at recent meetings in Northern Ireland, including with the Kingsmill and Ballymurphy families.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> Finance and welfare reform is primarily a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly. However, the Government here fully recognises the importance of finding an agreement on these issues for the economic well-being of Northern Ireland. The British Government has a pivotal role to play and I hope in playing this role, it will recognise the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland as a society still emerging from decades of debilitating conflict. Under the Good Friday Agreement, we have seen important progress in North-South co-operation, through the work of the NSMC and the North-South bodies. I look forward to attending the next meeting of the NSMC in Armagh on 13 November and taking further stock of our progress across all the areas of co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> This Government's recently published capital plan clearly states our ongoing commitment to investing in infrastructure to support North-South co-operation to help unlock the full potential of the island economy. This commitment is, of course, predicated on a stable political environment in the North with all of the institutions and cross-Border agencies operating to full effect. In our capital plan, we have reaffirmed our support for the EU PEACE and INTERREG programmes and will continue to work closely with the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that funding opportunities are maximised, with almost half a billion euro available from EU sources from 2016 to 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> In addition, there will be a renewed focus on investing in a number of key transport corridors, including ongoing review of the scope for building on the current commitment to the A5 road project, which is of major strategic importance to the north-west, and the Dublin-Belfast rail line, which is critical to the development of the Dublin-Belfast corridor and is currently in receipt of an €18 million upgrade package. The Government remains committed to the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge, which would provide a valuable North-South link between counties Louth and Down, with potential to provide jobs and a significant boost to tourism in the area. The Government will also continue to explore the development of further cross-Border greenways and blueway cycling, walking and water leisure routes, including the Ulster Canal.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> In considering Northern Ireland's economic future, it is also important that we recognise the European Union's strong support for, and positive influence on, the peace process and the importance for Northern Ireland politicians of engaging on the EU-UK debate. It would be remiss of me not to mention the bad news today in respect of the closure to come of a major plant in Northern Ireland, with the loss of over 800 jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> This Government has clearly set out its vision for a Northern Ireland free from the grip of paramilitarism and organised crime. We want to see a shared society governed by efficient, effective, representative devolved institutions which co-operate to build the island economy through overseas investment and joint efforts in trade and tourism. The people of Northern Ireland deserve political institutions which work to build a world class infrastructure and focus on delivering high quality citizen-centred public services, including an education system that promotes integration. The current talks have the capacity to move Northern Ireland forward towards that brighter future. Now is the time for the parties to step up to mark and show that they know how to make real and mature decisions about the future, rather than rely on the possibility of a return to direct rule.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> The outstanding issues can only be successfully addressed by the Executive parties and the two Governments working together to resolve the issues of trust, confidence and of political and financial instability that threaten the continuation of devolution and of course by implementing the Stormont House Agreement in its totality.</p>

          <p eId="para_550">I wish to share time with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> I welcome the opportunity to speak on the situation in the North. I fully support the talks that are under way and hope they conclude successfully. I am encouraged by the updates from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Minister of State with responsibility for North-South co-operation, Deputy Sherlock.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> To be a fully peaceful and democratic society Northern Ireland requires a functioning Assembly and Executive, but in order to be truly successful, the talks must be ambitious, comprehensive and robust. They cannot simply be about another quick fix. That approach has been tried and has failed far too often. All issues dealing with the past, welfare reform, paramilitarism and criminality must be dealt with once and for all. This brings me to the recent reports by the British Government and An Garda Síochána regarding paramilitary organisations. These reports arose from the murder of Kevin McGuigan in August and ongoing criminal activity by a range of paramilitary groups. The assessment by the British Government of the IRA indicates it is clear the army council continues to exist and exerts control over Sinn Féin. It asks fundamental questions about our democracy if a party that is in government in the North and aspires to be in government in the South continues to operate in this way. It is vote Sinn Féin and get the army council.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> There must be a break from all forms of paramilitarism and criminality. This does not just mean words, but requires action. It means allowing relevant authorities to investigate, co-operating with them and ending paramilitary activity in all its forms. When I became Tánaiste, I emphasised the need to tackle crime by paramilitary organisations in the joint statement of priorities with the Taoiseach. We must now recommit ourselves to doing this. This means escalating and expanding co-operation and developing a specific strategy for addressing crime in Border areas. An organised crime task force already exists at ministerial level and there is much North-South co-operation between relevant agencies. The Labour Party supports the position outlined by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to establish a new cross-Border task force to move to tackle more comprehensively organised crime in the region. If Sinn Féin is similarly supportive, it should not only endorse the proposal but also the national crime agency in Northern Ireland. That would be the biggest step it could take to demonstrate a real commitment to ending criminality.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> I want to speak on the upcoming centenary of the Easter Rising. Commemorating the events of Easter week, as the State is doing, is both appropriate and natural. We have put in place a commemorative programme which reflects not just the events, but the differing perspectives on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">We have come a long way since 1966.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> We should also consider addressing some of the legacies of 1916. One of those is partition. The politics of this country up to 1916 revolved around attempts to arrive at a solution to the national question on an all-island basis, albeit within the United Kingdom. Following the Easter Rising and subsequent events, a partitioned island emerged creating two separate states. I am proud to be the Tánaiste of an independent Irish State, yet I also believe that the people of the island North and South suffered from the creation of what were and became two sectarian states for much of the period.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> Close to 100 years living in separate jurisdictions on a partitioned island has also had its own impact. During the first half century, the two states largely ignored the issue and existed in splendid isolation from each other. The next 25 years were spent coping with the horror of a bitter and brutal sectarian conflict and the last 25 years have been about managing a peace process to ensure that the previous quarter century never happens again. Over that period, the most radical and effective new thinking on partition came from John Hume, the SDLP and people like Seamus Mallon. They restated the problem as being the division between the people living in Ireland rather than the contemporary malfeasance of the British State. Their outlook forms the basis of the Good Friday Agreement and the structures that flow from it. That analysis is challenged by those who assert the idealism of the 1916 Proclamation while ignoring the political reality on the ground. That divide continues to this day. It is why, for example, Sinn Féin members, who are self-styled republicans, have no visible strategy to bring about a united Ireland. Winning a Border poll is no answer to the question posed by John Hume, unless we simply wish to create the same problem in reverse.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> One recent example highlights how the contradiction of the republican position can lead to nonsensical situations. I saw a Sinn Féin representative being involved in a minor row about the IRFU being west Brits for using "Ireland's Call" as a representative anthem of the all-island rugby team, which has been doing all of us proud during the world cup. Surely somebody genuinely interested in bringing Unionists and Nationalists, North and South together would be supportive of an all-Ireland institution like the IRFU. In fairness, Sinn Féin has come a long way in recent years. We are now talking about all of us, Sinn Féin republicans included, laying wreaths at memorials, not blowing them up.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> There are over a million people loyal to the UK living on the island of Ireland. That is not to ignore the strong relationship that the rest of us continue to have, 1921 notwithstanding, with our nearest neighbour and sister island. After partition, undoing the Border rather than ameliorating the factors which gave rise to it became for many the sole goal of Nationalists. As we approach the centenary of the 1916 Rising, we might do well to consider these issues again.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> It is over 30 years now since the New Ireland Forum first met. We have come a long way since then. The principle of consent remains paramount yet I remain of the view that the long-term future of the people of this island would be better faced together. Were that possible, it would not be on the basis of the domination of one tradition over the other. It would involve all of us who are republican and Nationalist recognising the essential British identity of Unionists, and Unionists I would hope embracing a greater sense of their own Irishness. In the context of the 1916 commemorations, we should set ourselves the challenge of convening a new forum or body, one that is separate from but supportive of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, specifically to discuss our island's future.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> The men who fought in 1916 were idealists. The women who fought in 1916 and were involved in it were idealists. Those who died on all sides were victims. We have tragically had many more victims since then. What better tribute to all of them than to have a sensible discussion about our common future?</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> I was involved in the Royal Irish Academy last night in launching a book about 43 of the major figures involved in 1916, many of them household names and some of them relatively unknown. What stands out from the biographies and the <i>Dictionary of Irish Biography</i>, a seminal work of scholarship for this country about the people of this country, is that they all had a vision of an Ireland which was for all Irish people. Somehow in the course of the 1916 celebrations and the commemorations of the Somme, we have to really begin to embrace the other as we would ourselves and to reach out on both sides.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> We are all here republicans and descended from proud traditions in respect of 1916. My own party, the Labour Party was founded by James Connolly. The first person who was shot was a Labour Party councillor, Richard O'Carroll, on Dublin City Council. We all of us are and have the right to be seen as republicans but we have to embrace that other strand that runs deep in our island, particularly in the North, and that is the issue of unionism. We have to create an island where all of us can live in peace. We have to see an end to paramilitarism. Paramilitarism in a democracy is a step on the road to fascism. That is where paramilitarism leads to. We have to put it away and see it off.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Sean Sherlock)<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_564">I thank the Tánaiste for sharing her time. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan will set out to the House the developments regarding the all-party talks in Belfast in which he and I have been involved over the past several weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> Beyond the talks, the work to deliver a reconciled and peaceful Northern Ireland as part of a prosperous and inclusive island of Ireland continues every day across Government. Nowhere is this more evident than in our work to promote and develop North-South co-operation. Through this work, we are building the lasting relationships between North and South which will help to copperfasten peace and stability and deliver prosperity for all our people. The success of North-South bodies like Tourism Ireland and InterTradeIreland demonstrate what can be achieved when we pool our resources in key strategic areas. Building on these successes is now our focus. </p>
          <p eId="para_566"> In line with the Stormont House Agreement, a report on new economically-focused priorities was brought to the North-South Ministerial Council this year. Priority areas of co-operation for the Government include higher level education, agri-food, energy, climate change, creative industries, sport and other joint initiatives. The overarching aim is to ensure the most effective use of scarce public funds on both sides of the Border to promote economic growth and create jobs in all our communities. The Government’s commitment to North-South economic co-operation therefore remains a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> As the Taoiseach has stated, the recently announced infrastructure and capital investment plan has a dedicated section on North-South infrastructure. In the Stormont House Agreement, the Government agreed to a financial package to support North-South work programmes as well as measures to promote reconciliation and INTERREG programmes, including the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge project and developing the Ulster canal.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">In this agreement, we also reaffirmed our commitment to provide £25 million in 2015 and 2016 to the A5 project. This was the source of some discussions in Stormont as late as yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> Research and innovation, one of the key drivers of economic growth and employment, has been a key area for North-South co-operation. For instance, the development of the North West Regional Science Park, co-located in Derry and Letterkenny, has delivered new hubs for the development of innovative businesses, creating jobs and strengthening the cross-Border links which are so vital to the economic development of the Border region. There has been very good progress to date in terms of North-South collaboration under the EU's €80 billion research and innovation Horizon 2020 programme, which was negotiated during the Irish Presidency. The first year has delivered over €19 million of EU funding to support North-South projects. We need now to build on the excellent collaborative progress to date and to work on our allied strengths in areas such as ICT, health and agri-food research to create and deliver more successful partnership projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> The expansion of Science Foundation Ireland's remit to fund researchers in the North will enable further work together on an all-island basis and will create a further leveraging opportunity. North-South co-operation also brings real day-to-day benefits to people on both sides of the Border. For example, when open next summer, the £50 million radiotherapy unit at Derry's Altnagelvin Hospital will provide access to radiotherapy services to over a half million people across the north-west region, sharing services and maximising limited resources. This co-operation also extends to the field of sport. As one Rugby World Cup ends, we look forward to 2023 when, hopefully, Ireland will be hosting this great tournament on an all-island basis. This joint North-South bid has tremendous potential to drive tourism. Speaking personally, I am hopeful that all of the stadia will be ready when the time comes. I refer to Páirc Uí Chaoimh in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> It is clear that North-South co-operation is crucial and indeed a central plank of the Good Friday Agreement. I hope we continue to fulfil our obligations both North and South in respect of the North-South Ministerial Council. I welcome the announcement by the Taoiseach of a date for Armagh. It is important all political persuasions would sign up to that and that the Executive in all its forms would ensure that we continue to give that the energy it deserves. The current political difficulties should not get in the way of vitally important North-South co-operation. Now that DUP ministers have returned to their desks in Stormont, I hope the North-South Ministerial Council can resume its work, which has delivered so much benefit for citizens across the island. Whatever the difficulties, this Government will continue to work to support North-South cooperation and to help unlock the full potential of the island society and economy.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_245">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_572">Cuireann mise agus Fianna Fáil fáilte roimh an díospóireacht seo. Tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuilimid ag tabhairt ama chun ceisteanna an Tuaiscirt a phlé agus rudaí áirithe a shoiléiriú.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> Unfortunately, a pattern has been established in recent years where we are only allowed to discuss Northern Ireland when a new crisis emerges. This tends to be the pattern. We will hopefully get through this latest crisis in the very near future and the immediate threat to the Northern institutions will be addressed. However, let no one be in any doubt that unless we see a major change in how the parties and Governments have been behaving, the cycle of instability will continue. Much worse than this, we may well lose the opportunity to embed peace, to begin overcoming sectarianism and to tackle deep social and economic problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> The enormous advances secured by democratic leaders in bringing others into legitimate politics have been taken for granted. Opportunities for growth and reconciliation have been missed repeatedly. A culture of sectarianism and underlying conflict is not only unchallenged, it is becoming worse in important ways. The cult of paramilitarism is alive in different communities and while it exists at a time of growing alienation and sectarian discord, it remains a destabilising force. The one thing which should by now be blindingly obvious is that if you take peace for granted and if you fail to continue the work of addressing the underlying causes of division and alienation, you are taking enormous risks.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> By every available measure, the Governments and parties have by their neglect and behaviour allowed core public trust to be undermined. This is not a political assertion. It is a fact established repeatedly in surveys, elections and events. It is there to see for anyone willing to open their eyes. Too often the challenge in these negotiations has been about how we get through the crisis and get the parties to start working together. Yet the people of Northern Ireland are increasingly asking when the parties will get around to working on their behalf. Northern Ireland has gone from having one of the highest levels of participation in elections to one of the lowest on these islands. Much of this fall is found in marginal communities and among the supporters of parties who see themselves excluded from all policy discussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> The economic and social situation in Northern Ireland has deteriorated in a manner which should cause real concern. The austerity agenda being implemented is already causing disproportionate harm to vital public services such as education without which progress is impossible. Rates of poverty and child poverty in particular in Northern Ireland have continued to worsen and the gap with the UK is expanding. Nearly half - 46% - of children in west Belfast are today living in poverty. Pensioner poverty in Northern Ireland is one third higher than it is in the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> As we have seen, many of those who participated in the illegitimate paramilitary campaigns continue to operate as a caste apart and pose an ongoing threat and yet the institutions established with unprecedented hope and popular legitimacy are constantly diverted to dealing with breakdowns in trust and general party political manoeuvring. Two parties which rode to power by overcoming those who risked everything to secure and sustain a peace settlement have been unwilling to show the bravery needed to challenge their own or to accept the logic of peace in everything they do. Their willingness to attack inconvenient actions by independent institutions and to show loyalty to their movement before the public interest has been corrosive. After nearly two decades, the demand of the Irish people both North and South is to move on, to end the cycle of crises and to focus on the real agenda of challenging division and delivering growth which benefits all communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> Fianna Fáil strongly supports the effort to achieve a robust agreement. Where we differ from others is that we do not just want a return to business as usual. We want the parties and governments to understand the need to change radically the way that they have been working in recent years. More of the same will not work and if that is all we get, we will be back for another crisis session sooner rather than later. If parties continue to assert that all problems come from the behaviour of others, how will anything change? If they will not recognise their own failures, what is to stop another crisis and yet more wasted time?</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> The recent reports concerning paramilitary organisations are a cause of major concern. The vast majority of Irish people believe that 20 years into a process, there should not even be a suspicion that these organisations are still active in any way. Any level of activity is destabilising because of what these organisations represent and the threat which is kept alive by the cult of paramilitarism which they seek to legitimise. We must not forget the full context in which this report has been produced and the fact that the growing dysfunction of the DUP-Sinn Féin control of the institutions was not caused by the most recent revelations.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Fianna Fáil believes the settlement which we played a central part in securing remains the best hope for a shared future for all parts of our island based on reconciliation and progress. It involves an approach to deciding the most important constitutional issues which has been agreed by all communities and gives a transparency and certainty which has never been in place before.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> The spirit in which that settlement was first agreed and then, albeit slowly, implemented is the spirit which we need now to return to. We need the Heads of Government here and in London to give the deep and real personal commitment to Northern Ireland shown by their predecessors. We need the sort of commitment which recognises that this is not just any issue but one of enormous and historic importance. We also need the leaders in the North to show the sort of courage demonstrated by the former leaders of parties who put the public interest ahead of party and sectional interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> In this House and in all of its work, Sinn Féin has taken the ever more arrogant approach of attacking anyone who challenges its actions. In its view anyone who criticises it is an enemy of peace. Too much time is given to the ridiculous political posturing of people who want to wear the garland of peace but continue to justify and honour the bloody, illegitimate and sectarian violence they perpetrated. There is, however, a need to respond to the latest Sinn Féin campaign of attacking me and my party. Implemented with Sinn Féin's usual efficiency, it is as empty as it was the last time it was rolled out, in the service of a now abandoned denial that child abuse was systematically covered up within the Provisional movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> Sinn Féin's so-called new personalities have played a central role. Their empty attacks have claimed that we are challenging them only because of the coming election and that we would not say anything if Sinn Féin were lower in the polls. This is the type of empty nonsense which is being used to avoid answering substantive points. It is also the same tactic Sinn Féin has used unfailingly for 17 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> Anyone who looks back through the records will see Sinn Féin claiming that the only reason decommissioning was being demanded was a coming election; the only reason the Northern Bank robbery was being talked about was a coming election; and the only reason the brutal murder of Robert McCartney was being highlighted was a coming election. For Sinn Féin there is never an issue too serious that it cannot be dismissed by attacking others for just being interested in elections. No matter how comprehensive the evidence of financial irregularities, child abuse, murder or criminality by those involved in the Provisional movement Sinn Féin never responds with anything but blanket denials and abuse of the accuser.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> Let me be very clear about something: no party in Dáil Éireann has worked as hard or as long as Fianna Fáil in the cause of a lasting peace and reconciliation on this island. We took risks when many were attacking us for talking to paramilitaries and their political parties and we never stopped engaging and working to push the process on. I and my colleagues have spent countless hours in negotiations to get parties to accept actions which should be automatic in a democratic society. When we went into opposition after the last general election, I said to the Taoiseach in this House that peace should never be taken for granted and that he and his Government had our goodwill and support in respect of Northern Ireland. We began to express concern when it became clear that real damage was being caused by a policy of drift and neglect by the Governments, combined with the growing dysfunction of the Sinn Féin-Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, approach to government. When we said in 2012 that a crisis was inevitable unless policy changed, I was attacked by Martin McGuinness and Peter Robinson, both of whom fell over each other to say that everything was great. Events have proven our analysis to have been correct. I and Fianna Fáil spokespeople have been consistent in repeating our concern in speeches, interviews and meetings in all parts of this island. Every time we have spoken the inevitable press release has issued from Sinn Féin either denying that there was any problem or denying it had anything to do with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> We have also been consistent in calling for a reinvigoration of the North-South dimension, the creation of a Border economic development zone and a range of other actions which would rebuild trust and show concrete action to tackle growing poverty and alienation. We have met with a wide range of groups and listened to their concerns and to their proposals. For the past year, we have constantly called for a cross-Border crime agency to be set up and our spokesperson, Deputy Brendan Smith, has published a Bill on this. Given yesterday’s announcement that the Government is committed to setting up a cross-Border crime task force, I hope the Government will accept this Bill when it is debated in this House on 27 November.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> Sinn Féin and those who fall for its propaganda can keep claiming that the only reason anyone criticises it is electoral politics. The more they do this, the more they confirm that their arrogance and their actions are standing in the way of badly needed progress. After years of attacking people for supposedly not paying enough attention to Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin has started attacking those who do as being "hurlers on the ditch". In an act of supreme irony, it has fallen into the partitionist mind-set of demanding that anyone who is not on the ground has no right to express an opinion. This is very similar to the approach of some Unionist politicians towards the Irish Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> Sinn Féin’s arrogance has extended to claiming ownership of the word "republican". Its Deputies, new and old, have been united in recent weeks in claiming that Sinn Féin is the only republican organisation currently active. In doing this, they confirm yet again that there is nothing republican about them. Irish republicanism has its roots in an inclusive ideology. All of its great leaders earned and retain the respect of the Irish people because they were committed to a republicanism defined by the people and not by a party. The sectarianism seen in Sinn Féin’s north Belfast campaign, in Deputy Adam’s comments about equality being a Trojan horse and in the awarding of jobs by a Sinn Féin Minister can be described as many things but republican is not one of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> In order to avoid addressing the substance of the recent report on criminal activities by paramilitaries, Sinn Féin’s leaders have focused solely on the point concerning the Provisional IRA army council. In doing so, they have avoided addressing the evidence that the core network of the Provisionals is in place and that there are significant links to criminality. The assessment that the Provisional IRA supports the peace process and is unlikely to return to a political campaign is welcome. What this does not do is remove the right of others to question the remaining activities of the Provisionals and the impact of them. The link of senior Provisionals to organised criminality can be seen in a number of high profile cases. Just as important are the large number of Criminal Assets Bureau cases which are not open to public scrutiny but which show a serious pattern relating to organised criminality in the Border region.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> In maintaining its core structures and discipline, the Provisional movement maintains the idea of loyalty to the movement being superior to all other duties. It remains a fact that people associated with this movement do not engage with the policing and judicial system in the way that citizens are obliged to. A constant theme of crimes linked to the Provisional movement is that an absolute discipline is enforced. Sinn Féin goes out and calls on people to co-operate with the police but no one ever does.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> Eight years after the ceasefires, a pub filled with 70 Sinn Féin members and supporters looked on as a man was brutally beaten and stabbed in front of them. They did not even call an ambulance as he bled to death and sat quietly as a Provisional squad forensically cleaned the scene of evidence. Why this Mafia like silence to protect men whose vicious crime was gangsterism at its worst? There was nothing political or noble in this. It was a cruel murder of an innocent man and the murderers have never been brought to justice. Two months after the murder, the Provisional IRA said it had investigated it and that two of its members were directly involved but the loyalty to the movement came first and still comes first. We saw exactly the same situation in the murder of Paul Quinn of Cullyhanna, on a farm in Monaghan in 2007. I met his mother, Bríd, and his father, Stephen. The mother keeps saying, and her words would haunt one, that they broke every bone in his body and his screams could be heard for miles. The scene of his murder was also forensically cleaned by a Provisional squad and no one has ever been convicted. Sinn Féin spokespeople, including Conor Murphy, tried to suggest that Mr. Quinn was a petty criminal and that was why he was murdered.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">That is something that deeply upsets the family even today and yet no one has been convicted. The same is true in relation to child abuse within the provisional movement.  Crimes with no political basis whatsoever have been covered up long past the ceasefires and decommissioning.  No one has yet been brought to justice even though leaders of the movement have acknowledged the crimes happened. All of the punishment beatings, murders and criminality must end, as there is a political and moral obligation to do so. </p>
          <p eId="para_593"> As to the issue of the control or otherwise of Sinn Féin by the army council, we should remember one basic thing which is undeniable. Throughout most of the major negotiations of the past 20 years, Sinn Féin's position was that it could not agree anything until it had sought agreement from the Provisional IRA.  It often claimed to want to agree things but it needed to talk to the Provisional IRA first. What matters today is that Sinn Féin is unwilling to distance itself from the Provisional IRA. Sinn Féin continues to honour the Provisional IRA without reservation.  It sells mugs and T-shirts emblazoned with "Undefeated Army".  It stills refers to its members as Óglaigh na hÉireann, in defiance of the people of Ireland who recognise only the Army of this State as Óglaigh na hÉireann. Since 1998, in every illegal action linked to the Provisional IRA, we have seen Sinn Féin’s loyalty to that organisation is absolute and it will not allow criticism of it. Ultimately, this goes to the heart of why we need a genuine commitment to end the cult of paramilitarism.  If one honours a 30-year dirty campaign waged in the face of the overwhelming and repeatedly expressed views of the Irish people, how can one deny the same legitimacy to others? If one says that campaign was the only legitimate expression of republicanism in the last half century, how can one say that now only constitutional republicanism is legitimate? The cult of paramilitarism is a curse which is holding back progress on this island.  In the North, it is vulnerable communities on both sides which are suffering the most.  The local big men, who claim to police but are really enforcing silence, must no longer be sheltered by parties which lack the bravery to put the public interest ahead of the interest of their comrades.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> If we are to rebuild trust and have sustainable progress, we need a number of new initiatives. A permanent process for monitoring and publicly exposing paramilitary organisations, active or dormant, is clearly required.  Unless we have this, we will remain stuck in the cycle of denial and attempts to politicise legitimate security activity. We need a more open approach to the past.  There must be an end to the situation where Sinn Féin and the British Government demand openness of others but show none of it themselves.  Victims have the right to know why and how their loved ones were killed. In the institutions in the North, we need a return to the principle of inclusivity.  The Sinn Féin-DUP stranglehold on all processes must be ended.  The civic forum, which is an obligation of the Agreement, must be restored and the exclusion of other parties from discussions cannot be allowed to continue. </p>
          <p eId="para_595"> The Dublin and London Governments have to understand and accept the need for their continued high-level engagement in Northern matters.  Linked to this is the need for them to commit to recognising the priority needs of Northern communities.  The extension of British welfare policies to Northern Ireland will cause immense social damage and it should be stopped now while there is still time. We also need a genuine all-island development plan, one with the ambition and scale required to overcome the lasting damage of the conflict on both sides of the Border.  The six-county plan developed by Sinn Féin, the DUP and London is nowhere near good enough. Finally, we need a renewed commitment to developing the North-South dimension in other areas.  There are many services which would benefit from joint planning and delivery.  They threaten no one's political beliefs but they offer the prospect of practical progress in the spirit of the Agreement freely entered into by the people of this island. We need to move on from a process focused on parties and movements to one focused on addressing the needs of people.  There is no more time to waste. The cult of paramilitarism has no positive role to play and it represents a real threat to sustainable peace and reconciliation.  If we want to end the cycle of distrust and crisis, then we have to demonstrate that paramilitarism will not be tolerated in any form.</p>

          <p eId="para_596">Cuirim fáilte roimh an díospóireacht seo. However, it takes great patience to sit and listen to some of the rubbish and the lies which are peddled here, thinly disguised as a serious contribution to the resolution of the problems facing the people of this island as a result of partition. Ní bhíonn go leor díospóireachtaí anseo againn nó go leor ama againn ar chor ar bith chun na rudaí tábhachtacha seo a phlé. Sinn Féin has consistently proposed that there be a monthly Dáil debate on the North and I again urge the Taoiseach to agree to this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> The Good Friday Agreement marks the most significant political development on this island since Partition. An international agreement, it involved the two Governments and Nationalist, republican and Unionist political parties in the North. It has provided a peaceful and democratic way to deal with contentious constitutional and political issues. It has opened up a new and peaceful path to the realisation of Irish unity and ending the union where none presented before. However, the political process has been held back by continuous phases of instability since 2010. This stems from the negativity, disengagement and mismanagement of both the peace and political processes by the present British Government. Tragically, this approach has been mirrored by the Irish Government's semi-detached approach to the North. Both Governments have failed to honour their commitments to ensure full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements since 1998. A commitment made at Weston Park to investigate the murder of human rights lawyer Pat Finucane has not been honoured or implemented. In the St. Andrews Agreement, a commitment was made to Acht na Gaeilge. This has not been honoured or implemented. There is no bill of rights or all-island charter of rights. There is no civic forum. </p>
          <p eId="para_598"> In the period from 2010, the two Governments have stepped back from their responsibilities and political unionism has refused to properly support power sharing in the North. That has contributed directly to the serious political difficulties and ongoing instability, particularly around dealing with the past, disputed parades, flags, symbols and cultural identity. Despite intense lobbying and advocacy by Sinn Féin, there has been a failure to implement the equality, parity of esteem and mutual respect elements of the Good Friday Agreement. This impasse led to the convening of talks by Richard Haass and Meghan O'Sullivan in late 2013. British Government and Unionist rejection of the Haass-O'Sullivan proposals and further political instability led to further political negotiations in November and December 2014 at Stormont House. Bealach nua chun tosaigh a bhí ann i gComhaontú Theach Chnoc an Anfa agus tá dóchas le fáil ann go fóill. However, this difficult political situation has been exacerbated by the austerity crisis caused over recent years by the British Government's reduction of the North's block grant by £1.5 billion. This has had devastating consequences for public services, jobs, social welfare protections and economic growth in the Six Counties. With the election of a majority Tory Government in May, worse is set to come. Another £1.4 billion will be cut from the block grant. An estimated £120 million per year will be taken from the pockets of working families as a result of Conservative cuts to tax credits. British Government austerity policies have deepened political instability in the North. Cuireann polasaí na Tories an próiseas agus na hinstitiúidí i mbaol.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> Against this backdrop, political unionism has contrived to create a real crisis following the murders in Belfast of Jock Davison and Kevin McGuigan. This crisis was facilitated when a criminal investigation into Kevin McGuigan's murder morphed into an assessment of the status of the IRA by the PSNI leadership. While the PSNI chief constable may argue that this was not a political intervention, it is the responsibility of the PSNI to investigate criminality and to make those responsible accountable in the courts. It should do this by following the evidence and it is assured of the support of Sinn Féin in so doing. However, Sinn Féin will strongly resist any efforts to bring what should be operational matters for the PSNI into the political processes. We reject totally and will resist any efforts to undermine the rights of our electorate or any other section of voters.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">This was the background for a cynical electoral power play between the two main Unionist parties which brought these talks to an effective standstill pending the publication of a report by the British Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> Some elements of the British report, and a parallel report from An Garda Síochána, were seized upon by opponents of Sinn Féin, including the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Fianna Fáil leader, and misused for narrow, party political agendas. There has been a deliberate effort to criminalise and demonise republicans, Sinn Féin activists and other citizens, especially those in cross-Border communities in places like south Armagh and north Louth. Contrary to the Wild West image portrayed by some elements in the media and others in this Chamber, the people of the Border region are decent law-abiding citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> Let me also hold up to ridicule the absurd notion that there is a twilight zone in which the Garda colludes with republicans involved in fuel smuggling and so on as part of the peace process. This is patent rubbish. Let me repeat once again that Sinn Féin is totally and absolutely opposed to criminality of all kinds and we stand with communities across this island and with An Garda Síochána and the PSNI in opposing criminal gangs and criminality in all its forms. As a consequence of this, Sinn Féin members and our homes and families have been attacked. Despite this, Sinn Féin will be to the forefront of any future initiative to tackle paramilitaries or criminality on this island. No other party has done more to build the peace, reach out to others and robustly face down violent loyalism and so-called republican dissidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> I have also made it clear that Sinn Féin members are only accountable to our electorate. Sinn Féin has no fear of the electorate. We respect them. They are the people, after all, who gave us our mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> Despite the political opportunism and cynicism which was evident in the efforts of the Taoiseach to get the Assembly adjourned and the entirely ham-fisted call by the Fianna Fáil leader for the suspension of the political institutions - this cynicism is again evident in the Dáil today - talks have recommenced in Belfast. This is very much to be welcomed. Ach tá an baol ann go gcuirfidh daoine isteach ar an dul chun cinn atá déanta, sin daoine atá agus a bhí i gcónaí in aghaidh an phróisis ar fad.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> I spend at least two days a week if I can in the North and I spend most Mondays in Stormont. There is a widespread conviction that some elements within political unionism have pulled back from the political process and are not seriously committed to power sharing. I always make the case that this is understandable because if they have other options, they will take the other options. If governments keep to their obligations and responsibilities and implement agreements that have been made, then this old guard has less room to manoeuvre. The British Government position lacks credibility and there is no genuine intent to resolve the impasse.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> The very people in MI5 and in the old guard of the RUC, who produced the recent report, have also brought in a veto to stop the families of victims of British terrorism from getting the truth about what happened to their loved ones. These folks are locked into the conflicts of the past. They are the same people who directed agents, informers and paramilitary organisations that killed hundreds of citizens, including citizens in this city, with the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, and stirred sectarian violence and colluded in murder. They are prepared to put the peace and political processes at risk in an effort to stop the growth of Sinn Féin, North and South. These are the people some in this Dáil choose to believe. The Fianna Fáil leader does not believe the Garda Commissioner but he believes MI5. MI5, some in the PSNI and the British Government have also attempted to use the new legacy legislation to elevate British interests above those of victims and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> Victims’ groups are seriously concerned about the British Government attempting to row back from commitments on dealing with the legacy of the past. They are anxious and upset following a meeting last week with British Government representatives called to discuss the progress of legislation on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> The British and Irish Governments agreed at Stormont House on the need to provide justice and truth-recovery mechanisms that would give disclosure to families of victims of the conflict. The British Government's legislation is in clear breach of this agreement. The legislation is all about hiding the British state’s role as a central player in the conflict and its collusion with Unionist paramilitary death squads. This is unacceptable. People there - I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has met some of them - look to this Government to stand up for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> All measures to deal with the past, including any legislation, must reflect the commitments made at Stormont House by the parties and the two Governments. Given the serial crises in the political institutions in recent years, their reputation and public confidence in them has been severely undermined. It is the responsibility of the Executive parties to repair this. The responsibility of the Irish Government and of the parties in this Dáil should be to support the efforts to make progress and not to place narrow self-serving party political objectives and opportunistic untruthful propaganda above the necessary process of change and progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> Sinn Féin’s priorities have been to ensure the efficient functioning of the power-sharing institutions while endeavouring to create jobs, reduce unemployment, protect the most vulnerable and bring forward working budgets that ensure delivery of front-line services. I commend the patience and fortitude of the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, MLA, in this regard. He has played a consistently positive role. In particular, he has demonstrated an extraordinary willingness to reach out to others whether within unionism or in the British royal family.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> Sinn Féin wants the political institutions to work and to deliver for citizens. Despite all the difficulties, the Executive, the Assembly and the all-Ireland institutions have worked better for citizens than the years of direct rule by unaccountable British Ministers and decades of one-party rule by the Ulster Unionist Party. </p>
          <p eId="para_612"> The British Government needs to accept the reality of special circumstances in the North. I know the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade accepts this; I am uncertain if the Taoiseach does. The North is a society emerging from decades of conflict. It has always been a dysfunctional society; partition has that effect. Both Governments must accept the need for an economic dividend to the necessary process of peace building and political and societal change. Both Governments must fully implement the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements. The Irish Government needs to play a more constructive ongoing consistent role in the North and I have made this point many times to the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> Citizens in this State expect their Government to proactively pursue and promote the peace process. Citizens in the North, even those within unionism, expect the same. All of us in the Dáil must work to break down partitionist mindsets. This is a particular challenge for the Taoiseach and other leaders here. This Dáil itself needs to break out of a partitionist mindset. It was an interesting experience to hear the Tánaiste mention partition in an otherwise unremarkable and barely coherent contribution. The Government needs to move beyond its occasional rhetoric about republicanism. Any government that truly wants to unite all the people of this island, including those who see themselves as British, in peace, equality and harmony, needs to work diligently and in an effective way towards that end. There is also a constitutional imperative and obligation on the Government to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> This means pursuing every avenue to promote greater all-Ireland co-operation and working to build relationships on the basis of equality between all our people, regardless of their background or tradition. It is through the building of all-Ireland sectors as part of a single-island economy, including the environment, health, energy, education and agriculture, that peace and unity will be established. We must use every available opportunity to utilise the goodwill of our international friends, including those in the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">It also means proactively reaching out to Unionists. Crucially, the Government must end the practice of playing junior partner to the British Government when it comes to the peace process. The Government must see itself as a co-equal guarantor and deal with the British Government on that basis. Anything else is a recipe for failure. The British Government cannot be allowed to set the agenda, the pace of negotiations or the scope of discussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> I have urged the Taoiseach here many times to prioritise his engagement with the British Prime Minister with the objective of stabilising and sustaining the political institutions set up under the Good Friday Agreement but also to deliver on the separate responsibilities and obligations of both Governments. A 15 minute phonecall and an occasional meeting on the margins of other meetings with the British Prime Minister is not good enough. The process needs a consistent, strategic involvement on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will have noted, as I did, the positive contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock. I am sure the former will vouch for the fact that Sinn Féin is currently working positively with all of the political parties and with the two Governments. However, as a co-equal guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, and other agreements, the Taoiseach must engage with the British Prime Minister with greater focus and consistency. We must accept that the peace process is bigger than party political point scoring or narrow electoral considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> As I have said here previously, this is a time of change for the British union and that has major implications for the North. That situation in itself is destabilising elements of unionism. The issue of Scottish independence has not gone away and remains a live political issue with obvious implications for the North of Ireland. The Government can rest assured that unionism is watching that space very closely. While Sinn Féin is highly critical of elements of the European Union, including the lack of democratic accountability, the narrow ideological pro-austerity focus and the failure to deal with the humanitarian crisis faced by refugees, the prospect of increased or full withdrawal by the British state from the EU or the significant erosion of human rights protections also have major implications for Ireland, North and South.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> All these issues argue in favour of the Government to be fully and consistently engaged in a strategic manner, in keeping with its constitutional obligations, as well as its responsibilities under a series of agreements. There is a clear onus on the Government to contribute fully to the development of the A5, the Ulster Canal, the bridge at Narrow Water, as well as other capital projects. That has been made clear by both the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. The British Government must also face up to its economic obligations. It is not clear whether the British Government will ever accept its role as a participant in the conflict but the Government must insist that it does. British political and economic policy towards the North must change if we are to see political stability and proper commitment to real power sharing and to sustaining the institutions, which requires a workable budget. Let us have no doubt about that. Without a proper budget, the Executive cannot deliver the economic dividend that is required. Today's bad news about the job losses at Michelin show the challenges that face working people.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> Important contributions that are being made by civic society should not be ignored. They include Punching Above Our Weight by the Confederation of British Industry, CBI, Growing the Economy and Living Standards by the Unite union, the substantive Irish Congress of Trade Unions submission to last year's Stormont House negotiations and the content of the recent Equality Coalition conference in Belfast.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> Our opponents here lecture us on the need to build trust. At the same time, they patronise, insult, engage in the most vile, offensive and untruthful invective against us and our party. Let me assure the House that Irish republicans need no lectures from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the Labour Party. We will work with them. We know the business of building peace is challenging but that is our priority. In the short time available, we need to see energy, vision and inspiration. In short, we need to usher in a new phase of the peace process and that is Sinn Féin's focus.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Halligan<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_623">I would have liked much more time to speak on the issue but I do not have it. The two recent reports on the status of Northern Ireland paramilitaries and criminality have thrown into focus public concerns that paramilitarism remains in existence. As the previous speakers have indicated, there can be no tolerance by this Parliament for violence of any kind. I am not altogether comfortable with any suggestion that a violent campaign was necessary to force a peace process into place in the first instance to improve life for the citizens of the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> Between 1968 and 1994 more than 3,500 people died and another 35,000 were injured in Northern Ireland as a direct result of what is called the Troubles. Society in the North is still embittered and segregated and the quality of life for many has not changed at all. A united Ireland, which so many believed they were fighting for, is further away than ever. The civil rights movement of the 1960s had undoubted benefits for the Catholic Nationalist minority; a significant case in point being fair employment legislation from the 1980s, as a result of which more Catholics and Protestants worked together than ever before.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> Some sports have proven to be highly effective unifiers. However, such integration is limited. One only has to look at working class communities, which I have visited on a number of occasions and which were most affected by the Troubles, to see the proof. Resource competition is segregated, as is housing. The vast majority of Protestant and Catholic children continue to be educated separately. Fears prevail that simply cannot be overcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> The effects of the conflict on the economy of Northern Ireland have been well documented. Low wages and low labour productivity rates are directly connected to the Troubles and their legacy. Manufacturing employment went into serious decline when violence levels increased, hence increasing the province’s dependence on Great Britain for subsidies to maintain its standard of living. Such was the relevance of the subsidies that at one point in the 1980s, it was estimated that without them the living standards of Northern Ireland would approach that of Mexico and Argentina. As the private sector shrank, as foreign investors were put off by violence, the public sector increased sizeably and there was a significant duplication of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> A report by the consultants, Deloitte, estimated that in terms of lost opportunity, the violence in Northern Ireland resulted in the loss of approximately 27,600 jobs from 1983 to 2000 and the loss of potential investment amounting to approximately £225 million and a further £1.461 million in tourism revenue. The social and economic problems that have grown out of the missed opportunities are still having a detrimental effect on generations in terms of poverty and joblessness. Those households are predominantly concentrated in working class areas where poverty levels continue to rise. Areas of Belfast have some of the highest rates of child poverty in the United Kingdom. A report estimated that by 2020, 39% of children in the North would be living in relative poverty. A significant number of households have experienced intergenerational poverty or joblessness and are far removed from job-readiness and the labour market.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> Historically, Northern Ireland has been neglected in terms of investment and infrastructure. It is interesting that another direct legacy of the Troubles is the fact that almost half of the working age population in receipt of incapacity benefit have been diagnosed with mental and behavioural disorders. A significant proportion of those people reside in areas close to what is known as the peace lines and grew up surrounded by violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> History will decide the full legacy of the Troubles but there can be no denying that a huge conflict still exists in Northern Ireland and the peace process did not bring about socioeconomic security and peace of mind to a considerable proportion of the population. The working class is as divided as it ever has been.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">The objective of socialists and people like me was to reunite working classes, irrespective of their creed, colour or political persuasion. Unfortunately, because of what has happened, we are far from that if one considers the current position in Northern Ireland. I always have agreed with the philosophy and ideal that working people across the Thirty-two Counties in Ireland need unification, not a particular group of people because they wish to be part of a republic or part of a Thirty-two-County solution. The same problems exist for working people throughout the Thirty-two Counties.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T18:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_631">Over the summer months, the news pertaining to the killings of Jock Davison and Kevin McGuigan shook people's confidence as to whether they thought the IRA had gone away, the peace process was moving on and things were developing and moving on. This has shaken the confidence of a great many people nationwide as to what they can foresee for the future and what they envisage about how things can proceed. However, much of the sometimes hysterical reaction in this House to some of the aforementioned incidents and attempts to try to score political points, possibly with a view to the forthcoming general election, serve no purpose. I believe the people will look beyond that and will make their own decisions on these issues. I have heard from many people that they will make their decision regardless of what the Government tries to say or regardless of how it attempts to engage in political point scoring on these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> One vitally important point across the entire peace process is it is only by making politics work and making the process of peace work that one can undermine the existence of paramilitary organisations across the Six Counties and across the two states, that is, by making sure it works, matters can be dealt with fairly and openly and people can get the answers they deserve. Under the Good Friday Agreement, one sees victims and families seeking answers 20, 30 or 40 years later but they still cannot get closure and cannot get responses from the British Government, which is and has been a party to the conflict all along. It continues to undermine the process and to undermine the finding of the truth and closure for those families and victims. This does much more to undermine stability than anything else, other than trying to coax parties to work together or whatever in Stormont and so on. These are the matters on which Members and the Irish Government should be concentrating. The Government should be forcing the British Government to live up to its responsibilities and to ensure that by doing so, paramilitaries can be undermined right across the board, regardless of who they are and who they claim to represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> If one considers the recent Stormont House Agreement Bill published by the British Government, it contains nothing that will provide any of the answers or solutions I believe the families and victims need. There has been no consultation on the Bill. Victims were not consulted and have been ignored completely in this regard. Moreover, the British Government has set it up in such a way that it will have all the opt-outs it will need. As Members have seen repeatedly over the past 40 years, the British Government will be able to hide behind the issue of national security. It will allow the British Government to not deal with issues, not negotiate and not forward information to families. These are the matters on which the Government should be arguing and fighting the British Government tooth and nail to make sure that when it is passed, the legislation will provide for what the Stormont House Agreement was meant to provide, that is, mechanisms for dealing with the past, dealing with historical inquiries, dealing with information for victims and dealing with information in respect of events that took place over the years of the Troubles.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> If the Government continues to not engage with the British Government in this regard, we will revert to these crises continuously for ever more, probably until the whole conflict reignites in a disastrous way for the entire country. Consequently, the Government must engage fully. It must get the British Government to accept it was a party to the conflict and it must put it up to the British Government every step along the way to ensure that what emerges from the Stormont House Agreement will provide what is needed for people right across the North. This is of vital importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> The Taoiseach spoke earlier about welfare being a matter for Stormont. In that case, how did the Minister allow it to be included in the Stormont House Agreement? How did the Government allow this to happen unless it was looking at its own political aims in this regard? The Government should make sure that welfare is removed from the Stormont House Agreement and that the British Government lives up to its obligations in order that the legislation actually reflects the needs of citizens right across the State.</p>

        <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_250">
          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T18:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_636">The Good Friday Agreement has been perceived worldwide as an example of how to achieve peace and how to get conflicting sides around the table to engage in dialogue that leads to agreement and gives communities an opportunity to live their lives in peace. I acknowledge the work done by both the political figures and by those whose names are not in the public domain, including members of the clergy, the Civil Service, individuals and communities. However, for peace to last, it must be accompanied by justice and one aspect that struck me was the haste to have everything signed by Good Friday, perhaps so it could have the name, "the Good Friday Agreement". This haste has resulted in issues being unresolved, with flags and parades being two that spring to mind immediately. There undoubtedly are people in both loyalist and republican communities and circles who feel let down by the Good Friday Agreement and who thought their principles and values were not validated, respected or recognised in the agreement. While Members are aware the vast majority of people agreed to the Agreement in the referendum, 360,000 people rejected it and I believe a sense of complacency set in and the views of those 360,000 people were left unresolved, particularly in the North. This sense of abandonment continues to this day and consequently, one can see dissent in both loyalist and republican circles. Moreover, one can see increased numbers of so-called dissidents in jails in Northern Ireland. I wish to make the point in the Chamber, as I do on visits to prisoners in the North, that I do not believe in the use of physical force. However, there is an injustice in the way in which these male and female prisoners are left in jail in the North on remand for excessively long periods. As Members are concerned about an Irish citizen in a similar situation in an Egyptian jail, many Irish men and women are in a similar situation in the North. This issue, as well as other issues in the prisons, is not contributing to a conflict-free environment in prison or in society, nor is the perceived view of those prisoners that neither the legal system nor the parole commission system in the North is serving their issues or is being just to them. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and we receive delegations from conflict areas who come to Ireland to learn about the process that led to the Good Friday Agreement, the latest one being this afternoon. However, Members must be honest about the outstanding issues that remain to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> Those living in Border areas know about the illegal activity that goes on in smuggling, fuel laundering and extortion but one does not see the number of convictions that is proportionate for the extent of this illegal activity. I represent a constituency that has been damaged and ravaged by drugs and find it completely reprehensible and a complete violation of republicanism, in particular, that the value of republicanism has been used by certain groups that are involved in this sort of activity. I refer to the conclusion of the Villiers report about the main paramilitary groups operating during the Troubles still being in existence and a feature of life in Northern Ireland, albeit that they have undergone significant change. However, a worrying factor is that the leadership of some groups does not have control over the members. There is no place for paramilitary groups in a democracy and this issue must be addressed. While the Villiers report is quite negative in places, I wish to consider the positive developments in communities, some of which have been making presentations before the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in recent weeks. Some of these are involved in issues pertaining to the legacy of the past. However, I again make the point that people, families, individuals and communities still are waiting on answers and the British Government and other groups are allowed to continue to make excuses on this matter. In this regard, I think of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, Ballymurphy, the murders of Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson and at Darkley hall and the Widow Scallan's pub. Other groups have also appeared before the aforementioned committee and are funded through the reconciliation fund promoting lasting reconciliation and building sustainable community relations. These include groups such as the Pat Finucane Centre, the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation, the Bloody Sunday Trust, WAVE Trauma Centre and Crossfire Trust. Despite much positive work that is going on, there still are sectarian and racist tensions with intolerance and hatred remaining. How does one go about re-establishing the trust and respect? That means real dialogue and means taking on the difficult and contentious issues. I suggest the bill of rights could be a way forward but there is disagreement on where responsibility lies. Surely, it is the responsibility of all political parties in the North to be the drivers, with the co-operation of the British and Irish Governments. It was a central provision of the Good Friday Agreement and it would be based on the European Convention on Human Rights. Respect for human rights, parity of esteem and so on is the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> Through the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, we have also met groups who are funded through the community relations council and I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work they are doing. Those who feel disenfranchised because of political and economic decisions, including the so-called dissident groups, republicans or loyalists, will have to be listened to if we want to have a just and lasting peace.</p>

          <p eId="para_639">The Villiers report brings into the open what most people already know, namely, that all the main paramilitary organisations which operated during the Troubles still exist. The report was commissioned in the aftermath of the killing of Kevin McGuigan in east Belfast on 13 August and of Jock Davison in the markets in June. The Anti Austerity Alliance and the Socialist Party condemn both murders, just as we stood opposed to the murderous campaign of all paramilitary groups and of killings carried out by the state in the past. The aforementioned murders would likely have quickly slipped out of the headlines but for the announcement of the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, on 22 August that he believes the Provisional IRA still exists and that its members were involved in Kevin McGuigan's murder. His statement confirmed what most working class people in the North believe, namely, that paramilitary groups still exist and still prey on the most deprived and neglected communities. Of course, this is not just a question of republican groups. The loyalist UDA was almost certainly responsible for the murder of Brian McIlhagga in Ballymoney in January this year. In June, Derry man, Paul McCauley, died nine years after being assaulted at a family barbecue, for which again the UDA is thought to be responsible. Recently, the UDA, allegedly, crucified one of its victims, nailing him to a table. The loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force also remains active. Last year, it repeatedly shot Jemma McGrath in east Belfast, in an attempt to kill her. On top of this, the various dissident republican groups continue with their dead-end campaigns. </p>
          <p eId="para_640"> There is a punishment shooting or beating every third day in the North. There have been 600 recorded sectarian so-called incidents at the peace lines over the last year alone. The Villiers report states that the main paramilitary groups and their leaderships are committed to peace and acting to restrain and manage members of their organisations. This approach is not dissimilar to the famous words of former British Home Secretary, Reginald Maudling, who in the early years of the Troubles said he would settle for achieving an acceptable level of violence. Today, the British state has effectively settled for an acceptable level of violence and the existence of paramilitaries as long as these organisations do not pose any threat to stability and are focused on carving up and controlling working class communities as part of the peace process. Catholic and Protestant working class people should not have to settle for an acceptable level of violence, which is maintained by dozens of permanent so-called peacelines, thousands of armed police and the local enforcement activities of paramilitary groups interested primarily in control of their areas. </p>
          <p eId="para_641"> It should be remembered that in a period of relative peace, 150 people have died since 1998. Between 2001 and 2012, there were more than 1,500 shooting incidents and more than 1,000 bombing incidents. Even if yet another agreement is cobbled together, it will not deal in any fundamental way with the paramilitary control over working class communities. Only one force is capable of pushing the paramilitaries to one side and ultimately breaking their grip. That force is a united and organised working class. Working people are united in their trade unions and on many occasions have followed a union lead to strike and demonstrate against sectarianism and the paramilitaries. One of the hidden stories of the Troubles and the peace process is the role of trade unionists in confronting paramilitary and sectarian killings on a number of occasions. For example, in March 1989 when socialists and the Mid-Ulster Trades Council called for strike action following the murder of three Protestants by the IRA, workers from the Unipork factory and others responded in their hundreds. When Maurice O'Kane, a Catholic welder, was murdered by the UVF in Harland and Wolff in 1994 shop stewards immediately called thousands of workers out and left the shipyard empty. There are countless other examples which show the power of ordinary people and the power of the trade unions to take on sectarian forces. Today they could and should organise against paramilitary racketeering and intimidation.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> We can have no confidence in sectarian parties, paramilitary organisations or the British and Irish Governments to maintain an acceptable level of violence indefinitely. A peace process based on sectarian forces is one riddled with crisis and division that will pave the road back to conflict. An alternative agreement must be built, based not on the coming together of sectarian leaders at the top of society but of ordinary working class communities coming together in the spirit of solidarity and prepared to find a solution, based on compromise, to the issues that divide communities. The building of a new type of politics, the politics of a united workers movement, is necessary for this to happen. This means building a new party of working people. A new generation born since the ceasefire of 1994 will make this happen. Young people in the North are fed up with austerity, living in a socially backward state and with being imprisoned in Northern Ireland's past. They are rightly impatient to live in a society where they have the right to live in peace, free from intimidation, division and bigotry. The sectarian parties have failed to resolve the problems of poverty and division that face ordinary people. It is time to build a movement that will solve those key issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_643">I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on the current situation in Northern Ireland. In his statement, the Taoiseach outlined the priority which this Government attaches to peace and stability in Northern Ireland. Work to deliver a reconciled and peaceful Northern Ireland as part of a prosperous and inclusive island of Ireland continues every day across government, regardless of the news cycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> Our focus is, of course, on the current political talks in Belfast, which I co-chair with the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers. Progress has been made and there has been an intensification in engagement over recent days. The Government believes that the best agreement is one that all five Northern Ireland parties can support and commit to implement and we are working to that objective. Specifically, we aim to reach collective agreement on the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and a shared approach to end the impact and legacy of paramilitarism. I welcome the opportunity to update the House on progress on these issues but must emphasise that as negotiations are still ongoing, I am not yet in a position to speak in definitive terms about the likely or final outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> The implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, which was concluded under the auspices of both Governments in December 2014, is a central element of the talks. The agreement offers a template for overcoming serious difficulties in the Executive, especially around financing, welfare reform and dealing with the legacy of the past. While financing and welfare reform is primarily an issue for the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, I have continually encouraged the parties to resolve their differences for the sake of Northern Ireland's economic stability and the sustainability of public services. I accept that the British Government has a key role to play in this area and its engagement will, I hope, continue to recognise the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland as a society dealing with the legacy of conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> The Good Friday Agreement states in its opening words that the tragedies of the past have left a deep and profoundly regrettable legacy of suffering. More than 3,500 lives were lost in the course of the Troubles, which is an appalling legacy that has left wounds of memory that will never fully heal but we need to continue to do everything possible to ease the hurt and comfort the survivors. Working with the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, I am determined that the work begun by the Stormont House Agreement on establishing institutions to deal with the legacy of the past will be completed so that justice and truth can bring what healing is possible to victims and survivors of the Troubles and their families. I am working intensively with the Secretary of State and the Northern Ireland political parties to ensure the timely establishment of these institutions, including the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval, the Historical Investigations Unit, the Implementation and Reconciliation Group and the Oral History Archive. The Stormont House Agreement set out the political framework for these institutions but we are now working through, in more operational detail, how they will be established and function. Given the sensitivity of the issues concerned, this is not without contention and I do not propose to comment on the detail of proposed drafts or solutions currently on the table. Instead, I will offer some observations on what this Government wishes to see reflected in any final outcome on legacy issues. There will, in any event, be a need for legislation in this jurisdiction on a number of elements so we will have ample opportunity to discuss the detail in this House when the relevant Bill is introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> The Historical Investigations Unit, HIU, will be a new independent body with full investigatory policing powers. It will take forward investigations in Northern Ireland into outstanding Troubles-related deaths, including cases from the PSNI's Historical Enquiries Team process and the legacy work of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">For our part, we want to see a HIU which faithfully reflects what is envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement and is, therefore, victims-centred, independent and transparent and provides every opportunity to ensure effective investigations which are human rights compliant. Building on the excellent experience of the existing North-South police co-operation, the Government is committed to ensuring full co­operation by the relevant authorities in this jurisdiction with the HIU and, if necessary, to bring forward legislation to give effect to this commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> The Independent Commission on Information Retrieval, ICIR, will enable people from both jurisdictions to seek and receive information about the death of their loved ones during the period of the Troubles. The work involved in setting up the ICIR includes the conclusion of a bilateral agreement between the Irish and British Governments as well as legislation in both jurisdictions. The overriding priority for the Government is to establish a commission which is fully independent and, therefore, has the trust and confidence of the victims and survivors and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> A key element of the suite of legacy mechanism is the Implementation and Reconciliation Group, IRG. It will receive any potential evidence base for patterns and themes from the other mechanisms dealing with the past and commission work in this area from independent academic experts. The IRG will also encourage and support other related initiatives that contribute to reconciliation, better understanding of the past and reducing sectarianism. The framework also includes an oral history archive to provide a central place for people from all backgrounds and from throughout Britain and Ireland to share experiences and narratives related to the Troubles. The archive will be independent. It will be free from political interference.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> As two high-profile murders in east Belfast in the summer and assessments from An Garda Síochána and the PSNI and MI5 made clear, the pernicious impact and legacy of paramilitarism continue to haunt many communities on both sides of the Border. The Taoiseach has made the Government's view clear and I reiterate it. Twenty one years from the first paramilitary ceasefires and 17 years since the Good Friday Agreement, it is long past time that such groups should carry any capacity for any form of threat. The transition to a fully normalised society in Northern Ireland must be taken forward definitively.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> The Garda Síochána's review and the British assessment have acted as a catalyst, injecting fresh momentum into the efforts to collectively address the impact and legacy of paramilitarism. Addressing this issue will require a multifaceted approach across many sectors and two jurisdictions. However, any prospective outcome is likely to include an agreed vision for Northern Ireland beyond the shadow of paramilitarism, a commitment by all parties to work collectively to achieve it and some form of monitoring arrangements to measure progress on achieving these key objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> The effective tackling of criminality and organised crime associated with the legacy of paramilitarism by the forces of law and order will also be a key component of any agreed outcome. Involvement in violence and intimidation, large scale smuggling operations, fuel laundering, drug dealing and extortion are destroying lives on both sides of the Border. This cannot be tolerated in a democratic society.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> Building on the already very successful co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the PSNI, any agreed outcome to the talks should seek to further deepen North-South co-operation to tackle the scourge of this criminality. The Government's objective is to secure agreement on new arrangements for enhanced co-operation, involving all of the key agencies that will more comprehensively crack down on cross-Border organised crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> In considering what needs to be done to remove the culture of paramilitarism, we must not forget that dissident republicans, who completely reject the peace process, pose the biggest threat to security right across the island of Ireland. An Garda Síochána and the PSNI have been most successful in their efforts to thwart the murderous efforts of these terrorist groups and we must all commend and support that vital work of cross-Border co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> As ever, the Irish Government, mindful of its role as co-guarantor of the Belfast Agreement and conscious of its duty to the people of this island, is providing support and encouragement for these talks to succeed. The Government is determined to ensure that the full promise of the Good Friday Agreement is realised and we will spare no effort to achieve this.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> I believe that there exists and remains a willingness on all sides to solve the issues around the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and dealing with the legacy and impact of paramilitarism. I have no doubt that, with the necessary will and determination, agreement is possible. I urge all the parties to engage fully, and in a meaningful and positive way, over the coming days in order that devolved institutions can get back to the business of delivering good government and effective services for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_253">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_658">Each speaker in this debate has referred to the need to deal with the legacy of the past. Last Sunday in my constituency in County Monaghan a mass was celebrated for the late Columba McVeigh, a young man who was taken away and brutally murdered by thugs, criminals and murderers masquerading as republicans. That mass was celebrated by Fr. Sean Nolan in the Church of the Sacred Heart in Carrickroe to mark what would have been Columba McVeigh's 60th birthday last month. His late mother, Vera, along with all his family members and friends, campaigned tirelessly to have her son's remains recovered. She wanted a Christian burial for her son before she passed on to heaven herself. Sadly, and to this day, Columba McVeigh's remains have not been found. He is one of the people we refer to as "the disappeared". Apart from the McVeigh family, three other families have loved ones in that grouping we refer to as "the disappeared". They are Joe Lynskey, Seamus Ruddy and Robert Nairac. Their bodies have not been recovered.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> Due to the good work of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains, 12 bodies have been recovered. It is important to record in this House the extremely good and important work that commission has undertaken since it was established following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. The first commissioner to serve here was my former constituency colleague and friend, the late John Wilson, who also served as Tánaiste. The people who have held that role since on both sides of the Border have done exceptionally good work in extremely difficult circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> I again raise the issue this evening that we, as a Parliament, should appeal to people who have a scintilla of information or knowledge about the murder and burial of those four people, whose remains have not yet been recovered, to come forward to the relevant authorities and provide that information. Every day that passes makes it more difficult to recover those bodies. We cannot imagine, under any circumstances, the terrible grief and suffering those families go through when they have not had the opportunity to give their loved ones a Christian burial or when they cannot go to a grave to lay a flower or say a prayer. We must never forget those families and those people who were brutally murdered.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> It is important in debates such as this that we also appeal to statutory authorities or governments to provide information that can help to lead to the prosecution of those people responsible for horrendous murder and violence. I have had the opportunity to raise with the Minister, as I had with the Secretory of State, Theresa Villiers, and with the British Labour Party's spokesperson on Northern Ireland, the absolute need for the British Government to respond positively to the unanimous requests of this House, made both in 2008 and 2011, in regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. This House passed motions unanimously on both occasions asking the British Government to give an eminent international legal person access to the relevant files and papers relating to those terrible atrocities.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">Again, I reiterate that call this evening. There were many awful days of tragedy on our island during the period known as the Troubles. That day in May 1974 represented the greatest loss of life on this island due directly to the Troubles. That loss of life occurred in our capital city, Dublin, and in Monaghan town in my constituency. That day was, in effect, a mass murder of innocent people. There is a very good reason the British Government has a moral and political obligation to give access to the files and papers relating to those murders. There is very good evidence available, as referred to by the late Mr. Justice Barron in his report for the Oireachtas some time ago, as to where the trail leads and that there was collusion by British state forces with the people who carried out those murders. I know the Minister has raised this matter successively with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the British Foreign Secretary. We need to keep it very much on the agenda. People need to know the truth. When the families of the victims of those particular atrocities speak to me or to other public representatives, or when they talk openly about their great loss and the grief they continue to suffer, they say the least they need to know is the truth. The same goes for the Belturbet bombing of 1972 in my home area in County Cavan. It is important when dealing with the legacy of the past that we deal with all these particular issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> The recent report by the Police Service of Northern Ireland and MI5 on paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland contained serious findings which have profound repercussions for the island. The report stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_664">All the main paramilitary groups operating during the period of the Troubles remain in existence: this includes the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), Red Hand Commando (RHC), Ulster Defence Association (UDA), Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA).</p>
          <p eId="para_665">It is absolutely horrendous these paramilitary groups remain in existence on our island 17 years after the endorsement of the Good Friday Agreement by the overwhelming majority of the people on all of this island. Paramilitarism in any community, and from whatever source, can no longer be ignored or indulged. Paramilitarism manipulating and controlling political parties is nothing short of a direct threat to our democracy. It is imperative we renew and revitalise the hope and energy of the Good Friday Agreement. We are all aware of the major effort made by various Governments, organisations and parties to bring the Agreement about.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> Through parliamentary questions and other debates in the House, we have highlighted the need for additional resources for An Garda Síochána to confront criminality in the Border region. In particular, I reiterate my calls for a cross-Border agency to get to grips with the challenge. Last March, I introduced legislation in the House proposing the establishment of a cross-Border agency, the remit of which would be to deal with this criminality. I welcome the Minister’s statement in the print media yesterday in which he outlined the establishment of such an agency would be part of the talks process. This commitment needs to be backed up by real action. The Dáil will debate my legislation on the establishment of such an agency on 27 November which I hope the Government will support. It will present the Minister with an opportunity to back up his statements on the negotiations under way in Stormont with real action. If my legislation requires amendment or improvement, I will be willing to engage on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> The PSNI and MI5 report on paramilitary activity painted a bleak picture of members of the Provisional IRA engaged in criminal activity. It also highlighted the criminality of other paramilitary organisations. The Border region is bearing the brunt of this through illegal cigarette smuggling and fuel laundering. The latter activity can have serious environmental impacts. Sadly, in the past three years in the Border area in County Louth, we have had the deaths of two members of An Garda Síochána while on duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> The Bill put forward by Fianna Fáil proposes the establishment of a cross-Border agency that will build on existing links between statutory agencies, both North and South. It would enable authorities on both sides of the Border, including environmental bodies, to target and eliminate organised criminality. It is vital the Minister gives the commitment to such an agency as a core part of any agreement from the current talks, which I hope the five parties and both Governments will bring to a successful conclusion shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> It is important we work to ensure we realise the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement. Many people on this island put a major effort into bringing about the Agreement. Those of us who were privileged to campaign for its acceptance by the people in May 1998 were overjoyed that, in this State alone, more than 94% of those who voted endorsed it. That was a significant figure. Similarly, well in excess of 70% of those who voted in Northern Ireland endorsed the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> As I said earlier today during Question Time, the mandate all of us have as public representatives is to ensure we work to implement the Good Friday Agreement, along with the subsequent agreements, including the Stormont House Agreement. I hope everyone participating in the talks will be able to deal with the outstanding issues to ensure Northern Ireland can advance so we can have the real cross-Border and all-Ireland economic development we need to create jobs and a better society for our people. This will also ensure many pockets of deprivation and poverty will be eliminated and dramatically reduced, particularly in areas in Northern Ireland. Different groups come to the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to outline the particular challenges they have in areas of particular disadvantage. That is what the electorate wants us to be talking about. The legacy issues, the paramilitary activity and the criminality have to be dealt with and rooted out of our society once and for all.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_254">
          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_671">I welcome that we are having statements and a debate on the North. Like other speakers, I wish it happened more often and that more time was given for the North to be a regular feature on Dáil business. As an Irish republican, the North is not an abstract issue that can be ignored or set aside. It shaped my politics. What I have seen, heard and experienced has honed my political outlook and brought me on a journey to this institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> I welcome the fact that Stormont voted in favour of legislating for marriage equality on Monday. While 53 MLAs voted in favour of the joint SDLP-Sinn Féin motion and 52 voted against, there will be no moves to legislate for marriage equality because the DUP, Democratic Unionist Party, used its petition of concern on the legislation. It is disappointing the DUP used this power to block the extension of fundamental rights to a minority group, as well as opposing inclusivity and equality. There is a responsibility on all of us to continue to fight for equality for all citizens in the North and across this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> The Good Friday Agreement has had a hugely positive affect on politics on these islands. It is a cross-party and international agreement between two Governments. The current crisis in the political institutions in the North has been created by the negativity and disengagement of the British Government, the lack of leadership among unionism and the lack of creative conditions for a better future.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">At the heart of the problem, however, is the failure to deal with the past and the present. Positive change in people's lives was promised and is still demanded.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> The talks are intensifying and we all hope they can come to a satisfactory conclusion but all outstanding commitments of the Good Friday Agreement, previous agreements and agreements subsequent to it, need to be delivered on. More than 17 years have passed since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, yet we still do not have an Acht na Gaeilge because unionists have said they will not agree to it. We still do not have a bill of rights for the North or a formal role for the community sector and civic society.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> Two weeks ago, the Good Friday Agreement committee, of which I am a member, met to discuss the lack of a bill of rights. In a post-conflict situation, human rights are even more important and a key component and a bill of rights is essential to building confidence in any peace process. It appears to be quite clear that the public has bought into the idea of a bill of rights but the British Government seems intent on producing a watered-down British bill of rights as opposed to one based on the European Convention on Human Rights, which would have a rights-based legislative approach. This narrow approach of the British Government would, if implemented, be a blatant breach of the Good Friday Agreement and must be opposed by all political parties on this island and the Irish Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> In recent weeks we have seen the British Government attempt to depart from the Stormont House Agreement on legacy and victims' issues. The Stormont House Agreement clearly sets out the need to provide justice and truth recovery mechanisms for the families of victims of the conflict, but this needs the Irish and British Governments to pass legislation. The draft legislation being put forward by the British Government on dealing with the legacy of the past would allow them to regulate the handover of what they term "sensitive" information to historical inquiries. This is a clear breach of the Stormont House Agreement. It is a blatant piece of stroke politics designed to hide the British State’s role as an active and central participant in the conflict and, in particular, its collusion with loyalist death squads, including those who planted the Dublin and Monaghan bombs.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> It is undeniable that elements of the British security establishment with a political oversight that ended up in Downing Street armed, trained, supplied intelligence to, directed and controlled these loyalist death squads. The British Government has continually failed to meet its legal responsibilities on dealing with the past. The British Government needs to shoulder its responsibilities in this latest round of negotiations but so does the Irish Government. They need to stand with the victims of British state violence and collusion and support the right of families to full disclosure in their long pursuit to get truth and justice for their loved ones. This latest attempt by the British State to use the fig leaf of security to cover their wrongdoings needs to be stopped in its tracks as it will compound the hurt of victims and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> The British Government is refusing to hold a public and independent inquiry into the killing of the human rights solicitor, Pat Finucane, who was shot dead in front of his family by the UDA on 12 February 1989. Collusion was a matter of institutional and administrative practice by successive governments. The British Prime Minister, David Cameron, has admitted there was collusion in Pat Finucane’s murder and apologised to the family. However, the Finucane family wants the public inquiry that the Irish and British Governments promised.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> In the Weston Park Agreement the British Government committed to holding a public inquiry into his murder but it has failed to do so and reneged on the commitment. The failure to hold such an inquiry is a repudiation of the international agreement between the Irish and British Governments. The Finucane family has now lodged an appeal against the judgment and an order of Mr. Justice Stephens on 8 September that the British Secretary of State was justified in reneging on this commitment made at Weston Park. A full and independent international tribunal of inquiry, where all documents will be examined in public and witnesses compelled to attend and cross-examined by the lawyers of the Finucane family, remains the only model capable of uncovering the truth behind Pat's murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> There is an onus on this Government to go beyond polite requests to David Cameron that are brushed aside and ignored by him. Teachta Adams raised the issue with the British Prime Minister during the Stormont House talks and the Taoiseach decided not to comment. I call on this Government to put in place a vigorous political and diplomatic strategy to raise this case with our international friends, including those in the United States and Europe, at every opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> The difficult political situation is being inflamed by the social and economic cuts imposed by the British Government. The British Government continues to cut the block grant to the North by a further £1.4 billion and an estimated £120 million per year will be taken from the pockets of the poorest families as a result of Conservative cuts to tax credits.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> The North is in a post-conflict cycle and has unique needs and expectations but the British Government refuses to accept this fact. Despite what the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, once said, I think we can all agree that Belfast is not as British as Finchley. Tory advisers based in London refuse to face up to this and their austerity dogma is deepening the political instability in the North. The British Government must provide a workable and sustainable budget for the Executive in order for it to deliver public services and protect the most vulnerable and must devolve fiscal powers to the North. Sinn Féin will not be a part of the institutions if their function is to implement mass social spending cuts that Tories in London are dreaming up.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> The MI5 report shows that there are still elements of British intelligence and other State agencies fighting a rearguard action to try to stop the rise of Sinn Féin. The MI5 assessment that the IRA still exists and the army council exerts influence over Sinn Féin is a partisan, self-serving exercise by the British security services. The report was subject to cherry-picking, distorted and contained unsubstantiated claims by a shadowy intelligence agency that was part of the conflict in Ireland. Any real journalist worth his or her salt would have to question not only the source but examine the strength of the evidence. That evidence, if one reads the report, was based on the statements of informers, Internet gossip, chitter chatter, posts on Facebook, pub talk and journalistic imaginings.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> MI5 colluded with loyalist death squads in the wholesale slaughter of Irish citizens. The Garda Commissioner, Nóirín O'Sullivan, is on record as saying the Garda has found no evidence in this jurisdiction that the provisional army council continues to meet or to exist in the form that was once assumed. For some reason the fact that former IRA members have now become involved in purely peaceful political activities as Sinn Féin members has caused hysterical outrage in some quarters.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> Sinn Féin is committed fully to and supports policing North and South. There is no alternative or halfway house. We are committed fully to policing and the peace process.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_687">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak during this important debate on the North of Ireland and the recent Villiers report. Long before many of the political elite in this State woke up, I supported through thick and thin the peace process and the whole concept of conflict resolution. This was long before it became popular and mainstream. In recent weeks, we have seen the usual suspects coming back and trying to undermine the movement towards democratic change on the island. On a more serious note, we have seen the peace process wreckers emerging from the woodwork. Tonight I challenge them all in this House to get out there and support our peace process. That is the important point in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> It is our peace process and we have a lot of work to do to facilitate the healing of our people and bring them together on this island. However, politicians have to lead on the issue and not use the peace process to score political points. We need a Government that is very proactive and engages more often with the British Government and other people on this island, particularly those in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">We can never take the peace process for granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> With regard to the report and this debate, let us look at the facts. I would always have concerns about major players in a conflict which lasted over 30 years, especially MI5, being allowed to dominate the narrative of this report. However, when one looks at sections of the report, the facts are clear. Of course, we all oppose criminality and I warmly welcome the recent comments by the Minister regarding an all-Ireland cross-Border force to deal with this issue. That is the sensible, logical way forward. However, one cannot be selective. One cannot forget that in the violent conflict in the North there were three sides - republican-Nationalist violence, loyalist-Unionist violence and British state violence. We must not forget that. I raise this in the context of the report. The Government and this House must face up that reality. We cannot ignore the role in the past of loyalist violence, British violence and, in particular, British state violence. In my constituency, for example, I regularly meet members of Justice for the Forgotten. This group was formed in 1996 with the aim of campaigning for truth and justice for the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings which were carried out on 17 May 1974 and in which 34 people, including an unborn baby, died. It was the greatest loss of life in a single day during the Troubles. The group's membership includes the overwhelming majority of those bereaved families and many wounded survivors. The survivors of the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 20 January 1970 united with those of 1974 into a single organisation demanding to know the truth as to why their loved ones died and why so many others were maimed. When one meets those families, the talk is not about revenge but rather about truth and justice. Justice for the Forgotten also represents the bereaved families and survivors of the Belturbet, Dundalk and Castleblayney bombings, as well as families and survivors of the Miami Showband massacre. Justice for the Forgotten supports all of these victims as part of its work. I urge the Minister to keep in regular contact with that group and to work closely with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> The reason I raise this is that no person has ever been prosecuted in connection with any of the cross-Border bombings. Indeed, an official silence was maintained about these events until the early 1990s. Over the years the bereaved families have come to question the complicity of British state forces in the North in the bombings, the actions of the Irish State in pursuing those responsible and the integrity of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, RUC, and Garda investigations. I was a member of the Oireachtas justice committee which dealt with these issues. The first Barron report was produced in 2003 and was followed by the second Barron report in 2004. I raise these issues because it is most important that we examine them and the context relating to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> To return to this debate on paramilitary groups in the North, an assessment was commissioned by the Secretary of State on the structure, role and purpose of these groups. That assessment focused on those who declared ceasefires to support and facilitate the political process. We, as politicians and democrats, must push the political, peaceful and democratic process. I am not a big fan of many of those involved in producing the report. However, I accept the sections of the report that point in a direction where there is much truth. In addition, I do not go along with the recent hysteria in which there were major attacks on the Garda Commissioner regarding her views on these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> In the report, No. 2 of the key judgments concludes that the most serious current terrorist threat in the North is not posed by these groups. With regard to roles, section v. states, "Members of the PIRA have been directed to become involved in the politics of the Provisional movement." Under the heading "Purpose", the report states, "It is our firm assessment that, to different degrees, the leaderships of the main paramilitary groups are committed to peaceful means to achieve their political objectives." The report further states, at No. 14:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_694">The PIRA of the Troubles era is well beyond recall. It is our firm assessment that the PIRA's leadership remains committed to the peace process and its aim of achieving a united Ireland by political means. This group is not involved in targeting or conducting terrorist attacks against the state or its representatives. There have only been very limited indications of dissent to date and we judge that this has been addressed effectively by the leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">I have listened to the debate for the past number of weeks but I never heard people highlighting these sections of the report. I raise this issue because we must focus on the facts and get away from the distractions. We must focus on people who are anti-peace and who are trying to wreck the peace process. Some of them can be politicians and some can be mavericks or dissidents, as they are known.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> I reject any form of violence, and it is important that all Members of the House state that. We also have a duty to work towards achieving peace and reconciliation. We must focus on the real goal, which is a new, peaceful, democratic Ireland. We cannot indulge in political snobbery. Of course, many of the groups emerging from this conflict have baggage and have done terrible deeds but the vast majority - 90% in my opinion - want to try to make amends, move on and implement the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement. Undoubtedly, matters must be very difficult for somebody who was sitting in a pub when their brother or father was blown to bits or if they were watching a football match and somebody came into the pub and sprayed it with bullets. That is horrific. However, the reality is that we must go about making peace. One does not make peace with one's friends, one makes peace with one's enemies.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> I must commend Sinn Féin and how it has worked with the DUP in the Northern Executive. Recently, I attended a meeting with one of the cross-Border groups and I was very impressed by the relationship that has developed between the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Seán Barrett, and Mitchel McLaughlin of Sinn Féin, who is Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly. In fairness, I am also very impressed by some of the Unionist politicians who are trying to reach out and do their best. They are taking hits for it and I accept that. Likewise, Sinn Féin is taking hits from other people as well. The idea is to focus on the objective. We have secured the cessation of violence. The next objective is to carry out the healing and get on with building a modern Ireland. However, we must do this with a lack of political snobbery, which I often encounter in this House and which really upsets me.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> We all have much work to do. There is much healing and forgiving to do on all sides. There must be respect for all of the victims. I am always impressed when I meet the victims by how they are getting on with it. They constantly talk about truth, the right to mourn and the right to justice. Very few of them use the word "revenge". I am blown away by that. We are human beings and if somebody touched a member of our own families, we know how we would feel. There is much forgiving to do on all sides. The bottom line, however, is that there must be respect for all of the victims, as no victim is more equal than others. Only then can we move forward and build a new, modern, inclusive Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> I urge Members to support the peace process, stop the moaning and whingeing and get on with the real job. I hope the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, takes those views on board.</p>

          <p eId="para_700">I thank Members for their contributions, all of which will be the subject of careful consideration on my part. I will return to Belfast early tomorrow morning to co-chair the talks as they reach a critical phase. I will take with me a strong message of support from this House - support for the Good Friday Agreement and the need to safeguard its political institutions; support for victims and survivors in their quest for justice and truth; support for a Northern Ireland that is free from paramilitarism and organised crime; support for deepening cross-Border and inter-agency co-operation to tackle organised crime; and support for political institutions that deliver for the people of Northern Ireland and for the benefit of the island of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> The First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, and Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, have recently spoken of the need for an outcome in days, rather than weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">It was always the intention that the talks be focused and intensive. There is no doubt the negotiations have intensified in recent days, and I expect this to continue this week. The urgency indicated by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in recent days reflects my own sense that an agreement can be reached very soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> I must also acknowledge that while good progress is being made, significant challenges remain, with a number of crucial gaps needing to be bridged between the parties. It is, therefore, not just a question of timing but also one of substance. It is important that both elements of the talks - the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and the impact of the legacy of paramilitarism - are meaningfully addressed in any agreed outcome. The Government strongly believes that the best agreement is one that is forged with all five Northern Ireland parties participating, and one they can support and commit to implementing. That is the objective to which we are working.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> It must not, however, be an agreement that simply carries us forward a few months. I know the people of Northern Ireland are fed up of moving from crisis to crisis, from crisis to agreement and back to crisis again. The seemingly perpetual political paralysis has understandably undermined public confidence and faith in politics and the political institutions. Current talks have the capacity to move Northern Ireland towards a brighter future by agreeing a collective long-term vision for Northern Ireland, a vision that achieves the endorsement of all the parties to the talks and, above all, a vision that engenders and inspires a collective will to deliver: to deliver clear blue water between elected politicians and paramilitary organisations, and to work towards the eradication of paramilitarism for all time; to deliver consensus on a new approach to tackling organised crime, putting in place arrangements that build on the strong cross-Border co-operation between law enforcement authorities and agencies, both north and south of the Border; to deliver the institutions envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement for dealing with the past, ensuring that they serve the needs of victims and survivors of the Troubles; to deliver a shared society governed by efficient and representative devolved institutions which co-operate to build on the all-island economy and to oversee investment and joint efforts in trade and tourism; to deliver political institutions that work to build a world-class infrastructure in order to provide high quality, citizen-centred services, such as an education system that promotes integration; and, in a phrase, to deliver the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> This is the vision the Government has set out for Northern Ireland and is working with all of the parties to achieve. The Government will continue to ensure that it discharges its commitments under the Stormont House Agreement, notably with regard to the setting up of the institutions dealing with the legacy of the past. The Government is also working closely with the Northern Ireland Department of Justice, as well as the British Government, to examine ways to further enhance measures for cracking down on the criminality and organised crime associated with the legacy of paramilitarism, particularly in the Border area.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> The Government's commitment to North-South economic co-operation also remains a priority. The recently announced infrastructure and capital investment plan, with a dedicated section on North-South infrastructure, re-affirms the commitment of this Government to investing in infrastructure projects, such as the A5 Derry road and the restoration of the Ulster canal. All of these efforts are part of the Government's wider objective to fully implement the Good Friday Agreement, to protect the institutions and safeguard and build on the progress we have made since 1998 for the benefit of everybody on this island. The Irish Government, mindful of its role as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and conscious of its duty to the people of the island, will, therefore, spare no effort in providing support and encouragement for a successful outcome to the present talks. Conscious of the mandate I have received from the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Cameron, I shall continue, with the support of the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, to work intensively with the Secretary of State, Ms Theresa Villiers, MP, and the five Northern Ireland parties to the end of reaching a satisfactory conclusion to these talks that will, undoubtedly, chart the progress and the way forward for a better future for everybody on this island.</p>

            <p eId="para_708">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me to raise this important issue. I wish to highlight the injustice done to a cohort of women, whose numbers are as yet undefined. They started their early years in the workforce in insurable employment and, after a number of years, in some cases due to the public sector bar, in other cases due to the fact they wished to rear their families, and in some cases to both, they retired from the workforce. In later years, they then found themselves in a position where they could go back to the workforce, having reared their families but, later again, on applying for the contributory old age pension, they found they did not qualify on the basis they had an insufficient average of contributions over the total period of their working lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_709"> A working life is determined on the basis of the period from the first year in which a person went into insurable employment to the last year in insurable employment, which could be up to 45 years in some cases. The sad part about all of this is that, in many of these cases, the same women could have qualified for a limited amount of contributory old age pension had they not gone back into the workforce at a later stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_710"> Essentially, I am trying to highlight the need for the Minister for Social Protection to address the issue, if at all possible, in the context of the Social Welfare Bill. While that may not be possible, the cost aspect may not be so great that it cannot be incorporated into the Bill. One thing is certain, namely, at some stage in the future, this issue has to be addressed. It is grossly unfair that women who went into the workforce and were then forced, for one reason or another, to retire, having diligently given of their services and made their contribution, find themselves at a later stage to be outside the qualification limits. In some cases, they qualify for a means-tested old age pension, which is fine. However, if they have property or if a spouse or partner has a pension, they will not get a pension in their own right, and if their spouse or partner gets an adult dependent allowance, that will be means-tested.</p>
            <p eId="para_711"> This is an issue that affects quite a number of women, although the exact number cannot be determined at this stage. There is a need to address this. I would ask the Minister who is present in the House, Deputy Varadkar, to discuss this with his colleague in government with a view to identifying the precise nature and extent of the problem, and rectifying it.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_259">
            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy Leo Varadkar)<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_712">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. I am taking the debate on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, who is elsewhere on Government business.</p>
            <p eId="para_713"> The Irish pensions system is made up of a number of schemes based on criteria such as contributions paid, income need and other factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">These ensure that people have an adequate income when they retire. This range of supports has resulted in very similar outcomes for male and female pensioners in Ireland. Poverty rates for women and men over 65 have effectively been at parity over a number of years, despite many women having lifetime lower earnings than men. It should also be noted that, according to the most recent figures, the consistent poverty rate for those over 65 is a quarter of that for working age adults and a sixth of that for children.</p>
            <p eId="para_715"> The State pension contributory is one of a number of schemes and the rate of payment is related to contributions made over the years into the Social Insurance Fund by the person concerned. As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce who have paid more into that fund are more likely to be paid under the scheme. Under the scheme, entitlement is calculated by means of a yearly average calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life. Payment rates are banded. For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20 will qualify for a pension at 85% of the full rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_716"> The homemaker’s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification easier for those who took time out of the workforce for caring duties. It allows up to 20 such years in the period since its introduction to be disregarded when the PRSI record is being averaged for pension purposes. Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment. If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an increase for a qualified adult, amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them. Alternatively, they may qualify for a means tested State pension, non-contributory, which amounts to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_717"> Work is under way to replace the yearly average system with a total contributions approach. Under this approach, the rate of pension paid will more closely reflect the number of contributions recorded over a working life. It is expected that this will replace the current system for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation. When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes.</p>

            <p eId="para_718">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. The most important element of it is in the last paragraph, which relates to the proposed changes. This clearly indicates there is recognition of the need to bring about change. I wish to focus on that. In a previous incarnation, I had some influence on a change in the system from that which prevailed previously, where people with less than an average of 22 contributions over their working life got no pension at all. Those who had more than that, received a full pension. It was decided then it was only just to bring about change and introduce a <i>pro rata</i> pension commensurate with the contributions made.</p>
            <p eId="para_719"> The problem is that people who for economic reasons returned to work since the downturn now find themselves with five or six years extra spent in the workforce. However, this now disqualifies them from a pension. This should not be the case, because they would have already qualified for a limited pension beforehand. Once they had ten years in the workforce previously, their pension was safeguarded. However, once the extra years of service are included, this extends the period in the workforce over their lifetime, from what would have been ten or 12 years to 40 years, 45 years or above, which reduces the average number of contributions over that period, thereby eliminating their access to a contributory pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_720"> While the 2020 objective is laudable, I strongly urge that special consideration be given to the fact that these women all gave good service in the economy in their lifetimes. I do not believe it is justified in any way that they will be punished for going back to work when they were, in fact, forced to return to work due to economic circumstances at a later stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_721">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and believe the anomaly he pointed out may be dealt with by moving from a yearly average system to a total contributions approach. I understand there is an issue where people return to the workforce. Often we encourage people, particularly nurses, to go back to the workforce in later life and I would not like to see them lose out as a result. The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, asked me to take this issue on her behalf and I will certainly draw her attention to the Deputy's comments when I see her tomorrow.</p>

            <p eId="para_722">I and others attended a meeting with parents of girls who received the HPV Gardasil vaccine and whose lives have been dramatically altered as a result. These parents brought a number of concerns to our attention, such as breathing difficulties, hives, joint and muscle pain, muscle weakness, swollen glands, chronic fatigue, headaches, neural damage, noise sensitivity, chills, sleep disturbance, menstrual disruption, food intolerance, difficulty concentrating, panic attacks and depression. The research carried out by these mothers shows that this is not confined to one area in Ireland; therefore these effects are not caused by a rogue batch of vaccine. These effects have also occurred in other countries on the Continent.</p>
            <p eId="para_723"> In a response to a parliamentary question I put to the Minister, he told me there is an expected pattern of adverse effects in line with product information. However, the information mentions minimal adverse effects, not the full range I have mentioned. Also, there is no mention of these adverse effects lasting indefinitely, which is what is happening for over 106 girls here in Ireland. If the Minister does not believe the HPV vaccine is responsible, will he conduct an investigation into why these 106 girls are chronically ill, all with the same debilitating symptoms? It was heart-breaking to listen to these mothers describe how their bright, articulate daughters who were in education or training are now so ill with dramatically altered lives. The information pack that went to schools provided information on the most common adverse reactions to the vaccine and parents were then directed to a website for additional information. Surely all of the information should be included in one information pack.</p>
            <p eId="para_724"> I was also alarmed to read medical reports questioning the fact that this vaccine has any effect on cervical cancer. One report said the vaccine would have no effect in 87% of HPV viruses that might cause cancer and that the causal link between HPV and the later development of cervical cancer is far from definitive and that regular smear tests, with no side effects, can catch cervical cancer in time.</p>

            <p eId="para_725">I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue along with Deputy O'Sullivan. I also met with parents of young girls affected by this issue, a number of whom are in my constituency. A meeting on the issue was also held in Killarney a couple of weeks ago, attended also by Deputies Brendan Griffin and Tom Fleming. There, parents outlined the side effects affecting these young women and the only common denominator is the HPV vaccine. They are extremely concerned about it and I have raised the matter in a number of parliamentary questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_726"> There are several issues. Information is provided with the vaccine, but when parents are asked to consent to the vaccine when these young girls enter second level, a very short information document is provided by the HSE. This document only mentions some of the side effects, compared with the number included on the document supplied with the vaccine by the manufacturers. I believe the issue for these parents and young women is genuine and serious and would not raise it here otherwise. I have heard their stories and have heard of the debilitating effects on these young women and of the emotional damage to these families.</p>
            <p eId="para_727"> I urge the Minister to consider an independent assessment of this matter as there seems to be only one common denominator. Also, the information being given to parents of young women about to get the vaccine should be fully informative. They should not be given a shortened account of the effects. The concern of these parents is that every one of these girls has a pattern of ailments, as outlined by Deputy O'Sullivan, and all seem to suffer from chronic fatigue.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">They have gone around the world at this stage for advice from general practitioners and consultants.</p>
            <p eId="para_729"> In some countries, this vaccine is not given. Why have other countries not fully bought into this vaccine? They have some concerns about it. Surely then we should take the cautious approach; we should stop it and see if it is absolutely safe. To my mind - although I am far from knowledgeable on medical issues - there is a fundamental issue here. I believe the vaccine is having a deadly effect on young women, on their lives and the lives of their families.</p>

            <p eId="para_730">I thank Deputies Moynihan and O’Sullivan for giving me an opportunity to address the House on this issue. I want to acknowledge the concerns of families who believe their daughters have experienced adverse reactions and health issues after receiving the HPV vaccine.</p>
            <p eId="para_731"> As the House will know, the vaccine protects against two high-risk types of HPV that cause 73% of all cervical cancers. The link between HPV and cervical cancer is as well established as the link between HIV and AIDS, even though some very odd people still seem to dispute that. It is estimated that the HPV vaccine will save 60 lives annually in this country. It also protects against genital warts and other cancers, including head and neck cancers, which are truly awful.</p>
            <p eId="para_732"> The vaccine used in the school immunisation programme is Gardasil, a fully-tested vaccine which was licensed by the European Medicines Agency in 2006. Following this, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee recommended that the vaccine should be offered to all girls aged 12 years on an annual basis. The Health Products Regulatory Authority is the statutory authority for medicines in Ireland. While no medicines, including vaccines, are entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised nationally and at EU level. Decisions on the supply of vaccines are undertaken by specific expert agencies rather than being the responsibility of the Minister of the day. This is as it should be as it ensures that decisions are made solely on scientific information and expert advice, rather than being influenced by political pressure or lobbying.</p>
            <p eId="para_733"> As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines the Health Products Regulatory Authority operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment. All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information that may assist in the assessment of the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_734"> I have been informed by the HPRA that up to 9 October it had received 921 reports of suspected adverse reactions or events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines. The vast majority have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines as described in the product information, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and soreness or a rash at the injection site. These are short-lived. As for all licensed medicines, the safety of these vaccines is monitored by the Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee, an EU-level drug safety committee, where the HPRA is represented and actively contributes.</p>
            <p eId="para_735"> I am aware that the European Medicines Agency has commenced a review of the HPV vaccines to further clarify aspects of their safety profile, although the agency points out that this review does not question that the benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh their risks. The HPRA is participating in the review, which aims to clarify aspects of their safety profile and is specifically focusing on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.</p>
            <p eId="para_736"> I have been informed of a project in Denmark which aims to identify possible causes or potential risk factors for adverse reactions to the HPV vaccine. It would not be appropriate for me to comment any further until the results become available. This study, however, follows a major Danish-Swedish register-based study of a million girls from 2013, 300,000 of whom received the HPV vaccine. That study showed no evidence supporting associations between exposure to the HPV vaccine and serious diseases. It has been confirmed by the Danish authorities that they continue to offer the HPV vaccine as a result, as part of their childhood immunisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_737"> In the meantime, the European Medicines Agency has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines. Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using them in accordance with the current product information. Any changes to this advice will be made following the outcome of the review by the European Medicines Agency.</p>

            <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T20:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_738">What has happened in Ireland has happened in Spain, the UK, France, Denmark, Sweden and Italy. There is now a Europe-wide group for those affected. I think it is significant that the Danish Government is spending €940,000 for an independent investigation into the vaccine and the side effects. The experts involved have no ties to the pharmaceutical industry. I must admit to being very wary of the pharmaceutical industry. Whatever good it does, it is really a profit-making machine.</p>
            <p eId="para_739"> I do not want to deprive anybody of a vaccine that is beneficial and I do support any preventative measures, but the reality is that there are at least 106 girls in this country with very debilitating symptoms and the common denominator is the vaccine they have taken. These girls' lives are totally changed. They are not able to live normal lives like their peers. That has to be investigated. It warrants a meeting with the Minister or a very high-ranking official in the Department of Health or the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_740"> In 2009 there was a vaccine damage steering group report at which the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, spoke. He said the most important thing is to remedy the damage that has been done and provide the support the person needs to live as normal a life as possible. I ask the Minister to outline the position regarding the recommendations made by the group.</p>

            <p eId="para_741">I know that the parents who have come together - they are a great group - have sought a meeting with the Minister. I ask him to meet with a representative body of these parents so they can outline the concerns they have.</p>
            <p eId="para_742"> I have scanned through the official response. The word "risk" is there. If there is any risk, no matter how minute it might be in terms of the proof and examination of it by the authorities concerned, if there is a risk that even one young woman could have an adverse effect such as those the parents have been outlining to us, if there is any minute risk at all, should not the State err on the side of caution and withdraw the vaccine until there is a full assessment of what is at stake? The debilitating condition that these young women have is frightening. It merits a full investigation from the State, the Department and the HSE. They should park the vaccine until they can prove that there is no side-effect. That would be in the best interests of everybody. I am aware a request has been made to the Minister for him to meet with a representative of the parents towards the end of November.</p>

            <p eId="para_743">I am very concerned about this whole debate, where it is going and the comments made by some of the Deputies opposite. I am alarmed to hear we are getting into this space again. Deputy O'Sullivan is almost implying that there is some sort of plot from the pharmaceutical industry against people, that it is all about those in the industry making money and that this is not based on evidence or scientific advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_744"> I am also very concerned to hear a Fianna Fáil Deputy calling for a vaccine or drug to be withdrawn without scientific evidence to back it up. That bothers me because we have been here before. We had a similar scare around the MMR causing autism, which some people still believe. Children developed autism and parents connected the vaccine to autism because it was given around the time that those symptoms appeared. Some people still believe in that connection, even though the doctor who came up with it has retracted and has been struck off and even though there is no scientific evidence to support it. The result of that scaremongering and irresponsible behaviour by people who should know better was that some people got measles, mumps and rubella because their parents did not vaccinate them. There is a similar issue on which the jury is still out in respect of narcolepsy, whether it was caused by a vaccine or was coincidental and caused by something else such as a virus.</p>
            <p eId="para_745"> What do we know about this vaccine? We know that it does prevent cervical cancer, which is an awful cancer that kills many women every year. We know it prevents genital warts, head and neck cancers, and also penile and anal cancers in men. We have scientific evidence that this is the case. We do not know if these long-term psychological and physical effects that some people are reporting are any more common among girls who have had the vaccine than among those who have not. The Swedish-Danish study done so far, which went back over a million girls, 300,000 of whom had the vaccine, did not see any higher incidence of any diagnosis or disease in the 300,000 who had the vaccine compared to the 700,000 who did not.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">I appeal to the Members opposite, to Deputies in general and to Senators to be responsible in their comments on this matter because scares in respect of people using medicines and vaccines cost lives. Any decisions that are taken must be based on the scientific facts and the epidemiological evidence, and nothing else. No meeting with me will change that. These decisions are made based on scientific and expert advice and I appeal to Deputies to be responsible in their comments and actions around this issue.</p>

          <speech by="#DessieEllis" eId="spk_271">
            <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T20:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_750">In the five years since this Government took office, private residential rents have increased by a staggering 35%. Rents have increased by 10.3% this year. This is not just causing severe hardship but is pushing families and single people into homelessness. It is for this reason that more people are becoming homeless each month. The housing shortage is the reason they stay homeless. Rent costs are the reason they end up being homeless. I have been asked for help by the parents of young children and young single people - both working and unemployed - who were fighting to hold back the tears as they presented me with letters from their landlords informing them of rent increases. Their incomes are down and the standard of their accommodation is low but the price goes up continually because landlords know they can do this. Those to whom I refer are tired of being kicked around and treated like dirt.</p>
            <p eId="para_751"> The only solution is to regulate the private rented market, thereby controlling rent levels now and into the future in order to ensure fairness. Sinn Féin has long called for such measures. I was pleasantly surprised when the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government said he wanted rent freezes to be put in place. That was 11 months ago, which was already very late in the day but at least it was something. Unfortunately, this has come to nothing and it seems clear that Fine Gael is not willing to concede any ground. It stands by the landlords.</p>
            <p eId="para_752"> The proposals from the Government that are being floated in the media are nothing short of pathetic. Rent regulation can work if it is properly and strictly implemented across the private rental market. It will do nothing if it is piecemeal and both Fine Gael and the Minister know that. One proposal was to put in place rent certainty on rent supplement tenancies, thereby limiting future increases available to landlords. This would only increase the number of landlords refusing rent supplement tenants and reinforce the two-tier housing system built by Fianna Fáil and continued - with gusto - by this Government. Another proposal was to increase the eviction notice period, which would do little or nothing for tenants who cannot afford their rent as that would be seen as a break in the tenancy agreement. It also fails to recognise that most tenants are not in their homes for such long periods due to the instability of the private market. A few weeks more for the few tenants with tenancies of five years or more who are being evicted does practically nothing. Requiring landlords to justify rent increases based on the market rate is another nonsensical idea and it is really just a rewording of the existing rules, which do nothing but which can be spun to sound like something.</p>
            <p eId="para_753"> The solution is not just rent certainty across the board to limit future increases but control measures to decrease rents right now. The Private Residential Tenancies Board should be empowered to set local standard rates with a maximum deviation based on the size of the accommodation. These standards could be imposed by existing tenants via a rent review request when one becomes available and new tenancies would be required to meet these standards immediately. Berlin has implemented a similar model with great success and there has already been a decrease of approximately 5% in rents in the city. Rents are too high now. If they were frozen, they would still be too high next year. This is the reality for all tenants in Ireland, especially those in our capital. It is up to the Government to solve this. It is not just about building homes next year. By then, many more families will be homeless, rents will have increased again and the cost of homelessness will have risen also.</p>

          <speech by="#AlanKelly" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_272">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Alan Kelly)<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T20:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_754">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The structure of the property market in Ireland has changed dramatically in the past decade. In 2002, 11.4% of households and families were accommodated in the private rented sector. Today, that figure is well above 20% and it continues to grow each day. Effectively, the number of Irish households renting privately has doubled in recent years. As a society, we must adjust to that. With more and more Irish people being housed in private rented accommodation, it is vital that rent remains affordable and that people renting have an appropriate amount of protection and security in their tenancy.</p>
            <p eId="para_755"> The most recent data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board for quarter 2 of 2015 show that on an annual basis nationally rents were 7.1% higher than in quarter 2 of 2014. These annual rates of increase were driven mainly but not exclusively by the Dublin market. Overall, in the 12 months to the end of quarter 2 of 2015, rents were higher by 9.2% in Dublin and similarly large increases have been experienced in Cork, Galway and other urban centres. A combination of the shortage of supply in appropriate areas, continued population growth and increased levels of employment and earnings is driving this increase in rents across the State. The shortage of supply is being addressed through the Construction 2020 strategy for the building industry, which is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector's ability to scale up the supply of residential units are addressed. This is particularly necessary in the Dublin region, where both population and employment continue to grow strongly. This is placing further upward pressure on rents.</p>
            <p eId="para_756"> Another important element in bringing more supply on stream is the €3.8 billion in Exchequer funding to 2020 that I secured to fund the social housing strategy. This will provide 35,000 new residential units and support 75,000 households in finding accommodation through schemes such as the housing assistance payment, HAP. The implementation of this strategy is progressing well and my Department is liaising closely with local authorities to ensure that new social housing units are delivered as swiftly as possible. I have also provided funding to local authorities to take on an additional 300 staff to speed up the delivery of social housing and construction in general as they had been moved out of this space by previous Administrations.</p>
            <p eId="para_757"> The problems in the property market and, in particular, the ongoing situation concerning the numbers of families in emergency accommodation is deeply concerning to me and to the Government. I increased the funding allocation for homelessness services to €70 million in 2016, an rise of €17 million from this year. I also recently ordered an increase in the homeless HAP pilot in Dublin. These changes mean that families who find themselves homeless will now be able to access private rented accommodation to a value of 50% above the regular rent supplement limits in Dublin, helping many families in emergency accommodation to find suitable housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_758">While these measures are all important in dealing with the current problems in the housing sector, the continuing increase in rent levels is of deep concern to me and poses a serious challenge. Working closely with my Government colleagues, I am exploring options which will give more security to tenants and families in the private rental sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_759"> Ultimately, the solution to the issue of the rapid rise in rents, and to the problems in the housing sector generally, will require a whole-of-Government response. While some of the levers for dealing with this problem lie outside my Department, the Government remains determined to tackle this problem in a forthright manner. Discussions on measures which will give more security and certainty to tenants are ongoing, and I believe they will conclude shortly.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T20:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_760">I thank the Minister but it is very disappointing that he is still saying the discussions are ongoing. He has not indicated what he has in mind to tackle this out of control rental market. Many people on rent supplement end up homeless as a result of landlords putting up rents because they can get more money on the private market. We have to stem that flow and control the increases in some way, maybe through the consumer price index because not only are 5,000 people on the waiting list for homes but 80 new families a month are joining it. Many of them have come off rent supplement and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, as a result of these increases. The solution is to build more social housing but Fianna Fáil in government started this ball rolling, relying on the private rental market. I am glad we are trying to get back to building more social housing because that will keep the rents down. However, we need emergency measures now to deal with this. The Minister does not seem to be making progress with his Fine Gael colleagues. It is very worrying that they have a vested interest in protecting a particular group.</p>
            <p eId="para_761"> There is also a major crisis in student accommodation because the rent has gone beyond the reach of many students. I recently spoke to a person who had a good job but could not afford private rents because they are so high. Even in other countries they have not reached these levels. There are 130,000 families on the housing waiting list, nearly double the number there was in 2008. It is scandalous.</p>

            <p eId="para_762">I thank the Deputy for raising this critically important issue. There is no issue I take more seriously or spend more time on. Homelessness and housing services take up the bulk of my time as I try to ensure that people have a home and a decent living standard. It is very personal to me. This Government will do everything it can to help people. We have been caught in the perfect storm of the property crash. The industrial sector is dysfunctional. There have been years of privatisation of social housing and I agree with the Deputy on that. Local authorities also needed to be brought up to speed.</p>
            <p eId="para_763"> The biggest issue is the growing economy, according to figures today. It has created this pressure. There are also problems in the private rental sector because of a small percentage of unscrupulous landlords. There are real estate investment trusts, REITs, buying up property and announcing they will have annual returns, which are not sustainable and in some cases are morally unacceptable. We need to ensure that tenants are protected and that their rights are promoted, that they have security and certainty. I am working with my colleagues to ensure that is put in place and that we will have measures in the near future to ensure they are protected.</p>
            <p eId="para_764"> I compliment the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, Cathal Morgan and all his team. The Deputy will agree they do a fantastic job. I meet and speak to Cathal regularly. He also agrees with me that dealing with the rental sector is paramount and the most important issue facing us, given the issues he deals with day in, day out, in Dublin. Other people working in the sector have made similar comments. </p>

          <p eId="para_788">I find it extraordinary that we are having this debate about whether the ethnicity of Travellers should be recognised. I cannot imagine us having this debate about any other minority in the country. I cannot figure out why we have to have this debate. It probably goes back to the foundation of the State. It is ironic that as we approach 2016 the State always seems to have had a problem with diversity.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">To be Irish was to be white, settled and a Catholic who conformed to the norms in which the majority of society believed and people did not digress from that path. Perhaps one could pinpoint partition as a catalyst for the scenario in which the country was split along religious, if not political and ethnic, lines. Following partition, everyone south of the Border was to conform to a certain expectation and problems arose when some did not conform. That is exemplified in the State's refusal to recognise Traveller ethnicity and effectively to see them as a problem for the State. This is a situation that simply cannot be allowed to continue. </p>
          <p eId="para_790"> A report by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality found that all the identifiable, potential excuses or concerns that could be deployed by the State which continued the denial of Traveller ethnicity should be rejected. There have been many of these during the years under successive Governments. The rejection of Traveller ethnicity has been accepted in the Six Counties and an overwhelming body of research supports Traveller ethnicity, yet the Government amendment, although it is a counter-motion, rather than an amendment, states, "the question of formal recognition of Travellers as a group in Irish society with a unique culture, heritage and ethnic identity is being considered". My God, how pathetic is that? After all the years, all the research and all the information we have, the Government states "it is being considered". Do we need another 50 years of worsening conditions for the Traveller community for a Government here to make its mind up? </p>
          <p eId="para_791"> What we are doing is not just about rights for a minority. What we are doing is providing leadership, while the Government, in its so-called amendment, its counter-motion, is pulling back that leadership. To state it needs more consideration is cowardly. It is not leadership but an act of cowardice. Granting ethnic rights to Travellers would lead to major improvements in the lives of members of the Traveller community. I always say good legislation is legislation that makes it easier for people to do the right thing and makes it damn hard for them to do the wrong thing. It is legislation which has respect from every citizen of the State. Travellers do not enjoy respect and there is no other group in society to whom the Government or the people would say, "Until 100% of you are behaving 100% of the time we will not show respect to any of you." That is what the Government amendment is all about. We are pandering to prejudice. We are not dealing with the problems but pandering to prejudice, which is why the Government is seeking more time. Is there leadership? It is leading us back to where we were 100 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> The local authorities in their role in housing Travellers have been disgraceful. I was not aware until the recent tragic incident in which a family was virtually wiped out that local authorities had sent back money that had been granted to them by the Government to house Travellers. That is disgraceful and no Government should have tolerated it. All the local authorities are doing is reflecting the inertia of the Government. They are putting it off for another day, another year, another decade or another century, to deal with it then but not now because it might damage them politically.</p>

          <p eId="para_794">During 2013 the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality held a number of hearings on the issue of the State recognising the ethnicity of the Traveller community. In compelling testimony to the committee, Brigid Quilligan, director of the Irish Traveller Movement, stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_795">Through generations, where we were once a strong, proud people – and for some part still are - we have been devalued within society. Never before in my lifetime have I seen such hate as I have seen in the past five years. If one opens a newspaper or turns on the television, if one is in a shop or on a train, if one looks at Facebook, Twitter, <i>thejournal.ie</i> or anything at all, anti-Traveller sentiment is fired at one. As Travellers, we experience this in our daily lives and we try to set about changing that by making people aware of us and by working in partnership with people.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">The devastating tragedy at Carrickmines and the response of a significant minority of the people can only have reinforced the deep concern of Brigid and all of the 40,000 men, women and children that make up the Traveller community across the island. The ugly racism of some towards the Traveller community reached a new low after the tragedy at Carrickmines. The fact that hundreds of citizens gave a thumbs-down to expressions of sympathy to victims on the website <i>thejournal.ie</i> is deeply disturbing. Their hatred blackens their heart so much that even to the burning to death of ten human beings - ten Irish citizens, five of them children, one of them a pregnant mother - there is an empty shrug of the shoulders. </p>
          <p eId="para_797"> How did we get to this point? The first major policy report in the State on Travellers was that of the commission on itinerancy in 1963. The commission was established in June 1960 and the publication of its report three years later established policy on Travellers for the following 20 years. It is one of the most shameful reports in the history of the State. If Members want any evidence of its agenda or views, the four terms of reference for the commission are all that they need to look at. They were: (1) to inquire into the problem arising from the presence in the country of itinerants in considerable numbers; (2) to examine the economic, educational, health and social problems inherent in their way of life; (3) to consider what steps might be taken to provide opportunities for a better way of life for itinerants and to promote their absorption into the general community and, pending such absorption, to reduce to a minimum the disadvantage to themselves and the community resulting from their itinerant habits; and (4) to make recommendations. They were dripping in racism and elitism and everything abhorrent to the 1916 Proclamation. It is ignorant, it is stupid, it is ill-informed, yet it forms the basis for the hatred we see today.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">I say it again that human beings, citizens of this State, went online and gave a thumbs-down to the expression of sympathy to ten human beings who were burned to death in the most appalling circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> The language used in the terms of reference of that report was instructive as to the State’s ideological approach to the Traveller community at that time. It is also instructive that no representatives of the Traveller community sat on the commission. In its report, the commission asserted: </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_800">Itinerants (or Travellers as they prefer themselves to be called) do not constitute a single homogenous group, tribe or community within the nation although the settled population are inclined to regard them as such. Neither do they constitute a separate ethnic group.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">It reached this conclusion without any apparent explanation or evidence provided. In its 2013, 50th anniversary review of the Commission on Itinerancy report, the Irish Travellers Movement pointed out that in chapter 6 of the report, the commission states: "as it was not essential to the consideration of the Commission’s terms of reference, no special study was made of the origins of the itinerant population of this country." The commission stated that it was aware that “a period of long research” would be needed to answer this question and stated that this was a job for “trained historians”.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> Despite these acknowledgements, the commission resolutely rejected the ethnicity of Travellers. There was no historical, sociological or anthropological basis; it was just prejudice and racism. That was our society. That is what set the scene for the following decades. That is the virus that infects too many of our citizens in this State when the look at the Traveller community.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> The approach and recommendations found in the 1963 report of the Commission on Itinerancy remain deeply offensive to Travellers and are largely rejected by modern-day Ireland but the insistence by the State on not recognising the ethnicity of Travellers remains. Following our hearings the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality recommended the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_804">Step 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_805">That either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice and Equality make a statement to Dáil Éireann confirming that this State recognises the ethnicity of the Travelling community.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_806">Step 2:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_807">That the Government then writes to the relevant international bodies, confirming that this State recognises the ethnicity of the Travelling community.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_808">Step 3:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_809">That the Government build on these initiatives and commence a time-limited dialogue with the Traveller representative groups about the new legislation or amendments to existing legislation now required.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">Tonight's motion calls on the Taoiseach and the Government to implement these recommendations immediately. I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, has been a genuine friend to the Traveller community and a supporter. He was in attendance when we launched the report. I know he is advocating, but it needs to be delivered. I suppose I am not speaking so much to him but to his Government colleagues, to members of the Cabinet and senior departmental officials to do the right thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> I want to outline why our committee made its recommendations. I want to put on record the relevant sections of the report:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_812">This State has maintained a position for decades that amounts to ethnicity denial without having presented any evidence-based defence of this position to our international partners and indeed the Travelling community.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">As part of our committee's deliberations, we examined a number of the excuses or concerns that are there to block this as we could interpret it. They are that it is not in the best interests of Travellers; that granting Traveller ethnicity would be too costly to the State; Traveller ethnicity is not proven; academic reasons; and the need for full consensus amongst Travellers.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> We examined every one of them and dealt with them through the hearings we held and the visits to the Traveller community in different locations throughout Dublin. We found no legitimacy to any of the concerns. There was a 100% clear case for the recognition of ethnicity. In particular I acknowledge the input of Mr. Laurence Bond of the Equality Authority as it was then. He wrote a comprehensive report entitled Traveller Ethnicity back in the day. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has also written in clear terms about these matters. I leaned heavily on its findings and on the findings of members of the Traveller community who have done superb work. There is an absolutely cast-iron case that there is no justification for delaying this anymore.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> In response to the first issue, that "It is not in the best interest of Travellers", we found that the representatives of the Traveller community are best placed to know what is in their best interests and the support for the recognition of Traveller ethnicity from all four national Traveller organisations and the 99% support of Travellers in attendance at the 2012 conference organised by the National Traveller Monitoring Advisory Committee surely reflects their judgment on the question. Only one Traveller present that day expressed any concern about this matter, which is comprehensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> In response to the issue that "Granting Traveller ethnicity would be too costly to the State", the committee pointed out that cost should not be a barrier to the State doing what is right by all its citizens or act as a barrier to justice or equality. However, the committee accepted the analysis of Laurence Bond from the then Equality Authority who advised he could not see any significant additional cost to doing this but that there would be an immense impact of recognising the distinct culture, the contribution of Travellers, their language, their music, of teaching their history to children in schools, of going into community centres with the Traveller community to explain what Traveller culture is and what has its contribution been and why it needs to be cherished and sustained, why we need to have Traveller-specific accommodation, halting sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> It is because we are enriched as a people if we embrace all the diversity of the fabric that makes up our nation. We are only enriched by embracing that, cherishing that and reaching out to some of our most vulnerable citizens and saying, "You are loved and valued by this Republic", and then dealing with the issues that exist with any aspect of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> In response to the issue that "Traveller ethnicity is not proven", we looked at this issue in terms of the ground-breaking legal cases in Britain and the fact that in the North of Ireland the ethnicity of Travellers is recognised. The only place on these islands that does not recognise the ethnicity, the distinct culture and contribution of our Travellers, is this State. We need to throw that report from the Commission on Itinerancy into the fire or the bin. We need to bury the ghost of that report and start to heal the wounds that have been there in the decades that followed its publication. We have comprehensive evidence of the legal basis in Britain and the North of Ireland for the recognition of ethnicity.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> In response to the issue of "Academic reasons", the committee leaned heavily on the report by Mr. Laurence Bond. I cannot mention him and the Equality Authority enough. It was a superb analysis of the sociological and anthropological case. It was an immense contribution to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> In response to the issue of "The need for full consensus amongst Travellers", nowhere in the world is it necessary to find 100% consensus. It is up to a person to self-identify his or her race. In every way it was comprehensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">I conclude with the words of Brigid Quilligan. She said:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_822">We are not speaking about major changes; we are speaking about people who have been on the island of Ireland for as long as anybody can record and recognition for the valuable contribution we have made to Irish society. We are talking about having our own history recorded, rather than a history that has been written for us, imposed upon us and dictated to us. We are talking about setting the record straight and supporting our people to stand tall and feel they are a valuable part of Irish society.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">I know the Minister of State is on the right side of history. We just need to get his Cabinet colleagues over the line. We then need to deal with all the other issues my colleagues will mention, including the resourcing of Traveller accommodation; the need for one national body to oversee Traveller-specific accommodation because local authorities have failed.</p>

          <p eId="para_824">I welcome tonight's debate, in particular the focus, attention and the contribution by Deputy Mac Lochlainn, who has been to the forefront in advocating on behalf of Travellers long before he got elected to this Chamber. Despite the fact that it might not be very popular in some areas he has never shirked his responsibility to confront the racist views that are held by a minority.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> I extend my sympathy to the Connors, Gilbert and Lynch families who lost loved ones in the Carrickmines tragedy, and to the wider Traveller community. We should be honest and say that a Bill supporting Travellers' rights is not going to be universally popular. There is a deep, ingrained ignorance throughout every class of society when it comes to Travellers and their rights. That bigotry must be faced head on. It must not be mollycoddled, excused, tolerated or even encouraged. It is a fact that some politicians have stooped to the lowest level in scapegoating or attacking the Traveller community. It should be a statement of intent that we would say that we will not tolerate that type of behaviour within our own ranks. We had a terrible situation in my constituency where a house that was being purchased by the local authority for a Traveller family was burnt down. A senior politician in the county said Travellers should live in isolation from the rest of the settled community. A Fine Gael councillor weighed in to support him and said that as far as he was concerned they should all be sent to Spike Island. When Deputy Dara Calleary was asked on the "Tonight with Vincent Browne" show to condemn the comments made by Seán McEniff, he refused to do so. Instead, he excused them and said it was a personal opinion. We should send a clear message that that is not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> On reading Deputy Mac Lochlainn's motion I hoped that all sides could support it and send out a positive message on behalf of the people to the Traveller community. Instead, the Government has proposed a counter-motion which strips the motion of the positive message. Instead, we have a reiteration of the kicking the can down the road attitude on which the State always relies when Travellers' rights come up. There is nothing new in the counter-motion. There is no sign of a new commitment to equality for our fellow citizens from Labour or Fine Gael. We must compare that to the positive suggestions in the Sinn Féin motion which, in terms of Traveller accommodation, calls on the Government to amend the Twenty-six Counties' Planning and Development Act to make the Traveller accommodation programme a mandatory consideration for planning permission. It proposes that funding for local authorities should be based on how good their track record is in providing Traveller accommodation. It proposes that the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee should be empowered to take charge of providing Traveller accommodation with an annual budget and targets. Those are practical suggestions which have the potential to prevent another tragedy. They are suggestions designed to ensure that Traveller programmes work for Travellers.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> The Traveller community is an all-Ireland one and that should be reflected in policy making. That is the reason the motion calls for an all-Ireland forum involving Travellers and the settled community, including representatives of political parties, central government, local authorities, health and education sectors and representatives of media organisations. This forum should review the way Travellers are treated in society and by the State. The forum should be empowered to put forward policies that make the State live up to its obligations under international law and international conventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> The significant cuts to Traveller programmes must be addressed. They speak for themselves. A total of €30.7 million has been cut in funding for Traveller programmes since 2010. Since 2000 the accommodation budget reduced from €70 million to €4.3 million this year. The question must be asked whether Travellers created the economic collapse or if they are just easy victims, the soft touch, in the eyes of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> I note the recent media commentary on a number of local authorities that did not even apply to draw down funding for Traveller accommodation programmes. I wish to put on record that Donegal County Council did not receive any allocation from the Department but it did apply for funding. It applied for €240,000 in February of this year for four or five programmes but to date has not received any funding yet issues exist that require to be addressed. Traveller communities talk about the need to prevent other tragedies. For example, emergency sites are in place for eight to nine years and other related issues must be resolved. I urge the Government to ensure funding is made available to Donegal County Council in order that it can continue to deal with the issues that present in Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> Sinn Féin's manifesto, policies and principles will always put Traveller rights front and centre, regardless of whether it is popular to do so. We will do it because it is the right thing to do. We will challenge every party to commit to doing that, and to end the tolerance for party representatives who take up anti-Traveller positions for the sake of votes. That is a message we should all send out tonight. The next person to take what he or she perceives to be a popular position in his or her community and attacks or stigmatises the Traveller community has no place in the political party system.</p>

Tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuilimid ag plé an rúin seo, go háirithe toisc a tharla go tragóideach i gCarraig Mhaighin an mhí seo caite. Déanaim comhbhrón arís leis na clanna a chaill daoine sa tine agus leis na daoine a chaill cairde. Ní cóir go dtógfadh sé a leithéid de thragóid chun a léiriú gur chóir dúinne díriú isteach ar an gceist seo. Tá roinnt daoine tar éis díriú isteach uirthi thar na blianta. An fhadhb is mó ná nach bhfuil an córas ina iomlán tar éis díriú isteach uirthi. Chun díriú air sin, tógfaidh mé roinnt samplaí as mo cheantar féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> It is a pity that it takes a tragedy such as the awful one in Carrickmines to focus our minds. It shows how small a focus we have had on a major issue that has been growing in terms of its awfulness in many ways in recent times. I will give an example of a Traveller site in my area. When I was walking in today, by chance I stopped at a bookshop, which is one of my pleasures, and I saw a photographic book on Travellers. I presume the photographs are from the 1960s but I have not had time to read it. Many of the photographs are from my area and show Labre Park and Cherry Orchard. It reminded me of many things. Members of the Furey family are in it and others people know also. The scandalous circumstances in which people lived in Labre Park and Cherry Orchard 40 years ago are the same today, bar a few bits of wall erected in the meantime. I know Labre Park very well. I have worked with the Ballyfermot Traveller Action Group and many others to encourage Dublin City Council to live up to its commitment. We are now on the fourth regeneration programme for Labre Park, yet not one brick has been laid. There has been no movement in any shape or form.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> The situation has nothing to do with austerity or the crisis, as it predates it. Families are living in absolute squalor in this city but that is fine because they live outside of the norm. They live on the edge of an industrial estate. That is the problem with the vast majority of the sites which have been chosen over the years for Traveller accommodation. They are marginalised and on the edge - out of sight and out of mind. It is high time the situation ended and that we embraced fully our responsibility as legislators and focused on the responsibility of local authorities to deliver. That is the key message we should take from the debate. It is a pity the Sinn Féin motion is not being accepted but we will not leave it at that. We will continue to press to ensure that not only is Traveller housing addressed but also educational and other issues. I know the major effects of the cuts to the Traveller education programmes in Ballyfermot. The situation has served to discourage many Traveller children from travelling to school, staying in school or to continue, as some have done, to university. I congratulate those who have succeeded and received awards from universities despite all the adversity.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">For anyone who wishes to ascertain the full effects, only today I read the Travelling with Austerity report commissioned by Pavee Point and the scale of cuts facing every aspect of Traveller society is a disgrace. This Government and its predecessor have much to answer for.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T21:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_835">The tragic loss of life in the Carrickmines fire has brought a renewed focus on the issue of Travellers' rights. This indigenous minority has been part of Irish society for countless centuries but for far too long has been marginalised and has suffered the worst forms of discrimination that cannot and should not be tolerated in any modern society. While examples of discrimination and marginalisation are plentiful, one of the most telling examples of how Travellers suffer disproportionately is demonstrated in the widespread health problems and appalling premature death rates recorded among their number. Life expectancy has grown across Ireland in recent years but serious health inequalities still exist. The All Ireland Traveller Health Study published in 2010 makes for grim reading. The extent of the inequalities that exist between the settled and Traveller people are utterly damning and this study, among other things, found that Traveller men and Traveller women have four times and three times, respectively, the mortality rate of the general population. In other words, life expectancy for male and female Travellers was found to be 15 and 11 years lower, respectively, than for the general population. The infant mortality rate for Traveller children is 3.5 times the rate of the general population. More than 52% of Travellers aged between 40 and 60 years who were interviewed had been diagnosed with high blood pressure in the previous year, compared with 35% of the general population and more than 42% of Travellers were diagnosed with high cholesterol in the previous year compared with 30% of the general population. Social determinants such as accommodation, education, employment, poverty, discrimination, lifestyle and access to and utilisation of services were the main causes of the gaps in levels of morbidity and mortality between Travellers and wider Irish society. One should make no mistake but the issues of mental health and suicide are tearing the heart out of Traveller communities. Suicide among Travellers is six times the rate of the general population and accounts for approximately 11% of all Traveller deaths. The suicide rate for Traveller women is six times higher than that for settled women and the rate for Traveller men is seven times higher. While shame and stigma regarding mental health is, sadly, still rampant across society as a whole, it appears that within Traveller communities, it is even worse. In addition, those affected and who seek help are left completely frustrated as service providers often do not understand Traveller culture. Culturally appropriate counselling services across Ireland are needed urgently to stem this tide of suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> All these issues must be addressed. Pavee Point has advocated for policies and practices to be underpinned by an intercultural approach and by principles of equality, diversity and anti-racism. This absolutely is what is needed. The Traveller community should be front and centre in the development of health services and practices designed and geared to its service. While I acknowledge and welcome the establishment of new structures under Healthy Ireland to address the health needs of all groups experiencing health inequalities, including Travellers, I believe the only way this issue can really be tackled is by the Government recognising Travellers as a distinct ethnic group and I seek the establishment of an all-Ireland forum including Travellers, political parties, local and central government, as well as representatives of the health and education sectors and the media to review how Travellers are treated in Irish society and to bring forward policies to ensure the State truly values and protects Traveller communities. </p>
          <p eId="para_837"> In conclusion, it is sad and most regrettable that Members are to divide on this issue in the Chamber tomorrow evening. That will not be a good day for Irish politics or Irish society in general and certainly not for the Traveller community. Consequently, I make this final appeal to Deputies from all parties and none to give their support to this motion. It is not too late to withdraw the amendment and surely, in the aftermath of this most recent dreadful tragedy at Carrickmines, Members can speak with one voice on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_839">Yes. </p>
          <p eId="para_840"> I do not know whether this will surprise the Minister of State but for the past number of elections, a leaflet has gone around an estate in my constituency stating that Seán Crowe voted in favour of Traveller accommodation. It pops up at every election despite there never having been any problems from the Travellers in that accommodation. Nevertheless, this unsigned letter gets sent out. It originally was supposed to have come from a residents' association but it gives an idea of what goes on in some local authority areas and some electoral areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> I hope this Private Members' debate will create some dynamic and positive action to improve the rights and social indicators of Travellers. As Deputy Ó Caoláin outlined, a report from the Economic and Social Research Institute shows that Travellers fare poorly on every indicator used to measure disadvantage, including unemployment, poverty, social inclusion or exclusion, health status, infant mortality, life expectancy, accommodation and living standards. Members are aware the Traveller community experienced savage cuts in recent years but was also affected by knock-on social spending cuts. When I was the Sinn Féin spokesperson for education, I raised with the Minister at the time, Deputy Quinn, the negative effect the withdrawal of 800 resource teachers for Travellers would have, as well as the loss of the visiting teacher service for Travellers. These cuts basically tore apart the Traveller education supports, which were replaced with absolutely nothing. There was no uproar, no editorials in the respectable newspapers and the issue disappeared. Traveller support was cut and no one kicked up a fuss.</p>

          <p eId="para_842">As my time is brief, I will try to focus on the key points I wish to make. The Carrickmines disaster provides an opportunity to face up to this issue once and for all. The sight of ten people, two families, perishing in that fire to be followed by two extended families becoming homeless and not having anywhere to go means we really must look at ourselves as a society and wonder how we got here. Moreover, we must get out of that position. The situation in Carrickmines highlights the precarious nature of Traveller accommodation. While much of it is temporary in nature, there are simple things that can be done such as putting in place proper fire screens, having fire safety equipment on site and putting in place proper measures to make sure the men, women and children who are living on sites, be they transient or permanent sites, are safe. Safety must be the issue for everyone and this includes Travellers.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> On the all-Ireland forum that Sinn Féin proposes, one thing I have learned in my adult life is that sometimes, when one does not know people, one can have huge suspicions about them and so on. However, I make this point to both the Traveller and the settled communities, when people come together and get to know one another and to understand one another, it helps to break down those barriers. If one good thing comes from the Carrickmines tragedy, I hope we can do that. It is a pity the Government intends to reject Sinn Féin's motion. The all-Ireland forum is the key and the beginning to trying to resolve this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">It would be great if we could get that up and running despite the Government's rejection of this motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_846">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_847">To delete all words after “Dáil Éireann” and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_848">"extends its sincere condolences and sympathy to the Lynch, Gilbert and Connors families on the tragic loss of their loves ones in the Carrickmines fire and offers solidarity and support to the wider Traveller community;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_849">agrees that in the aftermath of the Carrickmines tragedy there is an urgent need for a far-reaching and fundamental reappraisal of the position of Travellers in Irish society and that this will require a significant shift in individual and community attitudes to inculcate mutual respect and understanding as between Travellers and the settled community;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_850">recognises that:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_851">— Travellers experience poorer outcomes in key social indicators including employment, poverty, health, infant mortality, life expectancy, literacy, education and accommodation and face enduring discrimination; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_852">— a further effort by Government Departments, agencies and Traveller organisations at national and local level working in partnership is required to address the root cause of these problems and to bring about greater mutual understanding and respect as between Travellers and the settled community;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_853">recalls the recommendations of the April 2014 Report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the Recognition of Traveller Ethnicity;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_854">notes that accommodation for Travellers is provided through a range of measures and that it is open to Travellers to opt for any form of accommodation, including:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_855">— standard local authority housing, financed from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government capital allocations for social housing;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_856">— Traveller-specific accommodation, also financed by the Department;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_857">— private housing assisted by the State, including local authorities, or voluntary organisations; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_858">— through Travellers’ own resources;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_859">recognises that, while there has been a general decrease in Traveller-specific accommodation funding, some €400 million has been invested in the provision and support of Traveller-specific accommodation over the last 15 years. The 2015 allocation totalled €4.3 million and an increase in the budget for 2016 has been agreed to €5.5 million;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_860">recognises and supports the continuing valuable work of the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, NTACC, including the advice and supports it provides to the Local Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committees, LTACCs;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_861">notes the continued delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation through the provision of funding to local authorities through the Traveller Accommodation Programme, supported at national level by the NTACC. The implementation of the Traveller Accommodation Programme of each local authority, including the drawdown of funds, is in accordance with the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, a matter of each individual authority;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_862">recognises that local authorities are already mandatorily required under section 10 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, to incorporate zoning objectives to provide for Traveller-specific accommodation in their development plans;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_863">notes:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_864">— that additional resources provided in the educational system for all children, including members of the Traveller community, are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need; that a key objective of the Traveller Education Strategy is the phasing out of segregated Traveller provision; and that additional resources have been provided to assist with the transfer of Traveller children and young people to mainstream provision, including additional pupil capitation, together with additional resource teacher posts to support the approximately 11,000 Traveller pupils in primary and post-primary education; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_865">— the substantial investment made in building the capacity of the Traveller community, through the Local and Community Development Programme, LCDP, with funding of €1.17 million for the National Traveller Partnership in 2015; </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_866">notes and welcomes that funding of approximately €1.35 million will transfer from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to the Department of Justice and Equality as from 1 January 2016 as part of a new National Strategic Framework being put in place by the latter Department to support the work of the local Traveller Interagency Groups, TIGs, Traveller community development projects and national organisations and to ensure that Traveller interests are strongly represented in local economic and community planning by local authorities;</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_869">— that the new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy is due to be completed and published in the first quarter of 2016 and welcomes the Government’s commitment that it will contain clear commitments and timeframes to address the accommodation, health, education and other issues the Traveller community faces; and further notes that:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_870">— the role of the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy Steering Group, which monitors delivery of the strategy, has been strengthened, including in relation to commissioning of independent evaluations of implementation; </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_871">— the question of whether revised institutional arrangements for delivery of services to Travellers are necessary to bring about greater coherence in and improve the effectiveness of statutory services for the Traveller community has been raised during the ongoing consultation process and will be considered in the drafting of the new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_872">— the question of formal recognition of Travellers as a group in Irish society with a unique culture, heritage and ethnic identity is being considered in the context of the development of the new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy."</p>
          <p eId="para_873">I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn and Sinn Féin for tabling this motion. I join with Deputies in this House in expressing my condolences to the Connors, Gilbert and Lynch families who lost their lives in Carrickmines.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> I have been, and have continued to be since my election to this House, an advocate for Traveller ethnicity. I have worked with people on all sides of this House to make Traveller ethnicity a recognised reality. However, my efforts in this regard have been somewhat frustrated because, I am told, I must take account of public opinion. I do not accept the premise that we should deal in the terms of popular opinion when advocating the rights of a minority. Outside of a referendum, I do not believe we should deal in focus group equality or that we should rely on polls in regard to how we should proceed on issues of equality. The fact that advocating for the rights of a minority might be unpopular is surely the reason we should collectively strive to ensure that equality is realised. </p>
          <p eId="para_875"> As alluded to earlier, since the foundation of this State we have experimented with what may be termed "sameness". Sameness is a lie. Since the foundation of this State people with mental health challenges have been incarcerated. Approximately 200,000 people with mental health issues were incarcerated in the 1950s. Young mothers who were unmarried were told that they were wrong and had to be placed in laundries. People who had troubled backgrounds and behavioural difficulties were also told that they were wrong and had to be sent to industrial schools. As stated so eloquently tonight by Deputy Mac Lochlainn, in 1963 Travellers were told that they were wrong and that they had to become settled people. Sameness is a lie while diversity is the truth. Diversity is the only truth that existed in the past. It is the only truth that can exist now and it is the only truth that can exist in the future. Members of this House, regardless of our political differences, should stand by truth. The truth is that the Traveller community in this State is a distinct ethnic group. They are a people and a part of this nation and they deserve recognition in that regard. This move does not require legislation or a constitutional amendment. It is just as well it does not require a constitutional amendment. One can only imagine the type of debate we would have in this country if that question were put to the people, considering that in this country one can pretty much say in public discourse, polite conversation or print media anything one wants about the Traveller community and get away with it. </p>
          <p eId="para_876"> There is no more reviled a community in our history, from the settled perspective, than the Traveller community. Is it any wonder that they feel isolated and disconnected? All they are asking for at this point in time is a new platform of interaction with their common citizens in this republic. Michael McDonagh, who is a long term advocate for Traveller rights, has spoken about how young Travellers do not know what role they play or what space they should start from. Surely a positive acknowledgement from this State of what we all know to be true would be the best move we could make. We need to acknowledge the distinct - not separate - culture, heritage, language and tradition of our fellow citizens who are Travellers. From there we can move to a whole new conversation about where we go in the future. We cannot have a commemoration of 1916 next year unless we fully subscribe to the idea of this republic guaranteeing equal rights and equal opportunities for all citizens, such that there is no repeat of a situation about which I heard recently, namely, the opening of two books of condolences in public buildings in this country, one of which was signed while the other was rejected. The fact that this measure would not be popular, would not do so well in a poll or might be rejected by a focus group is the very reason we have to support it. Let us reject focus group equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> I am working hard to realise the day when a member of Government, with the support of everybody in this House, can recognise the truth of diversity, put to bed the lie of sameness and say to our Traveller community, which on one level will be an apology for the lives they have led and the discrimination they have had to endure, that from a settled perspective we, this State, this republic, recognises them as a people and wants to work with them to build a new relationship. When that day comes, it will be a proud day for the many people who have campaigned for it, including the Irish Traveller Movement, Pavee Point, the Irish Traveller Women's Forum and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, members of which, cross-party and unanimously, have acknowledged that this has to happen. I believe that will be a proud day for this republic. We could then, collectively, celebrate a new dispensation and a new road to travel together in what would be termed a real republic.</p>

        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_286" as="#Acting_Chairman">
          <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T21:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_878">I wish to express my sympathies to the families of those who died in Carrickmines. I hope that they get every support they need in the aftermath.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> I would like to focus specifically on the housing aspect of this motion. Deputy Pearse Doherty said earlier that local authorities have failed in the provision of Traveller accommodation. That is not true.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">There has been a failure on occasion and in some cases it has been on the part of some councillors or councils, but it is wrong not to acknowledge that much progress has been made. Considerable support for the provision of Traveller accommodation has been shown by councillors in many councils, sometimes in the face of local pressure. </p>
          <p eId="para_881"> The other side of the equation is that the issue can be complex. When I was first elected as a councillor to South Dublin County Council, one of my earliest decisions involved a project that included social housing and some group houses for Travellers. There was fierce pressure locally against the project, including, in particular, against the group houses for Travellers, but some of the opposition came from Travellers located next to where the group houses were to be situated. That element was eventually removed. To this day, that is the one decision in which I was involved in the council that I regret. Deputy Seán Crowe will vouch for this, but we have since supported the Traveller accommodation programme. We have supported all of the new Traveller sites proposed. If there was the slightest bit of pressure, councillors stood firm together and, in the main, did not break ranks. I remember one case in which a person who was a candidate and subsequently not elected as a councillor went on a solo run, but councillors stood firm and the provision of a temporary Traveller site went ahead. We did this in the face of local pressure. When one shows leadership to the local community and explains what one is doing, its members come on board. In the South Dublin County Council area, particularly where I live in the Balgaddy area of Lucan and north Clondalkin, there was an unbelievable number of unauthorised sites when I was first elected as a councillor. They are no longer there. Many new permanent Traveller accommodation projects have been developed. At the time, when the needs of Travellers were assessed, most of them wanted to be accommodated in council houses. That was the greatest demand. This is very much borne out by the Department's information. Many Travellers were accommodated in social houses and I represent many of them. I know them and meet them.</p>
          <p eId="para_882"> There is an error in a figure included in the motion and there was an error in a figure given by Deputy Pearse Doherty. He said the capital budget was €70 million in 2000. The Department has advised me that it was just over €15 million. These things matter. That is a huge discrepancy in the figure Sinn Féin has included in its motion. We are all in favour of maintaining local democracy and when it comes to an issue such as this, it is bad for local democracy when we propose to take away power from councillors. These decisions should be made locally and many councillors will step up to the plate. We are all involved in political parties and can make sure of this. We should not have a kneejerk reaction on this issue because of the terrible tragedy that happened at Carrickmines or because of some bad cases. We should stand up to those who hand out leaflets opposing the provision of Traveller accommodation and show them up for what they are. I have seen instances where such persons have suffered electorally because of the bad publicity generated in handing out such material. It is not as simple a matter as described.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> On Traveller education, people involved in the media have highlighted the fact that there have been cuts. The Traveller education strategy which was drawn up in consultation with Traveller development groups proposed to move Traveller education services to the mainstream; it was to be done on a case by case basis according to need. There is much support for Travellers within the education system. Recently I met a young Traveller woman who was in her third year in Trinity College Dublin studying occupational therapy. She attended an event for Travellers in north Dublin and wanted to tell other Travellers that there were supports in place. It is not all negative; there are many positives and she wanted to get that message out. The debate has been so skewed towards the negative and unbalanced that it undermines the cause of Travellers. It promotes the idea that there is no support for Travellers when, in fact, there is. Many support the provision of Traveller supports and accommodation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaraConway" eId="spk_287">
          <from>Deputy Ciara Conway<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T21:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_884">First, I extend my sympathy to the Lynch, Gilbert and extended Connors families who experienced such an unspeakable tragedy. I also think of the first responders who attended the site. What an appalling incident it was for anybody to have to experience. It is horrific to think the lives of ten citizens ended so quickly and in such a violent way. I cannot think of a worse way to die.</p>
          <p eId="para_885"> I have read some of the briefing information I have received from the Department. I could hear the frustration in the voice of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin. It will be noted that he did not read from a script because I am not sure the Department is completely on board with what he had to say. We are not only talking about polling companies but even within the Department is there a willingness in this respect? In the briefing note I received three steps are outlined that need to be taken to recognise the ethnicity of the Traveller community. The first is that the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice and Equality make a statement to the Dáil to recognise the ethnicity of the Traveller community; the second is that the Government write to the relevant international bodies, confirming that the State recognises the ethnicity of the Traveller community, and the third is that the Government build on these initiatives and commence a time-limited dialogue with the Traveller representative groups about the new legislation or amendments to existing legislation required. Essentially, we are waiting for someone to make a speech and someone else to write a letter, while people's lives hang in the balance. That is simply not good enough. If it involved any other group in society, we would not be waiting for someone to stand up and make a speech and for somebody else to write a letter. Ten people perished in an unspeakable and unthinkable way and in this forum we are still debating an issue that can be resolved - I am advised by the relevant Department - by somebody standing up, namely, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice and Equality, to make a statement recognising the ethnic minority that is the Traveller community which has a distinctive culture, language and heritage. </p>
          <p eId="para_886"> In my role as a social worker and a community worker before I was elected to the Dáil I worked side by side with members of the Traveller community who worked as health workers and were employed by the HSE in Clonmel, one of the first areas in the country where members of the Traveller community were employed as members of the public service. However, the Minister of State and I know that the only job a Traveller can find in Ireland is working for a Traveller's group. A Traveller cannot find work anywhere else. Is it any wonder, therefore, that members of the Traveller community feel segregated, isolated and have difficulty in engaging with systems? I agree also with my colleague, Deputy Joanna Tuffy, when she says help is available, but it is available if one is able to look for it. As a Government, we need to ensure such help is forthcoming when people need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> I was very lucky at the weekend to be in my local library in Dungarvan, County Waterford where there were beautiful displays of artwork by members of the County Waterford Travellers women's group celebrating Traveller pride. I am not sure if there was much public fanfare about the artwork or if the mayor launched the art display, bearing in mind that one often sees a person wearing a chain of office cutting a ribbon and launching other displays of art, but I stand to be corrected. I did not know the art displays were taking place in the library. I just happened to be there with my daughter on Saturday and was delighted to see the artwork displayed.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">It is a beautiful display and one with which I would encourage everyone to engage. Going back to my central point, in the wake of the most tragic and appalling deaths of ten citizens of this country, we are waiting for a speech, a letter and some amendments to be made. I do not believe the Traveller community should be made wait any longer.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_288">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T21:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_889">Like other speakers, I offer my condolences to the victims of the recent horrific tragedy in Carrickmines. No words of consolation can adequately address that particular issue or can convey to the victims and their families the full extent of the recognition of the impact on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_890"> All tragedies serve to remind us of something. In this particular case, as in many other tragedies we have experienced in this country, it serves to remind us that there are people among us who are either isolated or feel they are isolated for one reason or another. By virtue of that isolation, they may find themselves isolated in another sense in regard to education, health and housing. In this particular situation, it was clearly the housing element, which affects many people in this country at this time. Ironically and inevitably, the Traveller community is going to be most affected in the situation where there is a scarcity of housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> It is only some years ago that we were deemed to be one of the wealthiest countries in the world. In fact, there were those who suggested we were the wealthiest country in the world. I do not believe we were. We need to recognise that we have a social responsibility to ourselves and to the citizens to ensure we do our best, each of us individually and collectively, to spread whatever is required in terms of opportunity to those who do not have it.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> The sad part of the housing situation for the unfortunate victims in Carrickmines is that it was not first-class accommodation. There is much accommodation on offer which is not first-class and it affects Travellers and even the settled community. It is a point to which we should be alert because there may be more tragedies like this which will come back to haunt us, unless we do something about it. I go along with Deputy Joanna Tuffy in that I do not believe the local authorities failed completely. They have done a great deal but it has not always worked out. They have tried and have provided halting sites. In the cases in which I have had dealings, there have been very effective and well-run halting sites with good quality accommodation. There were no problems in those places.</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> Ironically, good quality housing, good medical attention and access to education lift that community. It gives it an insight into something better that it can do. It should not be forgotten that there are quite a number of people in the Traveller community who want to settle down, have access to good health services, to housing and to education. Eliminate education from that area, and one eliminates the possibility of allowing people to evolve and to take their place in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> Reference has been made already, and it goes without saying, that there is some prejudice in various places. There are situations where things did not go right. If we are to improve the situation, however, we must recognise the fundamentals required to address the issue to help those who are members of the Traveller community. I acknowledge the work of Pavee Point, Ronnie Fay and all those who have been involved in that work for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> We often hear in the House that the poor suffered during the downturn in the economy. I hope no one expected that the poor, or anybody else, were going to get richer during the downturn. That is not the way things work. Those who are hardest hit in terms of housing, access to education and access to health services are obviously the poor. That subculture, as seen in the minds of some people, and the Traveller community is the worst affected and hit to the greatest extent. It impacts severely on members of the Traveller Community and tends to lead them into thinking that they are not and never will be recognised. We have a duty to ourselves and to our society in terms of social justice and recognising the need to look after those who are not as well placed as the rest of the community. The community in which we all work generally recognises that they want to help out, that there is a need to do something of a helpful nature and that there is a need to be constructive. They do so on a regular basis. We all have members of the Traveller community who come along to our clinics and explain their cases to us. This is something from which we have all learned.</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> As to the question of whether local authorities have failed, some have. The extent to which help is being made available is highly questionable. There is a need now, as there has been for some time, to recognise the fundamentals required to address the subject. That subject is to try to ensure the opportunities are made available. If one comes down on one side in recognising that the Traveller community will remain forever Travellers, one eliminates then the possibility for those within the community who wish to change from that life over time. That happens with the education and the children. I see Deputy Gerry Adams smiling about that.</p>

          <p eId="para_898">Deputy Gerry Adams should not be astonished at all. He should not encourage me to go into that area because I could depart into another lecture but I will not.</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> There are people within the Traveller community who want to settle and we need to encourage that. We then need to address the other issue of those who want to travel and have that culture recognised as part and parcel of their society. I do not see any reason we should not do that. Whatever we do on accommodation, we need to recognise that there is no sense whatever in putting anyone into substandard accommodation or in putting anyone into a situation in which we would not live. It is a golden rule that we, as public representatives, should always take on board. Would we live in these conditions ourselves? Some will say there are those in the settled community in similar situations. There are but there should not be. Some of us have spoken about it in this House for many years. In the good times, when the resources were available that could have easily dealt with these situations, nobody bothered. People stood idly by, wrung their hands, tore their hair out, beat their breasts and talked and thought about it but did nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> The fact of the matter is that it still remains. That will be the same in five years’ and in ten years’ time, unless we as a society, as well as our society and community leaders, recognise we have a role to play. We can evolve and influence that evolution. If we do not, things will remain as they are. What part of our society, what part of the population, should we regard as being incapable of moving ahead and tasting the fruits and benefits of society as it progresses? If we were all to remain as we were in the 1940s and the 1950s, we would be a peculiar race of people now.</p>
          <p eId="para_901"> Unfortunately, the thinking in some quarters has not changed. Instead of it being a them-and-us situation, we have to get to the point where we all have a role to play. We need to play the role and not play off each other. We do not need to suggest that some of us have the answer and others are not aware of that. Often people say to me that I do not know what it really is like but I am not so sure about that. I have been dealing with this, as has everybody else in this House, for a very long time now. If I do not know what it is like out there at this stage, I should not be here.</p>

          <p eId="para_905">I commend my colleague, Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, for tabling this motion concerning Travellers. On my behalf and that of Fianna Fáil, I extend our sympathy to the Lynch, Gilbert and Connors families following the recent tragic losses at Carrickmines. I am sure the relatives of those who died and the community in Carrickmines are still suffering grievously in the wake of the enormous loss of life in the tragedy. Everyone in the country was shocked and numbed by this terrible event. They felt for the families, as did I.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> Fianna Fáil is committed to the rights of Travellers and believes the Traveller and settled communities must work together. We all live in the real world and have to recognise that both sides have rights and obligations. Like many other Deputies and public representatives, I represent Travellers week in, week out. I deal with them in my clinics, as does everyone else. There is a significant Traveller community in my constituency in County Limerick. We help them with everyday issues, as we do the settled community. These issues include those relating to social welfare, education and health. Both communities face the same issues and challenges and the same service and help is afforded them, which is an obligation on all public representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> In April 2014, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality called on the State to recognise Traveller ethnicity. I am a member of that committee and I subscribed to and support the report, as did the Acting Chairman, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy. The committee recommended that the Government should write to the relevant international bodies confirming that the State recognises the ethnicity of the Traveller community. It further recommended that the Government build on various initiatives and commence a time-limited dialogue with the Traveller representative groups about new legislation or amendments to existing legislation that was required. It was disappointing that the then chair of Fine Gael, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, disagreed with the recommendation that Travellers are Irish like the rest of us. That did not serve any constructive contribution to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_908"> The then Irish Human Rights Commission submitted that "Traveller ethnicity is essentially a legal reality that the State is bound by, irrespective of any formal act of recognition". The commission recommended that a statement be made by the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice and Equality, on the record of Dáil Éireann, recognising the Irish Traveller Community as an ethnic group within the State. I support that recommendation and call on the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality to comply with it. We should have a session in the Dáil to discuss the statement. The commission also stated, "At an international level the State could confirm to relevant international human rights bodies that it accepts that Travellers are an ethnic group under the relevant legal frameworks, and continue this practice through its State Reports as they arise." It further stated, "At a legal level clarification in the law, such as the equality legislation, that Travellers are an ethnic minority could be a useful precedent, and would remove any doubt as regards the legal protection the State affords to this vulnerable community." The commission went on to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_909">At a deeper level, it would be recommended that the State communicate its recognition to the Traveller community. Of course recognition must go beyond mere rhetoric, and the State's engagement with the Traveller community must be fully informed by its human rights obligations regarding that community as an ethnic minority in the State, in seeking to ensure the human rights of Travellers, which the State consistently asserts that it seeks to achieve. At a practical level ... this may require the State to consider carefully those aspects of law and policy that have a disproportionate negative impact on the Traveller community with a view to their removal. </p>
          <p eId="para_910">Fianna Fáil - as do I - supports the Irish Human Rights Commission's statements and the move towards formal recognition of Traveller ethnicity.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> We must remind ourselves of some of the groups and committees that sat over the past 20 years and the decisions and legislation which flowed from this House as a result. It would be useful to have a proper analysis of how legislation and various committee reports impacted, both positively and negatively, on the Traveller community. We have had lots of legislation and reports. Some of them were good and some were well-intended. Some, however, did not have a positive effect despite the intent. This needs to be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> The Equal Status Act 2000, of which we are all aware, was introduced to protect against discrimination outside the employment field. The Traveller health unit was established in 2004. Local authorities have often been mentioned during the debate. We had the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 and the Planning and Development Act 2000. The Part V obligation of the 2000 Act provided for a social dividend in terms of housing for local authorities, which includes housing for the Traveller community. Unfortunately, in many instances local authorities up and down the country took cash in lieu of provision of Part V housing units. We need to examine that situation and see what can be learned from the shortcomings in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> The tone of the debate has not been political, nor should it be, but during those years local authorities were controlled by various political parties. My party had the least level of control over them because it was in a minority on most authorities during those years. That situation changed in the local elections last year. Local authorities are to blame and all the political parties represented in this House which are also represented on local authorities have played a part in not implementing the county Traveller accommodation programmes. The parties in question also played a part in local authorities taking cash payments from developers in lieu of the provision of housing units to meet Part V obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_914"> There was a national Traveller consultative committee which ran parallel with the local Traveller accommodation consultative committees. We need to study the work of those committees to see what they came up with that was good and what they came up with that was not.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> The concept of social partnership has been ongoing in this country for some time. We have had various programmes over the years. The trade union movement has been involved in social partnership with different Governments. The programme for prosperity and fairness, which ran from 2000 to 2002, committed to monitoring and evaluating the efforts to meet Traveller accommodation. The next social partnership programme, sustaining progress, which ran from 2003 to 2005, underlined the need to pursue an equality agenda for all minority groups and Travellers. We need to do an impact analysis of all the social partnership programmes and how they either positively or negatively impacted on the Traveller community. </p>
          <p eId="para_916"> It is incumbent on us, as a society, to recognise the identity of the Traveller community and those who want to remain in it. There are challenges and obligations. All of us, as citizens of this country, have an obligation to live and abide by the law. Some of the narrative which is unfairly levelled at the door of the Traveller community is exceptionally unwarranted. People in the Traveller community have to abide by the law, as do the rest of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> Unfortunately, some of the narrative emerging from debates recently is exceptionally weighted against the Traveller community, without any evidence or facts to support the narrative being spun against members of that community. This is important for all public representatives throughout the country, including public representatives within my party, in all other parties and, indeed, of no party. People look to their public representatives for leadership and guidance, and we have an obligation and a role to fulfil in terms of harmonising both communities.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T22:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_918">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important motion on the blatant discrimination against Travellers in Irish society, and the urgent need to end all forms of racism and to build a more inclusive country which respects and supports the rights of Travellers. I commend Deputy Mac Lochlainn and Sinn Féin on bringing forward the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> The motion follows the aftermath of the horrific fire in Carrickmines in Dublin which caused the deaths of ten members of the Traveller community. Reactions following the fire highlighted the ongoing discriminatory attitudes throughout Irish society towards the Traveller community. The motion calls on the Government to lead a fundamental review of the treatment of Travellers in Irish society. That is the important aspect of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_920"> The other important issue is that we must rally around and support the Travellers' rights movement, particularly groups such as Pavee Point and the Irish Traveller Movement. All of us expressed sympathy following the Carrickmines fire tragedy. It was horrific and very sad for the families and for Travellers in general. However, there is no use having sympathy if we do not talk about introducing services or bring forward action on equality. One in ten Travellers die from suicide. There is a lack of funds for Traveller counselling services. Last year they got €14,000 from the HSE. The All Ireland Traveller Health Study, which cost approximately €1.5 million, was published in 2010, yet no action was taken. Traveller men die 15 years earlier than members of the settled community. Services are failing at local and national level.</p>
          <p eId="para_921"> The 40,000 Travellers in Ireland deserve respect and equality. Damn charity, they want justice and we should support them. There must be a complete re-think on the Travellers' rights issue. The Government must hear the voices of Travellers directly. We need Travellers in the Dáil and in the Seanad, because they will speak out for themselves and we can act as support groups for them. I met them today and I saw their hurt, anger and pain. Quite honestly, I was ashamed and embarrassed to see the hurt and pain in their eyes with regard to this issue and their demands. They require a national agency to deal with the accommodation issues. We must take it out of the hands of local politicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> We are now approaching the 1916 commemoration. If we wish to talk about equality and justice, we will support the Travellers' programmes on education and accommodation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2015-11-03T22:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_923">It was the death of Jonathan Corrie that brought the issue of housing and homelessness onto the Dáil agenda in a stark way. It is alarming and disturbing that it took another terrible tragedy at Carrickmines, for the Lynch, Gilbert and Connors families and for the wider Traveller community, to bring about a debate on Traveller issues in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_924"> We are aware of the statistics which show the inequalities experienced by members of the Traveller community in terms of life expectancy, illnesses, rates of suicide and infant mortality. We are also aware of the inequalities in education. In that regard, I ask Traveller parents to be more proactive and supportive of their children continuing in school beyond leaving certificate into third level education. In the secondary school where I taught, too often I saw very bright Traveller girls leaving school at the end of first year.</p>
          <p eId="para_925"> We have become complacent with regard to Travellers. Successive governments and Irish society have ignored the glaring inequalities that persist. What was common at the briefing today from the Travellers' rights activists was the total alienation they feel when they enter Leinster House. Leinster House has not respected their culture, history or ethnicity. Irish people are against racism and discrimination. We have a strong voice with regard to human rights. Ireland is a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council. We believe we have a social conscience, but too often that stops when it comes to Travellers. The academic research on Travellers over recent decades supports the case for recognition of their ethnicity, which is supported by the majority of Travellers. Accepting their ethnicity is simply respecting difference and diversity.</p>
          <p eId="para_926"> If what had happened in Carrickmines and its aftermath had occurred in another country, we would have been horrified. While there was great support and sympathy from Irish people, there was not the same sense of outrage and horror that we would express if it had occurred somewhere else. Yes, there is anti-social behaviour by a small minority in the Traveller community, but there is major anti-social behaviour by many people in the settled community. I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, and heard his views, aspirations and outrage. It is very disappointing that this debate will become divisive and that we will vote against each other tomorrow night.</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> We said we did not want another death like that of Jonathan Corrie, but there were other deaths of homeless people. For the future, we should revert to the seanfhocal, ní neart go cur le chéile.</p>
