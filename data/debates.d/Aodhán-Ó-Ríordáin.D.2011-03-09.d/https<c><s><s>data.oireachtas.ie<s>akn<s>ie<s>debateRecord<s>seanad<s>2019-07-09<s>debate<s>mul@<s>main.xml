          <p eId="para_1">I acknowledge the presence in the Public Gallery of Dr. Pat Gallagher, a former Member of both the Seanad and the Dáil, who is now chief executive of Westmeath County Council. In his personal capacity, Pat is involved in a sister cities partnership between his home town of Tullamore and the city of Chandler, Arizona. On behalf of the Seanad, I welcome the students who are involved in the student ambassador exchange programme. I would like to extend a particular welcome to the students from Chandler. I hope they enjoy their visit to Ireland and to Leinster House.</p>

          <p eId="para_2">The Order of Business is No. 1, motion regarding Animal Health Levies (Pigs) Regulations 2019, back from committee, to be taken on conclusion of the Order of Business without debate; No. 2, Judicial Council Bill 2017 <i>[Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil]</i> - Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 4.45 p.m.; No. 3, Courts (Establishment and Constitution)(Amendment) Bill 2019 - Second Stage, to be taken on conclusion of No. 2, with the contribution of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and all other Senators not to exceed five minutes and time can be shared; No. 4, Parole Bill 2016 - Second Stage, to be taken on conclusion of No. 3 with the contribution of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and all other Senators not to exceed five minutes, which time can be shared; No. 5, Local Government Rates and Other Matters Bill 2018 - Second Stage, to be taken on conclusion of No. 4, with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and all other Senators not to exceed five minutes, which time can be shared; and No. 6, statements on defence matters, to be taken on conclusion of No. 5, with the contributions of group spokespersons not to exceed eight minutes and all other Senators not to exceed four minutes, which time can be shared.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineArdagh" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Senator Catherine Ardagh<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T15:35:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_4">I also welcome our former colleague and friends in the Gallery and hope they have a lovely day. I refer Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill's decision in respect of the State's interpretation of the European Court of Human Rights judgment in the case brought by Louise O'Keeffe against the State. Mr. Justice O'Neill described the State's interpretation and approach as an "inherent inversion of logic" and as representing a "fundamental unfairness to applicants." The Government argued in interpreting the decision that it only applied to people who were abused after an initial complaint was made against a teacher and no action was taken. The decision, which was published yesterday, is very disturbing. I commend Louise O'Keeffe on her bravery and tenacity in fighting this case and highlighting this issue. I call for a debate in this House on Mr. Justice O'Neill's decision. We really need to consider how the State got to the point where it completely misinterpreted a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights. That decision and poor interpretation really affected survivors of abuse in this country. It is very concerning and very unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> I also wish to raise the dangerously high levels of nitrogen dioxide in the air in our city. It is particularly bad around the city centre and used to be really bad around where the Luas runs, just outside Trinity College. A high level of nitrogen dioxide causes serious health risks to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">It is understood to contribute to asthma, emphysema and carcinogenic outcomes in patients. This report came from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. That is a serious body and we need to start taking heed of what it is saying. We must see Government action to combat environmental pollutants like this, which are in the air just outside the door. We need to take this issue a little more seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> The third issue I raise is Central Bank levies. These levies are forcing many credit unions to increase their interest rates and ultimately to close. A new Central Bank levy on credit unions will have a devastating impact on lending institutions. It will force massive interest rate increases, the closure of credit unions and their ultimate amalgamation. The credit union movement is very much consumer led. Ultimately the credit union model should be nourished. Credit Unions provide a very good service to consumers. They issue small and short-term loans to people who are really in need of financial help. Levies like this undermine the good service they provide. We should ask why they are being applied to credit unions and if there is anything we can do to help them, as they provide a good service to consumers throughout the country. </p>

        <speech by="#VictorBoyhan" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Senator Victor Boyhan<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_8">I wish to sympathise on the passing of Councillor John Bailey, a Fine Gael colleague of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, who passed away after an illness lasting some time. It is important that we pay tribute to such people. I knew Mr. Bailey for a long time. I first met him on the greatest day for him and his daughter, Maria Bailey, who is a Deputy and a Member of the Oireachtas, when they were elected together in June 2014. It is unusual for a father and daughter to be elected together. I particularly want to extend my sympathy, as I know others will, to Mr. Bailey's wife, Angela and all his children. He passed away very early this morning. It is a particularly difficult time for his daughter, Deputy Maria Bailey, and the staff in her office, where Mr. Bailey also worked as a political assistant and adviser.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> Many Members will have known John Bailey. It is not for me to talk about him today. He was elected to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in 2014. Anyone who knew him will know he was immensely involved in the GAA and local politics. His political and sporting activities were his life and they very much defined who he was as a man. He was highly competitive and liked to take on a challenge. There will be other times and places to talk about him. Each and every one of us will have had our own experience of him, and each and every one of us will have our own stories about him. I wish to offer my condolences to his family, the staff in Deputy Maria Bailey's office and the Fine Gael Party as a whole. May he rest in peace. </p>

        <speech by="#NiallODonnghaile" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_11">I too extend sympathies on behalf of the Sinn Féin group to Deputy Bailey and all of her family.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> I rise in the midst of ongoing controversy and preparations by the Cabinet for a no-deal Brexit. I understand from coverage at the weekend and remarks made by the Tánaiste that he will make statements to the other House about the Government's preparedness and the ongoing work on the series of memos going before Cabinet this evening. I appreciate that we have a very busy schedule this week, but if there is an opportunity, I ask the Leader to invite the Tánaiste or another Minister before the House to make similar statements on Brexit before we rise for the summer break. The months ahead will be a period of crucial and critical importance for Ireland and the EU overall.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">Given that the House has worked so openly on this matter, by means of the work of the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU and on legislation such as the Omnibus Bill, it is important that Senators, with the agreement of Government and colleagues, should have an opportunity to hear from Ministers about the matters that will go before the Cabinet tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> The Reverend Harold Good of the Methodist Church in Ireland will be known to many people for his work in peace-building initiatives. He was one of two people to oversee the decommissioning of IRA arms, the other being the late Father Alec Reid. Yesterday, he told Eamonn Mallie that nobody should fear or presume to know Protestant-unionist-loyalist thinking on the debate regarding the issue of a new, agreed and shared Ireland. In light of the purpose of this House as a civic space and a space for discourse at an all-Ireland level, I wish to take this opportunity to commend the Reverend Good on his conscious and thoughtful remarks in recent days, which came on the back of a series of contributions from people such as James Nesbitt, who is from Coleraine, and Baroness Paisley, who is the widow of the late Reverend Ian Paisley, both of whom indicated that it was not incendiary or controversial to have a view or a discussion on this issue. Senators should not shrink from the discussion because we have a safe space in which to hold one, particularly in view of our make-up and our purpose, and we can contribute positively to the live debate that is being held within society.</p>

          <p eId="para_15">I want to make a very strong protest over the swingeing reduction in the grant for the International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival. It is the biggest such festival in the entire world and has an enormous international reputation. It was established by Brian Merriman in 2004 on a non-profit basis. It has always had some support from the Arts Council, though this has been very minimal, but after 16 years its organisers do not have an office, they do not have a computer and they do not have any paid staff. This is an astonishing situation. This year, Irish companies have been invited to perform plays in New York City, in Provincetown, at two London venues, in Stockholm and in South Africa. This year the box office grew by 60%, while the year before it grew by 16%. Despite strong praise from the Minister, Deputy Madigan, the grant has been cut. Last year they raised it from €10,000 to €15,000 but this year, in an announcement that was made over the weekend of the Pride march, they celebrated that event by cutting the grant by 50% and restricting it so that the international aspect is excluded completely. It must now concentrate exclusively on Irish plays by Irish writers and with Irish players and workers. It is astonishing and very regrettable so I ask the Leader if he would contact the Minister to see if there is anything that can be done. It is a minute grant out of the almost €1 million that is available.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> My second point concerns the fact that Commencement matters were dislodged this morning from the business of the House, in favour of a discussion on Travellers.</p>

          <p eId="para_53"> I rise to speak this afternoon about the speculation on the loss of 100 jobs in Moneypoint in County Clare. Everybody knows that the future of Moneypoint as a coal-burning facility for generating electricity will cease in the coming years. There are not too many employers in west Clare and the ESB is the second biggest employer there. Given the fact that the job cuts are imminent, as part of the Government's response we should have a special economic taskforce to look at what we can do to assist the people who are currently working in Moneypoint, who now face an extremely uncertain future. Such a taskforce should be funded by the Government with the support, funding and participation of the ESB. The ESB must engage closely with the unions and workers in Moneypoint to bring clarity as quickly as possible because there has been no official comment from the ESB on numbers. What we have heard is what is being speculated in the media and that is probably not a good position. The best position is for intensive escalation of engagement between ESB management and unions and workers at Moneypoint in order to bring the matter to a conclusion and to bring clarity. As part of that, it is extremely important for an economic taskforce to identify employment opportunities and alternative business and economic opportunities for west Clare.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> I commend Lahinch golf club, the European Tour and the Dubai Irish Open on what was a phenomenally successful Irish Open in Lahinch over the weekend. In terms of numbers, it was the most successful Irish Open since 2012. People who have been going to the Irish Open for many years tell me that it was the most successful one in their memory in terms of enjoyment. Enormous credit is due to Paddy Keane and his great team in Lahinch golf club, Clare County Council, An Garda Síochána and the other State organisations, but in particular to the almost 1,000 volunteers from within Lahinch golf club and the wider community who rolled up their sleeves and assisted for the five to six days. Credit is also due to the many businesses which spent significant money upgrading their facades, painting their buildings and ensuring the place was pristine for the 20,000 visitors a day, amounting to approximately 90,000 overall.</p>

It was broadcast on RTÉ on Monday, 8 July, from 10.45 p.m. to midnight, and will be followed up by a second documentary tonight at 10.35 p.m. My personal objection is that it was secretly filmed and illegally recorded with hidden equipment in collaboration with Guy Verhofstadt, MEP, the former Prime Minister of Belgium.

          <p eId="para_129">Senator Conway raised the future of Moneypoint power plant and the thousands of jobs that will be lost. The Joint Committee on Climate Action has discussed at length the issue of a just and fair transition. I echo Senator Conway's call for the trade union, the ESB, the Government and the workers to work this out. As we move to a greener economy, this could become a template that would be on the side of the workers and communities affected in future, including in Bord na Móna.</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> Homeoptions is a new company which has been set up using what is known as the mortgage to rent to repurchase model. The company was only launched today but it appears to offer an alternative to the vulture funds and banks to which we have paid needless billions of euro. People are still being thrown out of their homes and evicted. The Homeoptions concept comes on the back of the Right2Water movement and will be in the same market to purchase as the vulture funds. It will, however, give homeowners or tenants, as they will become in some instances, a right to rent and repurchase their homes. I ask that the Minister encourage this kind of community banking and togetherness which prevents people from ending up on the streets as victims of the hedge funds, bankers and vulture funds.</p>

          <p eId="para_131">I raise the sugar tax, an issue I have raised on a good number of times over the years in the context of obesity. We need to have a renewed focus on treatment and prevention. Figures show that the Exchequer received €32 million from the sugar tax which was introduced last year. I hope I am not wasting my time by repeating that this money should be ring-fenced and spent on nutritional and educational incentives for children and parents, subsidies for physical activity and water fountains in towns and cities. Prevention is obviously better than cure and all of these measures would help prevent obesity.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> On the expansion of treatment for obesity, there is only one proper bariatric treatment unit in Dublin. Foresight is needed on this issue. It may be the case that treatment is expensive to provide in the short term but over the long term it will save the health service a fortune if we take this matter seriously. We need a modern healthcare system that could be partly funded by these tax revenues. The whole point of the sugar tax was to incentivise more healthy choices when it comes to drinks. The obesity experts say that sugar-laden drinks are a major contributor to childhood obesity. If the money just goes in to the general Exchequer, it will not make any major inroads into an area that really needs funding. There is a precedent for this in the plastic bag levy. Much of the income from that levy was reinvested in environmental projects. We are missing a trick if we do not ring-fence this money. I feel very strongly about this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_133">I congratulate Carlow woman Rhona Cullinan for winning the prestigious and inspirational <i>Woman's Way</i> mum of the year award. We often celebrate medals in sport and accolades in businesses. I wanted to celebrate an award for motherhood. It is a job which many of the population do incredibly well but behind the scenes. Rhona is well-known for her advocacy for Down's syndrome and autism. She is a mother to Jamie, who is 15, Joshua, who is four, and Molly, who is two, and I wish her well.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> I want to talk about the priority processing for the student universal support Ireland, SUSI, grant, which is closing. Applications will continue to be processed over the summer but the message for thousands of students around the country is to apply now. The SUSI grant is incredible and allows those who are disadvantaged to attend college. It is time to look at the ways to qualify for the special rate of the grant. The special rate is for those with income under €24,000. It is directly linked to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. I call for it to be increased to allow for access for working families who are not in receipt of social welfare but perhaps qualify for working family payment or where each parent is in receipt of a State pension. SUSI grants and giving students a chance to get to college are crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> I agree with Senator Ardagh about the proposals made by the Central Bank of Ireland to increase the credit union annual membership levies. In my area, Carlow, there will be an increase of €40,000. That is unacceptable. There are 30,000 members in the Carlow Credit Union. Credit unions are not for profit. This levy is unacceptable. I ask that the Minister come into the House and address this. It will eventually go back to members of credit unions. I will second Senator Ardagh's proposal that we bring the Minister into the House. This levy is unacceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">Last week, we passed a Bill dealing with missing persons, the Civil Law (Presumption of Death) Bill 2016. It has been passed by both the Dáil and Seanad. A connected area which I raised earlier in the year relates to where a body or part of a body is found and we are not able to identify who the person is, or the part of the body is from. If a body is found in Kerry and the name of the person is not identified, then the information stays in Kerry. There is no central database to co-ordinate this area. There were two incidents in the last 18 months. One was the case of a person who disappeared in Dublin and then about three months later a body was found in Louth. There was no connection between the two incidents and it took ten years for the family of the person who had disappeared to find out that the body found in Louth was the body of the person who disappeared in Dublin. There was a case in Limerick where a young lad disappeared and no body was found. About nine months later, a body was found in Clare and there was no connection between the two, in that the body was not identified as the missing person from Limerick. It took 17 years for the family to find out that the body discovered in Clare was that of their son.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> There is a need for a central database. I have raised this issue and understand that the Department of Justice and Equality is looking at it. I do not understand why it is taking so long to come to a decision on the matter. It is extremely important that we co-ordinate information between different areas of the country, especially to assist families of missing persons such that information is available and it is co-ordinated so that when a body is found, we can identify who the person is. I ask that the Leader bring it to the attention of the Minister and that, if necessary, we could have a debate on the matter in the next session.</p>

          <p eId="para_147">I agree with Senator Ó Donnghaile that these Houses, and in this House in particular, need to engage in an intelligent and reasonable debate about future relations between the two parts of this island. The debate on whether there should be a Border poll is somewhat premature and would be far better replaced by a debate on whether there are intermediate steps towards co-operation between the two parts of this island that would attract support from both sides of the community in Northern Ireland and from the people in this part of the world. The idea that there is going to be a 51% to 49% plebiscite some day soon to unite the country without actually knowing what would be involved is somewhat misconceived. If we are going to make progress on reconciling the two communities in Northern Ireland, and on providing a framework for the two parts of Ireland to work together, perhaps in the context of the European Union, it has always struck me that sharing membership of the European Union between the two parts of this island is something which should be examined, rather than simply expecting that a unitary state in the form of a republic would precede such shared membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> In that context, and on a serious note, according to the newspapers and media reports, the Cabinet is engaging in considering the serious potential implications of a disorderly British exit from the European union. The political process in the United Kingdom, particularly at Westminster, does not seem to be taking account at all of the possible implications for Ireland of the competing, aggressive approaches being offered to the membership of the Tory Party by those aspiring to be its leader. The only mention of Ireland I hear in the British media, in particular in political interviews, is that the United Kingdom can use the adverse effects on both the Republic and Northern Ireland as some kind of leverage to extract concessions from the European Union. That is a deeply reprehensible and irresponsible attitude on the part of those protagonists and their supporters.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> As we approach the end of this term, we might consider establishing a committee on future relations in Ireland in the autumn in order that we could engage in serious discussion and dialogue with people north of the Border in particular, from both communities, with a view to advancing realistic and achievable steps towards giving Ireland what it needs, which is, if at all possible, the idea that both parts of Ireland would share the benefits of European Union membership.</p>

          <p eId="para_150">It is not often Senator McDowell usurps me.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">I agree wholeheartedly with what he said in the context of what James Nesbitt and Harold Good said over the weekend. What Senator McDowell outlined can be very simply done through this House. We have done some very good things. I want to see the House play a part in the consultations, just as my colleague, Senator Ó Donnghaile, and Senator McDowell said. It can be easily done if we have agreement from each of the party and group leaders. We need to shape our own destiny. If the Brexit debacle has shown us anything, it is that we cannot be left, and cannot leave our children, at the behest of the Tory public school boys. Together we must shape a new and agreed Ireland, and we may as well do so sooner rather than later. People say our party should not call for a Border poll, but were we not to do so we would not even be having this conversation now. That call is to instigate the conversation that is needed on this in order that nobody is left behind. I have often said that a new and agreed Ireland to me is not about me being somehow better than a loyalist in east Belfast. It is about us all being equal and having equality of opportunity. As I said yesterday when speaking in another context, a mother on the Shankill Road wants the same for her children as I want for my children in Mayo: equality of opportunity in respect of education, careers, health and many other things that will take them through their life cycles in order that they can reach their full potential. We therefore need to work on those things that unite us and to shape the type of island we want. This is what we have been trying to do for decades, and I very much welcome that other people are on board now. This does not belong to any one party. This is the collective responsibility of all of us as citizens. We will certainly play our part, but this does not belong to any one person. There is no room for egos here; the business we need to do is too serious for that. We will certainly play our part in that business.</p>

        <speech by="#IvanaBacik" eId="spk_127">
          <from>Senator Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_152">I listened with great interest to what Senators McDowell and Conway-Walsh said about the future of the island in the light of the increasing and awful prospect of a no-deal Brexit. I will add a small observation of my own. A most unfortunate development has arisen post the Vótáil 100 programme we held last summer. Colleagues will recall that as part of the programme, I along with Senators Conway-Walsh, Higgins and others accompanied the Ceann Comhairle to Westminster to present a portrait of Constance Markievicz to the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow. The journalist Martina Devlin has just brought to light the fact that the portrait is unfortunately no longer hanging in a public space in Westminster, as I think we had assumed it would be, but was put into storage. It has now been liberated by the Labour Party MP, Conor McGinn, and is hanging in his office. I ask that we communicate with the Ceann Comhairle about this and see why or how the portrait, gifted by our speaker to the Speaker of the British Parliament, was not kept hanging in public after last summer's presentation, which was so successful. That is perhaps a small footnote on British-Irish relations but nonetheless of some significance.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> I wish to voice my disappointment that in this last sitting week, as has become an unfortunate tradition, we are inundated with justice Bills being pushed through. I know that this is not of the Leader's doing, that it comes to us from the other House. It is unfortunate, however, that we are seeing really important, long-awaited Bills such as the Parole Bill debated and rushed through this House in a matter of two or three days, even though that Bill started in the other House at the instigation of Deputy O'Callaghan in 2016. There is therefore no reason for this unseemly rush at the end of July every year. It always seems to be a particular feature of the Department of Justice and Equality and its legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">Will the Leader convey our disappointment that this is once again happening?</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> I commend Ms Louise O'Keeffe on her resilience and persistence in light of the report from Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill, which makes it clear that the conditions placed on the redress scheme for survivors of abuse in day schools should not have been so placed. I heard the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, on radio this morning. I hope that the Government will now devise a scheme that is fair to survivors of abuse. I should declare an interest, as I represented survivors of abuse in day schools. I know how long a battle to seek justice it has been for many of them.</p>

          <p eId="para_156">I wish to pass on my sympathies and those of the Fianna Fáil Party to the family of John Bailey, including his daughter, Deputy Maria Bailey, his wife, his other four daughters, their partners and his grandchildren, and the Fine Gael family generally. I worked closely with John. We sat together on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. I was there a little bit before him, but for almost 12 years we worked with each other and, sometimes, against each other. Very sadly, he died this morning of motor neuron disease. John had been such an energetic and dedicated councillor for many years. He gave his life to public life, both in terms of politics and the GAA. I was the Fianna Fáil group leader when he was the Fine Gael group leader. We worked with each other to put a programme together in 2014 that stood the five years. I sat beside him and we would often have little jousts, but we were good friends and I want to put on the record my sympathies to his family, friends and political colleagues across the country. It is a sad day for him, his family and us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> I understand that there is an objection to the Order of Business. I will actually address the Order of Business, which is not something we often do during the Order of Business. Regarding the idea that we should set times for everything, I take Senator Bacik's point about a great deal of legislation seemingly being put through. I am not sure that we can call 9 July the end of July, but I take her point that that deadline might be focusing people's minds.</p>

          <p eId="para_179">The Ministers are as able to accommodate us as much as we accommodate them, Senator, whom I thank for interrupting. Those are my thoughts for the day.</p>

          <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T16:25:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_180">I thank the 16 Senators who contributed on the Order of Business. I join with Senators Boyhan, Horkan, Ardagh and others who spoke on the tragic death this morning of former councillor John Bailey. I had the pleasure of knowing him as an elected politician, but also as a member of Cumann Lúthchleas Gael.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">He was an extraordinary man, dedicated to his community, his club, Cuala, and his family. I offer our deepest sympathies to his wife Angela and his daughters. The tributes paid to him this afternoon are justified and well deserved. He was an extraordinary person, a man who loved life and who was committed to his family, his local community, the GAA and politics. His maxim was to make life better for people. We sympathise with his family. </p>
          <p eId="para_182"> Senators Ardagh and Bacik raised the issue of the redress scheme and the decision yesterday of Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill. I join with the Taoiseach in welcoming that decision and I welcome the Taoiseach's apology today to all victims. As the Taoiseach said in the Dáil, the process should have been in place before 1992 to record an allegation of abuse. The Taoiseach also told the Dáil the Government proposes to amend and reopen the scheme in a way that will be responsive to Mr. Justice O'Neill's decision. The State has a responsibility to protect children who are abused. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, will make a statement on the matter in the Dáil tomorrow. </p>
          <p eId="para_183"> I draw the attention of Senator Ardagh to the decision in 1998 of the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Micheál Martin, to take the Louise O'Keeffe case to the Supreme Court. I ask the Senator to read the Supreme Court judgment in that case. It is important that we welcome the Senator's U-turn here today and that of Deputy Micheál Martin, who, as Minister at the time, could have said "No" in 1998 but he did not. I call on him to explain why he did not do so. The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has the capacity to say "No" to a case. I commend the bravery of Louise O'Keeffe and I thank her for her courage. We welcome the decision of Mr. Justice O'Neill. What is important now is that we get justice for the young people, now adults, who were abused and that the scheme is reopened. I welcome that the Minister, Deputy McHugh, will make a statement on the matter in the Dáil tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> Senators Ardagh and Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of the Central Bank levy. The rate recommended by the Central Bank is half the rate of the levy applicable to the high street banks, to reflect the unique contribution that the credit union movement makes in our local communities. I understand the questions posed by both Members this afternoon. I was a member of the credit union supervisory committee of my local credit union. I recognise the importance and value of credit unions and I commend all the volunteers and staff who do great work in our local communities and who work with people of all ages and gender in very difficult and, sometimes, fraught situations. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, was before the finance committee last week, where there was a very informed debate on the matter. I hope that the levy will be reviewed in time. </p>
          <p eId="para_185"> Senator Ardagh also raised the issue of the environment and the high nitrogen dioxide levels and I am happy to have the Minister come to the House on that matter. Senators Ó Donnghaile, Feighan, McDowell, Conway-Walsh and Bacik raised the issue of Brexit and future relations on our island. It is an important conversation that we need to have and I am happy to provide time in the House. The suggestion from Senator McDowell regarding the establishment of a future relations in Ireland committee is one I wholeheartedly embrace and support. This House has done the State a huge service in terms of the provision of a Brexit committee, the future of which will be before the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, for decision later today. The points raised by all Members of the House are ones that we need to reflect upon. For any candidate of Government or political office to seek to use this country as a leverage to gain support or political advantage is irresponsible and reprehensible. I concur with Senator McDowell in that regard. There is need for a conversation around future relations on our island, while at the same time respecting both traditions. I have not listened to or read the James Nesbitt interview, so I cannot comment on it. As I said, I am happy to have the Brexit and future relations in Ireland debate in due course. The suggestion made by Senator McDowell is one that the Seanad CPP could examine. It deserves consideration. There are a number of committees dealing with the Good Friday Agreement, including the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">If I may make a suggestion, such a committee could be a joint endeavour of the Upper and Lower House. This would give it the significance of an Oireachtas joint committee. If that is not to be, this House should certainly consider going it alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> Senator Norris raised the issue of the Dublin Gay Theatre Festival. I concur with his remarks regarding the reduction of the grant. I have received the email from Brian Merriman and I hope to meet with him. The points made by Senator Norris are valid and I support them. </p>
          <p eId="para_188"> Senators Norris and Craughwell have made comments regarding the ordering of the business of the House. With regard to Commencement matters, the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, which the Leas-Chathaoirleach chairs, was anxious to complete a number of pieces of work before the summer recess. One of these was on Senator Colette Kelleher's proposal regarding the Traveller community. We have facilitated a number of very important debates at that committee. A decision was taken between the committee, others, and myself as Leader to hold a meeting this morning from 10 a.m. to 2.30 p.m. This decision was not made to facilitate any group or grouping within society, but to facilitate the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, which we have also done at other times. </p>

          <p eId="para_190">They were indeed. The proposal was agreed by the House and was also agreed at a meeting of the group leaders and Whips. I will not apologise in any way for holding a meeting of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee. With regard to the points made by Senator Craughwell, I apologise to the Leas-Chathaoirleach because I am going to use my phone to highlight and indicate a number of things. First, the schedule as outlined was agreed at the meeting of group leaders. As Members will know, the schedule is indicative and is open to change in respect of times. Second, it was agreed that we would run all debates one after the other in order to use the time of Ministers, Members, officials, and members of staff of the House to the greatest benefit. As Senator Horkan said, this allows for better flow between debates. Senator Craughwell has not proposed anything but has said that he will oppose the Order of Business. If he were to propose to set times for each debate or stage of legislation, he would be proposing to guillotine them. If time were to run over on any particular legislation, debate would be curtailed.</p>

In accordance with Standing Order 148, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question "That the Bill be received for final consideration", the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments and the proposed grouping.

          <p eId="para_254">The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that certain matters can be addressed more expeditiously than others following the establishment of the judicial council. Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 provide that both the judicial studies committee and the personal injuries guidelines committee will be required to meet not later than three months following the first meeting of the council. The provision in the Bill as passed by this House was for all of the committees to meet not later than six months after the first council meeting. Having reflected upon the matter, I agreed with the proposal that a shorter period is appropriate for these two committees, which do not involve lay membership, and the consequent need to ensure time for the Public Appointments Service, PAS, process to be brought to a conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> In addition, the amendment in respect of the personal injuries guidelines committee means that it will be able formally to begin its work earlier than might otherwise have been possible. By virtue of amendment No. 3, that committee will now have six months, as opposed to 12, within which to bring its work to a conclusion and submit draft guidelines to the board of the judicial council. This is an ambitious and challenging timeframe, but I have no doubt that the committee will be able to rise to the challenge. I am conscious of the need for it to be adequately resourced if it is to carry out its function in a proper manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> These are straightforward amendments which seek to ensure a greater level of urgency in the setting up of certain committees provided for in the Bill.</p>

When we first debated the Bill in this House, we were expecting it to be a year and a half to two years before that committee would report back to the judicial council. I hope its report will reflect what is actually happening in this area and the need for a reduction in awards, particularly in the case of soft tissue injuries and whiplash injuries. I urge the members of the Judiciary who comprise the membership of the committee to take cognisance of the public view on these matters.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">This amendment does not in any way impact upon the substance of the provision contained in section 29 of the Bill which was inserted as a result of an amendment proposed by Senator Ruane. The Minister for Justice and Equality of the day will still be required to undertake a review of legislative provisions which impose minimum sentences, whether those sentences are presumptive minimum sentences or mandatory minimum sentences. The Minister will also still be required, within 12 months of the commencement of that review, to make a report to each of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The primary purpose of the amendment is to provide a context for the review, to make clear that its purpose relates both to the appropriateness of minimum sentences in general and the extent to which the provisions in this area are applied in practice.</p>

          <p eId="para_261">The purpose of these amendments is to confirm that, in all cases, both the name of the judge against whom a complaint has been substantiated and the reprimand issued will be published in the annual report of the judicial conduct committee. They achieve this purpose in a different way from that set out in section 87(4)(l) of the Bill as passed by Seanad Éireann. That section incorporates an amendment proposed by Senator Clifford-Lee requiring the annual report to include information on the judge concerned for each case in which a reprimand was issued by the judicial conduct committee. My amendment moves this requirement to subsection (6), largely for structural reasons. Subsection (6) provides that the name of the judge concerned and the reprimand issued shall be published where a judge fails to co-operate with a panel of inquiry under section 71 or does not fulfil a reporting requirement under section 79(13).</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> Amendment No. 8 will include section 79(2)(b) in that list. This is the section under which a reprimand is issued to a judge against whom a complaint of alleged misconduct has been upheld. As a consequence of this amendment, it is no longer necessary to retain section 87(4)(l). Nor is it necessary to retain subsection (7), which allowed the judicial conduct committee a measure of discretion as to whether or not the name of a judge to whom a reprimand was issued should be included in the annual report. Lest there be any doubt on this point, I emphasise that the effect of my amendment is that the name of a judge to whom a reprimand has issued and the reprimand itself will always be included in the annual report. I acknowledge Senator Clifford-Lee's previous comments in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">I am pleased to have the opportunity to commend the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) (Amendment) Bill 2019 to the Seanad on Second Stage. I acknowledge the co-operation and support being given to this Bill by colleagues and party spokespersons across both Houses. It is my hope that, subject to today's proceedings and the conduct of the relevant Stages as now scheduled, the Bill can be completed for enactment before Senators go on their summer vacation, which I understand will be at the earliest possible date to facilitate the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> The purpose of today's Bill is to provide for an increase in the maximum number of ordinary judges of the Court of Appeal from nine to 15. The Bill, therefore, provides for an amendment of the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act 1961 to increase the statutory number of ordinary judges of the Court of Appeal from nine to 15. At present, the court comprises a president and not more than nine ordinary judges as set down in statute. There has been no change in the configuration since the court's establishment in 2014. The Court of Appeal plays a pivotal role in dealing with a range of appeals arising from both civil and criminal proceedings across a number of other court jurisdictions. However, we are now at a point where it is clear from the current trend in waiting times that, without additional judges, the Court of Appeal, before too long, will face similar levels of undesirable delay to those which gave rise to its establishment five years ago. Successive presidents of the Court of Appeal have also highlighted the need for today's Bill with the strong support of the Chief Justice. Information received from the Courts Service confirms that, as things stand, hearing dates for civil cases before the Court of Appeal have already been fixed up to, and including, May 2021. While some allocation has also been made within that schedule so that any urgent appeals can also be dealt with, the time available for civil appeals is essentially fully allocated up to and including that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> Having brought this Bill to Government and before the House, I am satisfied that the additional judicial positions are warranted to address the current demands being faced by the Court of Appeal and to improve efficiency in the appeals process. The exercise of the option of appeal is, as Members will appreciate, a mainstay of our judicial system and in ensuring access to justice. I also wish to signal my intention to bring forward a small number of discrete technical amendments to this Bill which have been submitted to the Bills Office in the required manner for Seanad Committee Stage. These deal with a number of technical but nonetheless pressing court-related matters that need to be addressed before the summer recess and for which no timely and alternative legislative vehicle is available. They principally support the establishment of the office of the legal costs adjudicators that will replace that of the Taxing Master over the summer period under the reforming measures contained in the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. Extensive preparations in terms of IT supports, new procedures, staff training and rules of court have been made by the Courts Service in conjunction with my Department. The new system is scheduled to go live in mid-September on that basis with the preliminary registration of legal costs adjudicators from July.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> The proposed amendments will harmonise the current lodgement and tender provisions for legal costs in their application across the various courts. They will also streamline the way the new public register of legal costs determinations will be applied to county registrars. A cross-reference in the 2015 Act is also being corrected. The enhancement of the lodgement and tender process incentivises the parties in cases to make and consider reasonable offers to settle. That reduces the burdens of legal costs and time on both the courts and on the litigating parties. The new office of the legal costs adjudicators will be a linchpin of the wider and more consumer-friendly legal costs transparency regime when it comes into operation this autumn with the commencement of Part 10 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> That is all part of the programme of structural reforms to legal costs and legal services that will come into operation this autumn under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015. Early October will see the coming on stream of the new public complaints and professional conduct regime under which complaints about solicitors and barristers will no longer be made through their legal professional bodies but through the Legal Services Regulatory Authority. That will be bolstered by the coming on stream of the independent legal practitioners' disciplinary tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> I have also proposed an amendment to add the President of the Court of Appeal - that being the court whose membership is being extended under today's Bill - to the membership of the Advisory Committee on Patents of Precedence. The committee will modernise the process of conferral of senior counsel status under the terms of section 172 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 when commenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> A further amendment for inclusion in this Bill proposes to change the retirement age of judges of the District Court from 65 to 70 years as an immediate administrative priority. This will enhance the smooth running and continuity of court business in regard to the relevant District Court judges, who would otherwise have to technically renew their status in each of the five intervening years concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> As the House will recall, the Court of Appeal was established in October 2014 under the Act, following a referendum of the people in 2013 which was passed by over 65% of voters. On the establishment date, a total of 1,360 civil appeals then pending before the Supreme Court, and referred to as "Article 64 appeals", were transferred across to the Court of Appeal. A further 599 criminal appeals were inherited from the Court of Criminal Appeal. In terms of the existing caseload of the Court of Appeal, as of 31 March 2019, it had 909 civil appeals pending, of which 195 were transferred Article 64 appeals. It also had 516 criminal appeals pending, just five of which were inherited. Information received from the Courts Service confirms that, as things stand, hearing dates for civil cases before the Court of Appeal have already been fixed up to and including May 2021, with some allowance made to accommodate those more urgent appeals that will inevitably intervene.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> While the current waiting time for criminal appeals is five months, which is generally viewed as an acceptable period, the waiting time for civil appeals is 22 months. This is considered a significant problem in terms of access to justice. The purpose of today’s Bill is, therefore, to provide the necessary additional judicial resources for the Court of Appeal to deal with its current caseload and to address waiting times. Increasing the number of ordinary judges in the Court of Appeal by six, as proposed in the Bill, will have the beneficial effect of increasing efficiency and access in terms of processing appeals in the superior courts. For example, the President of the Court of Appeal has indicated that having six extra judges would allow for three divisions of the Court of Appeal, one dealing with criminal cases, the second dealing with the inherited Article 64 cases and the third dealing with incoming mainstream civil cases. In the view of the Judiciary, this would allow for the most efficient disposal of cases, allowing sufficient time for hearing cases in court, reading papers in preparation for court and, of course, the very important engagement which is the drafting and preparation of judgments.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> The appointment of six additional judges to the Court of Appeal is estimated to cost in the region of €1.22 million by way of salaries and allowances, with the provision of some additional supports by the Courts Service. Funding for such non-pay or capital costs, including any required additional chambers, will be managed within the existing resources of the Courts Service. As part of this approach, I will review the situation in two years regarding judicial numbers in the Court of Appeal in consultation with the President of that court and as the court clears down its inherited caseload.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> In commending the Bill to the House on its recognised merits, I look forward to the contribution of Members. In that regard, I also look forward to our discussion of the small number of key technical amendments that I have outlined.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">I welcome this Bill and Fianna Fáil will be supporting it. It is good that we are appointing six extra judges to the Court of Appeal. While the Court of Appeal was established in 2014 to deal with the very serious backlog in the Supreme Court, and it has made inroads in that regard, there are still serious delays. Justice delayed is justice denied, so I very much welcome the addition of these six judges. I look forward to the Bill being passed.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">This Bill is opportune. The Court of Appeal created a very valuable additional structure within our courts to try to deal with the volume of cases where people were not happy with the outcome, given the issues with the Supreme Court. It is only appropriate that we would resource it properly to ensure there are no unnecessary delays, and we know there have been delays, from what the Minister has told us and from our own information. I agree with the sentiments of Senator Clifford-Lee in the sense that justice delayed is justice denied, which is true. This Bill is welcome and I hope it will pass quickly.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Charles Flanagan)<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_276">I thank Senators Clifford-Lee and Conway for their interventions. While this is a small, two-section Bill, I am sure everybody will agree it will have a highly positive effect in terms of access to justice. If enacted, it will bolster the working capacity of the Court of Appeal so it can keep up with its demanding caseload while also working down any existing delays. Moreover, if the courts-related technical amendments that I have proposed can be agreed, the Bill will also provide a timely legislative vehicle to accommodate those discrete changes that will help to ensure the successful transition of the Office of the Taxing Master to that of the Legal Costs Adjudicator this autumn. This, in turn, will augment the broader historical package of structural reforms that are set to become operational under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 over the summer period.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> As Members will appreciate, the amendments propose to harmonise the lodgment and tender process across the courts and have been the subject of detailed consultation with the Office of the Taxing Master, the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, given their highly technical nature. They are also being supported by the new rules of court which have been prepared, subject to the agreement of the amendments concerned. The other amendments proposed will include the President of the Court of Appeal in the membership of the new advisory committee on grant of patents of precedence and fast-track the changes in the retirement age of District Court judges from 65 to 70 years for administrative purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> At the same time, it is important that we do not lose sight of the cross-cutting role being played by the Court of Appeal since it was set up five years ago. The new court inherited the civil jurisdiction previously exercisable by the Supreme Court in appeals from orders of the High Court, and the criminal appeal jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Court of Appeal also hears court martial appeals previously dealt with by the Courts-Martial Appeal Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> For its part, the High Court deals with a broad range of cases, including personal injuries, repossession, debt recovery, contract, extradition, defamation, planning, deportation, asylum and family law cases. It also deals with categories of criminal cases, including bail applications, <i>habeas corpus</i>, cases under Article 40 of the Constitution and matters of judicial review. Therefore, the range of civil appeals coming from that source for the attention of the Court of Appeal is extensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> The criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal extends to appeal against conviction after a trial by jury in the Central Criminal Court and the Circuit Criminal Court, and following trial in the non-jury Special Criminal Court. Appeals can be taken against the severity of sentence and the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal a sentence on the grounds of undue leniency. The Court of Appeal also hears applications to quash a conviction on the grounds of new evidence following a previously unsuccessful appeal. I want to also mention that relatively new categories of appeals include appeals by the DPP against an acquittal and appeals under the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, as amended, arising from the findings as to fitness or otherwise of an accused person to stand trial.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> According to the annual report of the Courts Service for 2018, the launch of which I attended yesterday and the details of which are now publicly available on<i> www.courts.ie</i>, the Court of Appeal had 499 incoming cases on civil law matters in that year, while it resolved 475 such cases in that period. Also last year, the Court of Appeal had 1,266 incoming criminal matters to deal with, while it resolved 1,400 such matters over that period. As we have discussed, the criminal appeals list is running well, with what would be regarded as a broadly acceptable waiting time of five months or less. It also has procedures in place for the allocation of priority hearing dates for appeals where the President of the Court of Appeal is satisfied there is a sufficient degree of urgency. However, the average waiting time of over 22 months for new civil appeals is unacceptable. It has, as I mentioned earlier, been a source of ongoing concern to the President of the Court of Appeal, his predecessor and the Chief Justice. The judges are acutely aware of the State's obligation under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights to provide a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time. Despite the maximum use of the available judicial resources and court time, therefore, it has become increasingly evident that the civil caseload of the Court of Appeal is not manageable without the appointment of extra judges.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">While hearing dates continue to be allocated weekly, taking the optimal approach in case management terms, today's Bill will allow the current list be reviewed by the President of the Court of Appeal. The appointment of six new judges will enable the president to manage the civil list by convening additional courts to prioritise hearing of the remaining Article 64 appeals, transferred from the Supreme Court, while at the same time bringing forward appeals that are on the priority list, bringing forward to earlier dates the appeals that are currently listed for hearing as far ahead as April 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> I thank Senators for their consideration of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to its further discussion on Committee Stage in light of the amendments I have outlined. Should the Seanad decide in its wisdom, following careful consideration, to enact its contents by passing Committee and Report Stages tomorrow, it is my intention that the Bill, as enacted, will proceed to be signed by the President and go to Government in early September with the nominations and my recommendations for consideration for appointment by the President at an early date.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidStanton" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_216">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy David Stanton)<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_288">I thank the Acting Chairman. I am pleased to address the House today on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality. I want to acknowledge Deputy Jim O’Callaghan’s role in originally drafting this Private Members’ Bill. Although it has been extensively amended by Government after a massive work programme in the Department of Justice and Equality, its core substance remains the same. </p>
          <p eId="para_289"> This is important legislation that will put parole decisions on a sound legislative footing and ensure they are made by an expert and impartial body. This Bill received cross-party support in the Dáil and it is clear there is a very genuine commitment in both Houses to progressing this Bill and ensuring its reforms can take place as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> While the law sets down very heavy penalties for the most serious crimes, we recognise that prisoners should not be detained indefinitely without any prospect of ever being released. Prisoners, and perhaps most of all those who have committed the most awful of offences, need to have an incentive to rehabilitate themselves. It is very much in the public interest that this incentive to rehabilitate exists. That is why a system of parole, together with other forms of early release, is common across the world. While we might recoil at the idea that a prisoner who has taken a person’s life by an irreversible and abhorrent action should be allowed to return to the community when their victim can never do so, we should remember, of course, that a life sentence does mean life. A parolee remains subject to the parole order for the rest of his or her life and can be recalled to prison at any time if he or she breaches a condition of parole. His or her sentence remains in place for the rest of his or her lifetime. It is very clear that parole should be considered very carefully, and only permitted when a reasonable amount of the sentence, taking account of all the circumstances, has been served.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> In Ireland at present, parole is legally granted as a form of reviewable temporary release under the Criminal Justice Act 1960. The current Parole Board comprises members with extensive expertise in a range of relevant areas, including criminal law, probation, psychotherapy, criminology and policing. It operates on an administrative basis and makes recommendations on the granting of parole and the sentence management of those serving long sentences. The final decision on whether to release a prisoner is made by the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> It has been a long standing objective of successive Governments to place the Parole Board on a statutory footing. When the current board was established in 2001, it was envisaged that the non-statutory board would operate for a number of years, with a view to the board gaining experience prior to being placed on a statutory footing. The penal policy review group produced a report in 2014 recommending establishing the Parole Board on an independent statutory basis. The Law Reform Commission agrees with this proposal and the former Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, under my own chairmanship at the time, in its report of March 2013, made the same recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> The current Parole Board has done excellent work for very many years, which I would like to acknowledge and thank it for. The reason it is so important that it is placed in legislation is that there is clarity and legal certainty for the prisoner, the victim and the general public about how the board reaches its decisions. The other reform in this Bill is that decisions will be made independently of the Minister. This ensures that decisions on parole cannot be influenced by political considerations but rather can only be made on the basis of criteria which are set out in statute.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> Senators will be aware of the growing appreciation of the needs and the interests of victims in the criminal justice system. The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 laid down the rights of victims to be given information during the investigation and trial processes and beyond. The Bill before us will complement other measures by enhancing the role of the victim in the parole process, including by allowing him or her to have legal representation. The Government is pleased to support the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> On Report Stage in Dáil Éireann, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, moved a very large volume of amendments that had been prepared by the Department and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and that have, in my view, ensured that the original policy intention is respected, while also ensuring the Bill is robust and legally sound. The Minister is pleased to see the extent to which the Bill and those amendments received the broad support of that House.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> Part 1 of the Bill contains the usual provisions on interpretation. Part 2 deals with the membership of the board, its functions and powers. While the members of the board are technically to be appointed by the Minister, the majority will be nominated by State bodies and professional organisations. This is to ensure that the board has the necessary range and depth of expertise to properly make decisions on parole. The board will have experts in law, psychology and psychiatry. There will also be a member from the Irish Prison Service, the Garda Síochána and a probation officer, who will bring their experience working on the front line of the criminal justice system to the board’s decisions. Another member will be from an NGO working in the area of prisoners' rights or prison reform. The remaining members will be chosen on the basis of their expertise and experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> The board will have the power to obtain reports about the prisoner. For example, it can direct the Irish Prison Service to provide a report on the prisoner’s behaviour in prison and his or her engagement with treatment and education programmes. It can obtain psychological reports on the prisoner. The board can meet with the prisoner, interview him or her and give him or her an opportunity to put forward the case for being granted parole. This meeting or interview can be conducted by two or more members of the board and can take place at the prison. All this will help inform the board’s decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> The victim will be entitled to make an oral submission to the board if he or she wishes. Currently, the victim is invited to write to the board, and the board takes these submissions very seriously. However, some victims would prefer an opportunity to address the board personally, and the Bill provides for that. Legal representation and legal aid will be provided for both the parole applicant and the victim in the parole process.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> The board will make decisions which have a significant impact on a prisoner’s liberty and we know that many prisoners have limited capacity to articulate their case. The victim will be entitled to legal representation and legal aid. This is to help ensure that balance is maintained between the need and entitlement for victims to be heard and respected, and the rights of life-sentence prisoners seeking parole.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> The board can make its own procedures, subject to some stipulations. In particular, there is a requirement for these procedures to be fair, and there are certain matters in which the board must make procedures. The board can determine procedural detail such as timeframes and the manner in which notifications are to be made. This allows for a degree of flexibility and practicality.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> There are limits on the board’s discretion. It will, for example, have to allow for legal representation. It will have to notify the victim of consideration of an application for parole and give the victim an explanation of how he or she can participate in the process. It will also have to provide the parole applicant with the information it will be considering in coming to its decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> The chief executive will manage and control the board’s staff, administration and business. The chief executive will prepare accounts for audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> Part 3 of the Bill deals with the parole process. The Bill increases the time which must be served by a life-sentence prisoner before being considered for parole to 12 years, compared to the existing seven years. While those life-sentence prisoners who are now being granted parole have, on average, served more than 18 years of their life sentence, the Minister recognises that an initial parole hearing after seven years can cause distress to victims. This increase is something that I hope will go some way toward limiting the distress victims have said they experience currently when they are notified seven years into a prisoner’s sentence that he or she is to be considered for parole, and the upset when this process is repeated a number of times.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> Eligibility will be limited initially to those serving life sentences, although the Minister can extend it to other prisoners serving long sentences eventually by regulation. This section also states that prisoners who are serving mandatory minimum sentences are not eligible until the minimum period has been served and sets out how eligibility is to be decided when a prisoner is serving concurrent or consecutive sentences.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> The Irish Prison Service will notify the board of who is eligible for parole and the board will notify the prisoner. The prisoner will be asked to confirm that he or she wishes to apply for parole.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Parole can be granted by the making of a parole order if three criteria are met. First, the applicant must not present an undue risk to the safety and security of the public, including the victim. Second, the applicant must be rehabilitated and capable of reintegrating into society. Third, the board must decide that it is appropriate in all the circumstances to grant parole. This third limb of the test is similar to a provision in temporary release legislation and the Minister believes it is important that it is also included here. The factors that the board will consider in deciding whether the test is met are set out clearly in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> A parole order will specify a release date, which may be up to 18 months in the future. Often, prisoners who have been detained for many years may find it difficult to adjust if they are released immediately. This time can be used to prepare the prisoner for eventual release, for example, by transfer to an open prison. A parole order will be subject to conditions that the board considers appropriate, for example, that the parolee does not communicate with the victim, visit a particular locality or commit an offence while on parole.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> When refusing parole, the Parole Board can recommend measures that could further the prisoner's rehabilitation or capacity to reintegrate into society or that might mitigate any risk the prisoner might pose to the public. For example, it can recommend that the prisoner should undergo a therapeutic programme or educational course or undergo short periods of temporary release. This is an important aspect of the current work of the board, particularly when it is reviewing prisoners at the early stages of sentences that will continue under the new board. The board can revoke or vary an order where the parolee poses an undue risk to the safety and security of the public or where he or she has breached a condition attaching to the order. Breach of a parole order renders a person unlawfully at large. This is similar to breach of a condition of temporary release and the person can be arrested and returned to detention with the parole order suspended until the board can consider whether it should be revoked or varied.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> Part 4 makes consequential amendments to other legislation. Most of these are technical in nature but I wish to draw the attention of Senators to section 41. The latter amends the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 to provide that the victim should be informed, if he or she has requested it, of any application for parole or the release of the person on parole.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> I appeal to Senators to support the Bill. I look forward to hearing their views and to the debate. I look forward to real progress on these important reforms to our parole system.</p>

          <p eId="para_312">We will take five and three minutes, respectively. I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive overview of the Bill. I wish to acknowledge the work done by my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, in getting the Bill to this House. It is an important milestone for the criminal justice system in Ireland to have it here. I hope the Bill will pass through the Houses and be enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> The Bill confers responsibility for granting parole onto an independent statutory body. Currently, the <i>de facto</i> parole system operates entirely at the discretion of the Minister for Justice and Equality, with a non-statutory parole board advising him. This is completely unsatisfactory and not fit for purpose in a modern criminal justice system. Any body that performs a function that is important in deciding whether to release convicted murderers and rapists should be clearly defined in legislation and its functions organised in statute. The current situation is incoherent in having a member of Cabinet and the Oireachtas making decisions in respect of matters initially decided upon by the Judiciary. It offends the principle of the separation of powers, which should keep politicians away from those functions of the court. The <i>ad hoc</i> basis upon which parole is currently granted in Ireland and the ultimate control of this system by a politician are outdated. It is important that these two functions are separated.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> I am happy that the Bill is before the Houses and that the Government is supporting it. The Bill gives significant rights and support to victims of crime. This is an important aspect for many Senators because it creates an obligation on the board to provide information that is readily accessible to victims, as well as the general public and offenders, about matters relating to release from detention on parole, policies and the operation of the board in general. This is important for transparency and public faith in the criminal justice system.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> The board will be obliged to take into consideration all relevant available information from the trial or sentencing process and information obtained from victims. There is also an obligation to take due consideration of the position of any victims affected by a decision and any impact statement victims might make or submissions that might be made by them or on their behalf. Again, this is significant because currently the parole system we have does not necessarily take this into account. It is important that we put victims of crime and their families at the front and centre of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> There has been a long-standing commitment to place the Parole Board on a statutory footing. A commitment was first affirmed by the then Minister of Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter, in 2011. This was repeated by him in 2013 at the inaugural Parole Board conference. Placing the board on a statutory footing will create greater transparency and clarity, features always welcome in the criminal justice system. The Parole Board will make the final decision regarding parole rather than simply recommending that decision. The Minister then will have the final say on whether it is made. That is really important.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> The make-up of the Parole Board, between the members and the staff, should be reconsidered. They cannot be merely political appointees with political connections. I say that with due respect to the current members. They work hard but what we are about is instilling public satisfaction and confidence in the Parole Board. That is something I hope the Minister of State will take into consideration. It is important that the Bill gets the full support of the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JenniferMurnaneOConnor" eId="spk_219">
          <from>Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_318">I applaud my colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, for bringing forward this legislation. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has been tireless in his work to help it progress. It is one of the most important tranches of legislation to come before these Houses and I appreciate being able to speak on it. Considerable work has gone into the Bill. It is important that we acknowledge the pain and hurt that has brought so many people from all sides together to send in submissions. I have spent a good deal of time with family friends of mine for whom the Bill is in a sense the justice they deserve. I have also heard from families of the perpetrators of crimes. They too need certainty to move on with their lives in the aftermath of these cases. These are serious crimes and we need to have serious punishment for them, but we need to be clear in that regard. For far too long we have struggled under the weight of the current parole system, which is in major need of reform. The parole system in Ireland has never been fair. It has never been transparent or something that gives everyone the sense of justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> There is a strong sense of collaboration in the Bill and that is to be welcomed because we must always seek to work together for the greater good. I want us to work hard to have this Bill enacted before the recess. It is vital, urgent and needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> The Parole Board should, as set out in the Bill, be independent and established on a statutory basis in order to ensure that release decisions taken are set out in legislation and not subject to discretion. It should be made up of those who have walked the halls in the context of these kinds of crimes, those who have seen all sides and can make effective decisions. In seeking to achieve this aim, a person serving a life sentence should not be eligible to apply for the parole process until he or she has served a minimum period of 12 years. We are seeking a punishment to fit the crime. We are saying clearly that there is no easy way out. We are also balancing the prisoner's rights in the clarification and notification of the same. Once the Bill is enacted, it should apply to anyone who makes an application for parole after enactment. That should apply irrespective of when the crime was committed. This detail is important to know. We may need to look at the timescale of the review process. I welcome the inclusion of specifying periods within which anything is required to be done, including the period within which the board shall make a determination on an application for parole. I welcome that the victims can access the information regarding parole applications. They are living with the consequences and should be informed. In reality, the average time spent in prison in the most serious cases was 18 years. For a prisoner to believe that he or she might be eligible after seven years is adding to drama on all sides. It is right that over half the sentence would elapse before the process of seeking parole would begin.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> The Bill also seeks to ensure that when imposing sentence upon a person a judge may impose a specified period during which the person should not be eligible for parole. These measures offer certainty where there has not been certainty before. It is important to emphasise that the Bill lays out with certainty that release on parole does not and will not conclude the sentence of the parolee. The possibility of revoking parole is welcome. For far too long we have heard of repeat offenders reappearing in court on further charges. The associated crimes and most serious offences should be handled with this in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> The court system has proven incredibly tough for the families of victims to navigate.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">I would like to see their rights strengthened. Allowing victims' families to be heard at parole hearings goes a long way to allowing them to have a voice and allowing families a choice under the nomination of family members section where a family member may have passed away but someone can still speak up for the victim. It gives strength and voice to the families and it is good to have a statutory framework for it. The definition of justice is fairness in protection of rights and punishment of wrongs.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> Although there were previous permissions to have any victim put his or her submissions in writing, I believe that while they have been taken seriously, those submissions were silent. To silence the families was to deny them justice. I am heartened to see the provision of oral submissions from any victim, including in this Bill. Victims of crimes are to be involved and legal representation for families affected will be made available. This creates a balance. Murder victims' families have endured life sentences and will serve them forever. There will always be a sense that someone important is missing from their lives. We cannot change that but we can minimise the drama by strengthening what we can do for them. There is a long road to go in how we treat them in the future and they need company. This is a vital Bill which society needs and deserves. I hope we can all support it to see its swift passage into law and to listen to all these voices to allow sufficient weight to be placed where it may not have been before.</p>

          <p eId="para_326">I welcome the Minister of State. I thought that I would be delighted to have the Parole Bill here but I am not delighted at all. I do not agree with Part 3 of the Bill. It addresses eligibility for parole, which has been radically altered. Section 24 is gone or is certainly unrecognisable. Certain sections of this Bill as I read it a week ago have been erased and a very serious aspect of it, judicial discretion when imposing sentence, is completely omitted. The Bill which I was referring to last week stated: "When imposing sentence upon a person, a sentencing judge may impose a specified period during which that person shall not be eligible for parole." Little did I know that beneath me, in the Lower House, this provision was being eradicated. I was not informed that it was being magicked away.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> I was led to believe that my Criminal Justice (Judicial Discretion) (Amendment) Bill 2019 would be dealt with to some degree in this Parole Bill. I did not make that up but somewhere I was led up the garden path. When I read the Parole Bill in its original form last week, it stated: "When imposing sentence upon a person, a sentencing judge may impose a specified period during which that person shall not be eligible for parole." That would lead one to believe that it went some way towards implementing my Bill. Who informed me of the change? It was the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, which submitted a lobbying document from which Senator Clifford-Lee quoted a few minutes ago. The document outlined what the IPRT agreed with in the Bill from the Lower House and what it disagreed with. It lobbied me about its amendments and informed me that my section of the Bill had been removed and that it was delighted.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> The IPRT believes that we must make communities safer and use prisons sparingly. It believes in an early prison release system and that all aspects of parole should be transparent, fair and coherent. I do not disagree with that. It campaigned for the implementation of a statutory parole system, fully independent of political control, and it got its way. It should be here, in the position of the Minister of State, because it is now taking his role. It will be responsible. We know what happens when an executive becomes responsible. The Parole Board is now responsible for everything related to release. The buck will stop with it. We all know what happens to committees and executives when they are in charge. There is no baseline accountability. I fundamentally disagree with that. The IPRT informed me that it knew what was going on. It acted like the Minister of State. It had a number of recommendations related to Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill. The Fianna Fáil Senators should note that Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill, which I thought was excellent, was radically overhauled by this Government, to my detriment. It is not the same Bill that Deputy O'Callaghan introduced. The Irish Penal Reform Trust is against mandatory sentencing and has made recommendations on it. It even recommended that people serving a mandatory life sentence be eligible for parole before the 12 years provided for in the Bill. What is this legislation achieving in reality? The Parole Board is now a Government; it is ministerial.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> Last week, 35 family members of murder victims accompanied me to the Seanad. All of these victims submitted impact statements about their lives and feelings and the intellectual and internal damage the death of a son, daughter, brother, sister or parent had caused. Everybody is worried about the victims. We are falling around with worry and compassion about the victims, yet all legislation, sociology, criminology and law is about the offender. It is rarely about the victims. The Irish Penal Reform Trust is concerned about the potential impact of victim input on parole outcomes. It states: "Where submissions by victims are permitted, the legislation should provide for what can be included." These are the people who I should be listening to, who thought it was a good idea to get rid of my section and are delighted it has been eradicated, and who believe it is right to ignore the victims of murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> This Bill in its current form states that our judicial system is one purely based on reform and certainly not any kind of punishment. I was dealing with first degree murder. That is wilful, purposeful, violent murder, nothing else. No judge is now allowed to even make suggestions for the gravest crime, that is, wilful, violent murder. I have said before that I believe in rehabilitation and change. I also believe in equality before the law. The Irish Penal Reform Trust refers throughout its summary and its subsequent lobbying, as did everybody else who read its document and thought they were on its side, to clarity, transparency and fairness. Its whole document was like a memorare prayer. Every second sentence refers to clarity, transparency and fairness. I was offering that with certainty for the families, the parents, brothers, sisters and children of people who have been violently murdered. I offered that the judge would have the facility to impose, along with mandatory sentencing. One cannot have clarity, transparency or fairness without certainty. I disagree with section 24 on which I will call for a vote. It is outrageous.</p>

          <p eId="para_331">I commend Deputy Jim O'Callaghan on his success in bringing this Bill through the Oireachtas. As a fellow member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, where we have had significant engagement on this issue, I acknowledge that Deputy O'Callaghan was very keen to progress the legislation. I was sorry to miss the debate last week on Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's Private Members' Bill, but I listened with great interest to her podcast on the subject. The points she has made today are important and relevant, and I hope there is some engagement with them on Committee Stage in respect of Part 3 of the Bill. I am not sure if such engagement is possible, but I hope it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> This important Bill is to be welcomed, notwithstanding the concerns some Members have with parts of it. During the term of the last Seanad, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, was Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which completed a significant body of work on the issue of restorative justice, including a report with recommendations and references to the models in south Dublin and north Tipperary which were working well. In addition, we had an important engagement on community courts and what they had achieved in New York city, particularly in the area of Times Square. Of course, when people commit a crime, they absolutely must be punished for it, and that punishment must be fair and proportionate. That is what society expects. However, the time inevitably comes when people are released back into society, and we have a responsibility to ensure that they are properly rehabilitated. Advocates of restorative justice practices, community courts and similar measures emphasise the importance of engaging with perpetrators to help them achieve an understanding of what they have cost their victims. I appreciate that it is a totally different situation where murder and other very serious crimes are concerned. However, in the case of less serious crime, we should always have an open mind and an eye to the future when people are trying to re-enter society. We have a responsibility to ensure that those people, once they have served their sentence, are properly rehabilitated, can gain an understanding of the damage they did to their victims and, most important, are no longer any danger to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> The Minister of State is well equipped to bring this legislation through the Houses because of the work he did in the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in the previous Oireachtas term. It was a full five-year term in which we had an extensive engagement on the issue of alternative sentencing. I hope we have an opportunity to bring as many people as possible on board on Committee Stage.</p>

        <speech by="#NiallODonnghaile" eId="spk_223">
          <from>Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_334">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. In broad terms, Sinn Féin strongly supports the proposals set out in this Bill. At the same time, I appreciate the passion with which Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell has argued her position on the issues. The Bill started well and, despite some heavy amendment on Report Stage, retains at its core that original intent. I am satisfied that the amendments introduced on Report Stage in the Dáil enhance the Bill, particularly in respect of certain definitions and circumstances set out therein. For example, where a family member who would have been the point of contact is deceased, there is now provision in the Bill to enable his or her replacement. The Dáil amendments provide greater detail to some of the provisions in the Bill, and my colleagues were happy to support them.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> A balancing of rights must be achieved and, as such, it is right that victims should have a say via a more participatory stake in the justice system and access to legal aid. This is good legislation that will make a significant difference to the operation of our justice system. There are difficult considerations to balance. As it stands, and with the prospect of potential further amendments in this House, I am confident that the Bill can achieve that balance. The system of parole currently operates at the discretion of the Minister for Justice and Equality, under advice from the Parole Board. It has been a long-standing position of the Government that the parole process should be placed on a statutory footing. It is the correct thing to do. The current system is unsatisfactory because it is not based in statute and is ultimately controlled by a politician. My intention in saying that is not to question the integrity of any individual, but this is a matter which requires independence, transparency and a statutory footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> I commend my colleague on the justice committee, Deputy O'Callaghan, on his efforts in advancing these proposals. It is difficult to get a Private Members' Bill past Second Stage in either House and harder again to bring it through several Stages. It is particularly difficult to draft such a technical and comprehensive Bill, and Deputy O'Callaghan's achievement in this regard is both commendable and valuable. I commend the Minister on his engagement with and support for these provisions. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, to encourage his Cabinet colleagues to engage in a similar way with other Opposition Bills with a view to taking them through all Stages. We could do with a bit more of that type of co-operation, and I am glad it happened in this instance. I reiterate my own and my party's support for this Bill. It took a long time to get to where we are, but the progress we are now seeing is welcome.</p>

        <speech by="#IvanaBacik" eId="spk_224">
          <from>Senator Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_337">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, to the House to introduce this important Bill in the Seanad. I am particularly pleased to welcome him given his former role as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. It was my pleasure to serve on that committee under his chairmanship, from 2011 to 2016. As Senator Conway noted, the committee produced several important reports on issues around restorative justice and community courts and also, notably, a report on penal reform in 2013 which made a number of recommendations relevant to our discussion today. I welcome the Bill, which is in keeping with my party's long-standing commitment to penal reform, as expressed by the leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin, when it was introduced as a Private Members' Bill in 2016. I join colleagues in paying tribute to Deputy O'Callaghan for bringing it forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> It is long overdue that the mechanisms for dealing with the parole process and the Parole Board itself be placed on a statutory footing. I am grateful to the Irish Penal Reform Trust for pointing out to us that the main purpose of parole is to increase community safety by providing structured, supported and supervised transition of prisoners serving long sentences back into the community. A clear, transparent and fair system of parole is in the interests of all members of society, including victims and offenders. That is very much the view that we in the justice committee took in 2013 in looking at how to adopt strategies around structured sentencing and structured release of prisoners to ensure that sufficient and adequate means of rehabilitation would be in place for prisoners serving time and that people would not be released back into the community without some type of structure in place. For a long time, that lack of structure was a point on which our prison system could be criticised. It is only in relatively recent times that we have seen a more structured approach to release, the development of a sentence management process and better legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">The previous Government undertook a good deal of penal reform but, as Deputy Howlin pointed out, there is still room for a good deal more - for example, the placing of the Prison Service on an independent statutory footing rather than its retention as simply a division of the Department of Justice and Equality. Nonetheless, I see this parole legislation as very much a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> It does not, however, go as far as we recommended in 2013, when we called for the introduction of a single piece of legislation to set out the basis for a structured release system to include changes to remission, temporary release and parole and to provide a statutory framework for an expanded community return programme. All of us on the committee were very impressed by the community return programme we saw in operation within the prisons in Ireland. We were also very impressed by the open prison system we saw in Finland when we did some research on Finnish penal policy. We argued that such legislation would underpin strategies currently used by groups working with offenders post release and potential offenders, recognising that there are some excellent NGOs doing a lot of important work on rehabilitation post release and in assisting the Prison Service within prisons. That is very important to say. All these recommendations are made with a view to increasing the likelihood of rehabilitation and decreasing the likelihood of reoffending, thereby providing a service for victims, the victims' families and the community as a whole. That is a very important context in which we debate the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> I have a procedural issue with the Bill. I raised it on the Order of Business. Although the Bill has been in the system for three years - as I said, Deputy Howlin and others spoke on Second Stage of the Bill when Deputy O'Callaghan introduced it in 2016 - we now see it being rushed through the Seanad in three days in July, during our last sitting week. This tends to happen all too frequently with justice legislation. I said this earlier. It is unfortunate because this is such an important Bill and is so long awaited, and it is a pity we did not have a longer time to debate it. Having said that, my party is fully supportive of it, as am I, and we will facilitate its rapid progress through the Seanad. We do not intend to obstruct it. I just wanted to make that procedural point, that the Bill deserves greater time for consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> I wish to make some specific points about the Bill. Again, I am grateful to both the Irish Penal Reform Trust, which gave us a very helpful submission, and Dr. Diarmuid Griffin of NUI Galway, who just last year published a paper on life imprisonment and parole called Killing Time, which is beautifully written and encapsulates a lot of the parole issues we are debating. As I said, I think all of us working on penal reform - and, I hope, victims' advocacy groups - will very much welcome the Bill for placing an existing process on a statutory footing and giving greater clarity and certainty. I listened to Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell. She is right about the need for clarity and certainty, and I was grateful to her for giving us the opportunity last week to debate life sentences in the context of her Bill. The Parole Bill, however, has an application, and will have a future application, beyond just those serving life imprisonment. Dr. Griffin reminds us: "Life sentences are rarely imposed and are exceptional as a punishment in a sentencing system [such as ours] characterised by determinacy." He gives us an interesting figure: in 2016 life sentences accounted for only 16 out of 12,163 committals to prison. We are therefore talking about a very small number of committals and a relatively small number of persons in prison. However, as Dr. Griffin states, "The ultimate penalty available in a state has a social, political and cultural significance that goes beyond its use as a sanction." Those words are very pertinent. It is very important we scrutinise the Bill in detail because, while it has an application beyond those serving life sentences, its most immediate application, as provided for, is clearly to those serving indeterminate life sentences. While persons released on parole may be released from prison, they are always subject to recall. We should remember that that is genuinely a life sentences in that sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> The Irish Penal Reform Trust points out a number of concerns it has about aspects of the Bill, and I share those concerns, in particular the increase in the period before which a person serving an indeterminate sentence is first eligible for parole from seven years currently to 12 years. I know why this provision has been put into the Bill, and again I will not oppose it, but it should be possible for those serving life sentences to be reviewed prior to the 12-year point - not that they should necessarily be released. We know that those serving life sentences serve on average 18 years so, in fact, very few if any are released after seven years. Parole decision-making is a process, however, and again, in the interests of good sentence management and structured release, it is key that persons prepare over some years for eventual release. That is in the interests of victims and their families. I am therefore not sure that the absolute 12-year cut-off is essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> There are also issues surrounding the independence of the board. Is the membership sufficiently independent of the Minister, given that the members are appointed by the Minister? I am glad to see gender balance provided for, and I know we will have more time to debate this in detail on Committee and Report Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> I will make two final points. The minimum period of eligibility for 12 years of parole review will apply equally, it seems, to that very small number of children convicted and sentenced to indeterminate sentences. Again, this might be better amended. I refer finally to the role of victims in the parole process. My colleague, Deputy Sherlock, tabled amendments in the Dáil in this regard. I am glad to see that section 41 of the Bill incorporates the right of victims to information. We know how critical that is for so many victims and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> Again, I welcome the Bill. I look forward to making more points on Committee and Report Stages and to the speedy passage of the Bill into law.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_225">
          <from>Senator Michael McDowell<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_347">I am one of the few people in the House who has never been scared of the idea that people with political accountability should in the end make far-reaching decisions about certain kinds of people who have been sentenced to prison for life. It has always surprised me that people should claim that it is wrong that somebody who is politically accountable should have the final say on such matters. This is why I believe that the idea of an advisory parole board is preferable to a board which makes parole orders itself. I have always thought that Ministers in particular are sensitive to issues of public satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the implications of sentencing policy and early release. One need only consider the well-known Lough Inagh murder case of Shaw and Evans, in which a life sentence meant very long life sentences for two offenders convicted of murder, to realise that there are certain things which can be put on the scales in determining whether or not to grant parole or to allow somebody out on licence, including in the last analysis issues such as the message that is sent out to potential offenders, particularly people coming to Ireland for the purpose of committing sexual murders and rapes. We just have to be careful we do not sweep away in this legislation powers which ought to be retained in the political sphere. It should also be said that the power of remission and commutation of any sentence is vested in the Government under the Constitution to operate through the President. Therefore, the Government has, and cannot be deprived of, an overriding role to commute or remit a sentence regardless of this legislation, and we must bear that in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> I echo what Senators Bacik and Marie-Louise O'Donnell said about rushing this through in the last days of this session. There is no rush. The Bill took a long time to get to us from the Dáil. It only passed the Dáil on 3 July of this year, and why this House should effectively turn off its critical faculties to facilitate the Bill's early passage into legislation I do not know. I do not see any reason matters would be in any sense prejudiced if we were to give ourselves a couple of months to look at this legislation to make sure that it is what we wish it to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> I wish to zero in on section 24 of the Bill. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_350">(1) Subject to this section and <i>section 6(2)</i>, the following persons shall be eligible for parole:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_351">(a) a person serving a sentence of imprisonment for life who has served at least 12 years of that sentence;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_352">(b) a person serving a sentence of imprisonment of a term equivalent to or longer than such term as is prescribed in regulations made by the Minister under <i>subsection (3)</i>, who has served at least such portion of the sentence as may be prescribed by the Minister in accordance with that subsection.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">One must look to subsection (3) to see what is the Minister's power. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_354">The Minister may, for the purposes of <i>subsection (1)(b)</i>, following consultation with the Board, by regulations prescribe—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_355">(a) a term of imprisonment of not less than 8 years, and </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_356">(b) the proportion of such a term to be served by a person prior to becoming eligible for parole.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">One of the problems with the Bill is that it is not clear from its terms whether these regulations can differentiate between offences. Is it simply intended to be 60% or 50% of the sentence regardless of the offence for which it is imposed or is it a power to make regulations intended to apply different minimum periods or proportions of sentences to different offenders? That is not made clear by subsections (3) or (4). Subsection (4)(d) provides that one of the criteria to which the Minister is supposed to have regard is "the desirability of equality of treatment with regard to eligibility for consideration for parole, insofar as is possible, between persons serving sentences of imprisonment for life and persons serving sentences of imprisonment for a determinate term, and between persons serving sentences of imprisonment for determinate terms of differing lengths".</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> I do not know what this section means and it has not been clarified. We should not be in a situation where I have five minutes to pose that question. I do not think I will get a very enlightening answer, although perhaps the Minister of State will explain exactly what the section means. It seems to me that section 24 is significantly problematic in terms of the language used in addition to the difficulties raised by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell in respect of whether it is appropriate that a sentencing judge imposing a life sentence may make a recommendation that would override the 12-year period by raising it or otherwise, which I presume is what she has in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> I will finish on that point as I only have five minutes to make a contribution, which is ludicrous. This Chamber is shaming itself again by running through legislation. Although I am not comparing myself to him, under the current rules of the House former Senator W. B. Yeats would not be allowed to make the speech in which he proclaimed "we are no petty people". Rather, he would be told to sit down after five minutes or so. I make the point, if I may, that-----</p>

Similar concerns were raised and passion displayed when the Bill went through the Dáil last week. The issues raised by Senator McDowell and other Senators will be dealt with on Committee Stage on Thursday. The subject matter of the Bill is difficult and the balancing act required is very challenging. As the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, stated, it seeks to take account of the perspectives of people who have felt the awful effects of the crimes committed by prisoners who have received a long sentence as well as those of people who believe that the worst of us deserve the opportunity to rehabilitate and, at least, the prospect of some daylight on the other side of the prison walls.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> I join Senators in commending Deputy O'Callaghan on introducing the Bill and acknowledge his spirit of co-operation in getting the Bill to this point before the House. I acknowledge the chair and members of the existing parole board and the many other State organisations and non-governmental organisations which provided their expertise and gave us much food for thought in their submissions on the Bill and parole generally. The reforms in the Bill are designed to put the operation of the parole board on an independent statutory footing and ensure that it makes its decisions in an open, transparent, fair and fully informed manner. I believe the Bill achieves that aim and I ask the House to support it.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (Deputy John Paul Phelan)<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_414">I am very pleased to bring this important Bill before the Seanad. The purpose of the Bill is to modernise the commercial rates system. Commercial rates make up approximately one third of local government current income every year and are the single largest income source for local authorities, providing income of almost €1.5 billion per annum, between 15% and 53% of total funding for local services at individual local authority level. It is critical that the Bill is enacted before the summer recess to ensure enactment of critical rates related provisions and that local authorities do not lose out on any revaluation buoyancy, to ensure rates can be applied immediately after revaluation, and to provide for alleviation and abatement schemes. The amendments are required in good time for local authority 2020 budgets in the autumn. Separately, there are a number of other important amendments to planning and residential tenancies Acts that need to be enacted before the summer. The legislation governing the levying and collection of commercial rates is spread across numerous enactments, many of which date from the 19th century. The primary legislation relating to rates is the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act 1838, so the legislation is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> The drafting of the Bill has been informed by extensive consultation with rating experts in the local government sector and the Valuation Office. We have also taken on board important feedback from local authority members and ratepayer representatives. In general, ratepayer groups have welcomed the intent of the proposals. They recognise that further improvements to rates collection levels are necessary, both to ensure that local authorities are equipped to provide services to the local community and to ensure that ratepayers are not subsidising those who do not pay. While this legislation is very important in its own right, it is also an important building block in the context of overall improvements to the valuation and rating system under way and planned. These include a review of the Valuation Tribunal, extra resources for the Valuation Office revaluation and revisions programme, and a review of exempted properties, which is ongoing. These important initiatives are being prioritised for implementation in the autumn. If necessary, there will be legislation in the autumn. Further consultation with stakeholders will take place in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> A key intention of this legislation is to encourage ratepayers to engage with their local authority more and sooner in the process. That will mean that the annual rates collection process is more effective and efficient for both parties. It is important that the relationship between local authorities and ratepayers is positive, given the critical role of commercial rates in local government and the vital role of local businesses in villages, towns, cities and rural areas. Local authorities that better understand the local business environment, and ratepayers' businesses are better equipped to design alleviation and abatement schemes and to arrange suitable and equitable payment plans. Consultation with business and the public is critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">In recognition of a challenging operating environment and to support businesses, the Department has, in recent years up to and including this year, requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting the annual rate on valuation, ARV. To their credit and notwithstanding the pressures on their own finances, local authorities have adhered to these requests. The national average ARV has not changed significantly in recent years. </p>
          <p eId="para_418"> I will now go through the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 provides for the interpretation of terms used in the Bill. Section 2 provides clarification on the local authority’s role in the adoption of the annual rate on valuation. Section 3 provides that a local authority shall consider the local authority’s budgetary needs in determining the applicable annual rate on valuation. Section 4 provides the power for local authorities to levy rates on the occupiers of relevant property, as identified in Schedule 3 to the valuation Acts 2001 to 2015. It confirms the long-standing provision that the commercial rates liability is calculated by multiplying the valuation determined by the Commissioner of Valuation by the ARV adopted by the local authority at its budget meeting. Importantly, this section also modernises the rates process in two ways. It provides for additions and amendments to the valuation list to become immediately effective for rating purposes. It also provides for the<i> pro rata</i> levying of rates where the ratepayer changes during the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> Section 5 provides for the storing and publishing, by the local authority, of the contents of the rate book in electronic format. This is a critical modernising requirement. Section 6 provides a power to limit the level of ARV that can be adopted by the local authority. Section 7 provides that local authorities may offset any rates owing to them against an amount that the local authority owes to that ratepayer. Section 8 provides that the collection of rates and interest due on unpaid rates pursuant to this Bill are under the care and management of the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> Section 9 provides that a local authority may provide a temporary abatement for vacant properties, subject to a maximum relief which may be specified by the Minister, to ensure that all property owners other than those whose rates liability would be below a <i>de minimis</i> threshold make some level of payment to the local authority and that vacant property is discouraged throughout the country. It is proposed that any revenue accruing from reductions in the vacancy refund would be added to the general municipal allocations of the municipal districts in the local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> Section 10 provides local authorities with the power to establish a database of relevant property and to delegate this function to the local government management agency as a type of shared service. Section 11 provides an obligation on the owners and occupiers of relevant properties to provide relevant information to the local authorities. Section 12 provides local authorities with the power to apply interest to unpaid rates. The provisions are based on the provisions in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which provide for the addition of interest to unpaid taxes to the Revenue Commissioners. This provision is focused on incentivising positive engagement with the local authority at the earliest possible time rather than increasing revenues. Therefore, the interest would only accrue from the 1 January of the following year where a ratepayer has refused to enter into an agreed payment plan with the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> Section 13 provides for obligations on the owners of a relevant property before the sale of that property to pay any rates and interest payable. This provision only applies to rates liabilities accrued by the owner when the owner is also the occupier of the property. Section 14 provides that any unpaid rates and any interest accruing is a charge on the property where the owner is the liable person.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> Section 15 provides for local authorities to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support specific national and local authority policy objectives. This is one of the major provisions of the Bill. This could include Realising Our Rural Potential - Action Plan for Rural Development; local economic and community plans developed by local authorities; and planning objectives set out in development plans and local area plans. The approval of schemes would be a reserved function of elected members. We are all agreed that consultation will have to be a feature of the development of these schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> Section 16 provides for the appointment of local authority staff as authorised officers by the chief executive for the purposes of the Act. Section 17 provides those authorised officers with certain power to enter relevant property in certain circumstances. Section 18 provides that the Minister may make regulations under the Bill. Section 19 is a standard provision relating to expenses in the administration of the legislation. Sections 20 and 22 are technical amendments to rates enactments on foot of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> Section 21 provides for amendments to the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015. The section includes technical amendments in respect of amendment of the effective dates for rates and the timeframes allowed to public utility undertakings and other ratepayers undergoing valuation by the Commissioner of Valuation. Importantly, the section amends section 56 of the Valuation Act in respect of the making of a rate limitation order. A rate limitation order is set for local authorities following a revaluation to ensure it is revenue neutral by setting the upper limit for rates income in the following year. This amends the rate limitation order formula to take account of rates loss in valuation of appeals. A further amendment to section 56 mitigates an unintended consequence of potential loss of income to local authorities undergoing a standard revaluation that coincides with the valuation of a new global utility. This amendment to the rate limitation order formula will ensure that any extra buoyancy from new or revised global utility valuations can be accounted for in the formula and will not be offset by rate increases by other ratepayers in that particular local authority area during the revaluation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> Section 23 provides for transitional arrangements for the Office of the Planning Regulator and the regional spatial and economic strategy. It is required to ensure that the Minister has a robust legal basis to issue a direction, if necessary, to ensure the regional spatial and economic strategy is consistent with the national planning framework or other key strategies. The proposed amendment will apply only in respect of the three current regional spatial and economic strategies that commenced prior to the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> Section 24 is a minor technical amendment to give the Cork councils an extra year to review their development plans to facilitate the significant workload and range of complex issues arising from the revisions to local government boundaries in Cork and to take account of the southern regional spatial and economic strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> Section 25 is a technical amendment to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019. The Act inserted a description into section 19 of the works that would bring about a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation that would warrant an exemption from the 4% rent increase restriction applicable in rent pressure zones. Concerns were raised that it would not be possible for works undertaken to protected structures to satisfy this description and that this could result in the loss of such units from the rental sector. In recognition of this and to encourage continued investment in this type of rental property, the first rent set under the tenancy of a protected or proposed protected structure dwelling not rented in the previous 12 months can be the market rent. Thereafter, the 4% annual rent increase ceiling will apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> Section 26 amends the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 relating to the application of the legislation to student specific accommodation, whether occupied under licence or a tenancy, and the arrangements for the commencement of annual registration for tenancies generally and for the student specific accommodation sector. This is important to close off a potential loophole before the summer rush on student accommodation to ensure tenancies are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> Section 27 provides for the repeal and revocations of various provisions of rating law to be replaced by the new provisions. Section 28 is a standard provision in respect of the title of the Bill and for the commencement of the various provisions contained in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> As well as simplifying the processes for levying and collecting rates, the Bill addresses some issues which will have a positive financial impact on local authorities, in particular the amendments to the rate limitation order ensuring that a revaluation exercise is revenue neutral rather than loss-making for a local authority and that revisions and additions to the valuation lists are immediately applicable and rateable. In addition, the provisions I have described in sections 9 and 15 relating to rates abatement and alleviation schemes further empower elected members and their local authorities to devise and achieve policy objectives through locally targeted schemes because the local elected members have local knowledge. The rates alleviation schemes will allow local authorities to make schemes to support local and national policy objectives and challenges particular to their local areas. It will allow local authorities to support specific objectives to promote community, social and economic development, urban planning or rural regeneration. Again, I envisage that the regulations will provide that such schemes can be made for specific local electoral areas or municipal districts.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> As part of this process and the local authority budget process generally, public consultation and engagement should play a central role. A specific model of consultation has been provided for regarding the local property tax and I am open to expansion of that model to encompass the wider local authority budget process. Specifically, with regard to rates, I believe there should be an ongoing engagement between local authorities, ratepayers and the community, facilitating discussion around issues such as urban planning, rural regeneration and the public realm. It also provides an opportunity for local authorities to outline the projects and services funded by rates income.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> During Report Stage in the Dáil, I accepted an amendment from Deputies in Fianna Fáil to provide for public consultation in the rates abatement scheme process and I committed to inserting an amendment along the same lines for rates alleviation schemes in the next appropriate item of legislation to be brought forward from the Department. Furthermore, section 14(5) of the Bill includes a broad regulation-making power for purposes relevant to the Bill. The Minister and I will consider whether that provision can be relied upon to ensure a public consultation such as that envisaged by this amendment can be held.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> In respect of the matter raised by local authority members concerning the rating treatment of their offices, I have made a commitment to local authority members' groups, and now want to make a clear commitment to the House, to address this issue as a matter of urgency. I recognise that it is a matter of concern to members that an office they establish and from which they serve their communities as elected representatives could be liable for commercial rates. I, therefore, commit to addressing this issue, separate from the current Bill process, so that an early resolution is found which is satisfactory for all concerned. In this regard, I will meet a delegation of local authority members on 16 July. As I pointed out earlier in my contribution, I intend to ensure, whether by primary legislation or other means of regulation, that the current review of premises that are exempt - the Schedule 3 and 4 review - will be implemented in the autumn of this year. If primary legislation is required, then so be it.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> This Bill is the first significant rates legislation to be proposed in many years and given the importance of rates income to the funding of local government, it is important to modernise the fundamentals of rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> In summary, the Bill will modernise key aspects of the legislative code to make rates and the legislative basis of rates more transparent for ratepayers and streamline the process of the making of the rate within local authorities to improve efficiency and remove some of the archaic processes that do not fit with modern administrative practices. These include the two moiety system, which is still on the books, so to speak, in local authorities. In terms of the rates book, the provision which allows for electronic rates books in future is long overdue. The Bill will also improve local authorities' suite of collection tools to enable them to build on recent improvements in rates compliance, thus ensuring the levying of rates is fairer for all ratepayers and that those who pay on time are not subsidising those who delay or seek to avoid payment. It will protect a vital source of revenue for local authorities to ensure their capacity to continue to deliver vital local services for our citizens and businesses alike.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> I thank the staff of local authorities for their input into the work supporting the development of the Bill. I also thank my staff and colleagues in the Office of the Attorney General for their hard work. This Bill will significantly improve the commercial rates regime for all concerned. I look forward to engaging with Members in the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JenniferMurnaneOConnor" eId="spk_237">
          <from>Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_438">I thank the Minister of State. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important legislation, on which I have received many submissions. I was impressed by the briefing I received from the Department. It is worth stating that much work goes into these issues and sometimes those who do the work are forgotten. Well done to the Minister of State's officials for the briefings we had with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> This legislation comes at a time when we need a comprehensive discussion on local government funding. Reductions in central government contributions have resulted in local authorities becoming ever more reliant on local businesses for their revenue. Local authorities are responsible for local economic development and commercial rates can cripple some small businesses. Rates are, therefore, a big issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> In 2019, business contributions will directly account for €1.55 billion, or 34%, of the total local government budget. That represents a 14% increase in the total value of commercial rates collected since 2010. Some €300 million in rates goes uncollected each year and only four local authorities have collection rates of more than 90%. These are Fingal County Council, Kilkenny County Council, which is the Minister of State's constituency, Roscommon County Council and Dublin City Council. A further 18 councils collected between 80% and 89% of their rates, seven collected between 70% and 79% and two collected less than 70%. Those differences are staggering.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> As it stands, this legislation does not go far enough. I and my colleagues in Fianna Fáil support the principles of the Bill and will bring forward amendments to enhance it. I will have amendments, including on councillors, ready for tomorrow's debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> The Bill should be improved by adding a further relief, staggering payment changes over a long period and increasing efficiencies in rates collection. The Government has spoken of overhauling commercial rates for years but it is only now getting around to doing it. For some businesses, these changes will come too late but if we do this right, we will be able to support businesses in our towns and counties and encourage the vibrant economies that keep this country competing globally.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> New commercial rates incentive schemes are needed to encourage regeneration, entrepreneurship and staggered investments. The Bill implements some rate relief mechanism but does nothing to enhance collection efficiency, does not provide for the staggering of payments and will not comprehensively tackle the plight of rural towns, which is an issue I raise constantly with the Minister of State, particularly in respect of Carlow.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> In the long run, the system should be reviewed by a new commission on taxation for business to ensure it is fit for purpose in the 21st century e-commerce environment. The current valuation process is leading to a dramatic shift in the rate levels businesses pay. This may be the difference between businesses staying open or going under. Fianna Fáil is proposing a number of measures to help alleviate the burden of commercial rates on businesses. I welcome the efforts in the Bill to consolidate and revise outdated elements of historical laws into a new Bill and to implement the introduction of a targeted rate and waiver schemes. I am a firm believer in waiver schemes and as a member of a local authority, I always knew how important they were.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> The current revaluation process undertaken across nine counties is leading to a major rate increase for a wide number of businesses. Dramatic increases threaten to close vulnerable businesses. We cannot have a policy of closing businesses in Ireland, especially in rural Ireland, where the issue of commercial rates is felt most keenly. That is a very important issue to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> Fianna Fáil is proposing that the level of increase to be levied on any one individual business be capped. Any increase should be allowed to be staggered at the discretion of the local authority over a five-year period. This will mean increases will be limited and spread over time and there will no longer be single large increases as is currently the case. I am sure the Minister of State has had many representations on this issue, which is significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> We need to secure balanced regional development. We propose putting a rate relief scheme on a statutory footing to allow local authorities to reduce or eliminate rates on new businesses in town centres and rural areas for two years. That is crucial. Local businesses must be consulted on the development of the new incentive schemes. It is important that the Minister of State speak with businesses because they are the generators of revenue. Local government is merely the collection mechanism for us. Businesses that convert upper floors into accommodation should also be eligible for rates relief. We will work on providing such relief in this Bill to secure this goal. We hear daily about all these issues, as does the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> Many businesses struggle with cashflow issues or short-term profitability problems. We propose putting in place a formal mechanism under which businesses would be able to appeal to local authorities to restructure debt payments on the basis of an inability to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> The Government should ensure that every local authority prevents job losses, allows for enhanced data collection and offers a choice of direct debit payments rather than two lump sum payments to help businesses cope with cashflow issues. That will save jobs, boost efficiency and help raise revenue for local services.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> The revaluation process must be scrutinised, including the cost and timelines, which are far too slow. We must provide local authorities with the tools to enhance their relationship with local businesses, thereby creating an environment in which everyone is working together. That is crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> Recently, at the Business Picnic in the arboretum in Carlow, an important event in the calendar for businesses throughout Ireland, many speakers noted that teamwork and good staff are at the heart of businesses. Importantly, they pointed out that all the big online players are setting up bricks and mortar offerings to enhance their customers' experience. Bricks and mortar offerings require staff, create jobs and bring spending into the local economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> We talk about the online shopping world undermining the real shopping world but if we all worked together on issues such as the future of commercial rates we would enhance local businesses and build the local economy, which in turn can build better communities. That has a ripple effect. However, we need to review the entire system in an era where, increasingly, shopping has shifted online because it is about achieving a balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> We need to demolish the myth that commercial rates are the only revenue raising measure in a town. This week, I asked my local authority to consider my proposal of a loyalty card for Carlow which one would load up to pay for parking. That would allow one to spend money locally and perhaps enjoy special offers but, above all, pay for parking easily and efficiently, thereby creating a flexible parking charge system that encourages short-term stays, rewards return shoppers and removes disproportionate fines. I hope my idea will be considered. The Minister of State might back my proposal for a loyalty card, which I believe should be used by all local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">I hope many ideas are considered so that we can increase our competitiveness together. We could talk about other ideas to generate new income in towns - for example, a renewed emphasis on buildings and use flexibility, a reform of urban design frameworks that utilise the archaeological framework of Irish towns, creating strong public transport links for ease of access and encouraging the diverse use of empty units by start-ups and community groups. We can also look at reforming retail planning guidelines, encouraging start-ups, inviting greater footfall on town streets and engaging in public flag projects to create safe, clean streets, ensuring that towns are inviting and are family-friendly areas at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> We need to look at providing greater access for those with a disability to our towns and cities and at generating more money in the local economy instead of sending everyone to shopping centres and large towns where the revenue is enjoyed by other citizens. We must engage with everyone. We must give businesses a say and give communities and locals a real voice in shaping the future of our towns. If we consider our towns in terms of value and providing value for money, we can encourage shopping locally because everyone will benefit. We will take Committee Stage tomorrow and I will table some amendments.</p>

          <from>Senator Victor Boyhan<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_456">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank his officials for holding meetings on this legislation, which I found very helpful. I learned more from them than I have done in many other places. I acknowledge their presence and thank them for giving us their time.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> I acknowledge also the work of Ms Niamh Larkin who was responsible for a value for money audit on the Local Government Audit Service, specifically on commercial rates and local authorities. I recommend every Member, Minister and local government to read the document. There is a section on local councils. What is it about councillors? We elect councillors to hold the executive to account. Despite what chief executives or county managers might say, there is legislation that permits elected members to ask their chief executives about the write-off of rates every year and for them to produce a schedule and a list. Indeed, the legislation also provides for them to publish the schedule of defaulters in respect of rates. Why are we not doing so? We are talking about more powers for city and county councillors but they have powers. I recommend, as mandatory reading for every person involved in local government, the report by Ms Niamh Larkin, director of audit in the Local Government Audit Service, published in December 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> In particular, I reference the section which mentions section 26 of the Local Government (Financial Procedures and Audit) Regulations 2014, SI 226 of 2014 which provides for the production of a schedule of uncollected rates, reporting thereon to the elected members of the council and the option to publish a list of defaulters rather than the authority writing them off. Ms Larkin, the director of audit in the Local Government Audit Service, states there was no evidence of the local authorities publishing the list of uncollected rates and the ratepayers concerned in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> Local councillors have powers to hold their executives to account on many issues but this is a particular one. Every chief executive must produce an executive order for write-offs. When we talk about payments, we need to look at the write-offs. Nobody, but nobody, should have a write-off that is not due to him or her. Good due diligence and auditing processes must be monitored to ensure nobody falls through the net. I am not suggesting anyone is writing them off but there need to be a good reasons, and councillors need to question them.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> I am conscious this Bill is time sensitive and I will not go into all of that, as the Minister of State said it all here. The primary objective of the Bill is to have one single consolidated rates legislation. Rates are currently payable in two halves or moieties, as we call them, in the calendar year. This legislation will replace the flexible payments, and that is to be encouraged. I welcome the proposal to establish a new database that will be operated by the Local Government Management Agency. That is positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> I acknowledge this Bill provides more powers to city and county councillors, which is a good. Under this Bill local authorities will be able to introduce rates alleviation measures to support specific issues and not just any issue, or making it up as one goes along. They will have to demonstrate that these alleviation measures are based on things like the objectives of Project Ireland 2040, local business and incentive schemes, as the Minister of State rightly pointed out, and support entrepreneurship and start-ups. All that is very positive. Local government has a mandate through its local enterprise office, LEO, operations to support enterprise, which is important. Elected members wanted that mandate and they now have it, so let them exercise that.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> The Bill seeks to encourage and stimulate economic activity through commercial rates exemptions. I understand that applicable objectives will be detailed in new regulations, which the Minister of State mentioned. Perhaps he would engage on that and bring that matter back to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government to tease it out because it is the statutory committee within the Houses that deals with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> Elected members can vary the basic local property tax rates on residential properties by plus or minus 15% but through a proper consultation process. I have suggested that if there is to be any deviation or change to rates, there must be public consultation. We have got to be very clear. We cannot advantage someone and disadvantage someone else in business. That is important and I am interested to hear more on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> The revaluation process conducted by the Valuation Office is too slow and too expensive, and lacks transparency. I am aware of an industry in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area where it was suggested the council would have lost about €2 million because there were no valuation certificates and yet the same council, which was also the planning authority, had every detailed square metre of that development because it had gone through a planning process so that is strange. This idea of having a temporary situation in place is right as we cannot lose revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> When we talk about rates, we must be honest about local government funding. We need an upfront honest debate on how we will fund local government. We can have all the local government reform we like but if we cannot put a sustainable funding mechanism in place, we are in real difficulty. I have looked at the rates bases of some of the local authorities and there is a very high reliance on retail. Should there be a downturn in retail, some of these local authorities would be in trouble.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> The Bill provides a mechanism for local authorities to issue preliminary valuation levies and commercial values, which I welcome. Each local authority will retain control. I read the transcripts of the debate in the Dáil and Fianna Fáil suggested that the Revenue Commissioners might be brought in to deal with this. I did not know whether that was a joke but I noted the Minister of State's response. I think it is best that we leave local councils to deliver because they know best the people in their communities and towns. We need an imaginative approach where we can come to reasonable arrangements when businesses are in distress and support them in paying their rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> It is time we had an ongoing debate on local government funding, but at a later date. IBEC and a number of business people made a number of recommendations, which I will quickly summarise. They suggested that we monitor the operations and powers exercised by local authorities as a result of this legislation, which is reasonable and fair. They suggested including published transparent statistics on the efficiency of collections. We have got to improve the collections but I believe elected members could do much of that by keeping pressure on their chief executives. They suggested that they implement a centralised shared model for commercial rates collection. That is something we should not write-off. If this does not work and we do not see an improvement in the collection of rates, we should revisit that at some point. They suggested that they publish draft regulations on the rates alleviation scheme, setting out the parameters. I think the Minister of State covered that.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> In essence, this is a good Bill and I will support it because it is the right thing to do. It is not perfect and needs some more tweaking. Let us get on with this and improve the rates system, which this Bill attempts to do. However, there will be a time when we will have to go back and address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> Will the Minister of State clarify the potential for, or the suggestion that, rates may be introduced for the bed and breakfast sector. I am totally against rates for the bed and breakfast sector, particularly that part of the sector associated with agritourism. It is critical that the Government is consistent about supporting rural villages, towns and communities and that we do not introduce a situation where we have commercial rates on family-run bed and breakfasts.</p>

        <speech by="#PaudieCoffey" eId="spk_239">
          <from>Senator Paudie Coffey<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_470">I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House for the Second Stage debate on very important legislation. I will comment on some of the contributions made by previous Senators.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">I agree that we should have a wider debate in this House about local government funding and the issues surrounding it. With the demand for more services for citizens and more powers for local authority members comes more responsibility in respect of raising finances, be it through the collection of commercial rates or local property tax, to improve amenities and services. We already saw the controversies that ravaged this country over the past years when water charges were introduced to try to improve water services. We saw the resistance. It is all fine to have the debates and demands for improvement of services, but we must have responsible debate and responsible proposals as to raising the finances to fund them. I certainly have experienced strong resistance where we have tried to improve services in this country through raising property taxes or water charges. If we want more services, we have to know how we are going to fund them.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> The Minister made reference to the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act of 1838. In 2013, I brought forward a Private Members' Bill to amend that Act. At that time, where a commercial property transfer was happening and rates were still outstanding, the bill for the rates did not transfer with the tenant or the person who was responsible but stayed with the property. I am glad that my Bill influenced the Local Government Reform Bill 2014 to address that anomaly. It is important that we continually evaluate and improve the system of collecting rates to reflect a modern society and the needs and demands of our local authorities and the people they serve. There is always room for improvement. Some Members outlined inconsistencies in the collection of commercial rates. In a fair system, we need a consistent method of collection of rates. I am sure that, like me, the Minister and Members have had businesses come to them complaining about the high cost of commercial rates. When people are not paying their dues in commercial rates, the charge will fall elsewhere. It is important that we have a fair and efficient system of collecting rates. This legislation is going some way to addressing that. Local authority performance is something we need to continually measure and monitor. The Minister and his officials have continuous engagement with local authorities in that respect. Where local authorities are lacking, this needs to be addressed. Commercial rates are just one significant element of the funding mechanisms for local authorities, which are needed to deliver essential services such as amenities, open spaces and public lighting. It is essential that we modernise the legislation, some of which goes back to the 19th century.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> On how the rates system works, the Valuation Office is responsible for implementing and maintaining the rating system. It is <i>quasi</i> judicial. It is independent, almost, of any political policy or interference, which needs to be recognised. A few years ago, Waterford went through the revaluation process. It can be a highly stressful time for businesses. As we know and as others are learning, there are winners and losers in the revaluation process. We always hear about the losers but we rarely hear about the winners. Some commercial properties see a hike in their commercial rates but there are many others whose rates are reduced. It has to balance out. We seldom if ever hear about the winners in those circumstances. We need a more transparent way of showing when a valuation happens to avoid controversy. It is in the best interests of public service to show how the funding is being used that is collected through commercial rates and where it is being spent within the respective local authority areas. There is room for improvement here. On local authorities selling to their ratepayers, these are the people who are funding them. Rather than just going with the hand out and collecting the money, which is their responsibility as a local authority, I believe there is a responsibility on local authorities to show ratepayers and citizens how their money is being spent. It can be done through a simple system. It is done in other jurisdictions and we should look to introduce it here in a better way. For a system to be successful, it has to be fair and equitable. I know the Bill is attempting to achieve that. It has to be transparent but it also has to be sustainable. If people are not paying, for whatever reason, it certainly will not become sustainable. It goes against the grain of good will and the good principle of people paying their rates for better services in the communities in which they do business and indeed reside.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> It is the responsibility and reserve function of local authority members to set the annual rate and valuations at their annual budgetary meetings. Often, as we all know in this House, those meetings can be a place of hot debate where priorities are set and funding is then required to meet those priorities. Sometimes this may require an increase in the commercial rates and sometimes it may not mean that. It is down to elected members to set the priorities in their respective local authorities and then set their annual rate and valuation which is used in the formula to collect money from the businesses that operate in those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> There was mention of an allowance in the legislation for a waiver scheme. That is a positive step but I would guard against its abuse. For political popularity reasons, I would be afraid that some groups in councils which I will not name might look for waivers left, right and centre. I do not think that is the intent of the provision. It is more for policy objectives within the council. For example, it might be applied in order to incentivise new businesses in an area of decline, which would be most appropriate. I would be interested to hear more detail about how we can target the provision to ensure that local authorities are using it for the correct reasons, not for political purposes to gain popularity by bringing in waivers for the sake of it but rather introducing them to target areas in decline and to stimulate economic regeneration and development. The Minister of State might be able to address that at a later stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_476"> We need consistency in revaluation through the Valuation Office. We need a balance to be struck, for example, on whether to collect rates on vacant properties. Some people feel it is unfair if the owner of the property is struggling to get a business in and the local authority is still trying to collect the rates. Others would argue that if there is not an incentive for them to get a business in, it will remain vacant. There is a bit of a stick and carrot approach and a bit of balance to be struck in that area. Some politicians have said that they wish for the local property tax to be retained in the area in which it is collected. I have a concern around that. The principle of equalisation needs to be upheld in terms of funding of local authorities. We have places like Dublin doing extremely well and creating an economic vortex where businesses are strong and financially viable. Then we have other regions where businesses are struggling and the rate collection is not as high. Weaker regions and local authorities need assistance from stronger areas. I ask the Minister of State to take that into account. We need to be careful. It is all very well to say we will change the funding in local government systems here but we need to be careful that we do not make the weak any weaker than they currently are.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FintanWarfield" eId="spk_240">
          <from>Senator Fintan Warfield<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_477">Sinn Féin will be supporting the Bill on Second Stage. While it is limited in scope, it will ensure that commercial rates are collected in a manner reflective of what small businesses are capable of paying. A formal structure for that process is welcome to local authorities and business alike, I am sure. I remember as mayor of South Dublin engaging with many businesses that struggled to pay their rates. The council always maintained that rates would never make the difference between a business surviving or not but we know it is much more of a grey area than that. I will come to that in a moment</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Commercial rates make up a third of local authority income. They can be burdensome for struggling businesses that want to be compliant. Seasonal businesses come to mind. We should do all we can to help. The alleviation scheme in particular would be of great benefit to businesses that are struggling and which might find that payment falls due at the wrong time of the year or during a disappointing quarter. They may wish to be compliant but the rigid system works against them. As Senator Murnane O'Connor mentioned, there are way too many boarded-up shops and restaurants on the main streets of our villages and towns, and even in the villages of this city. Senator Coffey was speaking about the urban-rural divide.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> I have spoken before in this House about our really cumbersome licensing system. Nightclubs and late-night venues all across the State are closing to be replaced by hotels. We need to make licensing independent of the backlogged and costly courts system through which nightclubs and late-night venues currently need to go. </p>
          <p eId="para_480"> Unpaid rates are a hindrance to local authorities. Over €300 million in unpaid rates is lost every year. This money could enhance our communities and local authority services. Many local authorities offered relief during the financial crisis for the sole purpose of saving jobs. A progressive alliance of Sinn Féin and the Labour Party did so in South Dublin County Council from 2009 onwards. Local authorities are best placed to decide on such reliefs and they should continue to do so. </p>
          <p eId="para_481"> I concur with the remarks made about the valuation system here and in the Dáil. The current system needs a good deal of change in order to be fair and transparent and to allow ratepayers to interact with and have confidence in the system. I will leave it there. Sinn Féin will be supporting the Bill. A colleague of mine will be moving a short amendment in my absence tomorrow. We hope for Government support.</p>

        <speech by="#AnthonyLawlor" eId="spk_241">
          <from>Senator Anthony Lawlor<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_482">I am sharing my time with Senator Reilly. I will not take too long. I welcome this Bill. It is innovative. I will just bring up a couple of points about it. My father was a rate collector and, at that time, rates were levied on every property. It was the property tax of the time. I always remember the two moieties. Not every business can afford to pay its rates in one go. That has to be considered sometimes. The size of the business may not allow for it. That should be included in the Bill. The two moieties should not be disregarded. They are there to help small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> I have a quick query. If someone owns a property on which I hold a long-term lease and my business goes wallop, leaving the property vacant, who pays the rates on it? According to the legislation, it would be me, but my business has gone wallop. </p>
          <p eId="para_484"> I like the idea of the power to limit annual rates evaluation. I was on Kildare County Council in the early 2000s. I always argued that rates should not increase by more than the rate of inflation, which was approximately 2%. The authority came in and said they should be increased by 10%. That adds to the costs for consumers buying products afterwards. It also contributes to inflation. I welcome the idea that the Minister will be able to use the whip on local authorities that decide to abuse commercial ratepayers. The key thing I want to say to the Minister about that is that it must be consistent across the country. It cannot be 1% in Waterford, 2% in Kilkenny, and 3% in Kildare. It must be consistent because the businessperson likes to know what is happening in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> I will speak on the various parts of the Bill later, but I will quickly mention a couple of ideas now. There are an awful lot of charity shops in my own town of Naas. Charity shops pay lower rates. Many of these charity shops are being run as commercial businesses. Their CEOs' salaries are greater than that of the Minister of State. They should be charged rates because they are taking a property that would otherwise be available to a small business. All of these charity shops make Naas look like a ghost town.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> What the Minister of State is doing will probably increase the collection of rates. Local authorities should therefore look at putting aside a rainy day fund because not all of those commercial properties will always be as successful as they are now. During the downturn local authorities came to the Central Fund with cap in hand. In the event of another such downturn, the Central Fund will also be suffering so the local authorities should establish rainy day funds to cater for times when their rates bases are diluted. I will speak on the various sections on Committee Stage. I welcome the Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_242">
          <from>Senator James Reilly<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_487">I thank Senator Lawlor for allowing me this opportunity. I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill. As we all know, rates are essential. I will raise a number of issues if I may. A public crèche does not pay any rates whereas a private crèche does. In Fingal there is a very young population, great demand on crèche spaces, and not enough crèches. Parents struggle to afford childcare. Should we consider allowing and encouraging such local authorities to offer rates holidays, starting at 0% in the first year then rising to 25%, 50% and so forth over time?</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> I welcome the provision in the Bill that allows local authorities to use the rates system to underpin Government policy. I particularly think of fast food outlets. A town in my constituency has 13 such businesses along the main street. These should face a higher rateable evaluation, particularly new facilities being opened near schools or educational facilities attended by kids. </p>
          <p eId="para_489"> I welcome the Bill's clear allocation of liability. Under the Bill a new tenant taking over from an earlier tenant will only be liable for rates from the point at which he or she takes over the tenancy, which may be in the middle of the year. That is clear and I thank the Minister of State for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> Could the Minister of State elaborate on the provisions mentioned in the Bill to make rates collection on new premises more efficient? Could we also use rates to rid our towns of the many derelict dwellings to be found on main streets? This is a real problem in some towns in north County Dublin. I know that our spokesperson, Senator Coffey, would say that Dublin is flying but, no more than any other part of the country, Dublin is not uniform in its wealth or well-being. There are some towns that are really suffering from dereliction on the main street. We need as many levers as possible to encourage people to make such premises available to those who would like to occupy them, which would result in more business and traffic in the town, rather than leaving them sitting there on a punt that they may at some time be worth a lot more money than they currently are.</p>

          <from>Senator Kevin Humphreys<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_491">The Minister of State is very welcome, as are his officials who have done a massive amount of work on this legislation. I will raise a couple of points. People have been talking about the funding of local government. Local government has been struggling with regard to funding since the abolition of domestic rates without proper provision being made for other funding. If that balance had been maintained, local authorities would receive several hundreds of millions more in funding than they currently do. The abolition of domestic rates without a proper plan to replace lost funding has greatly undermined local government. It was done as an electoral gimmick and local government has suffered as a result ever since.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> I will go through some specifics of the Bill. I did not have an opportunity to table an amendment on this issue, but I would be grateful if the Minister of State would consider it. It is about archives. I am concerned that no amendment to section 11 of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 is proposed as part of this Bill. The relevant section as currently worded refers to, "Any art gallery, museum, library, park or national monument which is normally open to the general public and which is not established or maintained for the purpose of making a private profit." This definition excludes archive services which are open to the public and not for profit.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Many archives are exempt under the current legislation as they form part of a religious body exemption under section 7 of Schedule 4, an educational institution, for example, a university, with exemption under section 10 of Schedule 4 or a national cultural institute with exemption under section 12 of Schedule 4. However, this is not the case with archives of the local authorities. The local authorities are required to collect and make available the archives of records of local government, as enshrined in section 80 of the Local Government Act 2001. At present, local government archives are required to pay rates on their premises, which puts a burden on them. I will not ask the Minister of State to respond on this today and I am sorry I did not have an opportunity to mention it before he came to the House, but perhaps he would examine this before tomorrow and possibly consider an amendment to cover it. I welcome the fact that he is meeting the local authority groups on 16 July. We also have an amendment tabled in this regard and hopefully it can resolve the issue, which I would welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> As Senator Coffey said, we must be very careful about the urban-rural divide. I believe strongly in social solidarity and that the strong should help the weak. That is correct. It is easy to say that Dublin is doing very well but Senator Reilly is quite correct. My local village is a village of charity shops. They have been suffering badly. The recovery has been positive in many ways and unemployment levels have dropped, but people are struggling as well. While businesses in the local village in Ringsend have closed and the residents have fewer services their property charges will be increased, depending on what is accepted. They are quite hefty for an inner city community and a two up, two down property. One could have a mansion in rural Ireland with the property tax that is being paid in urban Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> There are many arguments with regard to improved services and so forth and I accept some of those, but if we expect people to pay property tax to provide money that will be spent in the local area we must compare apples with apples and oranges with oranges. The maintenance of national primary routes was taken out of the central authority and put under the local authority without any compensation. In Kildare the national primary routes are supported by central taxation but they are supported by local property tax in urban areas. That is not counted. The grant levels to residents in cities, euro for euro per head of population, are less than those in rural Ireland. That must be accepted. One can go through the level of property tax and taxation raised per head of population and see that the return to people in urban areas is very low. I accept that there are costs and that one can get better value for money due to population density, but it is a little unfair of Senator Coffey to make a sweeping remark about Dublin considering what all of us have gone through.</p>

          <p eId="para_497">I have said I support equalisation, but it must be done through central taxation if we want more people to pay and buy into local property tax. We must look at people who are earning huge amounts of money and can afford to pay the taxation to afford the equalisation. People who are living in terraced houses are paying huge property tax compared to what people in Donegal, Leitrim or Waterford pay. There has to be a little fairness in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> I will support this Bill but I would welcome a proper debate, with facts and figures provided beforehand, on how we can develop proper supports for local government. Local government must be supported to provide services and it is best that there is a local property tax to pay for services and that when people pay the tax they see the services are provided. There must be social solidarity and an equalisation fund, but I believe that should be done through central taxation, not through an additional tier of taxation that is mainly imposed on residents in Dublin. I hope this Bill is passed quickly and I do not intend to delay it further. I would be grateful if the Minister of State would consider what I said overnight and if he will respond to me on it.</p>

          <from>Senator Robbie Gallagher<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_499">I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House to discuss the important issue of rates. By and large, I support the principle of the Bill but I firmly believe it is tinkering at the edges of an issue that is long past its sell-by date. There must be a root and branch review of the rate collection system for commercial property. The world has changed and, as other Members mentioned, retail business on the high street is not what it was. Online shopping and other developments have changed the traditional landscape of the high street and it is difficult to see it returning any time soon. Senators spoke about the struggles of rural towns. Unfortunately, there are many vacant units on many streets of our towns and villages. Urgent action is required to address the decline of rural towns. That is a separate debate and one we must have sooner rather than later, but it is linked to the debate we are having this evening on rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> There is also the dark cloud of Brexit hanging over all of us. I have said many times in the House that no country will be more exposed to Brexit than Ireland will be. By the same token, no part of the country is more exposed to Brexit than the rural towns located in the Border counties from Donegal to Louth. A revaluation process is taking place at present in nine counties, one of which is Monaghan. Senator Coffey spoke about the confusion of businesses in respect of the revaluation process. Many business owners are left scratching their heads when they get a letter from the Valuation Office outlining their new rate. I have encountered many such examples both in Monaghan town and in small villages such as Newbliss. In Newbliss, a lady who owns a petrol station business built a sizeable extension to the business to improve the service to her customers. She now finds that her rates bill has quadrupled. If the bill presented by the Valuation Office stands, it could result in the business closing down in that rural town and the loss of jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> As I have said previously, people in Border towns are very exposed. Business people are very afraid of what the future holds for them. Border counties always have the challenge that other counties do not have with fluctuations in sterling and so forth. The rates revaluation in Border counties should be suspended until we know what the position is with Brexit. Those counties are struggling to survive with Brexit, not to mind the struggle of trying to come to terms with a revaluation process that is resulting in sizeable increases in rates bills for many business owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> Senator Coffey made the point, and it is a good one, that many businesses do not see a correlation between the rates they pay and what they get in return. That is a big problem. In many ways, they see rates as simply another layer of taxation. They have their turnover and they go to an accountant to do up their books. The accountant will tell them they owe X amount of money to the Revenue Commissioners and they will try to pay it. On top of that, a rates bill comes through the door. They do not see a correlation between that and the services being provided. We have a job to do in terms of selling to the business community exactly what it is getting for its rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">That is a big issue, because I spoke to an accountant who had a practice in Monaghan town who was just about surviving and no more. He lived next door to two public servants, and when he did some work for them, he found that their net income at the end of the year was greater than his. Yet he had a rates bill to pay whereas they did not. They were using more water, electricity and services than he was, but he still had a bigger rates bill at the end of the year, which he could not understand. We have a job of work to do there as well as on the transparency of the evaluation process for arriving at valuations, specifically in the small rural towns and villages scattered throughout the country. That is an issue. I accept that there are good things in this Bill, which I support, but we need to have a conversation about the future rate collections attached to businesses.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PadraigOCeidigh" eId="spk_247">
          <from>Senator Pádraig Ó Céidigh<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_504">Tá fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit ag an Teach seo, agus tugaim tacaíocht don Bhille atá sé ag cur inár láthair. I support this Bill and think it is bringing us in a positive direction. A few important issues have already been mentioned by my colleagues, and I hope the Minister of State and his team take them on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> It has been noted that the rates collection process should be centralised. The local council could still carry out the administration and set the rates, but the process of collection could be more complete. The percentage of collections would be greater if it were centralised, and a number of services provided by local councils are centralised already, so it should not be too difficult to do. Another factor to be considered is the Valuation Act 2001. Some parts of that Act still need to be executed, so that needs to be looked at. This Bill refers to amendments to parts of that Act. Parts of this Bill are both interesting and important.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> I know from speaking to IBEC, the Small Firms Association, ISME, and others about this Bill, that small and medium enterprises, SMEs, are supportive of it in general. They support paying their rates and do not have a problem with that. What they have a problem with, which Senator Coffey mentioned earlier, is that some people are paying the rates and others are not. That is a big issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> Senator Coffey also raised the issue of transparency in how rates are calculated. What are the differences between one rate and another? That transparency is critically important. IBEC has suggested that there should be reasonably significant corroboration in the setting of rates and the business communities that are paying the rates, which is a good idea. Last year, the rates received from local businesses amounted to €1.55 billion, which is approximately 30% of the total budget for local government. However, that changes significantly from one area to another. For example, it is clear from the SME report I and other Senators put together that tourism is important in counties such as Donegal and Kerry, while it is not as relevant for SMEs in Dublin, so we should take those factors into consideration. If there is a recession in tourism, places like Donegal will be hit much harder than places like Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> In response to Senator Humphreys, my sense is that Senator Coffey was not talking about the divide between urban and rural areas but about something quite different. He was referring to the issues of particular businesses, regardless of whether they were urban or rural. That is my interpretation of what he said. There are challenges for both urban and rural businesses, but rates are an overall, collective issue. Paying a rates tax transcends the urban-rural divide.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> Business people want to know what happens to the money they are paying, and right now, we do not know what is happening to it. I may be wrong about this, so please correct me if that is the case, but it appears to me that local councils look at their expenditures for the year and the revenues they can expect to take in that year, and make up the balance in rates. If that is the situation, we need to change it. I could be wrong, but that is my understanding of how it works.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> As others have said, we need to have a good solid debate on the overall role of councils. Local councils should have more authority and control over their local areas, because they know those areas well. We need a full and frank debate on the future of local authorities. Local elections were held recently, and councillors receive a salary in the region of €15,000 or €16,000 a year, but they deserve much more for the work they put in. Go raibh míle maith agaibh.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Housing,_Planning_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (Deputy John Paul Phelan)<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_511">I will try to respond to the issues that have been raised. Some of my answers might be specific, and I might attribute other issues to the incorrect Senator, so I ask people to bear with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> Almost every Senator spoke in support of the basic provisions of section 15, which provides for the introduction of alleviation or waiver schemes. Senator Murnane O'Connor was the first to speak on that and much of her contribution outlined potential schemes, which I fully agree with. As someone who once served on a local authority, it always struck me that the basis of rate collection in Ireland was grossly outdated. It needed to be modernised to be more reflective of how businesses operate nowadays, and we needed proper alleviation schemes. Senator Boyhan and others also flagged the necessity for those schemes to target those deserving of alleviation.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> Senator Ó Céidigh and others correctly noted that both business groups and individual businesses sometimes feel they are paying rates while others are not, and that is one of their biggest annoyances. The first question I ask when I visit local authorities is about the rate of commercial rates collection in that area. It varies hugely from place to place, and Senator Murnane O'Connor went through some of those variations in her contribution. I agree with her that we cannot have a policy of closing businesses, and that is why we are introducing a new power for local authority members to hold public consultations and devise alleviation schemes. It was probably not necessary in the past because prior to 1977, local authorities consisted solely of ratepayers, both commercial or domestic. In recent years, however, fewer commercial ratepayers have been elected as members of local authorities. That has led to a lack of understanding on all sides, whether from the point of view of the elected representative, the business person, or the local authority official, about where the other is coming from. As Senator Ó Céidigh said, there is often a sense from business people that when there is a gap to be plugged in local authorities' budgets, a bit of horse trading about rates happens to bridge that gap.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> I agree fully with Senator Murnane O'Connor about the issue of parking fees. While local authorities have relied on them over the years, if they want to revitalise their town centres, they need to address parking fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> Senator Boyhan referred to Ms Niamh Larkin's publication of comparisons within the local authority sector. It is well worth reading and provides some interesting statistics on the levels of rate collection. The story varies somewhat between local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">During the recession, some operated what was, to all intents and purposes, an alleviation scheme of their own. A number of them have been mentioned. With businesses in their areas under severe pressure, they adopted a policy of showing greater understanding in the context of rates collection in order to ensure that businesses did not close, particularly in the teeth of those recessionary years. This had a significant knock-on effect. The contribution that commercial rates make to the running of local authority services is considerable. I agree fully with Senators' comments on the need for greater awareness and disclosure on the part of local authorities regarding where the rates moneys they collect are spent. I might return to this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> Senator Boyhan asked a "Yes" or "No" question about rates applying to the bed and breakfast sector. A review of exempted properties is under way. Currently, guest houses are exempted. Many non-owner-occupied guest houses operate as small hotels. There is a loophole. I agree with Senator Boyhan regarding family-run bed and breakfast establishments. They should not be rateable. There are those operating what are effectively small hotels, though, and those are not rateable either. Any taxation system requires not just certainty, but a level of fairness. The ongoing review is considering this and many other issues. For example, our commercial rating system does not have a facility for calculating a one-off rate for an activity in a public space. I am thinking of some of the concerts that take place in Marlay Park or the Phoenix Park. If they occurred at a venue that was subject to a valuation, however, rates would be paid. Times have changed since the 1838 Act was introduced, and we must ensure that our rates and valuation legislation reflect that.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> Senator Coffey is dead right about us never hearing about the winners in the revaluation process. I have not encountered many. The Senator also spoke about local authorities' annual budgetary process. The Irish Poor Law Act 1838 was almost religious in its undertones. It was about the landed class giving alms, as it were, to those who required upkeep in times of hardship. That is the basis of our rates legislation. The system of local government has changed since then, but the legislative basis on which rates operate has not.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> The Senator asked me to address section 15. Its central thesis is that the waiver or alleviation scheme must be based on and linked directly to objectives in a plan, be it a local area plan, a county development plan or the national planning framework, Project Ireland 2040. It cannot just be decided on the whim of individual local authority members. Rather, the scheme must have a policy basis if it is to enter into practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> Regarding Senator Warfield's comments, the Bill is limited in one sense. In another, however, it is the first substantial overhaul of how we collect our commercial rates that we have had in many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> Senator Lawlor referred to how the two moieties were a good thing. As proposed, the Bill's provisions will allow for payment plans. Such plans exist in other areas of business. This will allow businesses to negotiate a process with local authorities in order to ensure that payments can be made at a time when, in the formers' view, they are in the best position to pay commercial rates. The Senator also stated that charity shops pay no commercial rates, but that is not true. The back office part of the shop is not rateable, but there is no exemption under legislation for their commercial elements. That is not to say that individual local authorities do not have different ways of treating charity shops, though.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> Senator Reilly spoke about the difference between publicly-funded crèches and private ones. The alleviation scheme to be devised by each local authority can take that matter into account. The Senator raised a point about fast food outlets as well. If that is a policy objective of a county development plan or local area plan, there is no reason for there not to be different rate provisions for those types of business. The Senator also spoke about derelict dwellings. There are major variations in commercial rates between local authorities. Some, like Louth, have active groups of officials who ensure that CPOs on derelict dwellings are pursued as a matter of course. It is for each local authority to do. As a member of a local authority 20 years ago, I remember getting it to purchase two dwellings that had long been derelict on the main street of a village. They were used to house two families on the local authority's housing waiting list.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> Senator Humphreys asked about archives. I will not be able to table an amendment tomorrow, but I have communicated with the archivists and the group in question. The ongoing Schedule 4 review, which is chaired by an official from my Department, is considering what types of building are exempt. I agree with what the archivists are seeking, as those operations - I will not us the word "businesses" - should not have valuations. This is why, when speaking about the Schedule 4 review, I stated that if primary legislation and changes on valuations were needed in the autumn, we would get them.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> The Bill is time sensitive because there is potential for a number of local authorities to miss out in the next budgetary year on substantial revenues if some of the changes proposed in respect of utility reviews are not adopted. That is why I am not in a position to accept amendments. However, I can certainly take their spirit on board. If necessary, we will have the facility later this year to evaluate. Rates legislation and valuation legislation are essentially two sides of the same coin.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> Senator Gallagher mentioned a filling station in his constituency. Several representations have been made to me recently in respect of the valuations on petrol forecourts and other operations. As Senator Coffey outlined, the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of duties under the 2001 Act. The fuel retail sector is involved in ongoing consultation and engagement with the Valuation Office regarding the revaluation methodology for service stations in the context of the national revaluation programme. The Irish Petrol Retailers Association made two submissions to the Valuation Office in January and June and met the office on Monday, 10 June. A follow-up meeting is planned for July. This relates specifically to petrol forecourts. I share the view of most Senators that the lone petrol station in a rural village that acts as a one-stop shop - it is the local shop as well as the forecourt - is a different type of operation than the larger forecourts that exist on our national primary routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> In the context of the discussion with the petrol retailers group, the Commissioner of Valuation has said that if inconsistencies are thrown up and if information can be provided by retailers to show overvaluation, then he is prepared to look positively at reductions in those valuations.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> Like others, Senator Ó Céidigh asked for a debate on local authority funding. I would welcome that very much once we have returned in the fall of the year. To varying extents local authorities depend highly on commercial rates but there are other sources of funding too. Local authorities must be able to avail of new sources of funding in future to fund the vital services they provide. The Senator spoke about transparency in how rates are collected. My Department is investigating the current provisions relating to the publication of the schedule of uncollected rates by local authorities. Senator Boyhan made this point as well. While bearing in mind the risk of sullying the relationship between local authorities and ratepayers, especially those ratepayers in payment plans engaging with local authorities, and in consideration of general data protection issues, officials are examining the provisions around publication of a schedule of non-payers and whether amendment is needed in updated local authority financial and audit regulations. The same applies in respect of transparency in how money collected from commercial rates is disbursed by local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> I think I have more or less answered all the questions. Senator Lawlor asked who was liable for commercial rates when a building is vacant. It is the owner. The occupier will be liable only for the portion of the year that he is in occupation of the building. The moieties are gone. The Bill allows for more flexible payment schemes. As I have said, charity shops are not exempt from commercial rates as things stand.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Deputy Paul Kehoe)<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_532">I am thankful for the opportunity to appear before the House this evening to discuss matters of the Defence Forces with Members. I had requested some time to discuss the Public Service Pay Commission report of recruitment and retention in the Permanent Defence Force following its publication last week. I will comment on the main aspects of the report and outline the ongoing efforts to address the current recruitment and retention challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> I very much welcome the report from the independent Public Service Pay Commission and it has been accepted by Government. The members of the commission, ably led by Kevin Duffy, have vast experience in the area of human resources and industrial relations. I thank them for the expertise and commitment they brought to this task.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> The report contains a number of recommendations, including an increase of 10% in the military service allowance. This will boost the earnings of the majority of Defence Forces personnel by between €602 and €675 per annum. Another recommendation is the full restoration to pre-Haddington Road levels of the security duty allowance and patrol duty allowance. By way of example, a 10% increase in patrol duty allowance equates to around €5 per patrol day. Other recommendations include a doubling of the premium rates for certain weekend duties and the reversal of the 10% cut in the overseas allowance. For a typical six-month deployment overseas this is worth an additional €1,400 tax free for enlisted personnel and between €1,700 and €1,850 tax-free for officers. A recommendation regarding the reintroduction of the retention loyalty bonus for Air Corps pilots is especially welcome in light of the retention problems facing that element of the Defence Forces. This will see significant increases to earnings for eligible flying officers. The estimated cost on a full basis of all these measures is approximately €10 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> The report also contains a range of recommendations aimed at improving workforce planning, recruitment and conditions of service. There is also a recommendation that further progress be made on the review of technical pay grades 2 to 6, without compromising the stability of the Public Service Stability Agreement. The report has been presented to the Permanent Defence Force representative associations. The recommended increases in allowances will be implemented on confirmation of acceptance of the measures by their members.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> A high-level implementation plan drafted with inputs from the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of An Taoiseach has been approved. Work will commence on the actions in this plan immediately. The plan will be implemented in two phases. This first phase focuses on implementing the recommendations in the report of the Public Service Pay Commission. The second phase will examine core pay in the Permanent Defence Force within the context of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2018 and future public sector pay negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> Several outstanding adjudication findings across the public service could not be implemented having regard to the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Acts. I have had discussions on the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe. With his agreement, it is intended to prioritise the outstanding adjudications in respect of the Defence Forces and pay on a non-retrospective basis from 1 July 2019. Several effects will result from these measures. The Army Ranger Wing allowance will increase by approximately €50 to €200 per week. Cooks with the relevant qualifications will go from technical pay grade 2 to technical pay grade 3, which is an increase from €26.90 bringing it up to €40.42 per week. Those account holders currently not in receipt of the account holder allowance will each receive the allowance of €65.80 per week. Recruits and apprentices will no longer be charged for rations and accommodation. The current charge €43.63 per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> As Senators are aware, the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, has initiated legal action regarding these adjudications. My officials will be discussing these matters further with PDFORRA before the payments are implemented. The increase in the allowances comes on top of the increases to core pay being applied to members of the Defence Forces in accordance with national pay agreements. The restoration of payscales and the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation are being done in an affordable and sustainable manner. The focus of these measures is weighted in favour of those on lower pay. The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement. This will see restoration of public service payscales to pre-FEMPI levels for all those earning under €70,000 by the end of 2020. The restoration of the 5% reduction to allowances cut under FEMPI is scheduled to be restored as part of that agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Voted expenditure for Defence - Vote 35: Army Pensions and Vote 36: Defence - in 2019 provides for gross expenditure of just over €1 billion, an increase of €60 million on 2018 expenditure. The overall 2019 provision for pay in Vote 36 provides for full funding for the pay of a target strength of 9,500 Permanent Defence Force, PDF, personnel, as set out in the White Paper on Defence. </p>
          <p eId="para_540"> Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel. The Public Service Pay Commission identified significant retention issues in the PDF. The PDF comprises highly trained, skilled and well motivated individuals who inevitably will be sought after and attracted to civilian employment, especially in a buoyant labour market. The loss of key personnel places additional pressure on, and limits the capacity of, the PDF in undertaking the crucial role that it performs in service to the State. The high level implementation plan includes a commitment to initiate a review of current retention strategies taking into account the individual needs of each service and minority group members. This will build on existing work and be consolidated into the ongoing programme of HR development within the Defence Forces, part of which is aimed at ensuring that there is an appropriate work-life balance, career development opportunities and educational supports. The Government is committed to ensuring that the provisions of the working time directive are applied to the Defence Forces. The Department of Defence civil and military personnel are in discussions with the Permanent Defence Force representative associations regarding the application of the directive in the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> The Permanent Defence Force continues to offer excellent career opportunities for serving personnel and for new entrants. There are ongoing opportunities to undertake career development courses and the Defence Forces have made significant inroads in ensuring that major courses acquire external accreditation. There are significant opportunities for career progression and development within the Defence Forces and there were over 800 promotions in the PDF in 2018. Each promotion brings extra responsibility but also brings a pay rise. Earlier this year, 24 enlisted personnel completed a potential officers course and were commissioned as officers for the first time in over 12 years. Under my direction, further potential officers courses will be undertaken in 2021 and 2024.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> The Defence Forces actively encourage and support personnel to undertake further education and training as well as to participate in physical development and sport. Members of the Defence Forces also have opportunities for diverse service, including opportunities to serve overseas. Members of the Defence Forces have full access to Defence Forces medical officers or contracted medical services. In addition, members of the Permanent Defence Force do not pay statutory public hospital charges for attendance at accident and emergency services and in patient admittance. Furthermore, commissioned officers may be referred for outpatient and inpatient treatment through private or semi-private care in civilian hospitals or private consultants' rooms, where it is deemed necessary. The provision of this range of benefits is unique in the public and indeed the private sectors and, due to changes in the Finance Act 2019, these benefits are not subject to benefit-in-kind taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> These are just some examples of the attractiveness of a career in the Defence Forces. While we acknowledge that there are retention issues, there are many in the Defence Forces who choose to stay and indeed want to continue to serve and further their career. In this regard, PDFORRA is seeking for the extension of contracts of enlisted personnel. RACO is looking for all officers to be allowed serve until at least age 63. The high level implementation plan provides for consideration of options to tackle barriers to extended participation in the PDF, including the possibility of extending retirement ages for members. </p>
          <p eId="para_544"> There is ongoing recruitment at both enlisted and officer ranks. In an effort to continually improve the recruitment process, a new recruitment model has been instigated which allows candidates to apply for general service recruitment on a continuous basis throughout the year. This new approach, aimed at both Army and Naval Service general service recruits, will maximise the Defence Forces training capacity, and will facilitate those making career decisions at any time of the year. The 2019 competition for cadetships in the Defence Forces was launched in April of this year and the assessment process for applicants, including interviews, is under way. An aircraft apprentice technician competition was launched earlier this month. There is direct entry provision for those with professional qualifications, which is utilised for the recruitment of medical officers and engineers. A working group has been established to examine the scope for greater use of such direct entry recruitment for certain specialist positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> In addition to traditional recruitment, a range of alternative recruitment approaches are being developed, aimed at addressing vacancies in specialist areas. A scheme has been introduced which permits former officers with specialist skills to re-enter the Permanent Defence Force and arrangements are in train to provide a similar scheme for former enlisted personnel. The Public Service Pay Commission has recommended that recruitment methods should be further reviewed and I look forward to the inputs of external expertise in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> There are no quick fixes to the current challenges and difficulties facing the Defence Forces, which are also being experienced by other military organisations internationally. The recommendations in the report will be quickly actioned, with increases in allowances implemented following confirmation of acceptance by the Permanent Defence Force representative associations. </p>
          <p eId="para_547"> Before I conclude, I want to discuss the issue regarding the Naval Service. I and the Government have acknowledged the staffing and personnel issues that currently impact on the Naval Service operations. The Naval Service fleet is managed in such a way as to ensure maximum availability to meet operational requirements. Last Friday, I received a full briefing from military management including senior Naval Service personnel about the ongoing issues in the Naval Service, including the movement of personnel from ships undertaking maintenance periods. This is a prudent step to take and I was told at the briefing that it has been reconfirmed since by the Defence Forces that the <i>LÉ Eithne </i>and the <i>LÉ Orla</i> are in dock for planned maintenance and repair. This includes a period of dry dock. By placing both ships in an operational reserve capacity, the flag officer has given the Naval Service the ability to move personnel from these vessels to other ships. At no stage did I or the Government ever deny the staffing issues in the Naval Service. These issues are being addressed as a priority. Two vessels, the <i>LÉ Eithne </i>and the <i>LÉ Orla</i>, are docked for planned maintenance. This position was once again confirmed by the Defence Forces last night. A meeting of the joint civil and military team will take place this week to review the issues at hand and plan ahead for the autumn to ensure that we maximise operational outputs. This review will include consideration of a number of operational ships. As we deal with these issues, the safety of serving personnel must be the number one priority. I expect that a full range of options will be considered and it is clear that difficult decisions will have to be made. I am happy to explain the current status of the naval fleet. The <i>LÉ Róisín </i>is going through a mid-life refit, while the <i>LÉ Eithne </i>and the <i>LÉ Orla</i> are going through planned maintenance and their crews will be deployed pending the return to service of both vessels. This will be kept under constant review. The three ships will be held in operational reserve or in maintenance. The remaining six vessels are fully operational. I reiterate that I and the Government are fully mindful of the staffing and personnel issues that are facing the Naval Service. That is why I have directed my officials and military management and senior naval officers to meet on Friday to fully explore all options to address the challenge in the Naval Service. My focus is on returning the Naval Service to full capacity as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> I wish to conclude by thanking the civil and military staff of the Department of Defence who provided the data and material required by the Public Service Pay Commission to assist in its analysis. I also want to thank RACO and PDFORRA for their input in the form of written and oral submissions to the commission. The Secretary General and Chief of Staff also had the opportunity to make oral submissions to the commission. I will continue to work closely with the Secretary General of the Department of Defence and the Chief of Staff to ensure the full implementation of the high level plan and deliver solutions that address the current difficulties facing the Defence Forces.</p>

          <p eId="para_553">I welcome the Minister of State and am grateful to Members for facilitating me. I do not intend to speak for long. This comes in the overall context of what could be classed as wasted recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">When one hears the Taoiseach, who is the actual Minister for Defence, taking every opportunity at Fine Gael events to announce his intention to cut taxes to the tune of €3 billion or so - €600 million a year over the coming years - while the best our Defence Forces can get is €10 million, it really sticks in the craw. We are proud of our Defence Forces and our military personnel. We know what they do; they protect people and save lives. We are all proud to see the work they do across the world. Having served in government with Fine Gael, it is remarkable to hear members of that party bellyaching about allowances. Those individuals completely misunderstand the nature of public service. When we went into government together, we had a five-a-side a club which included the current Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. He railed against things such as allowances in the public service. Fine Gael is aided and abetted by people in the media who belittle the type of arrangements in place in the public service for people who do difficult work. The idea was to get rid of all of these allowances because they make no sense. What the Minister of State has done here is a classic "Bertieism". He has gone back to the idea of allowances rather than core pay in order to fix an immediate problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> A sentence in the Minister of State's script jumped out at me, namely, "Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel." There is a high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel because the pay is so poor. The suggestion is that it is down to the unique and demanding nature of military life and that if the pay was better, the issue of retention would not be as great. This is a plaster over a very serious issue in respect of which people contact us all the time. They cannot do it themselves. We have to accept that this is the reason they do not get fair play. They cannot do it themselves because they are not entitled to unionise. As a result, their partners and spouses make contact with us, often in an emotional state, and ask us to do something to restore pay and provide decent wages. Those who contact me are generally, though not always, speaking for their husbands. They want the recovery that is spoken about to be brought into their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> The Minister of State has found a sticking plaster to cover his immediate problem. In the context of the €600 million his Government is willing to throw at those who earn higher incomes over each of the next three years, this really does stick in the craw. This attack on public service and public servants over a long period by people in the Minister of State's party, aided and abetted by people in the media, has to stop. He is using this complete misunderstanding of allowances and what they are for to get himself out of this particular hole. This issue comes down to pay, conditions, and decency and dignity at work. It is not good enough to stand shoulder to shoulder in saying how proud we are of our Defence Forces and military personnel if we are not willing to pay them. We all know the reason they do not get fair play is that they do not have the capacity to raise their own voices in trade union negotiations. I expect these measures to be accepted in the short term but it is absolutely no substitute for the restoration of pay as a proper and dignified recognition of the worth of the work of the brave men and women who wear our colours all over the world.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GerardPCraughwell" eId="spk_258">
          <from>Senator Gerard P. Craughwell<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_557">The Minister of State is welcome to the House, although it is regrettable that the Minister for Defence. I am, of course, referring to the Taoiseach. As a Minister for State, Deputy Kehoe does not have full power. The Minister who does have full power, the Taoiseach, does not know enough about the Naval Service to even know how many ships we have or the number of them available for operational service.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> I am deeply concerned that no one in the Government or the Department of Defence really understands the importance of a well-resourced and well-managed cybersecurity monitoring system under the defence or security services. This Government's cavalier attitude to this most important aspect of securing foreign direct investment will eventually cost our economy dearly. Is the Minister of State aware of the concerns of many of the multinationals operating in Ireland regarding the apparent lack of a clear retention and training strategy for cybersecurity experts in our Defence Forces? What is the plan? How will the brain drain be halted? An allowance of 96 cent per day will not do much to stop it. The internal Defence Forces computer incident response team, CIRT, was shut down a few months ago because the last person in this office purchased his discharge. We are now allocating up to €40,000 per month for a private contractor to provide the service if and when required. To say that this is very unsatisfactory would be a complete understatement. What does it say about our defence strategy that we now have a civilian company with eyes on military-grade communications and intelligence? I understand the Defence Forces are meant to provide two cybersecurity personnel to the interdepartmental, multi-agency, National Cyber Security Centre led by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. Needless to say, these two seats are empty. We have no spare personnel and no strategy to find them.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> With regard to the Naval Service, will the Minister of State agree that we actually own nine ships? I hope he will. I hope he will further agree that only three of those ships are fully operational, rather than the six he mentioned. Two of the ships are not operational on a full-time basis because we do not have engine room artificer, ERA, personnel to look after them. I refer to P61 and P62. Will the Minister of State accept that while P31, <i>LÉ Eithne</i>, and P41, <i>LÉ Orla</i>, are, as he stated, in for maintenance, this maintenance was not scheduled? Will he agree that, when that maintenance is completed, neither ship will be returned to the fleet in an operational capacity for the foreseeable future because of the shortage of personnel?</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> I now turn to the issue of Naval Service divers. There have been a number of tragedies off the coast of Ireland resulting in the need for deep-sea divers. The Naval Service's divers are trained to dive up to 60 m with mixed gases. As I understand it, they are the only professionals in the country who can provide that service. This was extremely important when Rescue 116 went down. The complement of navy divers should number 27 personnel. Will the Minister of State confirm that there are now only six qualified navy divers available?</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> With respect to the Air Corps, there is a reported pilot shortage of 30% but if senior officers are not included as flying that deficiency rises to 50%. Medical emergency flights, which used to be carried out by the Air Corps, are now contracted out at a cost of €7 million over two years. What would that €7 million have done for the Air Corps? What would it have done for pilot retention? Is this not a gross mismanagement of the system? We now have a plane on stand-by every night. Over the past nine months, it has only been used three times.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> With respect to aircraft maintenance, AW139 helicopters and PC-9 aircraft are being sent to Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and the UK for maintenance. How much does this cost? Could that money have been used to retain military personnel in technical areas? </p>
          <p eId="para_563"> In the context of the Army, situations have arisen in the not-too-distant past in which young officers straight out of the Curragh found themselves in command of three platoons. In one instance, a battalion was managed by three captains and one lieutenant. We have a shortage of explosive ordinance disposal, EOD, specialists. This is probably the most unfriendly place to work from a family perspective. </p>
          <p eId="para_564"> The Minister of State spoke about medical care a few moments ago. Is it not the case that a senior officer reported on radio recently that he funded scans for a private soldier out of his own pocket because the Defence Forces do not have access to such scans? We are cutting allowances for injured personnel. If personnel in the Army Ranger Wing, whose job is particularly physical, are injured, they lose their allowances after 28 days. We continue to fight cases relating to Lariam in the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">What do we do at the end of the day with most of these things? We settle them. The Minister of State referred to the working time Act in his speech. We are dragging PDFORRA to the gates of the courts and we then settle the cases. What is that costing? How much are we paying for legal advice when we know this has to be resolved, one way or the other? What is the establishment? The Minister of State talks about the €10.1 million that was provided by the Public Service Pay Commission and, indeed, I compliment the chairman on his work, given the constraints he was working under. Does that €10.1 million apply to the 9,500 we are supposed to have or to the 8,300-odd we currently have?</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> The Minister of State mentioned overseas service. Surely the United Nations pays for overseas service and it is not coming out of the Exchequer. We cannot include that in any public service pay agreement. With respect to the allowances for duties and patrols, these allowances do not even meet the minimum wage. We are talking about soldiers, sailors and airmen who are on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In fact, when we boil it all down, the actual increase in pay is 96 cent a day for a private soldier with less than three years service and €1.30 for a captain, hardly something we should be shouting from the hilltops about.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> Some time ago, I objected to the appointment of an assistant secretary general for people in the Department. The Minister of State fought his case in the House and it was accepted, by and large, for the Department. I am hearing that nobody has ever met the assistant secretary general for people. I understand he has not visited any installation or any barracks. Now that there is a story to be told with respect to pay and conditions, is the person in charge of personnel going to go out and meet soldiers, sailors and Air Corps people on the ground, explain to them how the Public Service Pay Commission arrived at its figures and explain to them how it will make a difference to their lives?</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> It was appalling in the last few days to hear the Taoiseach referring to our seven ships when we have nine. It is appalling to hear that the Naval Service is at 88%. The question is: 88% of what? When we take out the people who are non-seagoing and those on long-term sick leave, we are probably somewhere between 65% and 70%, in truth. When it comes to the <i>LÉ Orla</i> and <i>LÉ Eithne</i> being stepped down for maintenance, ordinarily in the Naval Service this time would be used for planned leave, training courses and so on. However, for the two ships that have been stepped down, the <i>LÉ Orla</i> and <i>LÉ Eithne</i>, the crews will be allocated to other ships in order to see those other ships at the establishment level.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> Where we have arrived at is no great achievement. We are in a total mess and I do not know how we are going to get out of it. The spiral is downwards.</p>

          <from>Senator Gabrielle McFadden<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_570">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. When I was speaking about Defence Forces pay and conditions last week, we did not have the full detail of the recommendations of the Public Service Pay Commission. Now that we do, I believe that much of what myself and Senator Craughwell said last week is still relevant. I understand that some colleagues in the House are referring to myself and Senator Craughwell as a duo who only know one tune. However, I have an enormous grá for Óglaigh na hÉireann and I will continue, as best as I can, to campaign for them. Whether it is aid to the civil power, security duties, counter-terrorism, support for An Garda Síochána, rescuing refugees, engaging in ceremonial duties or supporting communities in time of need or, indeed, in peacekeeping overseas, the brave men and women of Óglaigh na hÉireann provide a service that is vital to us all, and they deserve to be properly treated.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> In previous contributions, I have raised issues regarding delays in promotions, long distances to travel for those affected by brigade rearrangement, pension entitlements, obligatory discharge ages, treatment for those suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder, implementation of the adjudicator’s findings for post-1994 soldiers and other issues, all of which are having a negative effect on morale within the Defence Forces. However, the issue which has consistently been raised is that of pay. Last week’s report does not, by any stretch of the imagination, solve all the problems. Having said that, it would be meant-spirited not to welcome the fact that progress has been made. In particular, I welcome the increase in the military service allowance, the restoration of all allowances cut in 2013 as part of the Haddington Road agreement and the restoration of premium weekend rates. Defence Forces personnel have always been heavily reliant upon allowances and I know from talking to members that this cut was particularly hard felt. Concentrating available resources first on increasing allowances rather than giving percentage increases to basic pay was wise, and is proportionately of most benefit to the enlisted members. At the PDFORRA annual conference in Castlebar last year, its general secretary, Ger Guinan, asked for exactly this. I am glad the Government has listened to his call.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> I acknowledge that many sectors of the Defence Forces are currently running below their establishment figure. In particular, as has been said, we are having problems in the Naval Service and in regard to holding on to pilots and others with specialist skills in areas such as bomb disposal, operational command, marine and electrical engineering, medicine and IT. That is why I welcome the loyalty bonuses being put in place, the review of pay for those with specialist or technical skills and consideration of incentives for long service. However, I also believe we need to ensure that we do more for enlisted members and recruits. I believe that nobody wearing an Irish uniform should earn less than the living wage. I call on the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, once the current measures have been accepted and implemented, to make this their next priority. Nobody wearing an Irish uniform should have to rely on working family payments. That said, I am keen to ensure that none of the 90 or so military families currently in receipt of this allowance will lose out on this as a result of the increases announced last week. I have spoken with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and asked her to consider this issue for me. She has agreed to look at it and to come up with a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> The elements of this package are things for which I and others have been calling for a long time and, therefore, I welcome them. I know they are not everything that Defence Forces members had hoped for, but I would urge them to accept this much for now and work with the Government to make further improvements. In return, I would call on the Government to take the next steps in a matter of weeks, as soon as acceptance is confirmed, rather than letting it drag on into next year. Last week’s report should not be the end of the process but, rather, the first step of the next section - perhaps a smaller step than many of us wanted but a welcome step nevertheless.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> Defence is the ultimate guarantee of freedom. If we truly value freedom, then we must ensure that military service is an attractive career option for men and women. We must give them a reason to stay. With just three years to go to the centenary of the establishment, by our predecessors, of the National Army in 1922, we must put in place the structures and the funding necessary to ensure that the members of Óglaigh na hÉireann are motivated and resourced and can start into their second century ready to meet the needs of a changing Ireland.</p>

        <speech by="#NiallODonnghaile" eId="spk_260">
          <from>Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_575">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. The issues facing the Defence Forces are very serious and long overdue to be resolved satisfactorily for the men and women who serve in them. It is clear from the recent report by the Public Service Pay Commission that the Defence Forces will have to wait - for how long, no one knows - for the issue of core pay and allowances to be comprehensively and satisfactorily resolved. Indeed, the commission stated that its remit prohibited it from considering the issue of core pay. Why was this allowed to happen? Why is the Government dithering at a time when it needs to be responding urgently?</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> As a consequence of the failure by the Government to respond to the long-standing issues affecting personnel, the Defence Forces are haemorrhaging staff in significant numbers. Much of the issue centres on the fact that the Defence Forces have little or no collective bargaining and, currently, they are prohibited from joining or affiliating with a trade union and cannot strike.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Sinn Féin has proposed legislation that would provide for the collective bargaining rights of the Defence Forces personnel and gardaí. The European Committee on Social Rights upheld a case taken by PDFORRA, which is representative of ordinary rank-and-file membership, for greater collective bargaining rights for Defence Forces members. It also stated that the prohibition against strike action was proportionate. There is something in that for the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> The Government’s recent response falls short of what Sinn Féin has called for and I note that PDFORRA has asked for clarity on when it will it have collective bargaining rights. It is not good enough for the Government to say that it will look at the Defence Forces being affiliated to ICTU. This falls far short of what is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> There is more evidence of dithering by the Government when it comes to ending the use of Lariam for personnel. Despite the fact that the Dáil passed a motion two years ago calling for it not to be used, we find that those Defence Forces personnel on an EU training mission in Mali are being issued with it. It is completely unacceptable that the health and well-being of the Defence Forces is treated in this offhand manner. It is interesting, however, that there appears to be lots of energy and action when it comes to risking the neutrality of the State and tiptoeing into an EU army. How else are we to understand the decision by the Dáil, which Sinn Féin opposed, when it agreed that the Defence Forces should participate in a German-led battle group? I remind the Government of what its former Minister for Defence, Deputy Seán Barrett, said at the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence earlier this year:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_580">I ask that we revert back to what we were the best at, namely, peacekeeping ... Battle groups are not peacekeepers ... Since when do peacekeepers become involved in battle groups? With the greatest respect, we are losing our way here.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AliceMaryHiggins" eId="spk_261">
          <from>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_581">I will just briefly touch on the issue of pay and conditions because other Members have spoken very eloquently about them. It is clear from the response of PDFORRA and it is clear from the testimony and messages people have been getting, that the Government intervention will not be adequate in the context of allowances. The core issue remains about time, about wages and about having the hours worked valued and recognised. This is why the working time directive is imperative. It is one of the key aspects to this. That should not be a battle people have to fight. It should be something the State moves forward on.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> These are persons who are constrained. How we constrain people in collective organisations in the expression of perspectives needs to continue to be examined. There are a number of very good persons who are committed to public service but who should also, perhaps, be supported in making sure they are able to speak up on issues such as the minimum wage, on what is considered to be adequate, and on the relationship between pay and working family payments. Those perspectives need to be heard and they should not be pushed to crisis point to be heard. I put it to the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, to move on while building on the recommendations. We now need to go further and accelerate action.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> I will now focus on some other issues that are also defence matters. Even as front-line pay and conditions have been allowed to deteriorate to a point of crisis for many families, Ireland still has plans for very substantial increases in military spending that are not linked to pay and conditions. There is a proposal to move over the next few years to €125 million in capital expenditure. Perhaps most crucially, at a European level Ireland is contributing to a massive increase in European spending. Again, this is not focused on pay and conditions. It is largely focused on capital spending and research. We are looking at €13 billion committed currently to the European Defence Fund at a time when the Cohesion Fund and the European Social Fund, ESF, are being cut and reduced. Will the Minister of State specifically comment on Ireland's perspective on this issue? Does Ireland believe that investment in social cohesion may do more for peace and maybe more for our collective European project and the wider project? Do we think it appropriate that we would reduce social and cohesion funding to increase defence and military spending?</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> I am very concerned that the European Parliament voted not to have oversight of the €13 billion and has relegated this function to the European Council. This was something the Minister of State's party members voted for. Will the Minister of State comment on the mechanisms of oversight? How can the Irish public be assured that moneys given through the European Defence Fund will not be used for autonomous weaponry? How can the public be assured that funding given by us through the EU budget and through the European Defence Fund will not be used in the breaching of human rights or used outside the UN mandate? I believe, however, that we know it will be used outside the UN mandate in some cases. What is the assurance and testimony in this regard? This is important. These are not abstract concepts. When weaponry is developed, and there has been a focus on autonomous weaponry, it is designed to kill. It involves lives. The public, as a neutral nation, deserves the clearest transparency around how our moneys are used and the clearest chain. I would like the Minister of State to illustrate how he intends to deliver that.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> We already have serious concerns around certain parts of our funding that have been rerouted. We have spoken in the past about the Libyan coastguard and the significant human rights violations in Libya. In this context will Ireland procure with other nations weapons that might be used outside the UN mandate? This is still a question to which I have not received an answer and it was relevant even before we joined PESCO, which also presents major questions with regard to collective procurement projects. There are proto-fascist parties in some countries across Europe. If those parties come into government and into power, will we have contributed to joint procurement projects? We are aware that in recent years Austria had tanks on the border with Italy. Is there a situation in the future where Ireland may have contributed to the purchase of such weaponry, not only through the general sense of the European Defence Fund but through specific joint procurement projects under PESCO? Will the Minister indicate the safeguards under PESCO?</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> On Operation Sophia I will quote the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe. When I challenged him back in 2017 on Ireland's move away from bilateral search and rescue to Operation Sophia, the Minister of State said: "Transferring to Operation Sophia will result in the redeployment of Irish Naval Service vessels from primarily humanitarian search and rescue operations to primarily security and interception operations." The Minister of State told this House in 2017 that we were moving away from humanitarian concerns. Those missions had been a great source of pride for many in this nation. He said we were to move into security. Now we know that Operation Sophia will not be working on humanitarian rescue at all. A representative from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Ms Carlotta Sami, recently said that: "If we do not intervene soon there will be a sea of blood." These are life and death decisions. These are not decisions about readiness; these are life-and-death decisions. What steps are being taken to seek other opportunities for search and rescue, and for co-operation with other navies or civilian authorities for search and rescue in the Mediterranean Sea? I believe the Irish Naval Service has also spoken very eloquently about it. During Ireland's time in search and rescue, the Naval Service personnel, on their own and separate from any other European country, rescued more than 18,000 lives from the Mediterranean Sea. The personnel involved have spoken of this as being one of the most formative and meaningful experiences of their lives. Will the Minister of State indicate the plans for resuming that co-operation?</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> Concerns were raised with regard to the Libyan coastguard and Libyan human rights' violations, which are funded by Europe as a substitute for search and rescue in the Mediterranean Sea. This was one of many migrant control agreements signed by Europe. I believe there were 11 such agreements. Crucially, the one I wish to speak about is one on which I ask the Minister of State to engage with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade with a view to seeking its immediate suspension. This is the funding that has been given to the Rapid Support Forces group in Sudan. Currently, even the African Union no longer recognises any government in Sudan. There is extraordinary testimony from civil society groups who will again take to the streets this weekend. Young people spoke here last week about how instead of taking up weapons, they chose to take up paintbrushes, pencils and microphones. There is a very powerful civil society movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">We have concerns that the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces group is being funded by European money in a similar way to what is happening in Libya. Funding is effectively been rerouted to groups linked with the Janjaweed militia, whose members are taking part in violent actions against protestors at a time when there is no recognised transitional government in place in Sudan.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> My final question is a very specific one. We have a new nominee for President of the European Commission, Ms Ursula von der Leyen, who is a member of the same European party as the Minister of State. She has previously spoken about her vision of an army of Europeans being in place in the foreseeable future. How does the Minister of State plan to engage with Ms von der Leyen on this issue and how will he ensure that Ireland's neutrality is strongly protected within any plans for further EU integration? What assurances or messages can the Government publicly send in this regard via its engagement with the person put forward by the Minister of State's group in Europe to become the next President of the Commission? The Irish public needs more than casual dismissals of its concerns. We need to see the Minister of State's plans for diplomatic action which offers a clear assertion of Ireland's neutrality and commitment to disarmament and peace-building.</p>

        <speech by="#ColmBurke" eId="spk_262">
          <from>Senator Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_590">I welcome the Minister of State to the House to take these statements. I acknowledge that he would like to have seen a lot more done on the issue of remuneration of Defence Forces personnel. What we do have is Cabinet approval for €10 million in funding for this area, based on the recommendations of the Public Service Pay Commission. I was disappointed by that allocation, which does not adequately reflect the recognition due to members of the Defence Forces for the security, care and assistance they provide to the State at vital intervals. They are fantastic ambassadors for the country. Their deployment abroad operates under the triple lock system, which requires a UN mandate, followed by approval by the Government and, finally, approval by Dáil Éireann. I remember clearly when I was a Member of the European Parliament attending a committee meeting where there was a clear effort by certain people to undermine the EU operation to Chad, which included the participation of Irish troops. The operation was under the command of an Irish officer and was concerned with providing security around internally displaced person, IDP, sites and refugee camps where more than 570,000 people were based. Six months after the operation was fully in place, it was interesting to hear a senior member of the British army report back to the committee that the Irish troops had achieved more in six months in establishing good relations with the general population of the area than the French army had achieved in the previous 30 years. That was a serious compliment from a member of the British defence forces and clear evidence of the commitment of the Irish Army to its overseas operations. It is important to recognise that commitment. It is not just about providing security and protection for people in conflict zones but also sending a clear message across Europe and the world that the Irish Defence Forces are there in a peacekeeping role.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> One of the issues that greatly concerns me is the lack of affordability of suitable housing for members of the Defence Forces. I acted in a legal capacity in the past on behalf of a large number of ordinary soldiers who wished to purchase three-bedroom, semi-detached houses. They were able to do that on the salaries they had then. We all know how much things have changed in terms of incomes and the cost of housing, but it is important to note that even if a member of the Defence Forces has €100,000 in the bank today, he or she will not be able to buy the same three-bedroom, semi-detached house. We must examine how we can make it possible for personnel to access accommodation of the standard they enjoyed in the past and should continue to enjoy in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> We are facing several major challenges in this country at this time. Opposition Members have criticised the Government for the difficulties in which Defence Forces personnel find themselves, but part of the problem is that because we have full employment, we are competing with many other employers. That is the greatest challenge we face on this issue. No matter what remuneration we offer within the Defence Forces, there are competitors who are able to offer a much better level of pay and better supports. We must work out how to offer appropriate allowances while staying within the public sector guidelines on pay and conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> My final point is to note that we have recruited more than 41,000 additional people in the public sector in recent years. It is a bone of contention for me that 16,000 of those were recruited by the Health Service Executive. I am not questioning the need to prioritise healthcare provision, but I am seriously concerned that there is no strategy in place to ensure we get value for money in employing people. There is no doubt that we get value for money for the personnel we employ in the Defence Forces. We must see how we can further improve the offer that is on the table and ensure working conditions are attractive enough to retain people in the forces.</p>

          <from>Senator Ned O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_594">I welcome the Minister of State to the House for what has been an interesting and wide-ranging debate. I will focus on a human aspect of this issue, namely, the standard of living and working conditions endured by members of the Defence Forces. Ireland has never been a militaristic nation; we are too small for that and it has not been part of our culture. In fact, our predecessors spent much of their lives struggling against the imperial armies of our nearest neighbour. Nonetheless, we are entitled to have a solid defence corps available to the nation in a time of crisis. Fortunately, we have been spared some of the terrible atrocities that have arisen in recent decades out of the religious conflicts that are going on all over the world, particularly in the Middle East. However, we might not always be so lucky and, in such circumstances, we will be shouting for the Army and the Garda to defend our interests, as they have done before. Indeed, many members of both organisations have given their lives in the service of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> Defence Forces personnel may not be strong in numbers and they do not have the voting power of some of the larger organised groups such as teachers, nurses or even gardaí. Their power tends to be concentrated in areas where the garrisons are located, such as the Curragh Camp and Athlone. However, they are held in high regard throughout the country. We have all heard the sad tales related to Joe Duffy on the notorious edition of "Liveline" and on other programmes about how married men with families are trying to scrape a basic living while at the same time rendering proud service in the uniform.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">All of us will have taken great pride in observing the ceremonial value of the Army in 2016 and again this year. We see how Army personnel enhance all the functions they perform for An Uachtaráin in Áras an Uachtaráin. They add quality and prestige to those occasions. We have seen the way in which they have gone into our schools and talked to young people about our history, flag and so on. There is a deep-seated respect for the Army throughout the country. People are fed up with its members being pushed around.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> The Minister of State has been in the wars lately and I will not add to his trials and tribulations. He has had enough of them but he is well able to deal with them. That is his role. However, the commission's report must be seen as a start, although not a great start, and it will be up to the Minister of State and future Governments to deliver on what it promises. I do not want to repeat what has been said but the publication of the report will not in itself stop the haemorrhaging of members from the Defence Forces that we have witnessed in recent years. Record numbers are continuing to leave. Senator Craughwell worked out that the pay increase will amount to 96 cent per day for some members. Will that stop people leaving the Army? The commission found that 60% of enlisted personnel and non-commissioned officers had indicated they intended to leave the Defence Forces in the next two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> The measures have cost €10 million, which is barely one third of the €29 million underspend in the Department's pay budget in 2018. There is no doubt from the report that the commission knows that its recommendations are just the beginning of what is needed. I repeat that this is only a start and people will expect the serious business to take place from now on.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> From the outset, the commission was hamstrung by its very terms. The numbers serving in the Defence Forces have fallen below 9,000 and morale is on the floor. Pay and conditions are one issue but members feel abandoned in respect of a range of other issues also. We witnessed the embarrassment of the messed up arrangements for repatriating troops from abroad, which caused great upset for the troops and their distraught families. The decline has left the force with just 8,847 personnel at the end of March, which is 653 below the current agreed strength. The Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Mellett, stated: "You are always going to have a churn and a churn is healthy, but I would rather it be down about 5 per cent rather than the 8.1 per cent it is at present." The UK Government declared it a crisis when the equivalent level in Britain reached 5%. That should be a wake-up call for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> It is clear to my party that a pay body must be established for the Permanent Defence Force which would reflect the unique nature of military service in the broader context of pay and allowances. The Taoiseach has been in denial, citing recruitment campaigns when challenged during Leaders' Questions, but the commission makes it clear that current recruitment processes must be reviewed as the continued acceleration in recruitment activity in the absence of equivalent retention is kicking the can down the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> I am proud to be one of the Senators who receives his nomination to contest the Seanad election by the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations, ICPSA, which body represents, among others, RACO and PDFORRA. In my involvement with those individuals, I have yet to meet a finer, more upstanding body of men and women. RACO and PDFORRA should have had an input into the report because they have certainly been underwhelmed by its outcome. As the Minister of State is aware, legal proceedings are ongoing but I hope that, as he promised, the increases will come into effect immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> The outlays associated with developing a full range of military skills can amount to €1.4 million for an ordnance bomb disposal officer at captain rank or €1.72 million for a captain in the Air Corps. The cost of training one officer cadet is estimated at more than €100,000 per student. Recruitment is costly and even more costly when it comes without a retention policy to back it up at the other end. Retention is not only about remuneration. There are fundamental organisational and structural issues within the Defence Forces. The most fundamental retention issue is the working time directive, which many members referred to, whose protection has been denied to members of the Defence Forces. While I will not say the Taoiseach and Minister of State were not singing from the same hymn sheet in some of their recent statements, they were certainly not singing in the same key. This caused some confusion, as Senator Craughwell noted. I am not privy to the additional documentation the Minister of State presented to the House but I look forward with interest to seeing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> The Defence Forces have been an easy target for cost-cutting. Advantage has been taken of the unreserved loyalty and professionalism of Defence Forces members. Defence policy must become more than merely fitting the Defence Forces into a budget envelope.</p>

          <from>Senator Robbie Gallagher<recordedTime time="2019-07-09T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_604">I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House to discuss this very important issue. We have spoken many times about the great pride Irish people have in members of the Defence Forces and the great work they do on behalf of the nation both here at home and overseas, where they distinguish themselves with great honour. Regrettably, we have also spoken many times in the House about the plight of members of the Defence Forces and their families. It is safe to say that morale has never been as low as it is now. In many ways, members feel abandoned by the Government in that they keep shouting but, unfortunately, nobody seems to be listening to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> The long-awaited report on the pay of members of the Defence Forces was published last week. I have listened to comments by both representative bodies, PDFORRA and RACO, whose members are reasonable men and women representing the views of members of the Defence Forces. If their interim thoughts are anything to go by, the theme seems to be one of disappointment rather than elation at the contents of that report. That is very disappointing because it took a year and a half or two years to compile the report and, unfortunately, the synopsis from them is that it falls a good deal short from what they had been seeking.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> As the previous speaker stated, we need some kind of pay body or commission to examine the pay and terms and conditions of the Defence Forces. That is the way forward. The Garda had a similar body of work done in respect of its members' pay and conditions and it is fair to say that the majority of members of that organisation were happy with the outcome of that process. A similar body of work needs to be conducted in respect of Defence Forces members' pay and conditions. I look forward to the Minister of State's views on that proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> There was much speculation recently in the press about PDFORRA joining ICTU by means of some form of associate membership. I understand the Defence Forces members cannot strike. That is the way it should be, and most members of PDFORRA would be of a similar mind. What are the Minister of State's views on the speculation in the press about associate trade union membership? I look forward to his response on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">I concur with all my colleagues who have voiced their total support for the Defence Forces and the great work they do. I would like someone to grasp the nettle once and for all so that members of the Defence Forces can take pride in their work, can see a future for themselves, their wives and their children and can stay in the forces. There is no point in the taxpayer spending money to train them to a high level, only to discover that they cannot stay in the forces after their training has been completed because they are unable to put bread on the table. In many cases they cannot get a mortgage and those who are fortunate enough to be able to get a mortgage cannot repay it on the salary they get. The time for talking is over and it is now the time for action. I look forward to the Minister of State's response to the issues my colleagues and I have raised. </p>

          <p eId="para_609">I thank Senators for their contributions to this very important debate. I welcome the publication of the report of the Public Service Pay Commission, which provides an independent assessment of recruitment and retention issues. The report was accepted by all members of the Government last week. It recommends a range of measures to improve recruitment and retention in the Permanent Defence Force.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> I will try to cover as many of the points as possible. Senator Ó Ríordáin spoke about allowances, which form part of the pay of members of the Defence Forces. He was in government himself for five years and had an opportunity to change that but it was not done. It is important that we increased allowances and the restoration of allowances has been highlighted to me by people over the past number of years. I am delighted that allowances were addressed by the Public Service Pay Commission. Senator Craughwell said this equated to 96 cent per day. The Senator should either go back to school or get a calculator out.</p>

          <p eId="para_614">The mathematics of what the Senator would give a total of €3 million but the package of measures amounts to €10 million. There is €7 million left over, which goes to increases in allowances such as 10% in the MSA, which equates to between €602 and €675 for members up to the rank of colonel. There will be a restoration of allowances which were cut under the Haddington Road agreement. The Senator has jumped up and down in recent years about the security duty allowance, the patrol duty allowance, the Army Ranger Wing, bomb disposal, 24-hour duty and weekend duty but he did not mention any of those in his contribution. I must have done something right when the Senator did not complain about them. We have restored them and they are part of the €7 million he must have forgotten about.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> Another example is the recognition of peacekeeping. The UN provides a contribution towards our costs but it does not cover all overseas allowances payable to personnel. It is the State that covers the remainder of the overseas allowance and I am delighted that it has been increased by the Government, following the recommendations of the Public Service Pay Commission. I am disappointed that the Senator does not recognise this. I understand there are no votes in positive publicity so the Senator has to go on the negative. </p>

          <p eId="para_635">I will be fair to the man. He has visited installations and he does interact, but his most important job is dealing with the representative associations, PDFORRA and RACO, which he has done on numerous occasions. Last Thursday, he was at a full briefing by the Public Service Pay Commission to both representative associations. The Senator should acknowledge these things and he should make sure that, when he gets his information, it is the right information.</p>

          <p eId="para_637">I am aware that Senator McFadden spoke to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, about the working family payment today. People are on the working family payment for specific reasons, related to their own and their family's circumstances. It is for a person recruited aged 22 or 23 who has two or three children.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">It is for all members of the private sector and public sector. I am glad that the Senator welcomes this as a start. It is a start to the pathway of recovery for members of the Defence Forces. It is important that we recognise that it is an important step forward. Both RACO and PDFORRA have made representations to me on numerous occasions about the restoration of allowances and it is important to recognise that all allowances have been restored to pre-Haddington Road agreement levels. Restoration to pre-financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, levels is covered in the public service stability agreement, which will conclude in October 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> Senator Higgins raised a range of matters relating to defence and others to foreign policy. The Senator might take those up with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney. Operation Sophia is not rescuing migrants because an agreement could not be reached about where we could bring those rescued ashore. Ireland is participating in efforts to resolve this issue but it is outside our direct control. Efforts at European level will be central to resolving the matter. The Senator spoke about our involvement in permanent structured co-operation, PESCO. It is important that the Defence Forces participate in PESCO. We are involved in some of its many courses. It will assist in enhancing our capabilities. It is important that we are not isolated from working with other countries, whether on peacekeeping duties, PESCO, the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, or whatever else it is. Regarding Ireland's position-----</p>

          <p eId="para_641">I constantly restate Ireland's policy position on neutrality and ensure that it is reflected in European policy, which respects every country's position. I will continue to do this. The Senator spoke about the new President-elect of the European Commission, Ms von der Leyen, who has recently been appointed. I know her well. She is a former defence Minister. If there is to be a European army, that will not be a matter for the Government but for the Irish people. It is provided for in the Lisbon treaty. I have constantly stated that that is provided for in the protocols to the Lisbon treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> In response to Senator Colm Burke, this is a suite of measures under the public service pay agreement. It is a start and it comes from an independent pay commission. I acknowledge that there was a €1.5 million increase in outstanding adjudications.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> Some of the matters highlighted by Senator Ned O'Sullivan were why the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, prioritised the Defence Forces personnel to be looked at by the Public Service Pay Commission. I understand the Senator's frustration that it took so long for the report to be compiled and published but there was substantial work to do for this report. It was the same for the health sector, which was the first area to be looked at by the commission while the second was defence. I am delighted that it is complete. The Senator acknowledged the positive inputs for members of the Defence Forces. I acknowledge that we have a pathway to follow. A significant number of non-pay issues arise from the report, including the review of pay structures in the Defence Forces. This will pave the way for the next round of negotiations under the public service stability agreement, which concludes in 2020. There have been pay rises under the public service stability agreement, which concludes in 2020, of between 6.4% and 7.2%. In December, Defence Forces personnel will again receive a pay increase of 1.75%, as with all members of the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Gallagher spoke about a number of issues that I have already covered. Senator Gallagher asked me specifically to address an issue related to ICTU. A review was carried out under the conciliation and arbitration scheme last year. I received the report in the third or fourth quarter of 2018. There was a recommendation that my Department's officials would talk to ICTU. My officials have already done that, along with Defence Forces senior management. They are in conversation with ICTU specifically about that issue. I have spoken with the representative association about this. It is an ongoing exchange between ICTU and my departmental officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> With regard to the recommendation of increases and restoration of certain allowances, on top of the measures already provided for in the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the measures are weighed in favour of those on low pay. The increases due to date have been paid and further increases are due on 1 September 2019 and 1 January 2020. The last one will be on 1 October 2020, when the Government will negotiate a new public service stability agreement with the trade unions. By the end of the current public service pay agreement, the pay of all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces, earning less than €70,000 per annum will be restored to pre-FEMPI levels. The restoration of the 5% reduction in allowances cut under FEMPI is also scheduled to happen with that agreement, as I have stated. Revised measures relating to pay scales of new entrants who joined the Defence Forces since 2011 were also introduced with effect from 1 March this year. With a combination of all of these measures, a private, 3 star, on completion of six months of basic training, will earn €28,110 per annum. That includes a military service allowance, MSA. This point on the payscale will have increased by 30% since the end of 2015. This equates to an increase of €120.39 on starting pay and MSA for a private, 3 star. I do not think that anyone here could say that this is not a significant increase. This is starting pay with MSA. There are incremental adjustments from years of service, with opportunity for additional duty-based allowances also being included on top of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> We will move quickly to implement the recommendations in the report. This report is available on the Department's website. A high-level implementation plan for the recommendations in the report has been approved and work will commence immediately. It might have been Senator Craughwell who said that this will be left on a shelf. I assure him and all Senators that these recommendations from the Public Service Pay Commission will not sit on a shelf. There is a high level implementation group with officials from my own Department, Defence Forces personnel and senior management and officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of the Taoiseach. The group will provide a report. The increase in allowances will be implemented following confirmation of acceptance by the Defence Forces representative association.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">The report also makes recommendations that include the following: progress on the review of tech pay; commence a review of pay structures in the Permanent Defence Force; consider incentivised long-service agreements for certain officer and NCO ranks; review current retention initiatives; undertake a review of recruitment; and introduce a new approach to workforce planning in the Defence Forces. I think Senator Higgins mentioned the last item.</p>
