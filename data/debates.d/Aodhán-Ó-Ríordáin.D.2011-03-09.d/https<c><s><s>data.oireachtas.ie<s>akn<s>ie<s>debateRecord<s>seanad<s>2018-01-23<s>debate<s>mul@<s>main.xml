            <p eId="para_22">St. Molaga's senior national school has 463 pupils. It is in the town of Balbriggan, County Dublin. Balbriggan is the fastest growing town in Ireland, has the youngest population in the State and the capacity to expand much more. Since 2000, over half the pupils and half the teaching staff have been housed in 16 prefabricated buildings. These are now in a desperate state of repair despite the best efforts of the principal, Pauline Costello, and her staff. They are overcrowded, cold and damp in the winter and too hot and stuffy in the summer. The conditions are intolerable. The school is at bursting point and, given the projected enrolment from the feeder school, Sts. Peter and Paul junior school, and the drop in the pupil-teacher ratio, extra capacity is urgently needed in St. Molaga's.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> The school is on the major building works list for 2019-21 but nothing is imminent. I brought forward this matter on the Commencement on 26 October last. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Halligan, told me on that day that substantial progress would be made on this project before the Christmas break.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> Christmas came and went and no word came to the principal. This prompted the principal to apply for additional prefabs due to the urgent capacity issues. She did so very reluctantly due to their cost and the fear that the ultimate goal of permanent school structures being put in place would be put on the back burner for a further 17 years. In early January the Department made contact with the principal, organising a meeting to discuss the extension. I believe 7 February was finalised as the date for this meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> This afternoon Pauline Costello got word that approval had been granted for prefabs for two mainstream and one special education classrooms. This was less than she had requested but it is welcome. The focus, however, should remain on the extension which needs to be delivered immediately. Can the Minister give me a clear outline today of the appointment of a design team and planning permission application or will this be given to the team that is meeting the Department on 7 February in Tullamore?</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> I am also looking for a guarantee that the granting of additional prefabs does not mean that the extension date will be pushed out because 17 years is too long to wait and we need this permanent structure in place for the children of St. Molaga's and Balbriggan who will enter the school in the future.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Richard Bruton)<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T14:35:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_27">I thank the Senator for raising this matter. I can understand what a frustrating experience it is for any school that is struggling.</p>
            <p eId="para_28">My Department is planning on delivering 20,000 school places every year. We are facing the need to meet very strong population challenges across both primary and secondary level. It is a challenging area for my capital Department. </p>
            <p eId="para_29"> On the wider issue of the planning area of Balbriggan, it is indeed one of 314 planning areas across the country in which the Department is carrying out a demographic exercise to identify whether there is pressure for additional accommodation to be built in the longer term, that is, to extend the total number of places available in the area. That result should be available within a reasonable period although it is not yet available.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> On the specific situation in respect of St. Molaga's school, I recognise that what the Senator says is correct. The school has had a permanent building and temporary accommodation. It has survived for a very long period on a mixture of the two, with eight classrooms in temporary accommodation as well as two special needs classes. The school is absolutely and rightly on the Department's building programme. I do not want to get into a dispute about timings. However, the note I have says there was contact during the summer months regarding a project brief for the school and the longer-term projected staff requirements, and that the Department is currently preparing the project brief following that discussion. As the Senator correctly stated, a meeting has been scheduled for early February to bring that discussion further, with a consultation with the school authorities. The completion of the project brief will facilitate the project to be progressed into architectural planning, which includes the appointment of a design team. This is a positive movement for the project. There is a project brief close to completion. There is this meeting and it will proceed then to the design phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> I assure the Senator that my Department does recognise the importance of this. Providing additional prefab accommodation does not mean that the school will lose its position or the importance that is assigned to the work. As the Senator did, I also commend the principal, Pauline Costello, and the staff on the work they are doing in the school. I hope these scheduled meetings will assist the school in its planning and delivery of the service to which it is giving such commitment.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">The principal and teaching staff are doing an excellent job, despite the challenges they face. I am sure they will continue to do an excellent job. However, the children and staff deserve a decent and safe work and learning environment. The contact during the summer months was merely in the form of acknowledgement letters to the letters Pauline Costello submitted. There was no information contained in them. The contact in January was the first of a substantial nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> I am glad to hear that a project brief is being prepared. I hope details of it will be delivered to the board of management at the meeting on 7 February. I re-emphasise that this really is a priority at this stage. I understand there are other priority areas around the country but this is of urgent priority because of the census data and the desperate conditions in which the pupils and teaching staff have had to subsist for the past 17 years. Could the Minister tell me when we will see the extension being completed? Is the projected date in 12 months or 18 months? In the Minister's experience, what is the time scale between the project brief being completed and the actual delivery?</p>

            <p eId="para_34">Unfortunately, I cannot give any such projection because every project genuinely does differ. There can be delays in a planning process or a design team. There can be issues around reconsidering some elements of the design when it is seen. There can be issues around tender. It is a process we have to go through and I would only be misleading the Senator if I said one phase will take X amount of time and another will take Y amount. It would be construed as a commitment which I simply cannot make.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> The Deputy referred to the census data. It is being very closely examined at present to see if there is an expectation of additional capacity being needed in the Balbriggan area.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">The project predominantly involves replacing capacity which has been provided on a temporary basis. As I understand it, at this point it is not based on trying to increase the overall enrolment numbers for the school or area. I will convey to my Department how the school community and the Senator feel about the project. I recognise that virtually every area to which I go has projects that are very urgent. It is the product of the fact that we are experiencing population growth which up to now has mainly been in the primary school system but which is now occurring in the secondary school system. We have to make sure we meet the needs of the school population every year. </p>
            <p eId="para_37"> It is heartening that the overall number of children accommodated country-wide in temporary prefab accommodation is reducing. Undoubtedly, to some degree, after a lost decade of investment in many public service areas we are catching up. The Department has been able to protect investment in the education sphere in order to provide for children. It will have to continue to do so within tight financial constraints.</p>

            <p eId="para_38">The Minister has touched on the fact that this is not about creating extra capacity in the school. Extra capacity has been created in many other schools in the town of Balbriggan in the past few years, which is to be welcomed. However, the pupils and teachers of St. Molaga's who have built a great history and served the community in Balbriggan feel they have been left behind because the school has been allowed to run down and is falling apart. It is very important that the existing capacity be protected and that the pupils and teachers be given a decent school.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire Stáit as a bheith linn don phlé seo inniu. 'Sé an fáth a chuirim an cheist ná go bhfuil ráchairt agus feachtasaíocht ollmhór ag dul ar aghaidh uirthi, go háirithe ó Thuaidh.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to come to speak to me about my request. I refer to the concerted call made by citizens and those in the North applying for Irish passports for a dedicated office and facility to meet the growing demand. The Minister of State will know that last year over 82,000 passport applications were received from the North and even more from Britain. The increase in the number of applications received from the North was almost one fifth on the number of applications made in 2016. The levels in 2016 were an increase on the numbers of applications made in 2015, while the levels in 2015 were an increase on the numbers of applications made in 2014. There has been a concerted pattern in the past few years. </p>
            <p eId="para_43"> First-time applicants for Irish passports accounted for almost one half of the requests received last year alone. The call comes not just from Sinn Féin, although we are proud to lead in the institution of the campaign, but also from other political parties in the North. The SDLP agrees with us, while Fianna Fáil has indicated that it would like to see something located in the North. The Alliance Party has stated there is merit in looking at the opening of a service. It is about the interest shown in improving infrastructure and service delivery across the country. There are two passport offices. I take the opportunity to commend the staff who have worked under immense pressure to deliver a vital and important service across the State. The offices in Cork and Dublin service those parts of the country very well. There has been incremental growth in demand not just from the Six Counties but also the broader north-west region. There is, therefore, merit in the Government considering how it can improve the infrastructure across all 32 counties. When Guy Verhofstadt addressed us a number of months ago, he highlighted the commitment to protect our rights as full Irish and EU citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> I call on the Government to put its money where its mouth is and to make a practical infrastructural service investment in the northern part of the country. The Taoiseach rightly said that on his watch no longer will Irish citizens in the North feel abandoned. I ask that the Government does not abandon us, that it shows us that the preparations and work are under way as the unwanted and negative impact of Brexit is rolled out, and that the Irish Government remains steadfast and that it is here to stay in terms of citizens' rights in the North. One way to do that, which would certainly be hugely symbolic, would be the opening of a passport office. It would also help immensely with service delivery and the practicalities of the increasing demand for Irish passports from Irish citizens in the North.</p>

          <speech by="#CiaranCannon" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" eId="spk_10">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_45">The year 2017 was a record breaking one for the passport service, with approximately 780,000 passports issued. This was an increase of over 6% compared to 2016 and an increase of over 15% since 2015. That strong demand for Irish passports includes an increased demand from Irish citizens in Northern Ireland and Great Britain - overall, almost 20% of the total number of applications received by the passport service last year were from Northern Ireland and Great Britain. As the Senator pointed out, a total of 82,274 applications were received from applicants in Northern Ireland and first-time applicants represented approximately half of all those applications from Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> We predict that increasing demand will continue to be a feature of our work in 2018, bearing in mind a range of factors, including a growing population and economy. Between 1 and 21 January 2018, the passport service has already received 53,554 passport applications. Of this total and in the same period, we have received 4,446 applications from Irish citizens in Northern Ireland; 4,020 of these applications have been made via the Northern Ireland passport express service, while 425 have been received via the passport online renewal service.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> In anticipation of increased demand my Department has commissioned research to try to better understand the potential demand for passports from citizens who have not yet applied for a passport. That study will assist the Department in formulating plans on the resources required into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> Responding to this significant and growing demand, the passport service offers a range of convenient channels for submission of passport applications by Irish citizens at home and abroad. Advice and guidance on these channels and other useful information on passports is available on the Department's website at <i>https://www.dfa.ie/passports</i>. </p>
            <p eId="para_49"> The Department has worked exceptionally hard to ensure we provide a modern, secure and efficient passport service. An ambitious reform programme is in place to meet the unprecedented demand for passports from Irish citizens at home and abroad, and to continuously strengthen systems guarding against fraud and protecting the integrity of the Irish passport.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> The award-winning online passport renewal service was launched in March 2017 and offers the convenience of an online application system 24 hours a day, seven days a week for adult Irish citizens anywhere in the world, without the need for application forms, printed photos or witnesses. The introduction of online service not only offers improved customer experience but is also resulting in efficiency gains which are assisting my Department to manage the large volume increases in applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> Citizens who cannot or do not wish to apply online have the option of applying through their local post office. In 2017, over 400,000 citizens availed of this option and submitted their passport application through the network of more than 1,000 post offices across the State. The Northern Ireland passport express service offers an equivalent service to those living in Northern Ireland from more than 70 of its post offices. We are keenly aware of the importance of our post office network on this island and I want to acknowledge the valuable role it plays in administering the passport express service, offering a convenient and cost-effective option for citizens across the island of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> Bearing in mind the availability of both the online and postal application channels, very few citizens living on the island of Ireland are required to travel a significant distance in order to apply for their passport. In the relatively small number of cases where citizens need to travel very urgently and do not have a valid passport, the passport offices in Dublin and Cork offer an appointment service, including where necessary a rapid renewal one-day service. The passport service keeps passport demand under review on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> To address the increased demand for passports during peak season, the passport service is this year employing over 210 temporary clerical officers to assist in processing. These staff have been hired and the roles are being filled. My Department has also been working closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to fill permanent positions across all passport offices and I am pleased to say over 20 permanent staff have joined the passport service in the past month.</p>
            <p eId="para_54">Furthermore, it is already planned to further extend the online application facility to all citizens, including first-time applicants and children, by 2019. That will be a very significant step indeed in terms of enhancing the service for all citizens. That will allow additional efficiency gains and improvements in customer service. People who cannot or do not wish to apply online will still be able to submit their applications through a service provider with an extensive network of contact points throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the range of service options available meets the current needs of passport applicants and projected demand and I do not see a compelling rationale to open an additional passport office in Northern Ireland at this time. I should clarify that any new office would need to have the capacity to provide a rapid renewal service for applicants with urgent travel needs such as that available through the passport office in Dublin. That would require an on-site passport production machine in a specially controlled and secure environment. The purchase cost of a new passport printing machine alone would be approximately €1.7 million. That is without security, technical, fit-out, staffing and rental costs. An outreach office without production facilities could not offer a significantly faster service than the online option and it would do no more than duplicate the passport express service already offered through local post offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> In all the circumstances, I am convinced that with the existing and future range of services, including passport express, rapid renewal and online services, my Department will continue to more than adequately meet the needs of all passport applicants, wherever in the island of Ireland they are living. My Department is also working on an outreach public awareness programme to inform the general public of all the services available in applying for a passport.</p>

            <p eId="para_58">Tá sé sin iontach spéisiúil. I do not disagree with most of what the Minister of State said. The passport service is first class. The staff in the post office network and in the passport office provide an immensely worthwhile service for citizens right across the State. I am disappointed that the associated cost is seen as a reason for not locating the service in the North. The Minister of State cited €1.7 million as the cost for the print facility, but I am sure all 82,274 people who applied for a new and renewed passport paid for the service. I do not believe, therefore, that cost is necessarily the best case to make. This is about investment, future planning and meeting a clearly identifiable need. In the broader political context, which we cannot ignore, this is about saying to Irish citizens north of the Border that we are investing in them and we see them as part of the life of this State and this country overall and we will meet the need with a service delivery to which they are entitled. While I agree that the service at this stage is first class, as the Minister of State rightly outlined, there is a growing demand which I expect will continue to grow. The very broad political call for this service will not go away.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">It is critical to point out that the rights of citizens on the entire island of Ireland to apply for and to retain an Irish passport is at the very core of the work that we do. I fully agree that significant challenges will arise in terms of what Brexit will bring but the service is available through the network of 70 post offices and increasingly online. Last year if one were to avail of the online service one had to be over 18 and renewing one's passport but we will shortly allow the service to be accessed by everybody applying for a passport, including for the first time. That is a significant development.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> The purchase cost of the machine would be €1.7 million. The number of applicants submitting their applications through any additional or new office would not be sufficient to keep the machine running for more than half an hour a day, as it can print approximately 500 passports per hour. If we channel our resources through enhancing all the services already provided on the island which are available to all citizens of the island, that would be a far more appropriate use of those resources.</p>

            <from>Senator Gabrielle McFadden<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_63">I welcome the Minister of State to the House again and thank him for coming here so often.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> We are all too aware of the problems with overcrowding that affect many hospitals around the country, particularly at this time of the year. We are all deeply concerned about this. None of us wants to see our relatives, or anybody’s, lying on a trolley, especially if they are elderly.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> This problem has been with us for over 20 years. I acknowledge that there is no quick-fix solution. The issues are complex and require creative solutions. We know it is not just a matter of throwing more beds at the problem, and this becomes even clearer when one talks to people working at the coalface. It requires a multifaceted approach. An initiative I believe would lead to a significant reduction in hospital referrals is the rolling out of geriatric teams working specifically in the community. Such teams, led by a community-based consultant geriatrician and including specialist and prescribing nurses, could play an important role in supporting the management of the health needs of older people in community settings and in providing services that avoid the necessity for a hospital admission. There are regular admissions to the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, of elderly people presenting with various needs, such as a requirement for intravenous medication. With more community geriatric teams, many of these elderly patients could be assessed and treated in the community. The team would visit local nursing homes, day care centres, community nursing units or people's own homes to assess and treat elderly patients without the need for the hospital admission in many cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> People over 65 years make up 13.5% of the population but currently account for significantly more than half of all the inpatient beds. This segment of the population is projected to grow significantly in the coming years. Many older people admitted to emergency departments, once assessed by a triage nurse, end up spending prolonged periods awaiting treatment. HSE statistics show that patients over 75 years spend three times longer in emergency departments than those aged 65 or younger. Up to 40% of those waiting for more than 24 hours are over 75 years of age. Would it not be significantly better to bring the care to these people rather than bringing them to the care, where they have to wait for long periods exposed to additional infection and putting pressure on an already strained emergency department?</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> Such an outreach service, provided in an integrated manner, would be a significant support in maintaining older people in their own homes and communities, where we all know they do better. This would not only help to reduce overcrowding in hospitals, such as that in Mullingar, but also, and just as important, preserve the dignity of older people and reduce the stress on their families. I have been in communication with Nursing Homes Ireland and it has assured me that this initiative is one it would very much support.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> When I raised this issue previously with the then Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, she informed me the HSE was to put in place an integrated care programme for elderly people that would examine the variety of ways that health care services could be delivered to older persons and determine the most effective way to do so. Therefore, I ask the current Minister of State to update the House on the status of the integrated care programme for elderly people and, in particular, outline whether he believes a sufficient number of teams, each comprising a geriatrician and specialist nurses working in the community, could provide a more appropriate service for older users and help to relieve the pressure on emergency departments in hospitals, particularly at times of overcapacity.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Jim Daly)<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_69">I thank the Senator for raising this issue, which she has been raising for some time. There is nothing more impressive in politics than consistency. The Senator is certainly consistent, and she certainly has been consistent on this topic. She has been following it for a number of years. She referred to the predecessor of my predecessor, Kathleen Lynch. Therefore, it is quite a while since the Senator first proposed what she is now proposing.</p>
            <p eId="para_70"> It is the role of public representatives, including Senator McFadden in her role as a Senator, to continue to challenge the system. The HSE manages the delivery of services to elderly people and the entire population.</p>
            <p eId="para_71">It is up to us as public representatives to continue to challenge how things are done. If we continue to do what we always did, we will not bring about the real change demanded by the people we represent. I thank the Senator for raising this matter because it gives my officials and I the opportunity to refocus our efforts on getting geriatric teams into the community to deliver health care. The last place for the elderly is in an emergency department or acute hospital. The health challenges they face in such environments are enormous. It is important we continue to help people to live longer and better lives in their own homes where it is safer.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> The integrated care programme for older persons, working in conjunction with the national clinical programme for older people, is leading on the development of cohesive primary and secondary care services for older people with a specific focus on those with more complex needs and frailty. To date, 12 pioneer sites have been supported and are in development nationally. Six were commenced in 2016 and a further six in 2017. These sites are working to a ten-step framework informed by a local population based approach, delivered by multidisciplinary teams working across traditional service boundaries and adopting a case-management approach. The integrated care team for older persons in the pioneer sites works, in partnership with community services, primary care, social care and health and well-being services, to promote healthy outcomes and reduce morbidity to enable older people to lead independent and purposeful lives in their communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> The integrated care programme for older persons pioneer sites has focused on developing improved care pathways which address areas of older persons care such as integration across acute and community services, emergency department older persons flow and inpatient flow. While delivery of the pioneer sites is in the early stages, initial indications are positive with the integrated care programme for older person teams demonstrating they are providing multidisciplinary interventions for the majority of older persons in their own homes or in a community day hospital setting. There is substantial emerging evidence, locally and internationally, to show that approaches that use the models of care outlined in the national and integrated care programmes for older people demonstrate improved outcomes, particularly with regard to frailty.</p>
            <p eId="para_74"> Further evaluation is ongoing to better understand the impact of integrated care on outcomes for older people in the Irish context.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">I have raised this matter concerning the SouthDoc service in Kinsale, County Cork, because of a public meeting held there several months ago. The lack of a dedicated SouthDoc service in Kinsale has not been addressed since 2014 when we lost it due to a merger between two existing services in Bandon and Kinsale. The community in Kinsale has not had a dedicated SouthDoc service based in the town since.</p>
            <p eId="para_78"> SouthDoc services are a key part of the social and economic fabric of Kinsale and how it does its business. It is a large town with a significant urban hinterland and a thriving tourism industry which sees the town's population quadruple in the summer months. Due to the age profile of some of these tourists, the lack of the SouthDoc service has become an issue in the past few years.</p>
            <p eId="para_79">At a public meeting I attended with other public representatives, it became apparent that it is a major issue in the town. I want the Minister and the Department to look at where we are going with the SouthDoc service for the people of Kinsale. There are genuine concerns not only for the residents but also for the tourism industry. It was taken away in 2014 because of financial constraints, but it is now appropriate to look at reinstating this service. The physical infrastructure, the building, is still there. All we need is the will on the part of the Department and I hope I might get some news on that today in order to progress this very important issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_80">I thank the Senator for raising the issue. The Government is committed to enhancing primary health care services, including GP services, throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> Patient needs for health care can arise at any time and GPs contracted under the GMS scheme must make suitable arrangements to enable contact to be made with them, or a locum or deputy, for emergencies outside normal practice hours. While GPs are not obliged to participate in out-of-hours co-operatives as a means of meeting the contractual requirement, such services have been developed and expanded over time and are now an essential part of our primary care services. This helps to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, urgent care needs are met in the primary care setting.</p>
            <p eId="para_82"> SouthDoc operates and provides out-of-hours GP services in Cork and Kerry. The HSE provides funding to support this service, including the costs of triage nurses, call centre, treatment centres, drivers, cars and receptionists. Of more than 215,000 patients that SouthDoc dealt with in 2016, approximately 10,000 were from the Bandon and Kinsale area. In 2013, SouthDoc undertook a review of the service across the Cork and Kerry area. The review considered issues such as levels of activity, availability and sustainability of GPs in each area as well as value for money. This review resulted in changes to service delivery in a number of areas, including Kinsale. SouthDoc took the decision to establish the main centre for this area in Bandon, and base the doctors there on weekdays from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. and for the weekend service, while retaining a treatment centre in Kinsale. After 11 p.m., one doctor on-call is based in the Bandon treatment centre and travels out as required. If a backlog remains at the 11 p.m. handover, the second doctor will remain on duty as required to deal with the patients waiting to be seen. The levels of activity in this area and the access to an alternative location within a distance of 19 km were key considerations when making the decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_83"> The HSE has advised that at least two doctors continue to be on duty in the area, supported by additional doctors, when necessary. The doctors are also backed up by the wider SouthDoc infrastructure and resources, including a triage nurse team in headquarters. For all those in Cork and Kerry who contacts SouthDoc, a patient's condition will dictate the appropriate treatment and its delivery location in line with clinical protocols. Patients are contacted directly and given a suitable appointment time in the appropriate location which may be in either treatment centre or could be a home visit in the case of a patient being unable to travel. At all times, the progress of each patient is clinically managed on an individual basis in line with that patient’s condition. The HSE has advised that 80% of all patients are treated within 90 minutes of initial contact.</p>

            <p eId="para_84">I thank the Minister of State for his very detailed response on what is a very serious issue for the people of Kinsale. I hope there will be a review at some stage into the service to see if this station could be reopened, particularly at night. That is the key issue. There is a feeling in the town that this needs to be looked at. If the Department were doing a review, it might consider Kinsale in light of that review.</p>

As it is in my constituency, I will be more than happy to progress the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_89">I welcome the Cathaoirleach back to the House and wish him a happy new year. Although the Government seems to be making a large number of announcements regarding housing figures, many of which have contradicted previous announcements, the harsh reality is that there is a cohort of people, including families with children, who are living on the verge of homelessness having been served with termination notices by their landlords who are, in many cases, selling up. This week alone two such families have called to my office and to the council looking for assistance. I am very disappointed by the services on offer by the various local authorities for those who are not homeless yet but who are on the verge of homelessness. People in these circumstances are turning to organisations such as Threshold or the Mercy Law Resource Centre which are filling in the gaps left by the State. In a situation where the Government is claiming false wins in terms of allocations to those who move from rent allowance to the housing assistance payment, HAP, it is disgraceful that the local authorities are not doing more to help those in receipt of the HAP to navigate the process with private landlords. We know how difficult it can be to get private landlords to accept HAP tenants in the first instance but more involvement on the part of local authorities with landlords could build trust and confidence for both tenants and landlords to ensure that the HAP system works better. It is important that we question to use of the HAP to demonstrate an increase in social housing allocations as many local authorities are simply moving people from rent allowance to the HAP. They are not actually increasing the allocation but simply changing how the figures look. I call on the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to come to the House to address these matters, particularly how local authorities could facilitate those in receipt of the HAP. Obviously, I am not saying that HAP is the solution - we need to ensure we have a State-wide house building programme - but it is what is available.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> The second issue I wish to raise relates to the backlogs and waiting lists at the Property Registration Authority of Ireland, PRAI, and the probate office. Applications in both offices are taking up to 11 months to process.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">In circumstances in which housing construction is set to increase, support will be needed from the PRAI and probate office. There appears to be a resource issue in these offices. I ask that the Minister outline to the House what he proposes to do to ensure that the backlogs in both offices are addressed and the time for processing applications reduced.</p>

          <from>Senator Gerard P. Craughwell<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T15:35:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_92">I refer to the passing of Lieutenant General Gerry McMahon, who was the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces in 1995 and who gave 45 years of distinguished service to his country. Lieutenant General Gerry McMahon will be missed by many veterans. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> I have spoken many times on homelessness and housing. I congratulate the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on the initiative he announced yesterday. As has been stated many times in the House, it is not possible to resolve the homelessness problem overnight. There is no magic bullet for building houses and apartments at the rate at which they are needed. However, the Minister's initiative provides people who are in rented accommodation and wish to buy a home at realistic prices with an opportunity to do so. However, the initiative has one slight downside, namely, the requirement that participants make a deposit of 10% of the purchase price of the house. While I acknowledge that we cannot fix everything, this requirement is a problem. I am familiar with a case, one with which I have a personal connection, involving someone who has paid €87,000 or €90,000 in rent in recent years. It will be difficult for this person to save a deposit of 10%. I ask the banks to consider the possibility of offering a loan at favourable rates to cover the 10% deposit. While I am aware that this would involve a return to 100% loans, this issue needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> If people outside the Pale who are in trouble with their mortgages could remortgage based on the new scheme proposed by the Minister, they might avoid losing their homes. If I am not mistaken, the 2% or 2.25% interest rate announced by the Minister would mean a couple on a joint income of €75,000 would not spend more than 25% of their income on mortgage repayments. If the interest rates announced by the Minister were to apply, it could result in fewer people being added to the homeless list.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> I appreciate that the €200 million sanctioned by the Minister for the new scheme was probably for new homes only. He could take a further incremental step that would prevent people from becoming homeless. I compliment the Minister who has been getting a great deal of stick for purportedly either doing nothing or doing this, that or the other. He is making slow but sure progress and made one announcement after another. The problem has not been completely fixed, nor will it be completely fixed. The Leader and I will be long gone from the House or, I hope, back after an election before-----</p>

          <p eId="para_99">Like many other people, I was shocked on Saturday to discover that the US Vice President, Mike Pence, had taken part in a military photo opportunity with American troops at Shannon Airport. This incident raises a number of concerns. Ongoing concerns about the use of Shannon Airport for military transfer, which have been well aired in this and the Lower House, have not yet been addressed. There are also specific concerns, including that this military photo-op on Irish soil was for the administration of another country and involved troops who are taking part in actions far outside the triple lock and normal UN conventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">It was also concerning because it was being used at a divisive time in Irish politics. The tweets and messages sent out by the political figures at the time were used as a source of division and were being used in respect of the shutdown in American politics. They were also concerning because - so far away are we from the triple lock now - the mission that the US Vice President, Mike Pence, was on was not a mission in any way related to any kind of UN mission but a mission to promote the active disregard of UN resolutions. It was his mission to travel and promote the opening of an embassy in Jerusalem and several stops thereafter. We have several layers of concern around this trip. I would like to know and I would like the Leader to find out, if he can, the answer to several questions. Was the Government aware of this? How was the Government aware of it? What decision-making took place around allowing such a media opportunity to take place in Ireland on Irish soil?</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> Again, this points to wider concern in the House around the slow erosion of neutrality. We are keeping the word but we are chipping away. We saw homelessness being chipped away as an issue. We have this chipping away now.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> Questions arose at another moment. An article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> before Christmas told us that the numbers being rescued by Irish naval missions in the Mediterranean are going down. Again, I applaud every front-line member, every staff member and every member of the navy. I am proud of them and their unique mandate. We knew that the decline in numbers would materialise because it was signalled clearly by the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe. He told us that humanitarian search-and-rescue was moving down the line as a priority. Now the interception of all supplies to Libya has become different and more of a concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> A motion on permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, was passed before Christmas. It contained no mention at all of peace, peace-keeping or peace-building. I believe it was a mark of disrespect to the House when the Minister of State directly refused to answer questions on whether joint military procurement between Ireland and other countries would be subject to the triple lock, whether it would have appropriate scrutiny and whether we would ensure that when we buy military equipment, it would be used within a UN mandate. He said he would answer questions in the Dáil. I hope he has the opportunity to answer the questions, but I believe those of us in this House are entitled to ask these questions also.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> We know the public supports neutrality. I am calling again on the Leader to communicate to the Government the importance of an active passionate engagement, not only vigilance around our neutrality but passionate embracing of Ireland's role in peace-building. This requires such vigilance and it requires us taking ourselves seriously. It is an important time. It is a hawkish time. Let us step up to that role.</p>

          <p eId="para_105">I extend my congratulations to the 2018 Mayo person of the year, Sr. Maureen Lally. It is a well deserved award. I have known Sr. Maureen well for many years. She has worked tirelessly to empower communities throughout Mayo as well as with individuals to enable them to fulfil their capacity. She is an absolutely wonderful person and a well deserved recipient. The Mayo young person of the year is Michaela Walsh from Swinford. She has broken all Irish records and set new records in hammer-throwing. She is a wonderful example to young people throughout the country. The meitheal award went to the Blacksod and Eachléim community for the part they played in the rescue of the R116 crew and the tragic events last March, as well as to those in the emergency services who worked for many days on the project. I congratulate all of them and we are very much looking forward to them receiving the awards on 10 February.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> Today, the issue of flooding is again in the news ahead of the predicted heavy rainfall and strong tides in the coming days. People living in areas in Mayo such as Crossmolina, Ballina, Carrowholly, parts of Ballcroy and other coastal communities are deeply anxious about what is going to happen in the coming 48 hours and what will happen to them, their families and their livelihoods. These communities and others have never left the headlines when it comes to the destruction caused by flooding.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">In many areas, even through the good weather, homeowners, farmers and business owners are left fearing freak weather conditions and the impact of the heavy rainfall. I know that along with the local authorities, the Office of Public Works, OPW, is developing the catchment flood risk assessment and management plans. Out of this work will come the flood risk management plans, but now is the time to act. Now is the time to provide funding to these communities, and to listen to them on the solutions they have put forward to prevent flooding in the future. It is too late for Ministers to stand in front of the press outside the flooded premises and homes and promise humanitarian aid and assistance. Why are the plans taking so long to finalise? The year 2021 is a long way off. There are another four winters for people to endure first. Is it a question of staff or capacity? If so, what are the plans to address these issues? The plans will not only identify areas at risk, but will also inform developers, farmers and the local authorities in selecting suitable sites for builders. Without these plans we will continue to suffer the consequences of poor planning decisions. </p>
          <p eId="para_108"> My colleague, Matt Carthy, MEP, has highlighted again and again that Ireland is in danger of being in breach of the EU floods directive. The EU may well impose sanctions until the plans are published. The timeframes for the production of reports do not have to be final. The Government can put pressure on the administrative deadlines when it wants to, and I urge it to do so in this case. It will certainly have Sinn Féin's full support both in these Houses and at local authority level. I ask the Minister to appear before the House to have another debate on the flooding issue, and to discuss how we can listen to these communities and directly provide funding to solve the problems there. I wish everybody well in the next 48 hours.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">I wish to let colleagues know that next Tuesday we will be launching the Vótáil 100 programme of events here in Leinster House. That is the programme of events to commemorate the centenary of women's suffrage in Ireland. This year, 2018, marks the 100th year since women achieved the right to vote in 1918. I thank the Cathaoirleach, the Ceann Comhairle and members of our steering committee for all the great work that has been done in producing great publicity materials and putting together a programme of events around women's suffrage.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> I would particularly like to thank the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for allowing the use of the Seanad Chamber for a series of events. I know that the Leader is well aware that we will be holding the final of a transition year debate in this House on 17 April. That is just one of many events. I thank Senators McFadden and Higgins in particular for all their work on the committee. We will be launching the programme next Tuesday at lunchtime. All Oireachtas Members will receive information on the events and one of our special commemorative badges marking the centenary of this important commemoration.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> I commend the leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Micheál Martin, for his speech in the Dáil last week on the report of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, and to say just how impressive I thought the debate in this House on Wednesday evening was. It was extremely respectful and dignified, and there were so many contributions from so many. The Labour Party has always had a consistent record in seeking repeal of the eighth amendment. It is really positive to see the leader of Fianna Fáil coming out with similar words last week. It is time for the Taoiseach to say where he stands on this issue and to show leadership. I very much hope that he will endorse the excellent recommendations of the committee so ably chaired by our colleague, Senator Catherine Noone, and that he will also support the repeal of the eighth amendment in the way that Deputy Micheál Martin has done. </p>
          <p eId="para_112"> I call for a debate on housing, as others have done. While it is welcome to see the Government announcing further initiatives to ensure greater access to affordable housing, there is a fundamental problem of lack of supply. I am very glad to see Bob Jordan, the former Threshold chief executive, being appointed national director of the Housing First summit. That is very positive. However, I think Patricia King of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has it right when she says that there is still a lack of urgency and coherence about the initiatives the Government is announcing on housing, and in particular a lack of coherent response to the problem of supply. Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, the Labour Party housing spokesperson, has called for the 700 sites across the country in public ownership to be put to use in the provision of housing as a matter of urgency. There is no issue around ownership. Those sites are already publicly owned. That is the very minimum that should be done as a starting point. </p>
          <p eId="para_113"> I echo the words of Senator Higgins on the recent visit to Ireland of Vice President Pence of the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to go somewhat further than we have done to date and for Ireland to recognise the state of Palestine in light of the comments by Vice President Pence that the US Embassy would be relocating to Jerusalem by the end of 2019. We have already seen nine European Union member states give formal recognition to the state of Palestine. Ireland should also do so. I know the Minister, Deputy Coveney, will be in this House next week and I will be making that point to him at that time.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">I would like to talk about social protection for the self-employed. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection carried out a survey of 20,000 self-employed people last year. In that survey, 76% of self-employed people said they were in favour of a new stamp. The majority wanted it to be voluntary. I would prefer if it was mandatory but I am happy to get it one way or another.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> I have fought for the last six or seven years to get this stamp in place. Through the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection, we have the Mangan report. The report is ready to go. A self-employed person pays 4% in PRSI. The Mangan report says that it would have to increase to 5.5% for the new stamp but it would provide for sick pay and disability pay for self-employed people for the first time. That is very important.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">I thank Senator Norris. The Department is dragging its feet on this issue. The new Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, was the Minister formerly. He was pushing it. We have a new Minister now and I feel that it has been pushed to the back burner, which is not good enough. I appeal to Fianna Fáil, our partners in government. It is in the programme for Government that we progress this new stamp for the self-employed. We are the only country in industrialised Europe that does not have a stamp for the self-employed. That is an absolute disgrace. I welcome all the changes that have happened for the self-employed in the last 12 months. There have been new dental benefits, new access to eye checks and tax equalisation for the self-employed, but this has been dragging on and on. We are talking about a stamp that should have been put in place 30 or 40 years ago, perhaps even 50 years ago. There are 400,000 self-employed persons in this country who go out to work every day and who have no cover if they get sick in the morning or - God forbid - if anything happens to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">I would like to move on without interruption. I would like to raise an issue which I have raised here on a number of occasions, namely, the chronic shortage of teachers throughout our schools. I have highlighted this issue in the House on a number of previous occasions but, unfortunately, nothing has happened on it to date. I understand that our party, Fianna Fáil, has a Private Members' motion tabled for debate in the Lower House tomorrow evening which will again highlight this issue and bring forward what the party sees as solutions to it. I have no doubt that all Members of the Lower House will support that very worthwhile motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> It has been clearly apparent for a long time that schools are finding it extremely challenging to obtain and retain teachers in the right subjects in order that students in schools are able to select the subjects of their choice. I recently heard a statistic in respect of the subject of physics. There are only six physics teachers due to graduate over the next two years. That highlights the problems we have in that subject alone. We have the ongoing cruel situation where young, newly qualified teachers who are doing the same job as their more experienced colleagues in the staff room are being paid less money.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">Their colleagues in the staff room are being paid less for doing the same job. That is very unfair. It has been around too long and needs to be addressed. School principals say that it is nearly impossible to find a substitute teacher when the need arises. Will the Leader invite the Minister for Education and Skills to this House to outline how he intends to address this issue? It has reached a critical stage. We need to retain the teachers we have and to put packages in place to encourage the young teachers, who have emigrated for financial reasons, to come home.</p>

        <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_48">
          <from>Senator James Reilly<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T15:55:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_131">It is welcome that some progress has been made on the issue of people whose pensions were detrimentally affected by the Act passed in 2012. I have raised the issue many times. The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, has been working hard on this and received Cabinet agreement on allowing post-2012 pensioners choose between their current rate and that to be introduced under the total contribution approach. In most cases, people will gain and those who might not gain will not have to change over. I know there is work to be done on correcting the losses sustained in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> Yet again I raise the need for a competent independent regulator to rule on operating conditions at Dublin Airport. Passenger numbers hit 30 million last year, up from 18 million in 2011 when Fine Gael came into government. This is a great success story for tourism but the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and local residents need clarity on planning conditions at Dublin Airport where a new runway is under construction. If the existing planning conditions are applied, traffic at Dublin Airport will be restricted to 27 million passengers which is 3 million fewer. The impact of that on Dublin Airport, with Brexit looming, is there for everyone to see. Each job at Dublin Airport is followed by nine ancillary jobs. Transatlantic passenger figures are up as well because we have USA pre-clearance and there were 3.5 million passengers last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> Dublin Airport is one of the most important economic assets in the country. It supports or facilitates 117,300 jobs and contributes €8.3 billion to the national economy. It was 78 years old yesterday. It supports 20,000 jobs directly. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport needs to come back in here. He cannot go on ignoring this problem. A regulator needs to be put in place and if there is a need for legislation to do it, we need to fast track that. We cannot leave this matter hanging in the balance and creating uncertainty for the people who live around the airport and the important jobs created by the airport and the potential to create more.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> I ask the Leader to call the Minister in to explain his plans. He has had ample opportunity to address this issue. He promised us that the Irish Aviation Authority would rule on this and then decided this would not be the case. He owes it to the people around the airport and to the Irish economy to rule on this and do so quickly. </p>

          <from>Senator Máire Devine<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T15:55:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_135">Both sides of the House might need counselling to prevent the fracture in the harmonious marriage between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. I welcome the closing of the pensions gap as announced by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty. I attended a briefing on this by Age Action and other organisations last week, and their protest outside this House. The main concern is that the pensioners will not receive the money they have lost since 2012. This has been confirmed. They have been wrongly receiving the reduced State pension since 2012 but none of that money will be returned.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">In the solution brought forward today, the Government has failed to do this and to give them back the sum of about €30 per week that they were losing. The new system is to be implemented from March this year without back money. As a means to address the impact of the 2012 change on over 42,000 people, the Government is bringing forward a total contributions model for these people. They will now have their pensions reviewed based on their own entire working lives. I do welcome the review as well as the introduction of the new home caring credit for up to 20 years to assist workers who took time out to raise families and care for others. The long-awaited action by the Government on this matter is welcome. We must also recognise, however, that pensioners will be bitterly disappointed not to receive what was taken from them and what was rightly theirs since 2012.</p>

          <from>Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_137">I agree with the previous speaker. Even though we are delighted with the changes, there needs to be a lot more done. I firmly agree with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> I would like to raise an international issue that has very disturbing local consequences. The UK construction and service company, Carillion, which is involved in six projects in Ireland, collapsed this month. The six Irish projects include five schools, one of which is the Carlow Institute of Further Education. Carillion employed 43,000 people globally and was, until its troubles, a 200 year-old company.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> The issue I have is in my own home county of Carlow. Carillion is a 50% shareholder in the company constructing Tyndall College and Carlow Institute of Further Education. Although the Department of Education and Skills assures me that 90% of the project is complete, what about the last 10%? What is left to be completed? Is it the doors, floors, or walls? What is not finished? Every time I drive by, I see that there is a lot of work still to be done. The last time I checked, 90% was not the same as 100%.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> This is very worrying for parents, teachers, managers, students and for the future. We have no timescale. Carlow needs this project to be finished and I would like the Minister to tell us when and how that will occur. If the company contracted for the project has been forced into compulsory liquidation, will the Department roll up its sleeves and finish the last 10%? This is crucial. We have a fabulous college that needs to be finished. I am aware that the Minister for Education and Skills was in Carlow last week. However, as of yet we have got no commitment. I am asking for a full commitment that the last 10% will be finished and that the college will be completed.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">I express sympathy on the passing of the late Dolores O'Riordan, a native of Ballybricken in Limerick. I attended the funeral over the weekend. As Dolores sat behind me in school, I knew her then. She was a very fine person and a great ambassador not only for Limerick but for Ireland. She was a great performer. I offer my sympathy to her mother, Eileen, her siblings and the rest of the family.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> On the pension announcement today, in the past I have raised the issue of ladies and the marriage bar and the number of people who lost out in their pensions. It is a welcome announcement by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection today that people's accumulated contributions are going to be taken into account and also that there will be 20 years allowed for the homemakers and carers and those who stayed at home to rear their children. This is very welcome news. People do not have to contact the Department. The Department will contact those whom it thinks are affected. It will be effective from March 2018, which is most welcome. As has been said already, 42,000 people have been affected by this in the past. The development is most welcome.</p>

          <p eId="para_150"> At the weekend there were reports in the newspapers of the settlement of an action in the courts. In this case a pedestrian was knocked down by a cyclist who was cycling on the pavement and was seriously injured. A settlement was made. However, although in the United Kingdom cycling on the pavement is illegal it is not so in this country. I ask the Leader to request the Minister to give an opinion on whether it is his intention to introduce such legislation. If not, I will certainly set about drafting and introducing it. It is extremely dangerous for cyclists to cycle on paths. Very often they are cycling very fast on pavements. There are elderly and blind people and it is very easy to knock them down. I have almost been knocked down on several occasions when I have been walking on pavements in Dublin. I do not think it is right, particularly when there is increasing provision for cycle paths.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">I raise my reservations ahead of the opening of the new family hub in Dublin next week. Lynam's Hotel is due to open as a family hub next week and 38 families will be accommodated there. They will have kitchen and laundry facilities, as well as play facilities for children and places for them to do homework. While all of this is welcome, it is not ideal. My concern is that it is being operated by a private company. I understand Dublin City Council is leasing the hotel from the owners. The State will pay the owners to run the facility. I would like to ask the Minister to come to the House because I would like to know how much it costs to provide this service per family and per person and how much the company will make. I have raised this issue on numerous occasions because up to €400 million was spent on companies operating direct provision centres around the country over the past seven years. To my mind, they were never run properly and were never humane. It was not good value-for-money.</p>

          <p eId="para_153">I have always disagreed with it. I believe very firmly that if a family hub centre is going to be run it should be run by a charitable organisation because they know how to do it. The midlands Simon Community in my area has been deemed as the most cost-effective organisation in the country in the provision of homes for homeless people. That is the sort of organisation which should run family hubs. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to discuss how much this is costing and how much the State will pay. I do not agree with the decision.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">I welcome the announcement by the so-called dissident republican group, Óglaigh na hÉireann, that it is ending its armed actions. This is very welcome. The group carried out an horrific attack on the Catholic PSNI member Peadar Heffron in 2010. The group comprises former Provisional IRA members and carried out its first action in 2009. I pay tribute to the men who helped to end it, trade unionist Peter Bunting, Conal McFeely and Fianna Fáil Deputy Eamon Ó Cuív. I also pay tribute to the work of Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and many others who worked with dissident republicans in Maghaberry Prison and elsewhere. The work is very valuable. It is another move in the right direction and towards the normalisation of peace in Northern Ireland and our country. There is no place for violence on the island of Ireland. I hope other dissident groups will follow suit.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> I pay tribute to my neighbour and friend, Paul Young, from Cartoon Saloon who received his third Oscar nomination today for the film "The Breadwinner". His father was Sean Young, a bank manager who came from Ballymaguigan, County Derry and lived across the street from me. We are very proud in Boyle of our two movie stars, Paul Young and Chris O'Dowd. Boyle was also the home of Maureen O'Sullivan who lived up the street from me and played the role of Jane in the "Tarzan" series of films. Boyle is a town from which many film stars have come, which I hope will be recognised.</p>

          <p eId="para_157">I refer to the health service and note that the Minister for Health today presented the bed capacity review to the Cabinet. It is extremely important that there has been a full review and that the agreed number of new beds that are considered to be necessary be opened to deal with the challenges health services face. In opening new beds there is also the challenge of making sure wards will be adequately staffed. When I raised this issue last year, I pointed out that the HSE had been well able to recruit more than 2,000 administrative and managerial staff in a very short period. In responding to the needs highlighted in the bed capacity review I hope we will also be able to employ the additional staff required to provide adequate care for the patients who will occupy those beds.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> The negotiations on the GP contract have been under way for more than 12 months. I firmly believe this issue needs to be given priority and that GPs need support to deal with the increased demand. There has been a major change in the demographics which will continue over the next ten to 20 years. We need to be ready to face the challenges presented by an older population and many more people being retired. There will also be an increased demand on the health service. If sufficient progress is not being made by the National Association of General Practitioners, the Irish Medical Organisation, the Department of Health and the HSE, we should seriously consider looking for an independent chairperson to chair the negotiations. The issue needs to be given priority. We also need to have targets and deadlines to make sure comprehensive health care support will be provided in the community.</p>

          <p eId="para_159">I apologise for arriving late. I was listening to the Order of Business on the monitor. </p>
          <p eId="para_160"> I want to raise a point that is relevant to the one raised by Senator Ray Butler about the self-employed and it is one I have raised on a few occasions. Members of the Oireachtas are not entitled to parental leave, be it maternity or paternity leave. That is a serious issue because we are trying to implement policies that are family friendly in circumstances in which we do not have our own house in order. Senator Ray Butler rightly mentioned the self-employed in this context and has been consistent on the issue. Self-employed women and men who wish to take paternity leave are precluded from doing so because of the reality of their jobs. In many instances, they are providing employment and contributing to the Exchequer in a major way. We need to prioritise policies that are family friendly, given that there are professions other than politics that do not necessarily attract many women. They include surgeons, for example. I believe only 7% of surgeons are women who find the position very difficult. It would be very helpful, therefore, to have a discussion in the House in the near future on this issue and link it with the one raised by Senator Ray Butler, with the Minister for Employment and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, in attendance. Perhaps it was something the Leader had intended to suggest.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> I commend Aldi on introducing a restriction on the sale of high-sugar energy drinks to those aged under 16 years. These drinks have been linked to sudden cardiac death in some instances, but also feed in - pardon the pun - to the obesity problem. It has been long established by experts that the one thing they feel that we, as policymakers, could do is reduce the amount of sugar-sweetened drinks that young people drink. That is a huge driver of the obesity problem with which we are faced. What is proposed is not a panacea and it will not solve the obesity problem. However, measures of this sort are very helpful in the overall scheme of things. I am conscious as well that we are having a discussion on obesity on Thursday so I will leave it at that for now.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">I thank the 16 Senators who contributed on the Order of Business. I join Senator Byrne in paying tribute to Dolores O'Riordan and remembering her today when she is being buried this afternoon in County Limerick. We remember her as a talented musician, a wonderful person, a mum to her children and, as Senator Byrne rightly said, a wonderful ambassador not just for Limerick but for Ireland. We extend our deepest sympathies to her mother, Eileen, her siblings and her children on their tragic loss. I join Senator Craughwell in expressing our sympathies to the family of the late Lieutenant General Gerry McMahon, retired Chief of Staff, on his death. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anam dílis.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> Senator Ardagh raised the issue of housing and the HAP. It is important that we put it in context today that the Government's objective is to reduce the number of people who are homeless and those who are sleeping rough and in emergency accommodation and to provide more social housing. The figures have increased from 700 to 2,000 in 2017 to, I hope, 4,000 this year. We need to continue activation measures to improve the supply of housing, not just in the private market but also in the area of social housing. As the Taoiseach said in the Dáil today, it is important to recognise that the vast majority of citizens own and buy their own homes. It is also important, as Senator Craughwell said, to praise the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, for the work he has done to date. The Minister is committed to ensuring that housing affordability will be a central focus of his work.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> The Government is determined that the housing stock will be increased to 50,000 by 2021 under the Rebuilding Ireland programme. When the Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, was Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, he received multi-annual and ring-fenced funding, as does the current Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in respect of the task at hand. If it was just a case of increasing the budget to solve the problem, that would be the end of it. There are some in the House who believe that the solution is to throw money at everything, but that does not always work. What we must ensure is there is a multi-agency approach involving the Government, the HSE, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and local authorities to ensure that people are able to move from their current situations, whether they are homeless or in temporary accommodation, into social housing. We must also ensure that we can have an affordable purchase scheme and an affordable rental scheme. That is why the Government took the initiative outlined yesterday. I commend the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on the work he has done in respect of the measures outlined yesterday. It will take time.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> We must never forget that the construction sector experienced a lost decade. I will not go back over the reasons for that but those Members who know should recognise that certain parts of that jigsaw have not disappeared. Let us look at what IBEC stated recently about those involved in trades and apprenticeships. The Government must prioritise apprenticeships in the construction sector as a matter of urgency because there is a deficit in terms of some of the skills that are needed now to address the housing problem. We have some work to do and we are doing it. I commend the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, on what he is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> I am not familiar with the second issue Senator Ardagh raised but I would be happy to get the details from her and to talk to the relevant Minister. She is correct that we must put all the building blocks in place together to ensure a collective approach to tackling the matter she raised. I thank her for raising the matter and I will be happy to speak to her about it afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> Senator Craughwell also raised the issue of mortgage arrears. There is merit in what he is suggesting, namely, taking a collective, new approach to addressing the issue. It includes the Government, banks and various individuals involved working to address it. I am concerned about the need to have a 10% deposit. Young people working in many parts of Cork and elsewhere in the State claim it is a major issue which I hope will be addressed in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> Senator Alice-Mary Higgins referred to the visit of the US Vice President, Mr. Pence, to Shannon Airport last weekend. The use of the airport has been well documented, articulated and debated in this House. I do not share the views of the US Vice President on many matters, but I do not believe he was being deliberately provocative in using the opportunity to visit troops heading to Kuwait. He was on a three-country visit. It is important, however, that we keep our neutrality in context. I certainly would not want to see it being chipped away. I will be happy for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, to come to the House in the near future to discuss the issue. Perhaps as a matter of expediency, the Senator might table a Commencement matter because in that way she might obtain a quicker answer. The Minister will, however, be in the House in the coming weeks. I sincerely share the Senator's view that we should not allow anything to chip away at our neutrality, but I do not believe that has taken place in this case. I share the Senator's view that we should not allow the US Vice President to use any of our airports as a bully pulpit to lecture different parties in the US House of Congress, but in saying that, there is nothing to preclude the Taoiseach or Ministers from being interviewed and doorstepped in other parts of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> I join Senator Rose Conway-Walsh in congratulating the Mayo person of the year Sr. Maureen Lally and also Ms Michaela Walsh and the Blacksod-Aughleam community rescue services on their victories in Dublin last week. Those who volunteer and provide services are the heart of communities, for which I commend all of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> The Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, and the Office of Public Works have been very proactive in tackling flooding throughout the country. We saw their success last week in Bandon, County Cork. There are plans in many parts of the country to put flood defence barriers in place. We all want to ensure communities, towns, villages and homes are secure. I am sure the Minister of State will work with all of us to have this matter addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> On the comments of Senator Ivana Bacik, I am not sure I know where to start in commending Deputy Micheál Martin, but I am sure there are many in the Fianna Fáil Party who do not share his view. I thank all Members for their participation in the debate in the House last week which was very measured, responsible and respectful. To give him credit, I commend Senator Gerry Horkan who chaired much of the debate in the absence of the Cathaoirleach for doing a very fine job.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> I join Senator Ivana Bacik in commending Senators Gabrielle McFadden, Alice-Mary Higgins and all members of the Vótáil 100 group for the work they are undertaking to celebrate the centenary of universal women’s suffrage. It is great that the Seanad Chamber will be the forum in which the debate will take place on 17 April. I certainly hope it will be a year of celebration.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> Senator Ivana Bacik should note that the Taoiseach has always shown leadership. It is prudent that, as Head of the Government, he take time to listen and engage before announcing his own decision and making his statement on the eighth amendment. I am sure he will do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> I will be very happy to have a debate on housing and the approach taken by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. I join the Senator in congratulating Mr. Bob Jordan, a former adviser to the former Minister responsible for housing, Deputy Simon Coveney, on his appointment to Housing First.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> Senator Ivana Bacik also aired her views on the visit by the US Vice President, Mr. Pence.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> Senators Ray Butler and Catherine Noone referred to the self-employed. It is an important issue that Senator Ray Butler has consistently championed in this House and one on which we need to see continuing work, building on the Mangan report. I will be happy to have a debate in the House on the issue in the coming weeks. I agree with the Senators on the need for the self-employed to have greater rights and entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> Senator Robbie Gallagher referred to the teacher shortage. It is worth noting that there will be a debate on the issue in the other House this week and that since 2012, 8,900 more teachers have been employed in schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">There is an issue regarding substitution and replacement. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, has been proactive with the different teaching unions with regard to the recruitment of teachers in physics, home economics and other subjects. There is a need for recruitment to continue but also to change the way we recruit and advertise teacher training. The number of people applying for teacher training has remained consistent over the past several years.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> Senator Gallagher also raised the issue of pay inequality among teachers. I share his view but a significant amount of work needs to be done on pay equalisation. I hope the basis for change can be made in the coming months. I would certainly be happy for a debate on that matter in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> Senators Reilly, Devine, Byrne and Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of pensions. Senator Reilly has always been to the fore on this matter, raising it in the House frequently. I welcome today's announcement by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, on this matter. It is the beginning of the next phase of the Government's work in this area. The Government has agreed to allow post-2012 pensioners to choose between their current rate and that to be introduced under the total contributions approach. A new total contributions approach will be available to pensioners affected by the 2012 changes and will include a new home caring credit of up to 20 years. Back money will be given to people. The approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women whose work historically included an extended period outside the paid workforce at home while raising families in a caring role. I very much welcome the work done by the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty. I commend Senator Reilly, who has always raised this matter, and thank all Members for their contributions on it today.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> I agree with Senator Reilly on the issue of Dublin Airport. It is the main airport of the country and a new runway needs to be built there. As Senator Reilly quite rightly said, there is an obligation on the Minister to come forward to reveal the plans for this and, if necessary, a new independent regulator to take on board the issues raised about it. We need to see it happen immediately as a matter of concern. We do not want to choke Dublin Airport any further. While some of us would argue for other airports, such as Cork and Shannon, to be given a priority, Dublin is our main hub and international airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> Senator Devine raised the issue of counselling. The confidence and supply agreement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael is going quite well. We would be happy not to take any counselling from the Sinn Féin Party which needs to look at other issues also.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of the liquidation of Carillion and the site for a new school in Carlow. Last week, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, issued a statement on the matter. The National Development Finance Agency is the body responsible for the management of public private partnerships on behalf of the Department. It is actively engaged in the projects for six schools on four sites. I would be happy for the Minister to attend the House on the matter. It is important we have these projects completed and that the six schools in question are delivered, particularly the one in Carlow referred to by Senator Murnane O'Connor.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> I join the Cathaoirleach in congratulating Senator Norris on his victory in "Celebrity Home of the Year" and commend him on his generous act of donating his prize money to charity.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> I am not familiar with the court case regarding cyclists to which Senator Norris referred. I would be happy to have the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, or the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, come to the House on the issue of cycling and the use of footpaths. It is important we have a debate on this issue. As more cyclists are using our roads, a harmonious relationship between cyclists, motorists and pedestrians needs to be developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> Senator McFadden raised the issue of the new family hub in Lynam's Hotel, O'Connell Street. She raised valid points regarding the allocation of moneys. It is important we get this right. It is important the local authority and the Department work together to deliver for the families who require this service. I would be happy to have a debate on this issue in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> I join Senator Feighan in commending the work of Oireachtas Members and other people in ending Óglaigh na hÉireann's existence. All of us, who want to promote peace and want to see peace in Ireland, recognise that it took an amount of work to get to today and we commend all involved on that. I also join him in congratulating Paul Young on his nomination for an Oscar award. The Minister, Deputy Madigan, will be in the House tomorrow for a debate on arts and culture. I did not realise Boyle was such a hotbed of talent. The Senator outlined the history going back to the original Tarzan almost and Chris O'Dowd. I commend everybody involved in nurturing that talent.</p>

          <p eId="para_190"> Senator Colm Burke spoke about the health budget and recruitment. It is important to recognise that the Minister, Deputy Harris, has received the biggest allocation in the history of the State in this year's health Vote and more people are employed. The country is in the top five <i>per capita</i> in the world. I agree with the Senator that it is about ensuring that we retain staff. We need to understand it is not just about spending money, but about how we recruit staff, where we recruit them from and where we put them. There is a need for accountability and responsibility in the health budget. It is important to have an honest debate on the health budget. Some people think that allocating money to everything solves the problem; it does not.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> The Senator is right on the GP contract and I would be very happy to facilitate a debate in the House on it. In my opinion primary care is the most important part of the health budget and the health process. It is very important to get the new GP contract right. I agree with the Senator on the need for it to be prioritised. If there is a need for an independent chair, let us bring it in.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> Senator Noone spoke about Aldi's banning of the energy drink, which I welcome.</p>

          <p eId="para_196">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_197">That Seanad Éireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to accept the following measure:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_198">Directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 laying down standards for the reception of applicants for international protection (recast),</p>

        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_70">
          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Charles Flanagan)<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T16:45:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_200">I am very pleased to be in the Seanad to present the proposal of the Government that the State opts into the EU, recast, reception conditions directive 2013 under the terms of Protocol 21, annexed to the EU treaties. Last Wednesday, the opt-in proposal was broadly welcomed and supported by the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> Opting into this directive will align the supports that we provide to international protection applicants fully with EU norms and standards. It will be an important step. It is a progressive step. It reaffirms our commitment to continue to implement our programme of reforms to Ireland's international protection regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">Reforming the protection process began in 2014 with inviting Judge Bryan MacMahon and a group of experts to review our protection system, including supports for applicants. I want to acknowledge the role of Judge MacMahon, his interest in this issue and his continued active engagement in what is an important aspect of Irish life. He and his group made a total of 173 recommendations. The Government committed to undertake a process of reform that has seen positive actions across many Departments and services in order to improve what we do for people in need of protection and the way in which we do that job. </p>
          <p eId="para_203"> I take the opportunity to also acknowledge the hard work of Seanadóirí and the support I have received from them. I acknowledge, in particular, the work of Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin during his time as Minister of State in the Department of Justice and Equality. He is passionate about these issues, as are many in this House, which is why I am always anxious to continue to listen carefully to the views of Members of Seanad Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> Like many Senators, I am concerned about the length of time that applicants spend in the protection process awaiting a final determination. In order to address this issue, the previous Government undertook the biggest single reform of our legislation by introducing a single applications procedure under the International Protection Act 2015. Ensuring that we have a simplified and efficient independent protection process is one part of our commitment to reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> The other part is to ensure we continue to improve the living conditions and the opportunities for regular family life for applicants and their families, in so far as possible, while they await a final decision on their application for protection. We have responded positively to the MacMahon recommendations to enable enhanced family living in our accommodation centres and in the range of supports and services that we provide for international protection applicants. That is not to say everything is perfect or that there is an element of complacency here. We must continue to make progress. I acknowledge the work of my departmental colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, who engages on these issues on a daily basis. Furthermore, members of the MacMahon group continue to be actively involved in the process of reforming the direct provision system, including by playing a role, for example, in the standards development process which is currently well under way. </p>
          <p eId="para_206"> The Supreme Court gave its judgment in the N.H.V. case on 30 May last and declared section 16(3)(<i>b</i>) of the International Protection Act, which prohibits access to employment without any temporal limit for applicants, to be unconstitutional. The Government did not interpret this decision narrowly by simply amending the provision prohibiting access to the labour market in the Act. Instead, it listened to the calls from Deputies and Senators, the MacMahon group and NGOs that Ireland should align its bespoke system with European norms and standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> The Government decided that the State would give effect to the judgment by way of opting in to the European Union's recast reception conditions directive. The Government has chosen to be ambitious and to enhance and protect the rights of international protection applicants and their families. The directive not only provides a framework for effective access to the labour market but also reaches into many other areas which the Government feels it is timely to be validated by the European Commission in order to ensure that we do reach and comply with European standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> In addition to labour market access, the directive also includes important provisions on children's rights, rights for unaccompanied minors, as well as in the areas of health care and education. The directive also defines the required material reception conditions for applicants. Participation in the directive will place the provision of these material reception conditions for applicants on a statutory basis underpinned by EU law for the first time. If approved by the Oireachtas, the State will be required to demonstrate its compliance with all of the provisions of the directive to the European Commission before it confirms our participation. This will be a rigorous process but it will also be a transparent one. I want to assure Seanadóirí that we will continue to make any changes required of us by the European Commission. My Department is leading an implementation group established by the Government to oversee the opt-in procedure and the compliance process within the timeframe set out by the Commission, a period of four months. </p>
          <p eId="para_209"> The directive provides for access to the labour market for applicants who have not had a first-instance decision within nine months of making their application and provided that the delay cannot be attributed to the applicant.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">In determining the level of access to be provided to applicants the implementation group, membership of which is drawn from across a wide range of Departments and services, will be mindful of a number of important factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> The State already has a functioning employment permits system for third country nationals, which we must be careful not to undermine, nor must we take any action that would be detrimental to our legal migration system. The court's judgment acknowledges our role in setting these parameters. However, we all recognise that the Supreme Court has adjudged that protection applicants have a constitutional right to seek employment, one which is not conferred on other third country nationals who are legally residing in the jurisdiction. While the court was also clear that this is not an unfettered right, the Government considers that it is appropriate to apply a balanced approach under the scope of the directive where the level of access required will be in excess of that provided under the employment permits system. Once the State's participation in the directive is confirmed, I intend to provide for access for eligible applicants by way of an immigration permission, which would exempt applicants from the employment permits system and the associated fee.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> In determining the list of sectors of employment to which access will be granted, regard will be had to labour market gaps as well as the skill set of applicants and the expert advice of front-line Departments. We must also be cognisant of maintaining the integrity of the common travel area and the possible impact of the withdrawal of our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom, from the European Union. The Government has agreed that eligible applicants will also have access to self-employment and eligible applicants may now qualify for further vocational training, which was previously unattainable. The operation of these arrangements will be reviewed after 12 months and we will be open to amendments, having reviewed its operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> At the Supreme Court hearing of 30 November last, the State outlined its plans to the court to opt in to the directive, subject to Oireachtas approval, and the four-month process necessitated by the European Commission to confirm the opt-in following formal notification of our wish to be bound by the directive. We respectfully asked the court to adjourn the making of its final order until this process was complete. However, the court decided that the prohibition on international protection applicants accessing the labour market under the International Protection Act 2015 would be struck down on 9 February 2018. The participation of the State in the directive will not be confirmed by the court's deadline as we await the conclusion of the Oireachtas approval process, which is well under way, before we can begin the Commission mandated compliance procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> The decision of the court means that access to the labour market for applicants must now take place under a two-stage process. With the best will in the world, it simply will not be possible for us to have completed all of the procedures required to confirm our opt-in to the directive by 9 February. For this reason, the Government has today decided that a temporary interim solution will apply from 9 February until the date of entry into force of the directive, whereby applicants can access the workforce in two ways. The first entry point under the temporary solution is via the employment permits system of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. All applicants will be able to access this system on the same basis as other non-EEA nationals. In practical terms, this means applicants will be entitled to apply, or have their prospective employer apply, for an employment permit on their behalf to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation in the sectors where the employment permit scheme applies.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> In addition, to bring some clarity to the matter of self-employment I will use my discretionary powers to introduce an administrative scheme during this period to allow for access to self-employment for eligible applicants. This scheme will apply to applicants who have been nine months or more without a first instance decision and will broadly mirror the legislative access provisions to be put in place for access to self-employment once the State opts in to the recast EU reception conditions directive. This is important as I want a smooth and efficient transition into the measures giving effect by the directive in the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> In tandem, intensive work is under way across government to provide for the implementation of the directive pending its formal entry into force. In making this process a success, I want to work with Members of both Houses, employers and all other stakeholders. A further information campaign will be launched nearer the time of entry into force of the directive to communicate the new and enhanced access to the workforce arrangements that will apply once we are participating in the directive. Senators may wish to assist in getting the message out to eligible applicants and I will be delighted to work with them in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> Participation in the directive would be a very positive step in bringing our international protection system and supports for applicants more closely in line with EU norms and standards. There are some areas of the directive, particularly around health and education and State support for unaccompanied minors where we already apply more favourable provisions than would be required and these will be maintained. As I stated, the operation of all the arrangements we intend to implement to give effect to the directive will be implemented after a period of 12 months to ensure they are effective and working properly. I look forward to the debate and will be pleased to engage further with the Seanad in the context of proceeding towards complying fully with the directive, which I expect will take place in June 2018.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LorraineCliffordLee" eId="spk_71">
          <from>Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_218">I thank the Minister for his detailed speech. Fianna Fáil will be supporting the opting in to the directive. I want to use this opportunity to reiterate my real concern about the direct provision system and the lack of implementation in full of the McMahon recommendations. The soft recommendations have been implemented, but the meatier ones have not. As the Minister outlined, there is an opt-in process which takes approximately four months to complete. In the meantime, he will rely on the Employment Permits Act 2003. This will be restrictive and not at all suitable for asylum seekers. Virtually no one will qualify under the Act and the fees are astronomical, considering the weekly allowance afforded to asylum seekers.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> As the Minister outlined, the legislative scheme which will be put in place once we have formally opted in to the directive will be more generous. It would want to be substantially more generous than what is in place and Oireachtas Members will keep a close eye on it. If it turns out to be a farce, it will not be long before we start highlighting it to the Minister. We need to ensure asylum seekers are afforded adequate opportunities to work, as well as the dignity and support needed to get their lives back on track. Essentially, they have fled wartorn countries and come here to look for a new life. If we are not affording them proper opportunities, they might as well have not sought asylum here. The current system is akin to internment. If they are not afforded the dignity of work, education and training to access the labour market, it can be crippling.</p>

          <p eId="para_220">I want to challenge the Minister on certain matters and will be opposing the motion for several reasons. It is not that I am opposed to joining the recast reception conditions directive which is a good measure, but the interim measures raise a series of questions. The Minister has said the opt-in proposal was broadly welcomed and supported at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality. My information from the committee is that a number of questions directly asked of the Minister were not answered adequately. That is the view of certain members of the committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_222">It will be an important and progressive step, but in what direction? The interim measures are a step backwards, which is regrettable. The Minister has said it provides a framework for effective access to the labour force. Does it? I most certainly think not.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> The Minister has said that "in determining the level of access to be provided for applicants, the implementation group, the membership of which is drawn from across a wide range of Departments and services, will be cognisant of a number of important factors." It is welcome that when the interim process is over, the Minister will take steps to effectively raise the allowance paid to refugees. That is important. Under the current regime, the people in question receive €19 a week. How, in the name of God, can somebody who is supposed to be looking after his or her family on €19 a week be able to afford to pay between €500 and €1,000 for an employment permit? It is perfectly obvious that he or she will not be able to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> I have received a communication from the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, MASI. It states that "as people seeking asylum in Ireland and as the people directly affected by this, we ask you not to support the Government's proposed measures today, measures which will impose impossible restrictions on our access to work". That is coming from the coalface. If one wants to know if the boot pinches, one does not ask the boot, one asks the foot. In this case, the foot has made its view clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> Asylum seekers will be limited to jobs earning over €30,000, barred from 60 occupations, including most trades, many care worker and health care professions, construction, retail, domestic work, hospitality and many other sectors. That is a huge range of jobs. It has been pointed out that this measure discriminates particularly against women because most of the jobs that will be open to asylum seekers are male-dominated. We must bear in mind that in 2000 the direct provision system was originally an interim arrangement for a temporary period. However, we have been stuck with it for 18 years. One really is a little concerned about the new interim measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> The man who took the original Supreme Court action, a Rohingya, will not be able to find a job under the new interim guidelines. That to me makes it look as if the interim guidelines are an attempt to frustrate and get around the decision of the Supreme Court. That is something of which we need to be careful. I am rather surprised that the Minister who I know is a decent, humane and compassionate man would stand over an arrangement such as this. Perhaps there might be technical reasons which he can give to the House these ridiculous provisions under which people with nothing will pay between €500 and €1,000 and will be barred from 60 jobs were introduced. I hope he will answer some of these questions because some of them were posed at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and, according to my information, were not answered adequately.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> In the light of these observations, I will be opposing the motion and calling a vote on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_229"> I welcome the motion before the House and the opportunity to speak to it, although we have reservations and concerns about how the Government may interpret obligations it is required to meet in line with the directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> The recast reception conditions directive introduces several changes which, if correctly implemented in practice, will lead to improved and equal reception standards and treatment for many applicants for international protection throughout the European Union. The recast reception conditions directive encourages member states to interpret the provisions included in the directive positively and in accordance with obligations under instruments of international law. The concerns outlined in a letter received by Members today from MASI highlight the severe restrictions - what it calls impossible restrictions - which are worth the Government's consideration before moving forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> There is recognition that detention is an exceptional measure which is to be used as a last resort and can only be justified for a legitimate purpose on six defined grounds and after alternative measures have been explored. This is a point with which the Government will struggle. The exclusion of unaccompanied married children whose spouses are not present in a EU member state from the definition of family members may, in certain cases, run contrary to the best interests of the child principle in Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, especially where a child is dependent on his or her family for support.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">I am aware that a further directive with similar intentions is going through the relevant processes in Brussels and hope it will address issues such as the one I have just highlighted.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> I will speak about the current situation and the abhorrent treatment of refugees and those seeking asylum in Ireland. On 10 April 2000 Ireland entered its next dark period in its treatment of the most vulnerable within Irish society. The then Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, John O’Donoghue, had commenced a new programme aimed at tackling the issue of the State’s dealings with refugees who had come here to seek asylum. These refugees, many of whom were fleeing wartorn areas that had been savaged by so-called western intervention, had come to Ireland in search of safety and in the hope of escaping persecution in their countries of origin. The system known as direct provision was seen as a way of housing them and providing them with the basics they needed to survive while their asylum applications were being processed. I hope the then Minister did not envisage what was to come, as the direct provision system had been set up with the intention of being a short-term measure. Today in the Twenty-six Counties 35 direct provision centres are active. It is estimated that they house a very diverse group of 4,500 people who have a very wide range of needs in terms of support and attention. </p>
          <p eId="para_234"> In the past seven years more than €400 million has been paid to private companies for operating the network of direct provision centres for asylum seekers across the State. The Minister said these firms had been paid more than €57.7 million in the 11 months to the end of November last year, giving an average figure of some €1.2 million per week. In a written reply to my party colleague Deputy Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire the Minister said the figure for this year included €48.7 million for commercial contracts or, in other words, imprisonment for profit, which is certainly not a contentious implication, given the amounts of money involved. Direct provision has become a viable business, with the majority of the centres being run on a for profit basis, which, to me, is galling. To have a profit, one must also have a deficit and it is the deficits seen within this so-called business venture that truly gall me. Like many private companies and much like the private prison system in the United States today, their business models do not seem to centre on ethics or morals but rather on how much milk can be squeezed from the cash cow. Many of the people in question arrived in this country to seek asylum but also a new life in which they could rear their children knowing that they would be able to tuck them into bed every evening and in which dignity would not have to be fought for tooth and nail and that would allow them to live rather than merely exist, for which they would be very grateful. </p>
          <p eId="para_235"> Senator David Norris has referred to the letter received from the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, MASI. We also received a letter today from colleagues on behalf of Doras Luimní in Limerick. They have asked us to ask the Minister a number of questions on their behalf, specifically about the proposals concerning the right to work being considered. They ask if those already in the system will be included in the proposals or whether the right to work will only be afforded to new applicants. They also ask that there be no restrictions on the professions and sectors in which asylum seekers will be able to seek work, that they continue to be allowed to reside in their current direct provision accommodation and that they be allowed to claim their full social welfare entitlements after working for a period, just like other workers from other countries. </p>
          <p eId="para_236"> As we know, in the past 17 years Ireland has not had a shining record in its treatment of asylum seekers. To some extent, we all bear a collective responsibility for this in terms of the culture that has prevailed where it is seen as acceptable to allow people to move into direct provision accommodation and be forgotten about. I hope the directive, if passed, will go some way towards changing the negative experience for the people in question.</p>

          <from>Senator Frances Black<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_237">I welcome the Minister to the Chamber. I am really glad that we have been given a chance to debate this issue. The discussion at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality committee last week left several questions unanswered and much more detail is needed on how Ireland will comply in practice with the EU reception conditions directive, particularly the right to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> The directive is welcome. It is good to see conditions for asylum seekers being put on a statutory footing and that they will be subject to greater parliamentary oversight. The provisions on access to vocational training and health care and improved support for vulnerable persons such as those who have been the victims of violence or torture are very welcome. We must bear in mind, however, that the directive merely outlines the bare minimum standards. For example, it states asylum seekers will have the right to work no later than nine months after their initial application, but the reality is that the majority of EU member states afford a right to work after six months or less. Ireland should stand up for human rights, especially given that under the International Protection Act 2015, applicants are supposed to receive a decision after six months. More detail is needed on some of the changes to be made under the directive. It states, fore example, that the payments made to asylum seekers must ensure and respect their dignity. Is the Minister satisfied that a payment of €21.60 a week is enough to ensure their dignity, even though it makes it impossible for them to pay for clothes, books, travel and other vital aspects of daily life? The directive also states particularly vulnerable asylum seekers will have access to special reception conditions. What systems will be put in place to identify and support such persons? </p>
          <p eId="para_239"> Like many of my colleagues, I am most concerned about asylum seekers’ right to work. When we last debated this issue in October, I outlined my worry that the Government's response to the Supreme Court's decision would be overly restrictive. Three months later that, unfortunately, seems to be the case. The interim scheme for employment that has been outlined is deeply restrictive and a shameful attempt at vindicating asylum seekers' constitutional rights. Under this proposal, asylum seekers will be limited to jobs earning over €30,000 and barred from over 60 occupations, including in the construction, health care and hospitality sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Asylum seekers who receive €21.60 a week from the State will be asked to pay up to €1,000 for a work permit. Even as an interim scheme, this is clearly ridiculous. It will disbar the vast majority of asylum seekers from actually seeking employment and not amount to a substantive, effective right to work. </p>
          <p eId="para_241"> There is a real concern that the scheme will not comply with the Supreme Court’s ruling, meaning that every single day of the four month interim period we will be violating the constitutional rights of asylum seekers. In that context, a legal challenge against the State can be expected. On the basis of the interim scheme, the brave Burmese man who actually persisted and brought the case to the Supreme Court would not be able to accept the position of chef at the direct provision centre in which he is living. </p>
          <p eId="para_242"> We urgently require further concrete details on how the right to work will operate once the EU reception conditions directive is transposed. My big concern is that what is being introduced as an interim measure will end up being the permanent scheme of employment for asylum seekers. Direct provision was supposed to be a temporary measure in 2000, yet the system still persists nearly two shameful decades later. The call in this Chamber is loud and clear that we do not want a longer term employment scheme under the EU reception conditions directive to be as punitive and restrictive as the interim scheme. We are told that the €1,000 permit fee will be waived, but we need more detail in writing on salary or sectoral restrictions. If such restrictions are put in place, the Government should be willing to justify in writing exactly why it believes it is necessary to stop asylum seekers working in health care services, for example. It would be useful if the Department were to provide a formal outline of all of the changes to be made to the current system and, ultimately, in the longer term scheme under the directive. It could be accompanied by a comparison with the position in other EU countries. </p>
          <p eId="para_243"> Overall, the right to work is about much more than a job. It is about self-esteem, human dignity and the chance to put one's skills and talents to productive use. It is about one's mental health and the health of one's children. It means better integration into Irish society and better job prospects when asylum seekers exit the carceral system of direct provision. I want to quote what one man in the asylum system who appealed to Judge Bryan MacMahon said. He said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_244">Just let me work. Let me get up in the morning. Let me put on my clothes and have my breakfast with my children, and come back in the evening and say – today I worked. </p>
          <p eId="para_245">This is not someone who is looking for support but someone who wants to be able to support himself and enjoy the basic human dignity given by using his skills and talents. The Government talks about this being a republic of opportunity, but effectively if we deny people the right to work, we condemn them to poverty. Where is the opportunity in that? I urge the Minister to recognise the fatal, restrictive flaws in the interim scheme and ensure it will not form the basis of the employment system once the EU reception conditions directive is transposed.</p>

          <from>Senator Martin Conway<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_246">I welcome the opt-in to this EU directive. I attended the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and I believe the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, made a fair and comprehensive effort to address the very technical and detailed questions posed to him. The Minister would be the very first to accept that this is not a panacea to resolving all of the many challenges associated with direct provision. On numerous occasions in the past, I have said this is probably something for which a future Taoiseach will have to apologise in the Houses of Oireachtas, in particular in respect of the children who have grown up and spent the most formative years of their lives in direct provision. It is in a similar vein to what happened in institutions run by the Roman Catholic Church and others in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> That said, much has happened since the McMahon report. It is a fair comment that the easy recommendations have been implemented but that is the case with every report. There are many recommendations in reports and the more straightforward ones will, of course, always be implemented first. That is just common sense. Anyone who would suggest otherwise is not living in the real world. It is welcome that members of that particular group are still engaged in this process. It is an incremental process. It is something that is being dealt with. It was established 18 years ago as a knee-jerk reaction to a difficult situation where thousands of people were presenting themselves in this country. These centres were established as a temporary measure in order to put a roof over their heads.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> What happened then was that the cumbersome and complicated process of assessing their applications kicked in. There were judicial appeals and court cases. Some cases are gone to Europe. People found themselves in the system for a lot longer than they should have. Everybody accepts that. International best practice can be seen in Portugal. If a person is in a reception centre there for six months, he or she is in them too long. However, NGOs in Portugal will still say that they are not satisfied with that system.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> I do not think a system has been created anywhere in the world to deal with this particular problem which meets the satisfaction of all the stakeholders and parties involved. We can always do better. I salute the former Minister of State, Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, a colleague of ours. The issue of direct provision had just been dangling there until he caught it by the scruff of the neck in order to do something constructive and productive. I have spoken to him privately and in exchanges in the House and have no doubt he finds it very frustrating and gets very angry at times at the slow process in dealing with it. There is no bad faith on the part of the Minister or those close to him in addressing this problem. Now that we find ourselves in a better place economically it brings with it very clear responsibilities to deal with this issue as quickly as we can. Those who arrive on our shores and present to us for care, assistance and support are the most vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> We have a very clear international obligation to respect their dignity, integrity and decency. We are a decent nation and society. That is what we should be doing and I know that is what we all parties here aspire to. There was a very fair effort by the Minister to address concerns. As we all know, when these EU directives are implemented and become policy, all the ancillary regulations, associated paperwork and explanatory documents usually come down the line. It would be rare that all the bells and whistles from A to Z, the dictionary of implementation, would be available ahead of the directive being brought into force.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> I appeal to Senator Norris in the spirit of co-operation not push this to a vote because I do not think it would be right. I know Senator Norris's intentions-----</p>

          <p eId="para_260">I am blushing. I did not even need to wear a pink shirt today because if I had worn a white one, my rosy cheeks would have been reflected in it given the wonderful things that people are saying about my work in government.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> I appreciate what the Minister is trying to achieve. That is all very well but, unfortunately, I have to take the same tack as Senator Norris in opposing the measure in front of us for a number of reasons. This all comes from a Supreme Court judgment. That is unfortunate because during my time in the Department of Justice and Equality, and working with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, this came from a sense of justice. I refer to a sense of a great injustice that was being done in our society. As Senator Conway said, in years to come, there will be a State apology for those who have been languishing in the system for a long time. It has come from that. Something needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> The strongest voices in Irish society on the issue of direct provision were in this very Chamber, right across the political divide. What upsets me is that the reaction to what needed to happen came from a Supreme Court judgment. It did not come from within the Department itself or from the political leadership in the Department but because the Minister was told to do it. That is a great shame. In six weeks' time the Taoiseach will be in the White House and will hand President Trump a bowl of shamrock. I am sure that in a side office somewhere, he and his representatives will say to President Trump that he needs to do something about his immigration policy and that it needs to be a bit more humane to the Irish. Yet, we have 26,000 undocumented workers who need regulation. We will not do what we are asking the Americans to do. Ireland and Lithuania are the only two countries in Europe which refuse point blank to give asylum seekers access to the labour market.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> As was so eloquently put by Senator Black, that sense of dignity of coming home, washing one's hands after a day's work and talking to one's children about that work is the reason for getting up in the morning. It is fundamental to our identity. It also leads into all these myths about asylum seekers in terms of what they can and cannot do and the entitlements they have. We have all heard them. They are all lies. An asylum seeker is not entitled to work, even if he or she wants to.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> What is frustrating is the lack of leadership. The political leadership in the Department should be sick to the pit of its stomach at the scenario that we are overseeing and should be trying to change it. I refer also to the hypocrisy of going around the world talking about immigration policy when we cannot do it ourselves. I love the paragraph in the Minister's speech in which I am mentioned, but I take issue with it. It states that the court's decision means that labour market access for applicants must now take place under a two stage process and uses the words "with the best will in the world". I have, and the Minister probably has, the best will in the world but the Department of Justice and Equality has lost any credibility to utter a statement about having the best will in the world. It has shown zero goodwill to any asylum seeker who comes to this country. I know from my time there that the overarching phrase it wants everybody to think about, which it would almost have painted on every wall in the Department, underneath the bulletproof windows, is "pull factor". Before doing anything in the Department of Justice and Equality, one must be concerned at all times about the potential pull factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">That is really what drives this debate. The idea of having best will is, unfortunately, bordering on laughable. It will not be possible for us to have completed all the procedures required to confirm opting in to the directive by 9 February. The Supreme Court judgment was made on 31 May, if I am not mistaken. The judgment called on the Department to do something within six months and then gave the Department another two months to do something. If the Government was serious about this issue, it would have seen the Supreme Court judgment on 31 May as a fantastic political opportunity to set things right. It was an opportunity to declare that no longer would Ireland be one of only two countries in Europe not to allow asylum seekers into the labour market, no longer would we be an outlier in this regard and no longer would we have a questionable record when it comes to direct provision and the housing of asylum seekers. We can do this far better but unfortunately that was not the reaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> The suggestion that we operate an employment system under the 2003 Act has been made. It has already been stated that an applicant would have to earn over €30,000 per year. I recognise there is the potential to waive the €500 or €1,000 fee to enter the scheme. There are approximately 60 jobs that an applicant cannot do. The measure reflects classic Department of Justice and Equality thinking. I mean no disrespect to people who work in that Department. However, I know what the Department of Justice and Equality is like. It is about security, law and order, the Garda and prisons. It covers a vast bulk of legislation that goes through these Houses. That is what the Department of Justice and Equality is for. Those in the Department do not really believe that it is their job to have a humanitarian outlook when it comes to issues of people coming to this country to seek asylum. They always refer to the pull factor. We know there have been difficult cases of people who have been possibly raped or victims of violence or torture and who have come into this country. Regardless of the issue, there will always be an official somewhere in the Department who will whisper into the ear of the Minister or the Minister of State words about the pull factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> On that basis I regret to say the Labour Party will not support this move in the Seanad or the Dáil. We will support any vote that is called to reject the measure not because we want to do it, but because when it comes to best will and good will we have gone far past the capacity to believe a word that comes from the Department of Justice and Equality on this issue.</p>

          <from>Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_268">Aontaíom le cuid mhaith a bhfuil ráite ag na Seanadóirí eile romham. This really is a heartless and cynical move by the Department of Justice and Equality. We held a direct provision protest in Galway on Saturday. Several brave people who are in direct provision centres and who are afraid to speak out normally, spoke out publicly. They told us again of their plight within the direct provision system. To say they are disappointed with this news would be a major understatement. They are absolutely devastated. Following the Supreme Court ruling, they believed there was a chink of light at the end of the tunnel for them and their plight. Some of them have been in direct provision centres for ten or 12 years. Their lives have been put on hold unfairly. They have not been allowed to update their qualifications or show example to their children by going out to work and providing a living for their families. They are absolutely devastated.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> Representations have been made to us by several organisations. Possibly the most pertinent today are the representations from the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland. MASI stated this move, if it is allowed to pass through the Houses – I hope it is not – will impose impossible restrictions on access to work by asylum seekers. MASI stated the Government has not given any detail of what the right to work will look like once the opt-in to the directive is complete. In the meantime, MASI states the Government's proposed interim measures are punitive, to say the least. Under the proposal, asylum seekers will be limited to jobs that pay over €30,000. They will be barred from over 60 occupations, including most trades, many care worker and health care professions, as well as the construction, retail, domestic work, hospitality and many other sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> Let us reflect on that matter. We are crying out for nurses and health care workers. I have met many qualified people within the direct provision system who could help in that regard, but we are blocking them from doing so. MASI states the list of restricted occupations is shocking and that, in addition, these proposals will require asylum seekers to somehow come up with €500 to €1,000 for a work permit.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> My reading of the proposals suggests this is not really about the right to work but about the right not to work. It is about designing some measures to ensure that no one or very few within the direct provision system would have any chance whatsoever to qualify for the right to work. It is absolutely disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> MASI maintains that the interim measures mean few of the people seeking protection in Ireland will have the opportunity to earn their own living or support their families. However, that opportunity is really important to them. We can all go home. I can go home to my family and children. I have earned my wage or my crust and can show example to my children. However, we are not allowing these people to do that. It is a basic fundamental human right but the Minister is blocking them from it. I appeal to the Minister at this stage to pull back from this measure and to implement the spirit of the Supreme Court judgment.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> MASI maintains that this interim measure is a cynical box-ticking exercise that is already negatively affecting the lives and futures of living, breathing human beings. The brave Rohingya man who brought his case on the right to work to the Supreme Court would be barred from working under the Government's interim measures. That surely cannot be right. Perhaps the Minister can answer that question. Does the Minister think it is right that the man who was brave enough to go to the Supreme Court would himself be barred under this measure?</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> I welcome the comments of the Irish Refugee Council. The council states channelling access to this right by the employment permit process is inappropriate and restrictive. The council also questions why two separate phases are necessary for the implementation of this right, especially since the Government has known of the Supreme Court decision since May 2017. I and other Senators have raised that question. We asked the Minister to bring forward proposals rather than leaving it until the last minute. What has he done? The Minister has left it until the last minute. Was that by design or default? My fear is that it was by design.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> MASI notes that waiting times on asylum status determination in Ireland are at crisis point. Thousands of people have already waited for more than a year for an initial decision. The right to work should be retrospective and immediately available to people in this position. Why has the Minister not taken that position?</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> MASI states it is discouraging to still hear concerns about the right to work being a pull factor. To be honest, so many people believe that is the real motivating factor of the Department. MASI states that for the right to work to be truly effective, access to the labour market should be without restriction as far as possible. People should be given access to the labour market if they have waited six months for a decision. They should be free to work in any sector or be self-employed. This right should apply to new applicants and those to whom the transitional provisions of International Protection Act 2015 apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> Senator Ó Ríordáin referenced the Irish abroad who are looking for the regularisation of their status. The big difference in this case, thanks be to God, is that most of them have not had to flee war-torn areas or persecution. The people in this system have had to do precisely that. That makes it a double injustice.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> Doras Luimní has expressed disappointed in what was outlined by the Government. The organisation has recommended the following: access to the labour market be granted to people seeking asylum no later than six months after an initial application and that this should be retrospectively applied; no restrictions should be in place; the residents of direct provision centres should be able to retain accommodation in direct provision during any period of employment, if needed; and asylum seekers who have access to the labour market should have a right to claim social welfare payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> MASI has expressed particular concern that what was introduced as an interim measure would end up being the permanent provision for asylum seekers accessing employment. We have a wonderful example in direct provision of what was to be a temporary measure but which is certainly temporary no longer. That really is the fear.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> No Senator should support this measure. The Government should go back and bring in a proper measure in line with the spirit of the Supreme Court ruling. Such a measure should fully live up to the obligations under the right to work directive rather than what is being proposed. I appeal to all Senators in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> I welcome comments from the Immigrant Council of Ireland. I do not have time to read those comments but the council has been critical of the measure. All the organisations dealing with asylum seekers as well as asylum seekers themselves are calling on the Government not to bring in this measure as proposed. The Minister should go back and do the right thing. I call on all Senators to oppose it strongly in this House and I appeal to Deputies in the Dáil in that regard also.</p>

          <p eId="para_287"> I call on the Minister to clarify something. I agree with what everyone in the Chamber has said in respect of how restrictive the measure is. Is the purpose of the motion not to sign up to the EU directive in order that we will strengthen the rights of the vulnerable people and the people in direct provision who we are talking about in the long term?</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I believe I am right in saying this is copied and pasted from the Employment Permits Act 2003 in respect of the restrictions. That is my understanding. It took the restrictive process from the Employment Permits Act 2003 and brought it into the present. I understand that people fear that this will not remain an interim thing and will become long-term. Will the Minister explain what will happen if we do not sign up to this EU directive? How do we improve the situation in respect of people's right to work if we do not participate in this EU directive? That is the information I am looking for.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">I thank the Senators for their consideration. I want to point out that, as Senator Ruane has said, it is important that we have the opportunity of opting into the EU reception conditions directive, recast, because we need to bear in mind the key benefits it will bring to applicants and their families during their time in our protection process. Of course, we are using the opportunity afforded to us by the Supreme Court to continue the programme of reforms we have been undertaking since 2014. I thank Senators for their support. I am seeking the permission of the Seanad to proceed along the avenue of opting in. If I do not get that permission and it is not forthcoming, we will have a challenge and we will not be in a position to proceed along the lines that Seanadóirí have indicated they believe to be best. I very much agree with Senator Ruane's sentiment.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> I understand the issue of access to the labour market is a key consideration for everybody here, as it is for applicants themselves and for all stakeholders. I also appreciate the fact that some Senators have stated that they find the temporary access arrangements to be unduly restrictive. I have to say these arrangements are temporary. They are short-term and will be in place until such a time as we opt in.</p>

We must consider jobs, social protection, health rights, children's rights, education and vocational training. There are nine Departments involved in a whole-of-Government approach to this issue. I am anxious to ensure that this issue can be dealt with in a way that provides access to work under the directive for those who wish to avail of it. In the meantime, I need the permission of the Oireachtas and the European Union requires a four-month compliance process to allow us in.</p>

In response to a question which she posed to me, the full accounts of the McMahon recommendations are published online. They set out actions taken. In excess of 95% of the recommendations have been wholly or partially implemented. Mr. Justice McMahon himself has called for the opt-in. He is in favour of it. The non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that have been quoted have also called for Ireland to opt in to the directive. They have been calling for that for some time. They are still calling for it. As soon as we indicated that we were in a position to move on towards the opt-in process, opposition arose. I must say to Senator Norris and to Senators who are minded to vote against the motion that they will be frustrating the avenue or roadmap which is available to us to ensure that we can opt in.</p>

          <p eId="para_319">The effective right to work will result from the opt-in. I acknowledge what Senator Black has said in that regard. The opt-in process will guarantee that the new scheme will be required to be up and running within a period of four months. There was a common concern among Independent Senators that the short-term or transition measures, to which there has been so much reference in the course of the debate, would become long-term or more permanent. I assure Senators that will not be the case. We are continuing our preparations to ensure that the directive enters into full force at the earliest opportunity and as quickly as possible. A key part of this process, however, is the approval of the Seanad, without which we cannot proceed to notify our EU colleagues formally that we wish to participate in the directive. I say that particularly in response to the questions posed by Senator Ruane. Both the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, and I are committed to ensuring our protection process is fit for purpose and that all applicants are treated in a humane manner and with the dignity they deserve while their applications are being decided on.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">I also aim to reduce the case load on hand as quickly as possible to get to a point where a first instance decision is issued within nine months, as far as applicants are concerned. I ask Senators to approve our participation in the opt-in. I am happy to come back in the coming months while we are in the course of finalising our programme for opt-in to keep Senators informed of developments in the matter of progress.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Stanton as bheith anseo inniu. Is mór an onóir dom ar son Fhianna Fáil, agus Seanadóir Diarmuid Wilson, Seanadóir Paul Daly agus Seanadóir Robbie Gallagher, an bille tábhachtach seo a chur chun tosaigh sa Seanad anocht. Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le mo pháirtí Fianna Fáil agus ár seanadóirí go léir. Go háirithe ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt do mo chomhgleacaí, an Teachta Pat Casey, Teachta Jim O’Callaghan agus Teachta Dara Calleary, leis an tacaíocht leis an mBille seo. Freisin, fuair mé go leor tacaíochta leis an mBille ó roinnt comhairleoirí. Mar a duirt mé, is mór an onóir dom An Bille um Threalamh Tarrthála Beatha a chur chun tosaigh sa Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> I welcome John Fitzgerald to the Visitors Gallery. As co-chair of Community First Responders Ireland, he has attended Leinster House on a few occasions to give demonstrations and presentations to Oireachtas Members on hitting home the importance of bystander CPR. He can attest to the importance of a Bill such as this one. This is a very simple Bill that seeks to introduce a new specific offence of interfering with life-saving equipment. The genesis of this Bill was December 2016 when we witnessed the incomprehensible acts of thuggery with the theft and destruction of a defibrillator on Abbey Street in Arklow, County Wicklow. I was struck by the comments from the chairperson of Arklow Community First Responders, Mr. John Summers, about the "mindless, senseless and savage attack."</p>
          <p eId="para_364">The Arklow Community First Responders had put that defibrillator in place through community fundraising. John Summers said: </p>
          <p eId="para_365">I can't accurately describe my feelings at finding it but it was a mixture of anger, disgust, sadness, nausea and probably a lot more emotions that I can't find the words for right now. I just can't comprehend how someone can destroy a piece of very expensive lifesaving equipment paid for by the generosity of the local community.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The idea for the legislation came from CFR Ireland, the organisation representing community first responders, when in the wake of the incident in Arklow it called for stiffer penalties and custodial sentences to tackle the problem. It was then that I started this campaign, which has culminated in the legislation before us. I got to work when I saw its comments in the media. Working initially with my Fianna Fáil colleague, Deputy Pat Casey, from Wicklow and then with party justice spokesperson, Deputy Jim O’Callaghan, we got a Bill published and thankfully it has the full support of CFR Ireland and Irish Water Safety. </p>
          <p eId="para_367"> Much of the media focus in recent years has been on the destruction of or damage to defibrillators or automatic emergency defibrillators, AEDs, but this legislation covers items such as lifebuoys. Since starting to campaign on this issue, I have become even more convinced that the real heroes in Ireland are the ordinary women and men of our country, because their interest in and passion for their communities as well as the welfare of the vulnerable marks Ireland out as a great place. Volunteers who go out and patrol the riverbanks and bridges such as Wexford Marine Watch, or volunteers such as the mountain rescue teams, Civil Defence, the community first responders and the water rescue units are the people who give me great hope for Ireland. This legislation is for them because despite our problems, Ireland is a great place to live and it is a place where I want my young children to grow up. </p>
          <p eId="para_368"> That spirit of voluntarism is something that inspires me; it is the concept of the meitheal. Cuireann sé i gcuimhne dom an seanfhocal Gaeilge, "Ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine”. This is loosely translated as "Under the shelter of each other, people survive." Perhaps it is only in times of tragedy in Ireland that we fully recognise the million small acts of kindness and volunteerism that make us who we are as a people. </p>
          <p eId="para_369"> For me, volunteers reflect a nation's compassion. I often ask myself the following questions. What motivates a community first responder to rush to the scene of a medical emergency? What motivates a member of a mountain rescue team to leave their bed and join others on a misty morning, to go in search of an injured climber? What motivates a member of a river rescue team, which more often than not has the challenge of bringing a body home?</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> What motivated the sub-aqua teams from all over Ireland to come to north-west Mayo to help search for the missing crew members of Rescue 116 last year? What motivated the local fishermen in Blacksod to spend up to six weeks at sea, searching, hoping for a sighting, assisting the naval service and the Garda divers? What motivated a small group of women and men in Ionad Deirbhile in Aughleam to open up Halla Naomh Bhreandáin to ensure that hundreds of personnel involved in the search and rescue operations around Blacksod were catered for? </p>
          <p eId="para_371"> For weeks they provided an incredible compassionate, yet practical, response to the tragedy in Mayo, providing hundreds of meals around the clock, providing a focal point for the families and friends of the missing crew. Last week it was announced that this group of volunteers, Comharchumann Forbartha Ionad Deirbhile, won the 2018 meitheal of the year award at the Mayo Association Dublin awards. With Fr. Kevin Hegarty I was immensely proud to nominate them for that award. </p>
          <p eId="para_372"> Volunteers and voluntarism are the social capital that holds our communities and society together. That is why acts of thuggery like the destruction of a defibrillator or a lifebuoy are an affront to the spirit of voluntarism across the country, something that as a people we are so good at. It is part of our natural psyche and perhaps that is why almost 18,000 people have signed my petition, urging the Government to support this law.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> This legislation rightly recognises the emergency services, but it also recognises the emergency volunteers who regularly put their lives at risk without giving it a second thought. In my mind, this legislation is to honour the hundreds of volunteers from all over Ireland who took part in the rescue efforts off Blacksod for Rescue 116. It is also for every person in every parish, village, town and city who have donated or fundraised to put a defibrillator in place. </p>
          <p eId="para_374"> I have previously spoken about how a stolen lifebuoy is a stolen life. We have seen reports during the year that, for example, Cork City Council had to replace 300 lifebuoys in one year because of theft or damage. This is why I believe that a strong message needs to be delivered to individuals contemplating such irresponsible thoughtless acts of vandalism. Damaging or stealing a piece of life-saving equipment is not ordinary vandalism, such as graffiti or stealing a street sign. These acts directly impact on whether a real person survives an incident in their most critical hour of need. </p>
          <p eId="para_375"> As a doctor, I know that the availability of an AED can be the difference between someone surviving a cardiac arrest or not. The majority of these devices are put in place through fundraising by voluntary community and sports organisations. Other organisations such as the GAA have been extremely proactive in this area, including the establishment of the Cormac Trust, which was set up after the sudden death of Tyrone GAA star, Cormac McAnallen in March 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> I will now outline the sections of the Bill. Section 1 is a standard section, setting out the various definitions used in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> There are two parts to section 2. This is the central part of the Bill as it sets out the details of a new offence of interfering with life-saving equipment. It shall be an offence to interfere with, cause damage to, alter, remove or modify a defibrillator or an automatic external defibrillator. In the second part I give notice of my intention to introduce amendments to the categories of items that are covered under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> There are two short parts to section 3. They both set out the financial and custodial penalties under the Bill, whether for summary conviction and conviction on indictment. The Bill proposes that the upper limits will not exceed a €50,000 fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both. As I said earlier, these financial and custodial penalties are designed to signal how seriously the Oireachtas views the destruction or damage of life-saving equipment. It is no longer tenable to deal with these types of crimes under the Criminal Damage Act 1991. Section 2 of that Act covers the intentional damaging of property and it also provides that a person who, without lawful excuse, intentionally damages any property or is reckless as to whether any property would be damaged and who intends by that damage to endanger the life of another, or is reckless to such endangerment, is guilty of an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> On legal advice and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders I decided that the Bill needed to introduce a specific offence of damaging life-saving equipment. There can be no comparison between graffiti, damage to a park bench or kicking over a bin, and the wilful damage of or inference with a life-saving device. </p>
          <p eId="para_380"> Section 4 relates to attachment orders and has been introduced in order to ensure that any financial penalties by the courts are fully paid, or linked with future earnings. Section 5 deals with the Title and commencement. </p>
          <p eId="para_381"> I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's thoughts on the issues the Bill raises and engaging fully with other Senators throughout this debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_126">
          <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_382">I commend Senator Swanick on bringing the Bill to the House. I congratulate him on his initiative. This is very important legislation. While I do not want to pre-empt what the Minister of State may say in his remarks, there may be aspects of the Bill that need to be tightened. I am happy the Government will support the Bill. It is important to have a conversation about the voluntarism, commitment and patriotism of our community first responders. We also need to look at the case of Cork City Council, which, as Senator Swanick said, has had to replace numerous lifebuoys.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">It is important that the content of the Bill goes beyond the debate today.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> We all agree that vandalism is putting lives at risk and we cannot tolerate that. As I walked in Cork city yesterday, I noted a number of life buoys on the quay walls and there were defibrillators on some of the streets. We assume they are there and ready for use in the case of an emergency. As Senator Swanick said, Cork City Council had to replace lifebuoys last year. A defibrillator on Oliver Plunkett Street in Cork city had to be replaced by the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> Members of the community in Ballinora, a community on the outskirts of Cork city, fundraised to buy a defibrillator and then volunteered for training in how to use it. As Senator Swanick said, that is the epitome of community spirit and all that is good in Ireland. I welcome the guests in the Visitors Gallery and thank them for the work they do on behalf of all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> It is not about having a carrot or a stick, as some people may say. Keyboard warriors on social media will give out about the Bill and say it is a case of Big Brother trying to become more involved in people's lives. We must explore new ways of deterring people from acts of vandalism, as Senator Swanick said. He referenced the Criminal Damage Act 1991. It deals with criminal damage to property generally, which includes life-saving equipment. The Act carries penalties including fines of up to €22,000 and imprisonment for ten years. This debate is about the endangerment of life and how we can ensure vital equipment and infrastructure are not damaged or are not replaced. I make no apology for supporting the Bill because it is about ensuring that people who interfere with and damage defibrillators, lifebuoys or marine safety devices are prosecuted. </p>
          <p eId="para_387"> Weather alerts are issued at certain times of the year. People who go out on our seas, into the air or out on the roads are taking risks when trying to find people. Senator Swanick referred to mountain rescue teams in many parts of the country who go out in very arduous conditions. The Bill is about ensuring that there is a specific commensurate offence in respect of the act which has taken place. We owe these people a debt of gratitude. One of the ways in which we can ensure there is respect for their work and the work being done by bodies such as Cork City Council, which has put in place defibrillators and lifebuoys, is to ensure that life-saving equipment is available.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> Laws must be more explicit. The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, will be complimentary of us in his remarks in terms of what Senator Swanick is trying to achieve. The Bill is about ensuring that there is within our communities a mindset whereby we can educate and change behaviour in order to augment the significant work being done by volunteers. As part of the debate, we should reflect on the need for the Bill. The Title refers to life-saving equipment. The Bill will support the personnel who bravely go out to assist others.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> The Minister of State has an interest in EpiPens and how we can have a community response. As Chair of the health committee, I worked on legislation involving universities and colleges which would have enabled those in need of life-saving EpiPens to have them administered. It is something we need to consider. This is about volunteers in our community and ensuring that we not just applaud their work in a pyrrhic sense but also support them with legislation. It is about sending a strong message and ensuring that criminal damage cannot be tolerated or condoned.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> As I said, this is not about having a big stick or imposing the maximum fine or prison sentence. That is not what we are trying to do. That is not what I understand Senator Swanick and I are trying to do. I want to educate people, but I want to do so in a manner which involves them.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> I commend Senator Swanick and thank him for his work on the Bill. I join him, as I did on the Order of Business, in commending the people of Blacksod and the first responders who won awards in Mayo at the weekend. I thank those all over the country who respond and save people's lives. That is why we have safety awards and need legislation in tandem with other good acts. It is welcome that the Government will support the passage of the Bill to the next stage. I again thank Senator Swanwick.</p>

          <from>Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_392">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire Stáit as a bheith linn. Gabhaim mo bhuíochas agus déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Seanadóir Swanick as an Bhille seo a leagadh os ár gcomhair. Is Bille thar a bheith tábhachtach é a bhfuil deis aige difear suntasach dearfach a dheánamh, ní hamháin fá choinne an cháis seo. Táim cinnte go mbeidh teaghlaigh iad siúd uilig atá caillte mar gheall nach raibh a leithéid d'áiseanna ar fáil ag tacú agus ag leanúint an Bhille seo agus é ag dul ar aghaidh.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> I echo the commendation of Senator Swanick for bringing this Bill before us. It is important proposed legislation. I agree with the Leader, Senator Buttimer, that there will of course be opportunities for us to discuss, tease out and amend the Bill as, it is to be hoped, it progresses through the Oireachtas. From our perspective, there are aspects of the five-year sentence which we can amend, given all the reasons laid out by Senator Buttimer.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> I want to use my time to reflect on the broader sentiment of the Bill and life-saving equipment. A family had to undertake a long-standing campaign in my home city of Belfast. I was the Lord Mayor of Belfast when Joby Murphy, who was on his way home from a concert in the Odyssey Arena, fell from the Lagan Weir and drowned in the River Lagan. His family, in particular his father, campaigned extensively in the city. Joby was missing for what felt like months, given the agonising wait for his family for his body to be recovered from the Lagan. The family undertook a campaign in the city, and more broadly, in the immediate aftermath to locate life-saving equipment around the Lagan Weir and the river.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> Given the tragic loss of Joby and the agony his family had to go through for his body to be recovered, it was bad enough that there was no life-saving equipment in place that might have made a difference. We do not know whether it would have but it might have done had circumstances been different. Can one imagine the circumstances if equipment such as a lifebuoy were missing or damaged so it could not be used when trying to save someone in the river? It has already been said that a piece of this equipment stolen is potentially a life stolen. A piece of this equipment damaged could be the difference between life and death for someone. Therefore, I believe there should be legal repercussions for people who deliberately, consciously or knowingly interfere with, vandalise or damage life-saving equipment.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> I reflected on the contributions that have been made. Senator Swanick mentioned the loss of Cormac McAnallen and the absolutely sterling work undertaken by his family with the GAA and society more generally to ensure access to defibrillators and that we become conscious of the health issues faced by sportspeople. In this regard, can one imagine a scenario similar to the one I mentioned regarding Joby Murphy. Imagine if a defibrillator in a GAA club were found smashed up or stolen when needed. One can only imagine the horror. It is depraved to consciously and knowingly smash or steal such equipment. There is merit in ensuring legal repercussions for anyone who would deliberately seek to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> I join colleagues who paid tribute to the emergency services and volunteers in community organisations, sports clubs and any number of other organisations who undertake training to ensure the necessary awareness prevails right across society and that the issues are fully and broadly understood. The equipment has made a difference and can do so in the future but we need to ensure it is in place and protected. We must educate and inform people and raise awareness of the importance of the equipment. My colleagues, party and I believe that when informed people deliberately destroy or vandalise pieces of life-saving equipment, or obstruct their use, they should face the necessary and appropriate legal repercussions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GraceOSullivan" eId="spk_128">
          <from>Senator Grace O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_398">I commend Senator Swanick on bringing this legislation before the House. I have a significant interest in this area having been a lifeguard for five years, employed by Waterford County Council. I am aware of the work done around the country by the voluntary bodies, such as Irish Water Safety, and the first responders and Waterford City River Rescue, among many others. Considerable effort and hours are devoted to this work. Those concerned are very conscientious in protecting life. At times, they put their own lives at risk in order to protect people who get into trouble in rivers or seas.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> I recognise the importance of there being consequences if someone damages life-saving equipment. There has to be a consequence. There are organisations that are spending time providing education in schools and advertising. Even in the cinemas this year, there were advertisements drawing attention to the importance of taking care of life-saving equipment.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> What I particularly like about this legislation is section 2. It refers not only to lifebuoys but also to life preservers, throw rings, lifeboats, lines, ladders and safety harnesses. That is an extensive list and it has to be included. The use of the word "alter" is significant. It is not only the lifebuoys or life rings that can be thrown to the beach in a criminal act of disregard but also the ropes attached to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> As someone who spends a lot of time walking the beach in Tramore, I very often find a lifebuoy has been thrown on it. I was talking earlier to a friend of mine, Mr. "Buddy" Cuddihy, who is on the executive of Irish Water Safety. He told me that although an individual or member of a voluntary group might find lifebuoys in place when walking the length of the beach at a certain time, they might be gone a few hours later. In the morning, all might be well and good but in the course of the day someone could vandalise a lifebuoy or throw it out on the tide line. Sure enough, the tide would come in and take it out to sea, meaning the equipment would not be in place in the event of a rescue.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> Just last week, I was walking by the River Tolka in Dublin and saw a lifebuoy in the river. I contacted a friend who told me there is a website, <i>lifebuoy.ie</i>, on which one can notify those concerned. If anyone sees a lifebuoy thrown in the river, he or she can contact the authorities or notify them through the website rather than put his or her own life in danger by trying to retrieve it. In any case, there are ways to inform the authorities if one sees a piece of life-saving equipment that has been thrown around.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> The legislation is more than timely. There have to be consequences. What would happen in the event of a minor discarding life-saving equipment?</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> There are so many voluntary groups around the coast, lakes and ponds and along the rivers who are giving of their time voluntarily to safeguard life and ensure equipment is in place. It is absolutely disgraceful that some chancer or someone with no respect for the equipment or life could vandalise that equipment. Therefore, there has to be a mechanism and a charge. The proposed legislation is to be welcomed. I support it entirely. My party, the Green Party, supports it, as does the Civil Engagement group. Once again, I compliment Senator Swanick and all the volunteers around the coast of Ireland who are giving of their time to protect people's lives.</p>

          <from>Senator Martin Conway<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_405">Like previous speakers, I commend Senator Swanick on this very sensible and long-overdue Bill. Effectively, I live beside the sea. I live between Ennistymon and Lahinch in County Clare. I walk the beach at any opportunity I get. I was on the beach yesterday evening because I had some spare time. I know as well as anybody in this House the challenges faced regarding equipment for emergencies, such as lifebuoys. Deputy Grace O'Sullivan is absolutely correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I have been to Tramore where the beach is similar to beaches in my area.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> I estimate that more than 50% of defibrillators are purchased using money raised by voluntary groups. These groups go to the effort of collecting money to ensure defibrillators are available to save lives. They are placed at GAA clubs and other locations in communities. For example, there is one on the beach in Lahinch. The people who target them are more than chancers; they are thugs. The Bill will fill a gap in terms of dealing with those who behave in this way. </p>
          <p eId="para_408"> An intensive educational programme is needed to deal with minors who engage in this activity. Transition year in secondary schools could be put to good use by educating young people for life. By the time they leave school, all young persons should have been given an opportunity to learn how to swim. They should also be taught what responsibilities they have in respect of equipment that is available for use when people get into trouble. Some volunteers and colleagues have spoken about incidents that have taken place. I forget the name of the young gentleman from Belfast who drowned. A good friend from my locality, Catríona Lucas, lost her life two years ago while on a search and recovery mission. The Doolin rescue centre, which was built by the Irish Coast Guard in 2014, is now named after Ms Lucas. The Taoiseach visited Ennistymon on Saturday to open my constituency office. I must credit him for ensuring the Doolin Coast Guard secured the new centre with the best equipment available to allow it to respond rapidly and save lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> I am pleased to support the legislation and I hope that in due course Senator Swanick will be able to support a Bill I am working on to make it a criminal offence to disregard the instructions of the emergency services when a red weather alert is in place. During Storm Ophelia in October 2017, it was scandalous that people went wind surfing and seeking adventure with a hurricane alert in place. In addition to putting their own lives in danger, these individuals also put at risk the lives of those who must go out and save the lives of others when they are in danger. It is appropriate that some form of deterrent and punishment should be in place to deal with those who wilfully ignore a red weather alert by taking to the roads or waterways or generally disregarding and disrespecting the instructions of the emergency services who try to save lives, including the Civil Defence. The carry-on along the coastline during Storm Ophelia and similar storms was not acceptable. People took photographs on their phones of waves crashing over houses. This type of thrill seeking needs to stop as it shows a blatant disregard for those who risk their lives to save the lives of others. </p>
          <p eId="para_410"> The Seanad is the ideal forum for raising these types of issues. In the cold light of day, when we are not in the middle of an emergency, we can discuss and debate legislation and ensure it covers all angles. Senator Swanick has done a great job in covering the relevant issues. I am sure colleagues will be able to strengthen the Bill on Committee Stage by suggesting amendments that address angles that the Senator may not have considered. I look forward to engaging with Senators to ensure the Bill is enacted and ultimately results in lives being saved. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_130">
          <from>Senator Kieran O'Donnell<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_411">This is a good Bill. Senator Swanick has a background in general practice and is bringing the skillset he acquired before his election to the Seanad to this legislation. I represent Limerick city where, at the start of this year, a defibrillator was vandalised and broken. It has been purchased with funds raised by the South City Residents Association which is based in the O'Connell Avenue area. Criminal sanctions are needed to deal with these types of cases. While general legislation is available, it is something of a maze to navigate. It makes sense, therefore, to introduce specific legislation to deal with this type of vandalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> I commend the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, on working on the Bill. This spirit of co-operation is one of the positive aspects of new politics. While it may be necessary to ensure there are no inconsistencies in the Bill, the main focus should be to define a specific criminal act, ensure the provisions can be fully enforced and make people aware of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> Previous speakers referred to young people. Education on this issue should be built into the transition year curriculum. There is also a strong argument in favour of adding first aid to the curriculum to make young people aware of and develop respect for the benefits of defibrillators, lifebuoys and other safety related terms. Education is needed to inform people that destroying a defibrillator or throwing away a lifebuoy could cost lives. People need to realise the consequences of such actions, including potentially for their brothers, sisters, fathers or mothers. </p>
          <p eId="para_414"> The Bill is to be commended and I welcome the decision of the Government to allow it to pass Second Stage. As we all know, the devil is in the detail and changes will be made on Committee Stage. I hope we will all make a productive contribution to it. </p>
          <p eId="para_415"> Legislation must have a number of features. First, it must have an overriding principle which, in this case, is to introduce criminal sanctions for destroying life-saving equipment. Second, it must also have practical import, in other words, it must be possible to implement it easily and in a straightforward manner. Third, it must have an educational dimension. Too often, we get bogged down in the technicalities of legislation when we need to consider the practicalities.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> On Second Stage, we discuss general principles and we will discuss the details of the Bill on Committee Stage. It is not lengthy legislation and we must ensure it can be implemented. On Report Stage, we will have a second bite of the cherry, as it were, when we will be able to introduce elements that may have been discussed on Committee Stage. This is a fine Bill. </p>

        <speech by="#DavidStanton" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_131">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy David Stanton)<recordedTime time="2018-01-23T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_417">I am taking this Private Members' Bill on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, who, unfortunately, must be in the Dáil at this time. I thank Senator Swanick and the other proposing Senators for bringing the Bill before the Seanad and highlighting the consequences that can result from vandalism to life-saving equipment.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> Having listened to previous contributions, I agree with colleagues that this is important legislation and it is even more important that we are debating it. I wonder about the mindset of people who vandalise and damage life-saving equipment.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">I wonder whether it is a case that they do not care, they do not know or perhaps they know but are doing it on purpose. Whatever the reason, this is extraordinarily serious. This is why the debate is so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> As Senators have pointed out, the purpose of the Life Saving Equipment Bill 2017 is to introduce a specific offence of interfering with, causing damage to, altering, removing or modifying life-saving equipment such as defibrillators and marine safety devices. The Bill proposes to introduce a custodial sentence, for conviction on indictment, of up to five years for such an offence with a financial penalty of up to €50,000. The spirit and intention behind the Senator's Private Members' Bill is clear, namely, to send a clear message to individuals contemplating thoughtless acts of vandalism. Perhaps it is a thoughtless act of vandalism. If it is a planned act of vandalism that is even worse. If people were to realise that by damaging this equipment and putting it beyond use they could be contributing to a person's death, it would demonstrate the seriousness of their actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> I join Members who have mentioned the various voluntary services, and Senator Swanick mentioned Rescue 116 and what happened after the event. The volunteers in bodies such as the RNLI, mountain rescue, Civil Defence and first responders take their lives in their hands to save others as do the staff in the Naval Service, An Garda Síochána, the Air Corps, the Irish Coast Guard, lifeguards and so on. They are working to save lives and one can see the effort they put into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> In my own area, members of the east Cork rapid response medical group very often risk their own lives to save others. It beggars belief that somebody would damage equipment on purpose. I cannot comprehend that anyone would damage equipment on purpose. I join colleagues who speak of the need to change the mindset and the importance of education programmes in that regard. I commend Deputy Swanick for bringing this Bill before us. This debate is important as it may help to change the mindset of those who either mindlessly or on purpose damage this equipment. I notice some of the media have taken on this issue as well, which is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> The Minister has asked me to set out the law on criminal damage and theft. The offences which the Bill seeks to create are already provided for in legislation which deals with criminal damage and theft in a general way. The Criminal Damage Act 1991, referred to by Senator Swanick, deals with criminal damage to property generally, providing for a range of offences with significant penalties and this would include not only the life-saving equipment to which the Bill refers, but all life-saving equipment. Under the 1991 Act it is an offence to damage, threaten to damage or possess anything with intent to damage property. "Property" is defined in the broadest terms as meaning "property of a tangible nature, whether real or personal, that is capable of being stolen". The term "to damage" is also broadly defined as meaning "to destroy, deface, dismantle or, whether temporarily or otherwise, render inoperable or unfit for use or prevent or impair the operation of" the property concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> Section 2 of the 1991 Act provides that a person who, without lawful excuse, intentionally damages any property belonging to another or is reckless as to whether any such property would be damaged, is guilty of an offence. It also provides that a person who, without lawful excuse, intentionally damages any property or is reckless as to whether any property would be damaged and who intends by that damage to endanger the life of another or is reckless to such endangerment, is guilty of an offence. This latter provision has particular relevance in the context of damage to life-saving equipment. The commission of serious offences under the 1991 Act could, on conviction on indictment, result in a fine of €22,220 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or even life imprisonment where endangerment of life is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> As to the theft of property, the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides, in section 4, for a broad offence of theft which would include not only the life-saving equipment provided for in the Bill but all life-saving equipment. The Act states: "A person is guilty of theft if he or she dishonestly appropriates property without the consent of its owner and with the intention of depriving its owner of it." It is important to note that deprivation includes temporary deprivation. The penalty for conviction on indictment is an unlimited fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years. Senators will agree that there is already in place legislation of a general nature which would enable prosecution of those who would seek to vandalise life-saving equipment as provided for in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> This Private Members' Bill would put in place specific offences regarding defibrillators and marine safety devices. If the Bill, as drafted, were enacted, it would mean that persons interfering with or damaging defibrillators or marine safety devices would be prosecuted for those specific offences and could potentially receive substantially lower penalties than would apply under current law. I know that is not the intention of the Bill. It has been mentioned by Members that these issues can be examined further on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> It is clear that the Senator's Bill arises from concerns that lives could be lost due to the interference with or damage to the life-saving equipment provided for in the Bill and that such acts should not go unpunished. In this regard, this House can have no doubt of the Senator's sincere motivation in bringing forward his Bill. Again, I thank the Senators for bringing it forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> I will now turn to the provisions of the Bill. As Senators have outlined, section 1 of the Bill defines the terms used in the Bill. Section 2 provides for offences of interfering with, causing damage to, altering, removing or modifying a defibrillator or any marine safety device, except in the performance of routine testing or maintenance or during an identifiable medical emergency which has been notified to the emergency services. Section 3 sets out the penalties for such offences of a fine not exceeding €50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both, for conviction on indictment.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> Section 4 applies section 14, an attachment order, and related sections of the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014 to any person found guilty of an offence under this Bill. However, the Minister believes this provision to be unnecessary. The provisions of the fines Act apply in circumstances where a fined person fails to pay a fine imposed by the due date for payment. In such cases, the fined person will be brought before the court again and the court will either make a recovery order, an attachment order, a community service order or, and as a last resort, commit the person to prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> There are also some drafting difficulties with the Bill. The offences the Bill proposes regarding interfering with life-saving equipment are subject to the exception that the offences would not apply in the performance of routine testing, or maintenance of the equipment, or during an identifiable medical emergency which has been notified to the emergency services. This would mean that a person who, for example, throws a lifebuoy to a person without that person or some other person first notifying the incident to the emergency services would be guilty of an offence. That said, these are drafting issues and drafting issues can always be resolved. I just point this out to be helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> I thank Senator Swanick and the other proposing Senators once again, on behalf of the Minister, for their continuing work and interest in criminal justice matters. While the wide-ranging nature of the existing legislative provisions include life-saving equipment, the Minister and I believe it is worth considering whether the law should be more explicit and focused in this regard or whether different penalties should apply where life-saving equipment is concerned. The Minister does not, therefore, propose to oppose the Bill but will explore options to give effect to the principle underlying the Private Members' Bill and will seek to work with Senator Swanick and the other proposing Senators in that regard. We want to see what we can do to progress the ideas that Senator Swanick and the other proposing Senators have outlined in the Bill to see how we can improve it. The over-riding concern is that we ensure we change the mindset of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> The difficulty is providing proof because very often people interfere with equipment when there is nobody around to see it. Senator Grace O'Sullivan said that when one walks out in the morning everything is fine but when one walks back in the evening the damage has been done. I call on people who see somebody damaging equipment to please notify the authorities. It is incumbent on everybody to let it be known to the authorities if they can identify the person damaging the equipment. By doing that, one is saving lives. Senator Grace O'Sullivan mentioned <i>ringbuoys.ie</i> in her contribution and I was very taken by what seems like a very interesting website. I think we should look at it further.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> I thank Senators Jerry Buttimer, Brian Ó Domhnaill, Keith Swanick, Grace O'Sullivan, Martin Conway and Kieran O'Donnell who contributed. We are all of the same mind. The intention behind the Bill is good, but it needs to be worked on. I thank the Senators for bringing this Bill forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_435">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and all Senators for their contributions. I am delighted with the support I have received from around the House. This Bill needs to be enacted. It is the result of Members thinking of our volunteers, the people who put their lives at risk for others.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">I take on board the sentiments expressed by the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, and look forward to working with him and all other Senators on Committee and Remaining Stages. The Minister of State has said it can sometimes be quite hard to prove the offence. It is important when volunteer groups are placing defibrillators in certain locations that they be in view of a CCTV camera.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> I welcome Senator Jerry Buttimer's contribution and agree with what he said about the merit in providing EpiPens across the country. They are emergency devices and such an approach could work well in conjunction with the provision of adequate training in schools, third level institutions and community settings.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> I thank Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile for relating the personal story of Joby Murphy and the Lagan Weir. Could one imagine the situation if lifebuoys were put in place and then stolen? It would increase the trauma for a family, for whom the grieving process would be prolonged.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> Senator Grace O'Sullivan has first-hand experience of being a lifeguard. I have mentioned that I intend to introduce amendments to section 2. At the time I liaised a lot with Mr. John Leech, CEO of Irish Water Safety. I am open to an input by any Senator on marine safety devices. Reference was made to lifebuoys, life ladders and life rings, but I will be happy to take other ideas on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> I totally agree with Senator Martin Conway in his comments on the provision of education for minors, especially in transition year. With reference to what Senator Grace O'Sullivan said, I will look more specifically at the issue of minors and get back to her directly on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> I thank Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile for agreeing with me that we need specific legislation and the rolling out of more first aid training courses across the country. I am delighted with the raft of support and messages I have received from Members of this House and Deputies on all sides. If we are serious about dealing with the issue, we must move forward quickly with the legislation. I accept that the Bill might require improvements and changes to be made and will be happy to work with everybody to that end. There is no reason for the Bill not to move quickly based on what has been outlined in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> I thank everyone who spoke in the debate. I also thank Senators Paul Daly, Robbie Gallagher and Diarmuid Wilson who kindly co-signed the Bill. I am delighted that Mr. John Fitzgerald, co-chair of Community First Responders Ireland, has joined us in the Visitors Gallery. CFR Ireland has played an important role in helping me to have this legislation drafted.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> I wish to mention a young man from Athlone, Cathal Joyce, who is 27 years old. He is a survivor of sudden cardiac arrest and was one of the guests at a briefing I held on the Bill in July. He has been a great supporter of the Bill which he has promoted on social media. He collapsed in Cusack Park in Mullingar before a GAA football match between Athlone and Rosemount. He survived because of CPR and the fact that there was a defibrillator to hand. He is an excellent representative. Earlier I asked the question of what it was that inspired a volunteer. Perhaps it is the spirt of the great Jim Larkin who said: "An injury to one is the concern of all." That is a matter to be debated on another day.</p>
