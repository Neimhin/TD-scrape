I thank Deputy Mitchell O'Connor for nominating me and Senator Healy Eames for seconding my nomination.  This is a new committee which will cover the Departments of Education and Skills and Social Protection, both of which are important Departments in terms of expenditure.  It will deal with the nitty gritty of our role as legislators because much of our work concerns issues of education and social welfare.  In education we must try to ensure people reach their best potential and with social welfare we must ensure everybody has a safety net in hard times and can find work through labour market activation measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">I see this committee as a team that makes up an important part of the infrastructure of the Oireachtas by influencing policy development.  In the coming months I want to work with members on the development of policy in areas in which they are interested.  I hope everybody will have an input to the development of our work programme and deliberations.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">The next matter on the agenda is the selection of meeting times for the joint committee.  Joint committees meet on a weekly basis and select sub-committees shadowing individual Departments meet when Bills, Estimates, motions and other matters are referred to them under their terms of reference.  A select committee meeting will be held on the conclusion of this meeting to decide the membership of our select sub-committees.  I propose that the joint committee shall continue to meet on Wednesday mornings at a new start time of 10 a.m. instead of 9.30 a.m. and that the select sub-committees shall meet at 10 a.m. on Thursdays when matters are referred to them.  Are the proposed arrangements agreed?</p>

As this is a new committee, we are left with the time slots that are available.  Our previous time slot was 9.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. but I believe 10 a.m. is a preferable start time.  Certain meetings will take place at other times.  For example, we will be taking legislation next Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.  A certain amount of flexibility will be required but the only time that is open to us consistently is on Wednesday mornings.</p>

It would allow us to meet for an hour before business commences in the Houses.  Even though it initially proved difficult to get people in at 9.30 a.m., it eventually worked to good effect.  It is not an unreasonable time to expect members to be here and I suggest it as a starting time.</p>

The value of this committee is that it is a joint committee which comprises Senators and Deputies with considerable expertise in these areas.  I propose that the committee should suspend for votes in either House.  If meetings start at 10 a.m. members would be facilitated if they had to leave for a vote.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">Yes, we can certainly raise it at that stage.  We must ensure it is agreeable to everyone.  A Tuesday afternoon slot might not suit some people if they have the parliamentary party meetings at that time.  Many issues are involved and there are generally no meetings of parliamentary parties on Wednesday mornings.  These points need to be borne in mind.</p>

In the previous committee, the meeting was at 9.30 a.m.  We got used to that time and it worked.  If we are going to work, the morning is the best time.  Attendance at committees can be a problem at every committee.  I do not say that I am better than anyone else.  If we are trying to get work done, 9.30 a.m. is one hour before the Houses sit and it worked best for the previous committee.  I do not really see the reason to move from 9.30 a.m to 10 a.m., notwithstanding the difficulties Deputy Butler is having.  A half hour at that time can make all the difference.</p>
