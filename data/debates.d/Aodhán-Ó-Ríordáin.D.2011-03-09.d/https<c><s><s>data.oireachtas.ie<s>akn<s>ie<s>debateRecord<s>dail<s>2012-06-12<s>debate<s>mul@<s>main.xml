          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection  (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_4">I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 110 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">The budget for expenditure on community employment, CE, schemes in 2012 is €315 million in respect of 23,300 places, including approximately 1,400 supervisors.  Responsibility for community employment schemes transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2012.  Since this transfer Department of Social Protection staff, including former FÁS staff, 700 of whom are now integrated into the Department since 1 January, have been involved in a series of detailed discussions with CE sponsors.  These discussions have shown that while notionally focussed on activation, in reality community employment programmes deliver a range of services from child care, health care, drugs support to environmental works.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">The financial review of community employment schemes is near completion.  This review has proved to be a valuable exercise for the schemes and the Department.  Given the volume and breath of the data being returned and the requirement for staff to engage with each scheme, of which there are almost 1,000, the review has taken longer than originally envisaged to complete.  The outcomes of the reviews will be communicated directly to CE sponsoring organisations by staff in the Department as soon as they are finalised and the overall provision has been agreed by Government.  It should be possible to do that this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">Owing to current economic circumstances, the Government had to find significant savings in the budget for 2012.  However, the allowance grants for CE supervisors are unchanged, as are the working hours for staff employed under CE.  There will also be no decrease in the number of CE places allocated in 2012.  While no final allocation of materials and training grants has been made pending completion of the financial review, the existing commitment in relation to the financial support of schemes will continue to apply.  No schemes have been earmarked for closure.  The Government is committed to supporting the CE participants and the sponsors in continuing the valuable contribution the programme makes to individuals and communities.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
            <p eId="para_8">The Minister's reply to these questions is seriously deficient in that it does not answer our question in regard to when the reviews will be completed, one of which, the value for money review, was to be completed by end March.  I understand there is to be a third review, which will be a combination of the two earlier reviews.  The Minister stated that the review is taking longer than expected.  There were 1,000 schemes in place prior to commencement of the review and 1,000 will remain in place when it is completed.  I do not understand the reason it was not possible to determine how long the review would take.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">The Minister stated that she hopes to communicate by the end of this month with each of the sponsoring committees on how they are to continue and in relation to the materials and training grants situation.  This could lead to further delay.  By way of example, I would like to read a letter which I received yesterday from Mr. Michael Nestor, who is involved in a community employment scheme and deals with Offaly Personal Assistant Services Limited on this issue.  He states no decision has been made on how its funding will continue.  The company was told it would know by the end of April but it has not yet received any information despite a meeting having taken place between FÁS regional managers and the Department.  Offaly Personal Assistant Services Limited provides services to people with physical and sensory disabilities.  These people are the leaders while those participating in the scheme are the personal assistants.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
            <p eId="para_11">These personal assistants have a progression rate of 91%.  At present 24 personal assistants are being trained to FETAC level 5.  Will the Department of Social Protection or the Department of Education and Skills be responsible for this training?  Will the Minister give a commitment to schemes throughout the country providing FETAC level 5 training and with good progression rates that their training budgets will remain intact?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_6" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_12">With regard to the final point on training, when the scheme was transferred to the Department the allocation for training from the national training fund was €4.2 million, which was approximately €190 per participant per scheme, and this funding is included in the budget allocation I mentioned earlier.  To be clear, the terms of the review were to examine the income and funding of sponsoring organisations in terms of their ability to continue the programme with reduced funding from the Department of Social Protection.  Community and voluntary sponsoring organisations receive funding from a multiplicity of State agencies.  Deputies familiar with community employment schemes will know that in some cases, perhaps in the case of the scheme in Offaly which assists people with a disability, they may also be in receipt of other funding, for instance from the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills or educational bodies.  This is part of the reason that collecting this enormous body of data on community employment has been so difficult and so demanding.  I thank all of the community employment schemes which, for the most part, have been extremely co-operative and helpful in providing data.  It came from a slow start, to be honest, which is one of the reasons it has been difficult to get a full picture.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">I am very conscious of what happened previously, which was that many of the reports published on community employment were not flattering to it but they did not tend to address the issue of services provided.  I was anxious that when community employment came under the remit of the Department of Social Protection the issue of the delivery of service and its importance and significance to local communities throughout the country would be taken into account.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_7">
            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_14">I note the Minister stated the report is not finalised but some work has been done by the Department with regard to meeting some of those who will be affected.  Therefore at the very least the Minister has a draft in front of her.  The Minister stated the review was a valuable exercise but for some schemes it was not because the outcomes and changes being implemented do not seem to have been reversed, such as the financial implications of some of the cuts to child care schemes in particular.  Some of these schemes have been greatly affected and a number are seriously considering whether they can re-open in September.  On top of this are the changes with regard to terms and length of time of community employment placements.  With regard to child care schemes, a number of people have been refused a third year of training.  It is illogical that the State would invest in their training only to cut it off midstream.  Will the Minister re-examine this issue in particular?  It is illogical to have people on level 4 or 5 in terms of child care when the new standard is level 6.  Away from this debate the Minister has also committed to providing a first class child care service.  That would be one change.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">The Minister said the review would not result in immediate closures.  However, some CE schemes have closed because of the cuts, including the Smithfield Centre for Independent Living.  As I have mentioned, a number of child care facilities are seriously concerned as to whether they will be able to continue, including Casper on the north side, Treasure Tots in Ballyfermot and one in Poppintree.  Representatives of other child care facilities have also contacted me.  Can the Minister give a commitment that the report will be finalised and published, and that there will be some type of stability for such facilities in future?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_8" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_16">Late last week I received drafts of the report, which I have been reviewing in great detail.  I wish to clarify a matter on specialist areas of CE.  Some 1,000 places are ring-fenced for rehabilitation purposes; 2,200 places are ring-fenced for child care provision; and 2,800 places are marked off for health and social-care provision.  They are commitments in those very important areas.  The issue of the child care courses is being specifically examined by officials in my Department as part of the overall review of CE.  I agree with the Deputy that the provision of child care and appropriate training and education for child care have been very important, both in terms of community services and in terms of the progression of the individual through the acquisition of appropriate qualifications in child care and social care.  That is very much part of the review.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">One of the reasons the review has been so challenging and has taken so long is that there are almost 1,000 schemes.  There are many different types of CE schemes, some of which deliver services to GAA and other sports clubs where there might not be a requirement for a great deal of education, training and progression.  In other cases such as child care, there would be such requirements.  For example, the drug programmes relate largely to the rehabilitation of the individuals who take part in those programmes.  There are probably ten or 12 different broad types of CE schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_18">One of the important outcomes of the review has been the identification - we discussed it in the House previously - of very serious savings that could be made in areas such as administration in respect of insurance charges, and audit and accountancy charges.  In the case of a number of CE schemes, it is also clear that rental savings may be possible.  In the case of some schemes, premises are being rented in some cases at what one might call Celtic tiger prices.  Some schemes have entered into legal obligations and commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">No two schemes are exactly the same which is one of the reasons the review has taken so long.  I am very happy that the schemes have offered a very high level of co-operation and information to staff in my Department.  I am confident that with the information we have got we will be able to retain the level of service delivery and also provide for a much better structure of experience and progression for the individuals who participate in the schemes.</p>

          <heading>Carer’s Allowance</heading>
          <question by="#SeamusHealy" to="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="pq_3">
            <p eId="para_20">111<b>Deputy Seamus Healy</b> asked the <b>Minister for Social Protection</b> if she will address the position regarding the processing of carer’s allowance applications particularly the delays in deciding on applications, now averaging over 32 weeks, and the rule whereby a new application must be made when a carer cannot continue and a new family member takes on the caring role; and if she will make a statement on the matter. [28361/12]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_9" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_21">The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  The average time taken to award a carer's allowance application is 28 weeks at present.  This is not a satisfactory position.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">A major service delivery modernisation project is under way to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme.  This involves the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business process re-organisation.  It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer.  However, full deployment for carer's allowance will be achieved by mid-June, so it will be a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">In addition to the deployment of new systems, the Department is allocating additional resources in the form of overtime working and temporary staff to help reduce backlogs that have built up.  I understand that Deputies are concerned about delays in deciding applications.  Indeed, the high volume of queries from Deputies has, to a degree, added to the problems.  Before the end of the year I hope to have a dedicated published telephone line for Deputies' inquiries.  As Members will be aware, that applies in respect of other areas of social welfare.  However, we must get the new system up and running, deal with the backlog and then I hope to be in a position to implement, by the end of the year, a dedicated telephone inquiry line.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">Entitlement to carer's allowance is based on the individual satisfying means, residency, full-time care provision and medical suitability criteria.  Consequently, one family member having had an entitlement to carer's allowance does not automatically confer an entitlement on another family member.  In all such cases an application must be made by the carer in accordance with the requirements of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_25">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">Each application for carer's allowance is considered on its merits in accordance with the relevant legislation.  The decision is based upon the information and medical evidence provided by the applicant.  The staffing levels and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed with a view to ensuring claims are processed as quickly as possible.  I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer's allowance claims at present is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that the Department is taking action to resolve the situation.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_10">
            <from>Deputy Seamus Healy</from>
            <p eId="para_27">The reason I raise this issue, and it is a concern for all Deputies, is the fact that there is an average waiting period of far longer than 28 weeks - it is probably 32 or 34 weeks - for decisions on carer's allowance.  Increasingly, my office has found, and I am sure it is the case for other Deputies, that some people have passed away in the course of the application process.  That is a very unfair and traumatic situation for families.  There was another such occurrence last Friday.  It is happening on a regular basis.  Can the Minister give a time scale for clearing this huge backlog?  With regard to family members, I accept that the new family member or carer will have to be assessed.  Currently, however, not only is the new family member being assessed, but also the person being cared for is medically assessed again.  In many cases these are people in their late 70s, 80s and 90s.  Most, if not all, of these people are certainly not improving in health.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_11" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_28">For the information of the Deputy, the Department of Social Protection has done this successfully in respect of other schemes, such as pensions.  Deputies might recall that a couple of years ago quite a delay period built up with pension applications.  New processes were put in place and now, provided people apply a little in advance of the birthday when they become eligible for the pension, the system works very well by and large.  What we are doing now is screening applications relating to carers when they are received.  In the course of being screened they must also be validated.  Once the information has been entered into the system, we will have a computerised record of the application instead of having a paper file, which obviously will include information on the person being cared for.  However, it will take until the middle of this month before everyone is included after which there will be a time during which we will work on the backlog.  I understand this is of great concern to Members' constituents who have made an application.</p>
            <p eId="para_29">I also should note the enormous increase in the number of applications and that the Department has taken on temporary staff.  Some applications can be quite complicated as there may be issues concerning people's residency or where they are from.  There has been a huge increase in the number of applications and the number of those who are in receipt of both the full carer's allowance and the half-rate carer's allowance, which has, as the Deputy will be aware, risen significantly.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_12">
            <from>Deputy Seamus Healy</from>
            <p eId="para_30">Can the Minister provide a timescale as to when the backlog will be cleared?  Is it a case of one, three or six months?  Would it not be possible to prioritise some applications?  I refer, for instance, to applications in which the person being cared for is terminally ill or is in receipt of palliative care.  Could an exceptional process be put in place for such applications because they obviously are the most tight?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_13" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_31">The timescale for having the data in place for the new system is the middle of June and this is broadly on time at present.  The Deputy should recall the Department also is introducing the system for invalidity pensions and disability allowance.  This is quite an ambitious target of schemes that are migrating to the new system and I hope to have made significant progress in respect of carers by mid to late September, once the migration process has been achieved.  I also will take into account Deputy Healy's suggestion regarding the prioritisation of some urgent applications in which the timespan may be extremely tight, given the illness or whatever of the person being cared for.  Deputy Healy made a fair point.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">112<b>Deputy Barry Cowen</b> asked the <b>Minister for Social Protection</b> the status of changes to the rent supplement scheme; the number of tenants who have had to move accommodation as a result of the changes; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_34">I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 112 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">There are currently approximately 93,800 persons in receipt of rent supplement, for which the Government has provided €436 million for 2012.  New maximum rent limits were introduced from 1 January 2012, following analysis of the most up-to-date market data available.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved, while at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  The revised rent limits are applicable to new rent supplement tenancies from January 2012 and existing tenancies on review.  Approximately 21,300 claims have been awarded in 2012, indicating that it is possible to secure accommodation within the revised limits.  There were 96,800 persons in receipt of rent supplement at the end of 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">Where rents are in excess of the limit, customers are being asked to contact their landlord and renegotiate the rent.  Where landlords do not agree to reduce the rent within the limits, staff will discuss the options open to the tenant, including seeking alternative accommodation.  Information on the numbers who have secured alternative accommodation is not available.  The Department does not intend to negotiate directly with landlords to reduce rents on behalf of a tenant.  Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure their accommodation needs are met and that there will be no incidence of homelessness due to these changes.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_15">
            <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
            <p eId="para_37">While I understand where the Minister is coming from in this regard, the people who she should be looking after are the meat in the sandwich between private landlords and the community welfare officers.  I do not believe there is a Member of this House who has not had people in his or her constituency clinic reporting they received a letter from the community welfare office telling them to go back to their landlord and ask for reduced rates.  The Minister has just confirmed this.  It is distressing that she does not have numbers in regard to how successful these renegotiations were.  She cannot state this has not led to homelessness because she does not know that, yet she included that platitude at the end.  We have all come across cases of people on rental supplement, with very little income and bargaining power, who, in many cases, when the community welfare officer tells them they must get a cheaper place while the landlord tells them he or she will not reduce the rent, have had to leave and try to find new accommodation.  It may be at a cheaper price but what happens in the meantime?  That is the issue with which I have a problem.  When people change their address they are no longer eligible to be on the local authority social housing list, must provide details of their new address and be assessed in terms of this accommodation and whosoever else might be living at the new address, all of which can take a considerable time.  We know how complicated the form is for getting onto the social housing list.  Many community welfare officers are not paying rental supplement in the intervening period because the people are not on the social housing list to begin with.</p>
            <p eId="para_38">The Minister might offer an observation on having the rental supplement dealt with by the housing department in the local authority which would bring a joined-up approach to the issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_39">As stated in the programme for Government, in the Government's commitments and as I have stated in the House, the aim and objective is to transfer rent supplement to the local authorities which are expert on housing and have housing departments.  The difficulty in regard to community welfare officers or the community welfare service, as it is now known in the Department, is that the community welfare service officer is dealing with the individual, not the landlord, whereas the local authority has the power and the capacity to deal with both the individual on a housing list and the landlord who is providing accommodation.  There is an interdepartmental working group between my Department and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, addressing the various complex issues involved.  I hope for something like the RAS scheme, whereby the local authorities rent the property for a number of years and the individual is much freer to work.  The problem with rent supplement is that there is an inherent employment or poverty trap involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">I refer to the issue of negotiations with landlords.  We have data we collected from around the country on an exhaustive basis, from all the different available sources.  They indicated clearly that in some cases the Department of Social Protection, which is responsible for approximately 40% of rented properties in the country, was paying over the odds for rented accommodation.  My situation is that, along with every Minister, I am required to find savings and get value for money.  When one looks at availability of accommodation in various parts of the country and considers the kinds of falls in property values - this does not apply everywhere, obviously - it is surprising that rents have not reflected such falls to some degree.  It is important that the Department gets value for money.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">I am opposed to State subsidisation of landlords.  This is a reality, however, and is due to the lack of investment in social housing over decades since the State was founded.  The Minister stated she is required to make savings and we accept that.  However, the main problem, which I hope she will accept as such, is that she has passed the onus to negotiate with landlords to tenants, who are often very vulnerable, rather than to the Department or the community welfare officers who negotiate with the tenants.  I wonder whether the Minister is aware that in many cases, the arbitrary figures that were implemented recently have led to tenants further impoverishing themselves by making under-the-counter payments, in addition to the payments they were already involved in, to ensure they can stay in the places where they have put down roots.  I will give an example.  I recently dealt with the case of a woman who has three school-going children and was living near her mother in Leopardstown.  When her lease was due for renewal, the rental prices in that area were nowhere near what the community welfare officer was willing to pay.  The nearest place where she could go was well out of the locality when she can avail of the family support, etc., that she requires.  One of the consequences of this change is that it is forcing people to move their children from one school to another.  I hope the Minister will accept the point I am making.  Has she discussed with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government the possibility of using vacant NAMA properties to accommodate the rental accommodation scheme, as has been suggested?  Specifically, I would like such properties to be categorised as social housing.  That would be a much quicker way of reducing the rent supplement bill than passing people between the rental accommodation and rent supplement schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_42">I understand discussions are ongoing between NAMA and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on the question of procuring appropriate property which may be available to NAMA and would be suitable for social housing.  The difficulty is that in many cases the available property is not in a place like Leopardstown, where Deputy Ó Snodaigh's constituent wanted to stay.  As a consequence of the way property was developed around the State, it is more likely to be found in a place like the upper Shannon area.</p>

            <p eId="para_44">That is being worked on at the moment.  It is really a matter for the local authorities.  The Department of Social Protection makes rent supplement payments and allows tenants to source properties.  We are not directly engaged in the property market.  That is why I reminded Deputy Fleming of our clear policy preference, which is for the rent supplement scheme ultimately to be transferred to local authorities.  In 2000, approximately 42,000 people were receiving rent supplement payments, at an annual cost of €150 million.  At present, approximately 93,000 people are receiving rent supplement payments, at an annual cost of €433 million or just under €0.5 billion.  It is clear that we are spending a vast amount of taxpayers' money on resourcing the rent supplement scheme.  I would prefer us to reach an holistic solution, whereby local authority housing departments become much more heavily involved than at present in finding solutions for people who are looking for accommodation.  Although the rental accommodation scheme has been in existence for a considerable period, we are nowhere near having the amount of people that I would like on that scheme in different areas.  I would also prefer if people who are in a local authority tenancy arrangement of some kind were not inhibited from taking up employment, as they are in the case of the rent supplement scheme.  If such a person in the Dublin area who has a spouse and children takes up employment, he or she runs the risk of losing up to €1,000 a month in rent supplement.  It is very hard to get one's foot into the employment market if one is facing such an immediate loss.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_47">I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 144 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_48">The single working age assistance payment or single payment is a proposal to create a single social welfare payment that would cover all people of working age including those who would be currently classified as unemployed, with a disability or parenting alone.  The Department of Social Protection has been considering the option of a single payment for some time.  In 2009, under the previous Government, the Department examined the desirability and feasibility, both from a policy and operational perspective, of introducing a single social assistance payment for all people of working age - broadly speaking, those aged 18 to 66 - with the objective of improving the outcomes for this group.  This examination drew,<i>inter alia</i>, on work carried out by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and reflected in its report, The Developmental Welfare State, which it produced in 2005<i>.</i>  The report highlighted the need for greater interaction between services, income support and activation measures, and saw these as developmental for families, communities and the economy.  A recurring theme in the NESC report is that the current contingency-based payments to people of working age can operate to confirm a person’s status as someone outside of the workforce rather than as an unemployed member of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">In November 2010, the then Minister, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív approved the publication of the Department's review of the Report on the Desirability and Feasibility of Introducing a Single Social Assistance Payment for People of Working Age.  This report examined the current system of social assistance payments against the background of the broader policy rationale for a single payment, which was based on the policy that people are given or directed to the supports or services they need in order to return to or take up work or other training or educational opportunities.  It is also based on the rationale that the outcomes for people from a poverty and social inclusion point of view must be improved, and also that any changes to the current system must ensure that work pays.</p>
            <p eId="para_50">On foot of the publication of the Department's feasibility report, the Department held a consultation seminar with relevant stakeholders in July 2011.  The purpose of this seminar was to brief stakeholders on the findings of the feasibility report and to listen to their views in regard to the proposed development of a single payment.  Mr. John Martin, director for employment, labour and social affairs at the OECD made a presentation to the seminar on his response to the Department's feasibility report.</p>
            <p eId="para_51">It must be stressed that the development of supports and services is a necessary precondition for the introduction of a single payment.  In that context, the Department of Social Protection, through an interdepartmental group, is working to assess what services and supports would be required to support the introduction of a single payment, should it be decided to proceed with its introduction.</p>

            <p eId="para_54">I thank the Minister for clarifying that last point because I was concerned that people in receipt of carer's allowance would be included in this.  The Minister also said it appears that people in receipt of disability and one-parent family payments may suffer the most.</p>
            <p eId="para_55">More importantly, while I listened with interest to the nice run through the history from 2009 and 2010 until, eventually, there was a consultation seminar in 2011, the Minister might give us her own view.  Is she in favour of this?  Does she think it is a good issue?  I detect zero urgency from her in regard to progressing it and, if she is not going to progress it, let her tell us so and we can put it off the shelf and move on to other business.  There is no indication whatever as to any view the Minister might have.  Is it one of her key priorities to implement it this year or next, or is she determined to do it at all during the course of this Government's term of office?  She might explain where she sees this heading or whether the matter should be shelved.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_56">I recommended to the Government that carers would not be included in this group, because somebody who is caring full-time is not available for work.  The key concept is to make provision for the expectation that most people would be in a position and be anxious to participate in some appropriate way in the labour force.  Therefore, since becoming Minister I have introduced a number of additional options, for example, for people with a disability to take part in work and to encourage the development of supports for them to take up work.  We must, however, remember that we are talking about making provision for people in a way that best assists them, taking into account their family circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">The critical issue identified in the committee report, of which Deputy Ó Snodaigh was rapporteur, was that if we introduce a single age working payment, a prerequisite of the introduction of such a payment is the availability of appropriate supports and services.  There may be a significant cost factor in that and there is ongoing examination of that issue in the Department.  Since becoming Minister, I have had a look at all of the previous reports published and commissioned by the previous Government and I am examining the options carefully as to how to proceed.  I am also taking into account the views of the Oireachtas sub-committee in its recent report on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_58">Does the Minister agree with one of the points made in that report, which was also made by an official, that this is the wrong time to make all categories of social welfare recipients of working age actively seek work, considering there are already 50 jobseekers for every job vacancy according to the European Commission's figures?</p>
            <p eId="para_59">The programme for Government committed the Minister to maintaining primary social welfare rates and we already know this is an extremely minimalist commitment, given that cuts have already been implemented in terms of secondary benefits and means test rules.  The joint all-party committee report on the single working age payment, which was endorsed by all parties, also recommended that with any reform the value of the existing earnings disregards, the secondary benefits and means or capital allowance should be maintained.  This recommendation did not just come from me, but was endorsed by all represented, including Labour Party backbenchers.  Will the Minister take heed of this recommendation?  In particular, will she offer a commitment today to maintain the value of the secondary benefits that currently exist in any change or move towards a single working age payment later this year?</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_27" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_60">As the Deputy knows well, I cannot make any commitment in advance of the budget being framed for next year.  I am being honest with the Deputy on that.  I do not know if the Deputy is asking me to make budgetary commitments for next year, but I am not in a position to do that.  However, following my examination I have proposed to the Government that carers are not appropriate to be included in the strategy.  This was also recommended by the committee.  The objective of ensuring that everybody of working age has an opportunity to work, particularly people on the live register who are fully available for work, should be encouraged in so far as possible.  Last year, over 140,000 people left the live register.  Therefore, it is not true to say there is no movement in the job market.  There is a considerable number of people unemployed, over 300,000 and we have large numbers of people in part-time employment, over 80,000.  A considerable number of people are involved in various programmes, including JobBridge, Tús and the community employment schemes, and in educational schemes.  It is sometimes depressing for people to hear Deputies say there are no opportunities out there.  There are opportunities, and last year more than 140,000 people left the live register to take up employment.  It is important that we encourage and provide avenues for everyone on the live register to take up employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">With regard to people with disabilities, I have undertaken a number of initiatives to make specific additional supports available which will, I hope, assist people with disabilities who are interested in getting employment - of whom there are many - in entering the labour market.  That is very important.  The employment situation is particularly difficult for them in the context of the current economic difficulties.</p>

This year, the cost of the OFP scheme is estimated at €1.06 billion, and child benefit payments to such families cost approximately a further €246 million.  Between now and 2015, the consequences of the changes to the OFP scheme, as outlined in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2012, will be examined on a cross-departmental basis in order to ensure that the required service levels are in place to support lone parents as their youngest children reach the relevant age thresholds.  As part of this examination, discussions are taking place between officials from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs - which is the lead Department on child care policy and provision - and the Department of Education and Skills with regard to the development of a policy framework for school-age child care.  An interdepartmental group, chaired by my Department and comprising representatives from both the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills, was recently established and is assessing the requirement for and provision of school-age child care, focusing initially on the needs of lone parents.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">I do not know why the figure for child benefit was mentioned at all because the same amount is applied to both one-parent families and families of other configurations.  A couple of months ago we dealt with the Government's Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, which provided for a reduction in the cut-off age of children for one-parent family payments to seven years.  At the eleventh hour and under immense pressure, the Minister promised not to introduce the provision in the absence of a bankable commitment on child care.  At the time, we asked what that bankable commitment was, and now, as the Bill has started to take effect, I ask this once again.  Has the Minister prepared or is she drafting legislation to repeal those changes in the event that this commitment is not delivered?  We talked earlier about CE schemes and the debate on whether existing child care facilities will be able to survive given recent changes.  These are my key questions: what is the bankable commitment on child care, and what will happen at the end of the year?</p>

The early childhood care and education programme, ECCE, is open to all children aged between three years and three months and four years and six months in September of each year, with a fee paid to child care providers in respect of each child.  There are some 61,000 places being provided under the ECCE programme, 17,000 by community providers and 44,000 by private providers.  The community child care subvention programme funds some 1,000 community-based non-profit child care facilities nationwide to enable them to charge reduced child care fees to disadvantaged and low-income families that avail of their services.  Parents in receipt of social welfare income support are subsidised.  The child care education and training scheme is implemented by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on behalf of FÁS and the VECs, and child care places under this programme are capped at 2,800.  There is also an after-school care programme in which more than 15,000 places are available.</p>

Models exist in other countries; during the passage of the legislation we had a discussion about how other countries dealt with lone parent issues.  For example, in Northern Ireland, where the Deputy's party is in government, the cut-off age has been seven for a long time.

            <p eId="para_87">116<b>Deputy Seamus Kirk</b> asked the <b>Minister for Social Protection</b> the year on year increase in social welfare appeals from 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; the average waiting time in each of those years; the number of extra staff that have been transferred into the Social Welfare Appeals office.

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_52" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_88">The number of appeals received in the social welfare appeals office from 2008 until the end of March 2012 and the average waiting times in each of these years is set out in the following table.  As can be seen from these figures, there has been a very significant increase in the number of social welfare appeals year on year from 2008 to 2011, with the number of appeals received in 2011 being almost double the number received in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">In an effort to reduce the processing times, the Department appointed 12 additional appeals officers between 2010 and 2011.  In addition, a further ten appeals officers formerly employed by the community welfare service, CWS, of the Health Services Executive joined the office as part of the integration of the CWS appeals services into the social welfare appeals office.  This brought the total number of appeals officers to 39.  The office has also improved its business processes and IT support.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">As a result of these changes, the number of finalised cases increased from 15,724 in 2008 to 34,027 in 2011.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate this represents an enormous increase in the volume of appeals being dealt with.  I am advised by the social welfare appeals office that, based on figures for the first quarter of 2012, the average waiting time for appeals dealt with by summary decisions was  22.4 weeks and 40.9 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing.  The comparable times for all of 2011 were 25 weeks and 52.5 weeks, respectively.</p>

            <p eId="para_117">I thank the Minister for providing that information.  She will appreciate that we are operating under a disadvantage, however.  She referred to a schedule that has been circulated.  We will probably receive a copy in our e-mails at 6 p.m.  It is unfortunate that we do not have the advantage of seeing the figures to which she referred.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">I ask for an indication of the number of staff in the appeals office who took up the retirement scheme by the end of February 2012.  Did any appeals officer leave during that period and have staff numbers decreased?</p>
            <p eId="para_119">The issue with which we are most concerned is that the 40 weeks, or nine or ten months, involved in an appeal for oral hearing must be added on to the six months it takes for a case to be assessed in the first place and the two or three months required to complete a review.  The cases then come before the Department's appeals office, where they wait for nearly a year.  We are regularly told by the appeals office that it is waiting for the file to be sent from the Department.  The Minister spoke about technology.  I cannot understand why, once the appeal has been submitted, the file from the local office is not sent to the appeals office within seven days.  It regularly happens when a file comes in that one writes to the Department, which chases down the file and assembles it as if it is a great big package which must be delivered.  It appears that information technology is not used.  It is essential that the process be speeded up.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_120">If I may restate the numbers, 15,000 appeals were dealt with in 2008 but by last year that figure had increased to 34,000.  I accept it is difficult for the people who are applying but the reality is that since the country began to face its economic difficulties and meltdown in 2008, demand for a range of social service and social welfare schemes has exploded.  The appeals process, in particular, has been subject to an enormous increase in the number of applications.  In order to deal with that increase, new IT procedures and business methods have been introduced and the consequence is a decrease the waiting time for appeals this year.  For appeals by summary decision the waiting time has decreased to 22.4 weeks compared to 25 weeks last year and for oral hearing it has decreased to 40.9 weeks compared to 52.5 weeks last year.  That may not be the improvement the Deputy would like to see but it represents a considerable improvement in the context of ever expanding demand in terms of applications for social welfare entitlements and consequent appeals.</p>

            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_121">I acknowledge the numbers of appeals that are being processed annually but given the number of appeals lodged, the problem has not yet been addressed.  There are obscene delays in some payments for people who are in very stressful situations.  Delays in applications for payments such as the carer's allowance, domiciliary care payments and disability allowance are only adding to the stress.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">The Minister mentioned new technologies.  Can the social welfare appeals office be given access to the files via intranet or e-mail rather than requiring that the physical file be sent from Longford, Sligo or wherever to Dublin?  That might allow for speedier turnaround times.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_56" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_123">We are doing what the Deputy suggests by significantly expanding the use of technology in social welfare appeals.  Longer serving Deputies will recall that the processing time for pensions had risen enormously a couple of years ago simply due to demographic change and the increase in the numbers applying for benefits.  New business processes were introduced and the system is now working very well.  We are now in the process of introducing similar systems to a range of payments which involve exacting conditions, including the carer's allowance, invalidity payments and disability allowances.  The application of new business methods and new technologies have meant additional delays in the short term in the case of certain payments but as we bring all of this area into the new system, applications will be dealt with more speedily and we will be in a position to address the backlog.</p>
            <p eId="para_124">At that stage I would like to be in a position to set up a telephone helpline for Deputies because one of the problems is the enormous volume of social welfare questions submitted by Deputies, as is their right and entitlement.  These questions require the allocation of a considerable amount of senior resources.  Deputies may recall that last year I asked the staff of my Department to run a number of seminars for new Deputies and their staff to facilitate them in dealing with constituents' inquiries.  We are spending a vast amount of departmental time in dealing with a huge number of queries and I would like to introduce a telephone helpline by the end of this year or next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_126">The total of 432,907 recipients of jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit, at an estimated 2012 cost of €3.57 billion, currently includes some 80,000 casual workers.  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from the more traditional work patterns, with a consequent increase in the number of atypical workers.  In fact many large employers have a lot of part-time workers who are also being paid by my Department.  In acknowledgement of this trend, the Department conducted a review of the application of the unemployment benefit and assistance schemes conditions to workers who are not employed on a full-time basis in 2006, which examined the application of the jobseeker's benefit and allowance scheme conditions to workers who are employed on a part-time, casual or systematic short-time basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_127">The review made a number of recommendations which are currently under consideration by a cross-functional departmental working group.  These considerations are complex and are taking place in the context of other social welfare reforms, the current economic situation, and the considerable administrative and IT change that implementation proposals based on these recommendations will require.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education published its report, "A review of the status of casual workers in Ireland" in May 2012.  The report is written in the context of the work of my Department in this area and makes a number of constructive suggestions, including a recommendation that entitlement to jobseeker's payments be based on an hourly rather than the current daily system.  The content of the report will inform my Department's considerations.</p>

I thank the Minister for considering some of the findings in the report.  Does the Minister agree with the finding of the committee that the current social welfare system is decidedly unequal in that one person can work ten hours per week distributed over two days and receive an unemployment payment while others can work the same number of hours distributed over five days and be ineligible for any social welfare payment?  Does the Minister accept the urgent need, given the change in the workforce, to address this inequality?  How soon can we expect proposals on casual and part-time workers in line with, or taking on board some of the recommendations of, Deputy Anthony Lawlor's report?</p>

            <p eId="para_129">No decision has been made in this area.  The current system is unwieldy and I agree that it must be reformed.  This will involve a package of structures that recognise labour market patterns and required flexibility but also protect the integrity of the jobseeker's scheme, provide incentives to employment and deliver value for money.  Reform in this area is technically and administratively highly complex.  As discussed earlier, we are in the process of improving many of the systems and the management of the Department's processes and administration of various schemes.  Reform in the area could deliver a more flexible and responsive approach to the modern labour market but, equally, I have seen reports from one particular union on its concerns about the number of part-time workers to whom the Department is paying a social welfare income to the when, in many cases, the workers would like more work rather than more social welfare income.  It is a complex area and we must try to get the best outcome so that workers have access to full-time work where available, or to more work.  This will improve income dramatically above and beyond dependency on some social welfare income and some part-time work.</p>

There are ways in which the complexity will be addressed to ensure people are not benefiting where they are in part-time work and earning a substantial wage.  That can be addressed through a means test.  Does the Minister intend reporting in the next few months or is it an ongoing process?  There is an urgency in respect of part-time and casual workers given the changes.  Will we hear back by December or will it be a longer-term change?</p>

This includes the absorption of 1,000 community welfare officers and 700 former FÁS employees, as well as the business method changes referred to in earlier answers.  I will not commit to a date for this change.  It is an important area for trying to get the economic balance right, where the objective is to have as many people as possible in significant amounts of work, so that dependence on social welfare is lessened.  I am aware of the 80,000 people working part-time.  Up to a half of them would be interested in much more work and full-time work.  For others, part-time work fits quite well with family responsibilities, including child care and elder care.  We must have a nuanced response to the different types of people in the labour market and their different needs.</p>

          <p eId="para_132">This week we had the development with regard to the intervention by the European authorities on the Spanish bank debt and the decision to recapitalise Spanish bank debt by adding €100 million to the sovereign debt of Spain.  Does the Taoiseach accept it is a bad deal overall for Spain, Ireland and Europe in the sense that it represents another sticking plaster approach to the resolution of a fundamental crisis for the eurozone?  In particular, I refer to the failure to break the link between sovereign debt and bank debt, which the Taoiseach said in the House last week was a desirable objective.  In essence, the Spanish deal has reinforced the link between sovereign debt and bank debt and already it is beginning to unravel in the sense that there are significant doubts and uncertainty about the capacity of the Spanish Government to borrow for day-to-day services, given the increasing bond yields after yesterday's rally, which did not last very long.  We are witnessing what we witnessed for the past 15 months, a piecemeal, too little too late approach to resolving the crisis in the eurozone.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">Last week I asked the Taoiseach about the phone call to Chancellor Merkel.  The Taoiseach said he raised the debt issue with her.  He did not give us the benefit of her response.  We got a partial response on the Spanish bank deal, very clearly not in favour of breaking the link between sovereign debt and bank debt.  On the question of the Irish debt issue and the promissory notes, the Irish people would prefer a greater degree of openness and transparency about what the Government is negotiating for and what it is asking on behalf of the Irish people.  Will the Taoiseach publish the technical paper and various scenarios on which he and his officials are working since last September?  The Taoiseach needs to be more open about that issue and more assertive about the wider eurozone crisis and our position in respect of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">The Taoiseach seems to be keeping his eyes closed, smiling and waiting for something to land in his lap.  This seems to be the general minimalist, passive and acquiescent approach being adopted.</p>

The Spanish Government did not seek moneys for their bank debt problem as well as for the running of the Spanish economy.  The request was made and they got the deal and this is the deal they will sign.  The sovereign underwrites that loan and it pays the same interest rates as every other country.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">It ill behoves Deputy Martin to come into this House and talk about the antics of any other politician when he himself was the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a Government which agreed on a bank guarantee at 4 a.m. in respect of which I, as Taoiseach, am unable to find any file or shred of evidence in the Department of the Taoiseach.

Actually, we are one of the first governments to put forward the proposition that the ESM should be licensed to put money directly into banks.  This was indicated by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in respect of the Spanish situation, when he participated in the conference held last weekend.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">I will make three points to Deputy Martin.  First, this country is saddled with the legacy of the greatest economic disaster ever perpetrated on the Irish people and Deputy Martin was the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time.  It ill behoves him now to talk about the negotiations being carried on by other people.  Second, last weekend I wrote to every leader of European governments and I set out a view very clearly that this is a European problem which requires a European solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">I note that Dr. Alan Ahearne, the special adviser to the late Minister for Finance, now realises that the deal was the wrong deal and that the sovereign should have been broken from the banks, which this Government has set out very clearly as being the way to go.  I also note that Commissioner Rehn in his comments yesterday said that the Irish negotiations are progressing, that he and the Commission will support this situation being brought to a conclusion and that Ireland deserves support and assistance with the difficulties it inherited from the Deputy's lot on that side of the House.  That is what we will continue to do.</p>

As Deputy Martin will be well aware, the structure of the EFSF and the structure of the ESM - to be introduced in July - in its current position does not allow for direct injection of moneys into banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_183">As the Taoiseach outlined, last Saturday, Spain applied for and was granted what is being referred to as a non-economic bailout - in other words, a bailout - for its toxic banking system for which its citizens will be on the hook.  This is all very eerily familiar to us here.  It is also now clear that no crumbs from the table will be available for this State.  If the Taoiseach's strategy had been to wait and see what the Spanish get, it is clear this strategy failed badly.  Last week, he told the House there was a debate in Europe about direct funding of the banking system and he went so far as almost to claim this as his own big idea.  However, it has not happened.  It is fair to conclude yet again that the Taoiseach failed to stand up for Ireland's interests.  Once again, it is Frankfurt's way.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">In March, the Taoiseach tried to pull the wool over people's eyes concerning the promissory note but we know that the banking debt remains.  The technical paper, which the Taoiseach now incredibly tells us he has not had sight or word of, was due in February.  These matters are complex, as the Taoiseach says, but they are also urgent, so where is the technical paper and when will it be published?  It is a long time coming.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">What is the Taoiseach's overall plan?  It is all very well for him to point the finger at Fianna Fáil and say there are no files in his office to inform him on the thinking for past decisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_190">The Government has a strategy which is focused on the re-engineering of our debt position for longer-term, lower interest rates.  That has been set out by the Minister for Finance and by every other Minister for quite some time.  The first element of the promissory note negotiations that are taking place, as the Deputy is aware, is to move the deadline to 2025.  Clearly, I do not claim credit for the discussions that are now taking place in Europe about the ESM, although this Government was one of the first to table that matter, which has now become a central focus of the discussions by many leaders on how to deal with the European response to the European problem.  Ireland has a year longer than Spain to reach the 3% target.  Spain has its own challenges which were set out by the Prime Minister when he made a connection about the €100 billion loan for the bank position in Spain last weekend.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">Ireland's position is to continue to negotiate complex issues with the troika with a view to bringing about a re-engineering of that debt problem, thus easing the position for all our people.  The problem was initially caused by the incompetence of a previous government.  From that perspective there is a clear strategy, which is to continue to negotiate and reach an agreement to achieve that target of lower interest rates in the longer term.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Deputy McDonald said the strategy was to wait and see but that is far from the case.  Ireland has been in a bailout programme for quite some time and we have successfully renegotiated elements of it, with two Ministers engaging with the troika.  I would remind the Deputy that the IMF, the head of the European Commission, and Commissioner Rehn have all stated that Ireland will continue to have support in the context of negotiations to reduce our debt problem and bring this to a conclusion.  I was happy to note Commissioner Rehn's strong and clear statement yesterday.  Deputy McDonald can take it that the Government will follow that through to bring to a conclusion, hopefully successfully, our objective of reducing that debt burden which is currently on the backs of our taxpayers and citizens.</p>

The only piece of re-engineering that he has delivered will cost the taxpayer an additional €90 million.  If he considers that a success, heaven forbid that we ever witness one of his failures.</p>

          <p eId="para_208">There is a euro Armageddon approaching us of which we are not aware.  Every weekend events happen which have the potential to sink the euro.  Last weekend, we had the Spanish bailout, while next weekend there will be elections in Greece.  Both those events are extraordinarily dangerous not just for the euro but also for this country and the whole of Europe.  As Deputy Martin said, the Spanish deal is already unravelling.  The theory that one can rescue the Spanish banks with bailout money and somehow the sovereign will then be able to enter the bond markets, has already been exploded.  Today, the bond-market rate for Spanish bonds is about 6.7%.  Similarly, a dangerous situation is arising in Greece.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">In Italy, bond rates went above 6% this morning.  Italy is the last domino in this game we are playing in Europe because we cannot afford to bail it out.  What will we do if the markets, which have already turned on Italy, require that country to have a bailout?  It seems to me that there is a lack of urgency and realisation of the dangerous situation we are now in.  The Greek elections this coming weekend have the potential once again to rock the euro.  There is no good news in this for Ireland.</p>

          <from>Deputy Shane Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_211">I want to ask this question now.  The euro is in dire danger.  This morning, I heard President Barroso - as I am sure the Taoiseach did - come out with some sort of solution.  He said that a year down the road, which he was suggesting as an early date, we will have a banking union.  To me, however, that is not enough.  It is just a partial solution but it might offer some solace for Ireland in terms of the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes.  Can the Taoiseach tell the House what is the Government's attitude to this proposal for a banking union?  Does it offer some hope for Ireland and the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_131">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_212">I believe it would be possible to achieve a banking union more quickly than a fiscal one.  I agree with Deputy Ross that these are not easy times for anybody.  To echo Deputy McDonald, there is no comfort in what is now unfolding and requires to be dealt with.  The Spanish Government made its request for €100 billion of assistance in respect of its banks and will continue to pay over 6% on money to fund its deficit.  These are extraordinary times.  The second run-off of the French election takes place next week.  The Greek elections speak for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">I believe that a banking union could be achieved in a far shorter time than that stated by the President of the Commission.  The issues of monetary and fiscal union are much longer term projects.  The problem is a banking crisis within the eurozone which requires a European answer.  I set out in my letter to all the leaders that these are the issues which should be focused on, considered and decided politically by leaders of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I cannot speak for what happens in the elections in Greece.  The vast majority of Greek citizens want to remain in the euro.  It is not the intention of any country in the European Union or eurozone to have Greece removed from it.  That decision will be made by the Greek people when they vote.  The French electoral process is continuing.  Prime Minister Monti has already signalled his grave anxiety and concern about the scale of the problem in the Italian economy which is of more than €1 trillion and the extent of changes which he has brought about since his appointment as Prime Minister.  These are all matters that are the every day focus of European Governments.  That connection is being maintained from an Irish point of view also.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Deputy Ross will be well aware that the outcome of the Greek elections will bring about its own conclusion.  The scale of what is involved in the Spanish banks will also become apparent when the full analysis is published.  All of these matters will require serious and expeditious reflection by European leaders and decisions made at political level to deal with them.</p>

        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_132">
          <from>Deputy Shane Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_216">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  The point I am trying to make is that this time next week we could be facing a catastrophic situation.  I often wonder if the sense of urgency has been properly injected into not alone Members of this House but people outside.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">I take it from the Taoiseach's reply - perhaps he will confirm this - that he is in favour of a banking union.  I believe it is a good idea, one which might be helpful to Ireland, in particular in view of the fact that we will face an extraordinarily urgent recapitalisation of the banks, which has not yet been acknowledged but will happen sooner rather than later.  A banking union could help in that project.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Has the Government made preparations - I understand the Taoiseach cannot be specific - for the possibility of a collapse in the euro in the coming weeks?  Are we ready for it?  Do we have solutions?  Are we prepared to consider, as widely reported in the media, the possibility of a two-tier Europe?  The Taoiseach will be aware that we will need to be to ready for this when it hits us.  It could happen at any time.  Events in Europe are happening so fast that it is the Government's duty to prepare for a possible catastrophe coming down the tracks.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_133">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_219">I would be supportive in principle of a banking union.  As I stated, I believe it is a matter that could be brought to a conclusion successfully and a lot quicker than people might imagine, if the will to do it exists.  It is less complex a project than others in terms of people's views of fiscal union.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">I do not want to speculate and will not comment on the question in regard to the euro and eurozone.  We support the euro and eurozone.  Our people gave their view on that in terms of the referendum on the fiscal stability treaty.  I am aware of the commentary to which Deputy Ross referred.  I would not venture to speculate on it.  We must move on in the belief that the political process can deal with the crisis in the eurozone and do so effectively.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_238">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 17, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_239">I visited the United States from 15 to 21 March for the annual St. Patrick's Day celebrations in Chicago, New York and Washington DC.  As the Deputy is aware, I made two previous visits to the United States in February of this year, the first to participate in the Invest in Ireland Roundtable event hosted by President Clinton in New York and the second again to New York when I also visited Boston.  These visits were aimed at getting the message across to corporate America and its business leaders that now is the right time to invest in Ireland's recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_240">The importance of these visits, in terms of our economic recovery and the delivery of foreign direct investment to Ireland over the coming period from US companies already located here that are considering further investment and companies considering investing in Ireland for the first time, cannot be over-estimated.  I used the opportunity of my visit to Washington DC to meet with President Obama in the White House and to also make further contacts with key business figures and other political leaders in the United States, reinforcing the message that now is an excellent time to invest in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_241">I began my visit in Chicago where I attended events organised by the Irish-American Partnership, the Chicago Council on World Affairs and the World Business Chicago Roundtable. I also held a number of meetings at the headquarters of companies with established operations in Ireland.  On Saint Patrick's Day, I met with Mayor Rahm Emanuel and joined him in leading the Chicago St. Patrick's Day parade.  During my relatively short time in Chicago, I also met with political representatives, business leaders and members of the Irish American community.  I also travelled to South Bend, Indiana where I visited the University of Notre Dame.  Deputies may be aware that the Navy and Notre Dame teams will visit Dublin in September to play a game of American Football.  This will be a big attraction for US visitors, with thousands expected to travel and will be a great boost to our tourism sector as well as being an opportunity to promote The Gathering for 2013.  An Irish passport was presented to Fr. Ted Hesburgh during the course of the visit.  Fr. Hesburgh served as President of Notre Dame University for 35 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_242">In New York, my programme included a meeting with the chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE, Duncan Niederauer.  While at the Stock Exchange I also gave an address at a breakfast event at the opening of Ireland Day at the NYSE organised by the Irish American Business Association, following which I was invited to ring the opening bell on the floor of the Stock Exchange.  I also had a short meeting with Cardinal Dolan at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  I travelled from New York to Washington DC where I made the traditional presentation of a bowl of shamrock to President Obama.  During our meeting in the White House we discussed a number of issues of mutual interest, including Irish-US economic relations, developments in the European Union, immigration, the Middle East Peace Process and events in Syria and Iran and Ireland's co-chairmanship of the OSCE.  We also discussed current developments in Northern Ireland, during which I raised the matter of the Pat Finucane and my belief that a Public Inquiry should be held in this case.  The President recalled the warmth of the reception that he and the First Lady received when they visited Ireland last year and he indicated his wish for a return visit.  Naturally, I told the President that the Irish people would again warmly welcome him and his wife to our shores, if that be appropriate.  He spoke very encouragingly of the measures we are taking to rebuild our economy and to attract investment and to create and retain jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_243">During my time in Washington, I attended the annual St. Patrick's Day breakfast hosted by Vice President Biden and the Friends of Ireland lunch hosted by Speaker Boehner.  While on Capitol Hill I met a number of political representatives, including Senators Leahy, Brown and Schumer to discuss issues of particular interest to Ireland.  My programme in Washington DC also involved a number of business engagements, including addressing an Enterprise Ireland business leaders' event where I met a number of their client companies; attending a seminar involving a number of companies in the energy and utilities sector; and an event organised by Science Foundation Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_244">While in Washington, I was the guest speaker at this year's American Ireland Fund gala dinner attended by over 800 guests.  I also addressed an event organised by Tourism Ireland and United Airlines to mark the opening of the new direct air route from Washington DC to Dublin, which commenced last Friday, where I underlined its importance in terms of boosting tourism to Ireland from the mid-Atlantic US region and facilitating wider economic links.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_245">The grouping contains 17 questions covering anything which may or may not have been raised during the Taoiseach's St. Patrick's day visit to the United States of America.  This is a wide range of questions with no real link to each other, which is very unsatisfactory and stems from the fact the Taoiseach  is very determined to reduce the amount of time he must spend answering questions in the House.  We had questions on two days but this has been reduced to one and it needs to be revisited because as a consequence many of the questions have become way out of date since the time they were tabled.</p>
            <p eId="para_246">The Taoiseach has regularly come to the House and stated he wants to see something done about the murder of Pat Finucane but I do not get any sense of resolve about it.  There is a complete lack of resolve when it comes to dealing with key leaders.  It is not enough to raise it in general ways.  We must insist that any failure to deal with the issue is a blight on the British Government's commitment to justice.  It may be argued that Sinn Féin has little credibility in demanding justice for past murders but the Irish Government does.  It has signed a deal and it is part of an international agreement that there would be a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane.  The British Government's failure to address this issue is a blight on its record, and on behalf of everybody the Irish Government must up a gear in respect of its approach to the issue in international fora and when it meets US leaders in particular.  Photo opportunities and fine speeches are easy but substantive work must be done on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_247">With regard to the New York visit, in his reply the Taoiseach mentioned he attended the second annual Ireland day at the New York Stock Exchange on 19 March 2012.  There was much debate after this item on the itinerary about the presence of certain individuals on the platform.  With regard to these individuals, and the Taoiseach knows about whom I speak, he was asked a number of questions afterwards and he dismissed suggestions he was aware of who was going to turn up on the day.  He told<i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday, 2 April he had no idea who would be there and that he was not in a position as Taoiseach to vet the list of attendees at any particular function he attends.  On 7 March the Taoiseach’s Department received a background note outlining in three paragraphs the event itself, organised by the Irish American Business Association, the format of the conference and the list of speakers.  It stated the complete guest list was not available but did list the key individuals who were going to attend.  Therefore, the Taoiseach was very well aware of who would attend the conference.  Does the Taoiseach wish to correct the record of the House or was it a case that he did not read the background note?  Did he mislead people at the time with regard to the presence of people at the function in <i>The Irish Times</i> interview and comments made in the House?  This is with regard to the Denis O’Brien issue.  I would like to hear the Taoiseach’s view on this.  Did he read the background note?  He must have known who was going to turn up-----</p>

The Taoiseach's election commitment was to burn bank bondholders.  It is reported that Mr. Geithner steadfastly, strongly and robustly opposed it.  Did the Taoiseach raise this issue with President Obama?  There seems to be genuine reluctance on the part of the Irish Government to raise it with the US governmental authorities.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has not raised it.  He has repeatedly refused to raise the matter with Mr. Geithner.  Will the Taoiseach outline with whom he raised this issue during the US visit?</p>

            <p eId="para_253">When I went to Belfast to present an award to Geraldine Finucane and her family I met the family in private and undertook to raise the question of a public inquiry into the death of Pat Finucane when I had the opportunity to travel to the United States.  Subsequently I answered questions in the House from a number of Deputies on this.  When I met President Obama I took the opportunity to raise it with him at the highest level.  President Obama is aware of the situation in so far as this was an international agreement in which both governments indicated they would act on the recommendation given by Judge Cory.  The Irish Government responded in accordance with this international agreement and established the Smithwick tribunal into the deaths of Buchanan and others.  The British Government took a different view and appointed a Queens Counsel, Mr. de Silva, to examine all of the papers relevant to Pat Finucane on the assumption this might deal with their end of the agreement.  It does not and will not.  From this point of view I have raised the matter with the British Prime Minister on a number of occasions.  On every opportunity I have had to do so I have raised it.  Subsequently I spoke to Mrs. Finucane in the United States and she was grateful that I raised it with the US President.  I will continue to do so.  As Deputy Martin is aware, there is an all-party motion from a number of years ago in my name that there should be a public inquiry into the death of Pat Finucane and I stand by this very strongly.  I was asked to raise it and I did so with the President directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_254">With regard to the background note mentioned by Deputy Martin, I believe I attended 34 functions during the course of the few days I was in the United States.  Paragraph three of the background note stated the complete guest list for the event was not yet available but according to<i> www.ireland-day.com</i> the event would involve more than 300 executives from leading international firms including Fortune 500 companies, venture capital firms, entrepreneurial start-ups and financial and life sciences organisations from the US, Ireland and throughout the world.  It also listed a number of these people.  I did not see the background note myself </p>

            <p eId="para_256">I suppose as would be normal practice there was contact between officials in Departments, but I did not see the note and I did not have access to it.  The media comments referred to the bell ringing ceremony and they have been around for some time whereas the background note related to the parallel event which was the business breakfast, at which I believe I spoke for three or three and a half minutes before proceeding to the podium to ring the bell in the stock exchange.</p>

            <p eId="para_257">With regard to the Pat Finucane inquiry, the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government, is party to an international agreement.  He represents all of us with regard to the fulfilment and delivery of this agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_258">As the Taoiseach is aware there is no sense of any breakthrough on getting the inquiry to which all sides have signed up.  Does he see any light at the end of that tunnel?  Have his officials given consideration to how a breakthrough could be engineered?  Time is not on our side in finding the facts of this case.  It is a central issue and it stands out as a significant blight in terms of the British Government's commitment to justice and bringing closure to many issues of this kind.  The death of Pat Finucane has an iconic status at this stage in what his murder represented.  For the broader purposes of reconciliation it is important that that issue be pursued.  It is not satisfactory to say that we are raising it here and there.  Can any breakthrough be engineered at any point?</p>
            <p eId="para_259">I also raised the meetings at the New York Stock Exchange.  He said he had no idea who was going to be there.  He has now said he did not read the background note or did not get access to it for some reason or another.  That clarifies that point - although I would have thought a background note was intended for him.  Details of the event listed who would be on the panel and in attendance.</p>
            <p eId="para_260">The Taoiseach did not answer the third question to do with the bank debt and bank bondholders.  Strangely the Government has avoided giving us straight answers on this issue.  Why is there reluctance to raise the issue of burning bank bondholders with the American Government?  Have we ever ascertained whether United States Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Geithner, was resolutely opposed to that and stopped it at the famous G8 meeting when he made a crucial intervention to prevent any burning of any bondholders?  The Government was elected on the pledge of burning bank bondholders.  Both parties made solemn and ringing declarations such as "not another red cent" yet a strange silence has come over both parties with a desire to move away from that agenda completely.  The Taoiseach did not answer that.  Did he ask President Obama for his views on the burning of senior bank bondholders?  In order to get resolution of the eurozone crisis, can we get any answers on the bank debt issue which is continuing to engulf us?</p>

            <p eId="para_261">I made this point.  Clearly the British Government's decision to appoint a Queen's counsel is not satisfactory.  It is not satisfactory to us because it is a breach of an international agreement.  It is not satisfactory to the Finucane family which feels completely let down.  I have no idea what is in the papers or when the Queen's counsel may make a response or a finding.  The Deputy will also be aware of the court decision in this matter.  If the British Government has made the decision to appoint a Queen's counsel to investigate this, I cannot direct it to terminate that now and start a public inquiry.  However, I asked the Prime Minister what would happen in the event that the Queen's counsel is unable to make a new finding or reach a new conclusion.  I understand there are 1 million pieces of paper on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_262">Our perspective is the same as that of everybody in the House.  Judge Cory undertook to issue a report.  There was an agreement that whatever recommendations the judge made would be followed through by both Governments.  That has not been followed through by the British Government and in that sense it is a breach of that agreement.  I have said that very strongly to the British Prime Minister on more than one occasion.  I presume the process now is to see what arises from the decision and from findings, if any, that Sir Desmond de Silva comes up with.  I have made this very clear in Northern Ireland when I have been pressurised about other public inquiries.  This is a case where there was a very clear international agreement.  The judge made a recommendation that a public inquiry should be held into those two cases.  This State went about its business and set up the Smithwick tribunal - the British Government chose not to do so.  There we have a breach of that agreement and I have said that directly to the British Prime Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_263">I do not know what the British Government's attitude will be when Sir Desmond de Silva makes a recommendation or a finding.  Presumably given the strength of the objection from the Finucane family and from Geraldine Finucane that this is very far short of what the recommendation was, clearly I do not think it will be acceptable without prejudicing whatever the finding might be.  That goes back to the fundamental issue.  There was a clear agreement internationally - a clear recommendation and that should be followed through.  Regardless of what might be said about all the other cases, about which I hear there should be further public inquiries, this is one that is the subject of an international agreement that I feel should be honoured.  I will raise that at every opportunity I have.</p>
            <p eId="para_264">We discussed Ireland's economic situation.  We discussed foreign direct investment from the United States into Ireland, and also the challenges we face here because of the debt problem.  I explained to the president our overall strategy that a break, and assistance and co-operation in respect of having a longer period and lower interest rates would be very beneficial to us.  We did not discuss the detail of the comments made by the United States Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Geithner, because that was dealt with exhaustively by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.</p>

            <p eId="para_275">I am glad the Taoiseach raised the issue of Pat Finucane with leaders in the United States over the St. Patrick's Day period.  He is of course quite correct to differentiate between on the one hand the very many instances that require public examination and closure for families - and there are many of them - and the case of Pat Finucane on the other.  As he correctly said commitments were entered into knowingly and openly at Weston Park in respect of Pat Finucane.  The curious thing is that at the time of the Weston Park meeting it was not just the instance that gave rise to the Smithwick tribunal and death of Pat Finucane, there were a number of other cases that Judge Cory considered and deemed appropriate for inquiries - the death of Rosemary Nelson being a case in point.  Each and every one of those cases has been expedited in a manner appropriate and consistent with Weston Park with the exception of the case of Pat Finucane.  We all understand the message that sends not just to broad Nationalists or republicans in Ireland but to the population on these shores and beyond.  There is a strong suspicion - let me put it that way - that the British state is unwilling to proceed and will hinder any effort to have an inquiry into the very case that lays bare the phenomenon of British collusion in the war in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_276">The Taoiseach conceded that the Weston Park Agreement has been breached.  That has been done quite brazenly and consistently by the British Administration.  The Taoiseach says, and I accept his word, that he raised it with the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron.  However, simply raising it is not enough.  The Finucane family is deeply disappointed with the manner in which the British have turned their backs on the agreement and on them.  When the family had the meeting with the Prime Minister at which he broke the news that there would not be an inquiry, the family left that meeting.  To the best of my knowledge, that was an unprecedented act by the family in question.  What we need is a sense from the Taoiseach of what he proposes to do to keep the British Government to commitments entered into at Weston Park.  The Taoiseach is not the British Prime Minister so he cannot directly undo his actions.  The Taoiseach said as much and that is a statement of fact.  However, the Taoiseach is the second party to an international and binding agreement.  What will he do to insist and ensure that the British Administration keeps to the agreement it made?</p>
            <p eId="para_277">In the course of the visit to the US what level of support did the Taoiseach manage to garner for the Finucane family in respect of holding an inquiry?  I accept that he raised and addressed the issue but what concrete commitments, if any, did he secure in the course of that visit?  Our party leader, Deputy Gerry Adams, wrote to the Taoiseach since the last time these issues were raised in the Dáil on 8 May.  In his correspondence he advocated that the Government compile a comprehensive report on the Pat Finucane case as well as others, such as the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and Ballymurphy, and present it to the Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron.  Has the Taoiseach taken that suggestion on board?  If so, what is the current position?  What does the Taoiseach intend to do to progress these issues?</p>
            <p eId="para_278">I also wish to raise a different but related issue.  We spoke with the Taoiseach last week about the constitutional convention that will be established in September.  Did the Taoiseach mention this matter in the course of his trip to the United States?  The Government has said the issue of voting rights for Irish emigrants in presidential elections will be on the agenda of the constitutional convention.  That is very welcome.  In the course of our economic crisis we have rediscovered the value and worth of the Irish diaspora in the global community.  Many initiatives have been taken to bring together key players, not least from among Irish Americans.  However, we believe there should be a level of reciprocation.  On the one hand we sought the connection with our global community to assist us now and into the future, not least in terms of rebuilding the economy.  On the other, there must be an element of giving from this side.  It is our firm view that the global Irish community must have a concrete input into the political and democratic life of their native land and extending those voting rights is a way of making that a reality.</p>
            <p eId="para_279">Did the Taoiseach raise the issue of the convention?  Did he mention that these voting rights would be on the agenda and, if so, what response did he receive?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_280">Yes, Ireland is one of the two parties to the international agreement made at Weston Park.  What does one do where an agreement is not being honoured by one party?  I raised it directly with the Prime Minister on more than one occasion and, as I undertook to the Finucane family to do, I raised it directly with the most powerful political office in the world, the American President.  Clearly, the United States has a particular link with Ireland and it was important that I would do that in the interests of the collective understanding of how important it is that international agreements are honoured.  I also raised it with Senators Leahy, Brown and Schumer, Congressmen Richard Neal and Peter King and a number of others whom I met.  I raised it publicly at the gala event before 800 people and spoke personally to Geraldine Finucane about it.  It has been my duty and responsibility to raise it at the highest levels open to me, and I will continue to do that.  I would like to think that we could return to the simplicity, if that is the right word, of the first position, that is, whatever the judge would recommend would be honoured, and start from that point.  I hope we can get back to that point and have a public inquiry into the Pat Finucane case.</p>
            <p eId="para_281">I will have to revert to the Deputy in respect of the current position with the response to Deputy Adams.</p>
            <p eId="para_282">I did not raise the question of the convention because my intention is to meet with the representatives of the other parties in the House to set out the process by which that convention will take shape and get up and running.  However, I discussed the diaspora issue with the people I mentioned earlier.  In particular, I had meetings with the Senators about the situation of the undocumented Irish.  I also raised that with Congressman Neal and other political personalities.  The reason I did not consider it appropriate to raise the convention is that, while voting rights is a matter that will be considered by the convention, I thought it important to have the structure agreed by the Members of the House first.  That required a number of meetings with the opposition parties, to take on board what they said and, if possible, to accommodate that and move on with that structure.  I hope we will deal with that in the House in the next few weeks and that the first meeting of the convention can take place in September.</p>
            <p eId="para_283">As Deputy McDonald will be aware from our meeting last week, it will be open to members of the diaspora at meetings wherever they are abroad to connect directly with the convention with their views.  Long before Deputy McDonald was elected to the House, I and a former Tánaiste, former Deputy Dick Spring, worked on a report on voting rights for people in England and other places.  It became very complicated with regard to how far back one should go and to whom one should give an entitlement.  However, I look forward to the convention, when it is up and running, considering these matters directly with the diaspora.  When we encourage people to return here for The Gathering and ask them to get their companies to invest directly in Ireland under the Succeed in Ireland initiative, there is clearly a yearning to be able to do something.  What one does about it is the complication.  I hope there will be a full engagement when the process starts.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
            <p eId="para_284">I take it from the Taoiseach's remarks that, whatever about not raising the issue on his last visit, like me he appreciates the necessity for that connectedness and space for the diaspora.  It cannot all be one-way traffic.  I believe we think the same on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_285">To return to the issue of Pat Finucane, I am concerned that the Taoiseach appears to be taking the view that, despite having signed an international agreement, he can do little more than politely encourage the British Government to do the right thing.  Past experience suggests that is not necessarily the best approach.  Sometimes one must be rather more forceful in one's presentation.  I note the Taoiseach posed the question as to what he can do, given the agreement has been entered into and the British Government clearly has broken that agreement and broken its word.  Has the Taoiseach asked for advice within his Department in respect of what remedies, including legal remedies, might be available to him, leaving aside diplomacy and politics for a minute?  Has the Taoiseach investigated this possibility, has he sought such advice and what has he been told?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_158">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_286">It is not simply a case of stating we are party to an agreement and asking them to do the necessary.  This is an international agreement which has been breached by one party to it.  However, it is not as though the party which has breached the agreement has indicated it does not intend to do anything about it.  It has made an appointment of a senior counsel to go through and examine all of the papers relative to the Finucane case, which I understand to be very extensive in number.  The Finucane family was very disappointed by that decision and took a judicial review.</p>
            <p eId="para_287">From a political perspective, the response must be to tell the British Prime Minister that there was an agreement which his Government has not honoured.  In addition, because of our connections with other areas, the response must be to raise it directly with the President of the United States, as well as with Senators and Members of Congress who have an interest in this matter, in order that through their connections with their British counterparts or whatever else, they can remind the latter that they did not honour this agreement and can ask them to live up to it.  They can tell the British it was agreed that this is what would happen in advance but that they have not followed through.</p>
            <p eId="para_288">While the judicial review sought by the family is one case taken by them, I prefer to think a conclusion could be arrived at by a political route.  Although persistence certainly is required, in that one must raise such matters more than once, the Deputy should believe my assertion that this is an issue of which I do not wish to and will not let go.  It is a serious matter that two sovereign Governments would make an arrangement and agreement to honour whatever was recommended by the person appointed.  There is a trust and responsibility to live up to this commitment and I note this State honoured its share of that agreement.  I hope we can arrive at a position at which the British Government will do the same thing.  Obviously, I do not speak for it and cannot direct that it reverses its decision about the Queen's counsel but I would like to think that the agreement in place will be honoured in full.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_289">As the six questions I had tabled cover three different aspects of the visit, I will ask about each of them.  In recent weeks and months, President Obama has been strident and often damning of the failure of European leaders to deal with the deepening crisis in the eurozone.  He has called consistently for more decisive and more concrete action to deal with the financial crisis in Europe.  He stated recently:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_290">If you are engaging in austerity too quickly, it makes it harder to pay off your debts.  Markets respond ... if you are contracting, they bet you're not going to be able to pay off your debts.</p>
            <p eId="para_291">He then added that after a bank bailout, a proper plan for growth is needed.  I could not have put it better myself.  This comment sums up months of criticism by President Obama of eurozone leaders and their failure to deal with this crisis, as it continues to worsen.  Moreover, President Obama's words are borne out by what has now happened in Spain on foot of the move to recapitalise that country's banks in the face of the ECB's insistence, as was the case in this country, that ordinary people should guarantee the bailout of the banks.  The result of this has been to plunge Spain now, just as was the case with Ireland previously, further into a debt spiral.  It is not time the Taoiseach heeded President Obama's words?  When the Taoiseach spoke to President Obama, did he make these views known to the Taoiseach?  Did he make known his understanding, as he has stated in public, that the approach being taken by eurozone leaders was a failure and was not working but that a different strategy, which moved in the opposite direction to austerity, was needed?  How did the Taoiseach respond to that?  How does he respond to President Obama's critique of euro leaders in the context of the unravelling of the current bailout of the Spanish banks, just as, of course, the so-called bailout of this country has unravelled and failed to deliver on its promise?</p>
            <p eId="para_292">In addition, I refer to the Taoiseach's engagement in the New York Stock Exchange.  Serious concerns have been raised over the presence of Mr. Denis O'Brien on the same platform as the Taoiseach, given that Mr. O'Brien is someone against whom very serious findings were made in the Moriarty tribunal and about the circumstances in which he was awarded the second mobile telephone licence and the assistance that was given to him in that regard by a former Fine Gael Minister, to whom he also was known to have given payments.  Moreover, I note Mr. O'Brien, a billionaire, is now a tax exile from this country.</p>

            <p eId="para_300">I take the Ceann Comhairle's point.  I simply am summarising what was in the Moriarty report.  It made serious findings about the circumstances in which Mr. O'Brien received the aforementioned licence and about the role a former Fine Gael Minister had in helping him to secure that licence.  The report also noted that significant payments were made by Mr. O'Brien to Deputy Lowry.  Given this finding, does the Taoiseach consider it to have been appropriate for him to share the platform forum?  This is not simply an historical question and the Taoiseach should clarify his relationship and that of his party to Mr. O'Brien.  I ask him to so do particularly as a live issue faces us yet again in respect of Mr. O'Brien's recent acquisition of Siteserv plc and its facilitation by the writing down by Anglo Irish Bank of €110 million worth of debt to that company.  This deal deserves considerable scrutiny and in the context of the controversial plans to introduce water metering and water charges, I note Siteserv provides contracting services to Bord Gáis, including the installation of water meters.</p>
            <p eId="para_301">Finally, on foreign policy matters, did the Taoiseach raise the question of the recent massacre of 16 Afghan civilians by United States troops in Afghanistan?  Moreover, did the Taoiseach raise with President Obama the question as to the reason the western powers, led by the United States, continue to impose punitive sanctions on Iran, even though the International Atomic Energy Agency has made it absolutely clear it does not believe Iran is engaged in a nuclear weapons programme?  Did the Taoiseach ask him about the contrast between the treatment of Iran, which no one believes to have a weapons programme but on which sanctions are imposed, and the failure to impose sanctions on Israel, which everyone knows has a nuclear weapons arsenal but which does not have sanctions imposed on it and which in fact receives $3 billion in military aid each year from the United States?   Did the Taoiseach ask the President about those double standards, given the very worrying sabre-rattling going on about possible further sanctions or even military action against Iran, something that would be disastrous for the entire region and possibly for the world?.</p>

            <p eId="para_304">-----in Iran with President Obama.  As to the Deputy's comments about what the President has stated about eurozone leaders, we discussed Europe, the eurozone and Ireland's position therein.  I explained to the President the progress Ireland had made by being removed very much from the platform where we were placed with Greece last year, from where we are now heading in a very different direction.  I referred to the fact that unit labour costs had decreased with competitiveness being enhanced as a consequence, and stated the Government had been able to renegotiate elements of the memorandum of understanding with the troika and that the challenge for Ireland lay in getting further assistance and concessions in respect of the scale of bank debt we face.</p>
            <p eId="para_305">I am not sure what the Deputy's question was about in regard to the Spanish bailout.  The Spanish Government made a request for assistance which was answered with €100 billion from the EFSF for Spanish bank debt.   This means that the sovereign Government of Spain underwrites that sum, pays back the loan at the same interest rate as anybody else and in respect of funding its own deficit it continues to borrow on the international markets at in excess of 6%.  The Prime Minister has made many comments stating the country expects to be able to deal with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_306">In regard to the Deputy's question about whether it is appropriate to share a platform with any individual, I do not invite participants to any event I attend.  For all those who were in attendance at the function to which the Deputy referred and at the bell-ringing at the New York Stock Exchange, invitations were extended by the NYSE and the representatives of Ireland Inc.</p>
            <p eId="para_307">In regard to the question about the Siteserv position, I point out to Deputy Boyd Barrett that the Competition Authority looked at that merger to see if there were any anti-competitive practices contained therein and it made its decision approving that merger independently, as is its function and responsibility.</p>

          <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_171">
            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_308">I am not sure which part of the point I made about the Spanish banking crisis was not clear to the Taoiseach but surely it should be very clear that President Obama's criticism of the manner in which European leaders have dealt with the deepening financial crisis in Europe has gained renewed force from the unravelling of the so-called bailout programme for Spain's banks.  The country has borrowed money to recapitalise its banks but far from that stabilising the situation, and because the money has been routed through the Spanish sovereign, Spain will now have difficulty in borrowing elsewhere.  The markets look at the increased debt burden that has been forced onto the Spanish sovereign and its citizens, conclude that Spain will not be able to repay its debts and therefore do not wish to lend it money, with the result that bond yields go up, just as happened to us.</p>
            <p eId="para_309">My point is that President Obama's criticism of the manner in which eurozone leaders are dealing with the crisis has now been further vindicated with the unravelling of the Spanish banking crisis.  At what point do the Taoiseach and other European leaders begin to listen to what President Obama is saying, what a range of very mainstream and prominent economists are saying, what growing forces in Europe are beginning to say, namely, that continually bailing out the banks and making citizens of this country, or Spain, responsible for guaranteeing those borrowings and paying for it with austerity is a disastrous failure.  That was the other point made by the US President, about contracting demand in the economy and worsening a situation already made bad by states taking on board the gambling debts of private financial institutions.  Does the Taoiseach not believe the President Obama's criticism is correct and that we should start to listen to him in a way that, so far, European leaders have not done?</p>
            <p eId="para_310">I find it surprising that the Taoiseach would not raise the situation of Iran.  It is very serious, with very severe penalties involved and sabre-rattling about possible military assaults on Iran.  I do not know if the Taoiseach is aware of this but I understand Iran has begun to denominate oil sales in the Chinese currency.  It might be interesting for the Taoiseach to note that when the former Iraqi regime did the same thing it led to invasion by the United States, in the second Gulf war, as such a move could have very significant effects on the US and western economies.  I find it surprising, given the seriousness of the situation in Iran and the threats and sabre-rattling surrounding that country, with Israel joining in, of course, and the contrast with how Israel is treated in respect of its nuclear arsenal, that the Taoiseach would not wish to raise those issues and concern himself with them in his conversations with President Obama.</p>

            <p eId="para_314">Fair play to the Deputy.  He is certainly not shy about spinning out the record.  I note the comments of President Obama; they are what we have been saying for some time, namely, this is a European problem that requires a European answer, one that will have to come from political leaders.  A political response is required.</p>

            <p eId="para_316">As I observed to Deputy Ross, we support the principle of a banking union which is something that could be worked upon relatively quickly by European leaders in order to deal with the banking crisis.  That is something I set out in my recent letter to all the other leaders, namely, this is an issue of European crisis and therefore requires a response from European leaders.</p>
            <p eId="para_317">The Spanish Government made its case for assistance in the way it thought best for itself.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is well aware that even President Obama would be unaware of consequences that have yet to happen in respect of the decision to be made by the Greek people, whatever it might be, and the follow-through election results in France, whatever they might be, and in respect of the scale of figures that will emerge from the final assessment of the liabilities of Spanish banks and also whether there will be further liabilities that may become apparent from the regional governments in Spain.</p>
            <p eId="para_318">Prime Minister Rajoy made his call for assistance from the EFSF programme which initially brought a strong response, bringing about a sense of stability because there was a big buffer involved in regard to the amount being borrowed.  Clearly, the Spanish Government must underwrite that and pay it at the interest rate that applies to all EU terms but it was content, stating it could deal with its deficit by continuing to borrow ten-year bonds on the international market.  These are at higher interest rates but that is a decision for the Spanish Government and not one for me to interfere with in any way.</p>
            <p eId="para_319">Mr. Draghi from the European Central Bank has set out his view that there needs to be a clear vision on the part of European leaders, decided politically by them. This has been echoed on a number of occasions by Miss Lagarde from the IMF.  I hope that will follow the decision to be made by the Greek and French peoples and the assessment in respect of Spain.   It remains to be seen whether Cyprus will seek assistance.  I have referred to the concerns and anxieties that have been expressed by Prime Minister Monti.  All of these are complex and enormous problems.  Political decisions will have to be made around the table in Brussels.  I am sure people reflect and understand the views that have been expressed in the United States in this regard.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_320">I would like to ask the Taoiseach about foreign policy issues that pertain to the United States.  When the Taoiseach met President Obama, did they discuss the ongoing use of Shannon Airport by American war planes on their way to or from war zones?  Did they discuss the fact that despite President Obama's alleged revulsion about secret renditions and the holding of people in detention centres without trial, he is continuing to implement such a policy?  Was the Shannon issue raised in any way?  Did the Taoiseach raise with President Obama the whole question of renditions, which has not been mentioned publicly for some time, and whether Shannon is still used in that regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_321">I would also like to ask about a broader foreign policy issue.  Did the Taoiseach have an opportunity to raise the use by the US of drones and Hellfire missiles against targeted individuals in countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen?  Did he mention the fact that civilians, including family members of the targeted individuals, are routinely massacred and killed during such operations?  He could have referred to the brutal massacres by civilian-backed militias in Syria and to the unspeakable atrocities that are being committed against innocent Syrian people by its government.  The United States contradicts itself by condemning such actions while endorsing the killing of innocent civilians as a result of its military tactics.  I would be interested to know whether the Taoiseach had an opportunity to raise those issues from an international human rights perspective.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_179">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_322">We do not support policies of rendition.  The US President expressed thanks for the use of Shannon Airport for transit flights going through the airport.  I visited Shannon Airport recently when Transaero announced a major expansion at the airport.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government has decided to restructure Shannon Development.  The establishment of a task force to examine the previous Shannon Development zone will present an opportunity for a new future for the entire region.  I did not get around to discussing the use by the American military of Hellfire missiles or drones with President Obama.</p>
            <p eId="para_323">The actions in Syria have been condemned by the Government here, the United Nations, the American Government and the Secretary of State.  The tragedy in Syria is continuing to unfold.  I listened to Kofi Annan the other day when he said his peace programme or plan is not working.  He said that as this problem becomes even more critical, it will explode outside Syria.  This is an issue of serious concern to the European Union, the United States, the Arab League and all the countries of that region.  People continue to be slaughtered and wantonly murdered.  We condemn those actions absolutely.  This country will add its voice to those at EU and UN levels that are trying to ensure the regime that is carrying out these atrocities is brought to an end.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_324">When the Chinese leadership was in Ireland, we rightly demanded to know if the Government had raised the issue of human rights with it.  We spoke about the heavy hand of that regime within its own borders in China and the abuse of people and workers there.  It is appropriate to ask the same questions with regard to the United States.  Like every elected person, I strongly support future employment at Shannon Airport.  Does the Taoiseach agree it would be preferable if that did not depend on American military operations?  Such a dependence would be repugnant.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the indiscriminate policy of routinely shooting from unmanned missiles rockets that kill innocent civilians should be a matter of major concern to the Government, which routinely claims to be an ally and close friend of US Governments?  Does it not strike the Taoiseach that this is completely at odds with respect for the human rights of innocent people in the same way as the events in Syria?</p>

            <p eId="para_327">He made the point that there are 800 million users of the Internet and 400 million bloggers in China.  He clearly recognised that the question of human rights is central to his decade of power.  He was very open about the fact that China can improve its human rights record.</p>
            <p eId="para_328">It is clear that the number of US military personnel who pass through Shannon Airport has declined seriously since its peak a number of years ago, when the Iraq War was at its height.  I believe the number will continue to decline, not only because of the withdrawal of American troops from that region but also because of the use of longer-range transport aircraft, which have the capacity to fly to other airports.  Unfortunately, one does not have to go to other countries to find instances where death can occur.  We even had a potential case in our own country on the day of the referendum, when there was a bomb scare after a device was placed under a car.  I do not agree with any of this, but clearly there are people who do.</p>

I know the Deputy offered to make a personal statement to the House.  Obviously, it is appropriate to the Ceann Comhairle to make that call and he has made it - I accept that.  However, it seems to me that the scale of the issue necessitates an opportunity for the House and its Members to give their views and perspective on it.  I know there was a meeting of the Whips earlier in terms of motions and so on, and legal issues were raised.  I make the point to the Taoiseach that, outside the House, the general view among the public is that people, irrespective of who they are, must be seen to be treated equally by the agencies of the State.  That is a very strong view out there on this matter.  It seems somewhat surreal and unreal that everyone outside of this House is discussing the issue, from "Liveline" to everywhere else, yet there seems to be some difficulty in facilitating a discussion or debate in this House on what is, irrespective of one's personal views, a very genuine issue that goes to the heart of society and how it is ordered and structured, and the role of the Dáil and the Oireachtas.  Has the Taoiseach any thoughts on the timing or facilitation of such a discussion?</p>

The longer it goes on, the less likely it is that the Bill will be able to help those who are suffering from mortgage distress.  I am looking for the reasons for the delay and for a commitment that it will be discussed and debated before the summer recess.</p>

          <p eId="para_343">This is a very serious matter.  As I said to other Deputies in the House, it has taken up a huge deal of the time of the parliamentary draftsman and the officials from the different Departments and the Attorney General's office.  We expect to publish the Bill before the end of June.  I would like to see it being discussed in this House or the Seanad before the summer recess.  It may not be possible to have it concluded because of its scale - it is an enormous Bill - but I would certainly like to see it published and being debated in the Oireachtas because we regard it as being central to the issue that is of so much concern to people out there every day.  Deputy O'Brien can believe me when I say it is legislation that has the absolute concentration and focus of Government.  I am sure that when he sees what is involved in it, he will appreciate the scale of the work that has gone into it.</p>

A public consultation was carried out previously on a draft general scheme of the Bill, and the proposals are being revised following the public consultation and in line with legal advice.  The Minister expects to bring those proposals to the Government later this year, when he will seek the formal drafting of the Bill.  The Bill is to meet the recommendations of the Madden report on post mortem practice and procedures, to make updated arrangements for the donation of bodies to anatomy schools, to provide for the setting of guidelines and standards to be met in the practice of anatomy, to introduce a licensing system for the public display of bodies or body parts and to establish a legal framework for the donation of organs and tissue for research purposes by both living and deceased persons.  It will be introduced later this year.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_287">
          <from>Minister for Defence  (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
          <p eId="para_522">Pursuant to a decision made by Cabinet today, I would like to make the following announcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">On behalf of the State, the Government apologises for the manner in which those members of the Defence Forces who left to fight on the Allied side during the Second World War, from 1939 to 1945, were treated after the war by the State.  The Government recognises the value and importance of their military contribution to the Allied victory and will introduce legislation to grant a pardon and amnesty to those who absented themselves from the Defence Forces without leave or permission to fight on the Allied side.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The Government recognises the value and importance to the State of the essential service given by all those who served in the Defence Forces throughout the period of the Second World War.  They performed a crucial duty for the State at a time of national emergency and enormous difficulty.  The loyalty of the Defence Forces to the State is indispensable.  It is essential to the national interest that members of the Defence Forces do not abandon their duties at any time, especially at a time of crisis, and no responsible Government could ever depart from this principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">In addressing the question of desertion during the Second World War, the Government acknowledges that the war gave rise to circumstances that were grave and exceptional.  Members of the Defence Forces left their posts at that time to fight on the Allied side against tyranny and, together with many thousands of other Irish men and women, played an important role in defending freedom and democracy. Those who fought on the Allied side also contributed to protecting this State's sovereignty and independence and our democratic values.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">When, in August 1945, the Government of the day, through an Emergency Powers Order, addressed the question of members of the Defence Forces who had absented themselves during the Second World War by summarily dismissing them from the Defence Forces and disqualifying them for seven years from holding employment or office remunerated from the State's Central Fund, individuals were not given a chance to explain their absence.  This remained the position following the transposition of the Emergency Powers Order into an Act of the Oireachtas in 1946.  No distinction was made between those who fought on the Allied side for freedom and democracy and those who absented themselves for other reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">In the almost 73 years since the outbreak of World War II, our understanding of history has matured.  We can re-evaluate actions taken long ago, free from the constraints that bound those directly involved and without questioning or revisiting their motivations.  It is time for understanding and forgiveness.  Also, at a time of greater insight and understanding of the shared history and experiences of Ireland and Britain, it is right that the role played by Irish veterans who fought on the Allied side be recognised and the rejection they experienced be understood.  To that end, this Government has now resolved to provide a legal mechanism that will provide an amnesty to those who absented themselves from our Defence Forces and fought with the Allied Forces in the Second World War and to provide a pardon to those who were individually court-martialled.  This will be achieved without undermining the general principle regarding desertion.  The proposed legislation, which I intend to introduce later this year, will provide that the pardon and amnesty does not give rise to any right or entitlement or to any liability of any nature on the part of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">In extending this amnesty and pardon, the Government emphasises that it does not condone desertion, and fully recognises, values and respects the contribution of all those who stood by their post with the Defence Forces and pledged their lives to defend this State's integrity and sovereignty against any and all aggressors.</p>

          <heading>Modern Languages Initiative</heading>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_291">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_532">The decision by the Minister for Education and Skills to abolish the modern languages in primary schools initiative was extremely regressive and shortsighted.  After benefiting 550 primary schools and thousands of young children for 13 years, this positive initiative will shortly come to an end.  The benefits of the scheme far outweigh its cost.  In times of financial difficulty, initiatives such as this which provide excellent value for money should be kept in place rather than dismantled.  A legitimate case can be made for expanding the programme in light of its value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_533">This decision makes no sense, whether culturally, linguistically or economically.  Does the Minister realise that foreign multinationals such as Google and PayPal are crying out for young Irish graduates with strong foreign language skills or that Irish-owned companies need personnel who can market Irish goods abroad?  The UK Secretary of State for Education is due to announce this week that it will be compulsory to learn a foreign language from the age of seven as part of a new draft national primary curriculum in that country.  The British Government recognises the importance of developing language skills from a young age.  However, our Minister, Deputy Quinn, wants to take the opposite policy direction to that taken in other countries by dismantling all the progress made to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_534">The initiative has been operating successfully since I first launched it in 1999 as Minister for Education and Science.  It is recognised by the Council of Europe as forward looking and thousands of children and young people have benefited over the years by learning Spanish, French, German or Italian.  It has helped to bring about greater diversity in the language capacity of students and experts recognise that it is easier for students to develop language skills when they do so at a young age.  It has fostered positive attitudes towards language learning and the response among teachers has been positive.</p>
            <p eId="para_535">Since announcing the cut in budget 2012, the Minister has failed to provide a rationale for his regressive decision.  On foot of a freedom of information request to the Department of Education and Skills for details on the research or impact analysis carried out prior to taking the decision, the Department was not able to provide me with any material and simply stated that the budgetary decision was based on an outdated 2008 NCCA report entitled Modern Language in the Primary School Curriculum: Feasibility and Futures.  This report did not in fact recommend ending the modern languages in primary schools initiative and the NCCA supports the initiative and believes it should be continued.  Only two weeks ago, the NCCA published three new research reports to support the development of a new language curriculum at primary level.  One report referred to the modern languages in primary schools initiative and recommended the introduction of an integrated language curriculum to ensure language skills are transferred effectively from one language to the other, whether that is English, Irish or another modern language.  It stated that when children develop literacy skills in Irish, English or another language they not only learn how to read and write in a particular language but also develop a common underlying proficiency that enables the transfer of literacy skills and learning strategies to other languages.</p>
            <p eId="para_536">The report's recommendations clearly show the folly of the Minister's approach to literacy, language learning and the modern languages in primary schools initiative.  It demonstrates a lack of understanding on the part of the Minister of the positive and complementary role that languages can play in developing literacy skills among primary school children.  The Minister must heed the most recent NCCA reports and ensure we develop an integrated language curriculum where language learning supports the development of literacy skills across all languages.  It is clear from the NCCA's research that there is no justification for abolishing this important and cost effective initiative.  It is time he recognises that he is wrong and reverses his decision immediately.</p>

          <speech by="#CiaranCannon" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_292">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills  (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
            <p eId="para_537">I am taking this topical issue on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills.  I thank Deputy Martin for raising the issue and welcome the opportunity to clarify the decision taken in the context of budget 2012 on ending of the modern languages in primary schools initiative.  As part of the budget 2012 decisions that have been announced, the modern languages in primary schools initiative will cease at the end of the 2011-12 school year.  Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn has spoken repeatedly about the need to raise educational standards.  In terms of curriculum reform the priorities in the period ahead are to strengthen achievement in literacy and numeracy, implement reforms in maths, Irish and science and progress junior cycle reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_538">The modern languages initiative was a pilot scheme which involved approximately 550 schools and had been operating since 1998.  It has not been possible for other schools to join the pilot project for a number of years and the way in which it operated was not capable of being rolled out to all 3,200 primary schools.  The decision to end the scheme was based in part on policy advice from a 2008 report by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment which identified serious issues with curricular overload at primary level.  The NCCA recommended that modern languages should not be part of the primary school curriculum as an additional and separate subject at present.  The advice on curriculum overload predated the wake up call on literacy and numeracy triggered by the PISA results.  The Minister is taking that advice on board, with particular regard to the demands on time that will result from a heightened focus on literacy and numeracy.</p>
            <p eId="para_539">The primary curriculum is currently being reviewed by the NCCA in the context of the national literacy and numeracy strategy, Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life.  The 17% of schools currently involved in the initiative faced greater time demands than others in a crowded curricular space and should now be better placed to deliver under the strategy.  The focus of the review will be on how best to enhance children's learning in these areas, provide a clearer delineation of the learning outcomes required and integrate into the infant cycle the learning experiences from Aistear, the curriculum framework for early childhood education.</p>
            <p eId="para_540">At post-primary level targeted support is provided to schools to enable them to diversify language provision, with a particular focus on Spanish, Japanese, Russian and Italian.  Other languages taught at second level include French, German and Arabic.  Participation in foreign languages remains high relative to other subjects.  The vast majority of students are studying two languages and are therefore developing core skills which will serve them well in future language learning over their lifespans.  There are also many opportunities outside the second level system for people to resume language learning.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_293">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_541">I am extremely disappointed by that dishonest response.  It is not good enough to blame PISA for this.  The vast majority of the 550 schools participating in the initiative do not face problems with numeracy or literacy.  Stop trying to pretend that we are getting rid of a good scheme in order to introduce a broader literacy and numeracy programme.  That is the kind of dishonesty that drives people mad.  All the official speak dressed up in this response is just that.  It is stupid, wrong and dishonest to end the initiative.  The Minister needs to cop himself on.  Last week he tried to argue that he never bought a German car in German to justify a claim that we do not need to teach German in our schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_542">What the hell is going on in the Minister's office or in the Department?  The initiative is no longer a pilot scheme.  These schools showed initiative and they were not concerned about curriculum overload.  The Minister of State should not bring up PISA, in which regard different issues arise.  It appears that the Minister wants to use PISA as a cover to dump on education, teachers and standards.  We are well aware of the issues that affected PISA outcomes, such as dramatic changes in the population and the number of non-English speakers who have entered the education system in the last decade.  This is a dishonest approach.  The €2.5 million involved supported 550 schools which showed initiative in introducing children to languages such as Italian, Spanish, French and German.  All of us know that if children are introduced to learning at an young age they will benefit as a result.  It a disgraceful educational and cultural decision and it is crazy from an economic perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_543">The Minister of State will speak about exports and markets.  Do we not know that Spanish is spoken by half of the world, that Germany is the biggest importer of Irish pork and that France is a significant consumer of Irish seafood?  As far as we are concerned, we do not give a damn whether young children learn French, Spanish or Italian.  This is a very dishonest response and it is time to stop insulting people with arguments of this kind, camouflaging what the Minister of State is up to and trying to give other reasons and rationale for incorrect decisions.  The decision should be reversed and it is within the capacity, and the budgetary capacity, of the Department to do so.  Is there an agenda of which we are not aware?  Was someone in the Department out to get this initiative?  The logic of what has been decided escapes me and it needs a genuine review by the Minister of State.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ciarán Cannon</from>
            <p eId="para_544">Deputy Martin can only acknowledge that the PISA results were a wake-up call for the country.  Other jurisdictions had similar challenges to Ireland in coping with children of varying languages and nationalities and those countries achieved higher PISA results.  It cannot be explained by that one issue.  Given the priority literacy and numeracy represent for this country, the Minister acted on the advice about curricular overload.  He could not justify the continuation of the modern languages initiative in existing schools or its expansion to 3,200 schools, even if funding was not an issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_546">The focus is on the efforts needed throughout the school system to underpin the literacy and numeracy strategy.  We are facing challenging times as a country, particularly in the education sector.  Given the scale of our economic crisis, adjustments had to be made across all areas of the public sector and public spending.  Despite the challenge, the Government has sought to do this in as fair a way as possible.  The Government had to take difficult decisions in the budget, including the decision to end this initiative.  To the greatest extent possible, the Government has shielded front line services and does not plan to review the decision to end the modern languages in primary schools initiative.</p>

        <heading>Unemployment Levels</heading>
        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_298">
          <from>Deputy John Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_548">We must examine the unemployment figures for the south east.  The national employment rate is 14.8% and the corresponding figure for the south east is 19.7%.  Let us call it 20%, which is 25% above the national average.  To put it in perspective, the national unemployment rate in Ireland in 1989 was 18.7% and today, in the south east, it is 1% above the 1989 figure.  In my constituency, Waterford, 15,000 people are unemployed.  The figures are horrific and the latest Investing in Ireland report made the case that Ireland's position as location of choice for foreign direct investment has been consolidated and could yield 20,000 extra jobs over the next three years.  Since the start of the year, we have seen a number of significant job announcements, including Allergan Pharmaceuticals Ireland in Westport, Abbott, Big Fish Games, Hewlett-Packard, PayPal in Dundalk, Eli Lilly and Apple in Cork, and Mylan and Cisco Systems in Galway.  It is all good news but, in the south east, we are feeling a little left out of the loop and not just because of foreign direct investment this year.  We are feeling isolated because the trend has been apparent for many years.  A recent study of the national spatial strategy found as many as 82% of jobs created by overseas firms in the past six firms were centred around Dublin, Cork and Galway.  The south east of the country is in a slide towards chronic long-term unemployment.  Despite some infrastructural additions over the past ten years, the south east has become the regional poor man of Ireland.  It is fair to say we are in a crisis situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">I want to raise a matter I have come across over the years, the perception that Waterford city, in particular, does not attract foreign investors because of the perception of a reputation for militant unionisation.  This could put off potential companies coming to the city.  It has been raised with me by officials in State agencies like the IDA.  I do not know if it is true but the perception exists and it is time the perception is addressed.  If it is a factor in Waterford city not attracting a reasonable ratio of foreign direct investment in Ireland, it must be acknowledged.  It has been raised with me too many times to ignore it any more.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">This brings us to the response of the Government to the 20% unemployment rate in the south east.  Following the loss of hundreds of jobs in TalkTalk in Waterford, the south-east unemployment action plan was launched in December 2011.  At the time, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, said "compared to other regions the south east's industrial base has not developed strong clusters in specific sectors that can then help attract future investment.  The multinational sector is proportionately smaller than in other regions".  Forfás produced a report on the south east but the problem is that Forfás has produced reports like it for every region in the country, including locations I listed earlier that have received the bulk of foreign direct investment in this country over the past ten or 15 years.  There would not be much difference if one took the south-east action plan and compared it to an action plan for somewhere else.  There is a massive difference in the south east and the gap is widening.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">What further action does the Government intend to take regarding the 20% unemployment rate in the south east?  Does he agree that, as far as the regions are concerned, we have a major unemployment crisis in the south east?  The figures speak for themselves.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" as="#Minister_for_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation" eId="spk_299">
          <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
          <p eId="para_552">I thank Deputy Deasy for raising this issue and I understand his concern.  The figures show the south east with the highest rate of unemployment in the country at 19.7%.  That was a feature even in the good times.  It was an area with high unemployment even while there was strong performance in the rest of the country.  Unemployment blackspots, which disappeared in many parts of the country, persisted in Waterford.  That was the background to my decision last December, following the closure of Talk Talk, to set up a south-east action plan.  It is in recognition of the structural problems Deputy Deasy recognises.  There is a mixture of problems with education and physical infrastructure, many of which have been debated.  Other structural problems include those spelled out by Deputy Deasy.  New industry has not taken hold a strongly in Waterford as it has in other regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The positive point in the action plan is that it has identified strengths as well as weaknesses.  The Deputy referred specifically to the activity of the IDA and the sense of neglect or a lack of attention.  Since I gave a direction to the IDA to give clear priority to the region, there has been a significant step up in site visits to Waterford.  In the year to date, and we are not yet halfway through the year, there have been more site visits than in the past three years.  There is a significant increase in activity.  I visited the region on three occasions and plan to meet the stakeholders in the south-east action plan later this month, which is roughly six months after it was launched, to review progress.  Solid progress has been made on the plan but it is not spectacular.  Against the background of the problems, we need to continue our focus and I am determined to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">The question of a bad perception of industrial relations in Waterford has not been an issue on my book.  All of the fault was on the employer side and not in any way on the workers side in respect of how the TalkTalk closure was handled.  The workers behaved with great dignity and it was an encouraging sign of confidence building for potential investors.  I refer to the establishment of Eistech by three former employees of TalkTalk.  This is a company with potential for significant growth and it can be counted as an early success of the south-east action plan.  I accept the Deputy's well made point that we need to continue to work on this agenda.  Many factors contribute to build the environment - or ecosystem - for stronger growth in sectoral opportunities.  The Waterford Institute of Technology has been very impressive in its technology centre with regard to telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, the food and environmental area.  These are significant bases which it is hoped will help when companies are brought on site visits in an attempt to market the region successfully.  The bringing together of interested parties and sectors has resulted in a sense of shared ownership of the problem and this is helpful.  It was heartening to see the groups working together.  I accept the Deputy's point that progress remains to be made in this area and this against a background of very difficult conditions in the domestic economy and which impact on Waterford in particular given the variety of its industrial sectors.  The economic conditions probably impact to a disproportionate degree on the south east because it does not have the sectors which have proved themselves to be more resilient in these difficult circumstances.  I reiterate my commitment to working with the region in order to ensure the agencies under my remit maintain their focus on the region.  I will review the progress and I hope to add further initiatives which can build on the current action plan.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_300">
          <from>Deputy John Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_555">The south east was ahead of other regions over the decades with regard to the historical trend but it should not be accepted that this will remain the case.  The region's unemployment rate is 25% higher than the national average and it is becoming one big blackspot.  Since the action plan was launched there is a consensus of opinion that the State agencies such as IDA Ireland have been working a little harder and I note there are more site visits and itineraries.  The different sectoral groups in the agencies have brushed up on Waterford, so to speak.  They have visited Waterford and the region and they have acquainted themselves with the strengths and weaknesses.  The view resulting from this activity is that the life sciences area such as pharmaceuticals, medical devices, may provide a possible cluster of industries which could be developed more strenuously in the south east.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">However, what has not happened is a commitment to pull together the local development forum consisting of the local authorities, academics and Departments, on a quarterly basis.  I ask the Minister to examine why this has not happened.  The Minister has visited the region on three occasions since December but I have been asked why the quarterly meeting of that forum has not happened.  I suggest there have been no tangible results in a macro sense for Waterford and the region from the action plan for the south east.  There has been no net effect.  To be blunt, the efforts so far, even though well intentioned, have not been sufficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Large numbers of job losses affect communities to their very core.  Such events result in emigration, there is a higher level of crime and they destabilise and undermine the positive work of Government and other groups in many areas of community life.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">The Minister must look at the hard facts and acknowledge that the south east requires a different response.  The feeling in my constituency is that there is no national imperative to deal with the situation in the south east.  There is an imbalance in responses and this is obvious in the figures.  In my opinion, the Government needs to address and correct this imbalance even if it means providing additional incentives to potential foreign investors.  An unemployment rate of 20% is not just disastrous, it is dangerous and the Government needs to take this on board.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_301" as="#Minister_for_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation">
          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_559">I acknowledge Deputy Deasy's point that the agencies have increased their activity in the region and I note his acknowledgement of the sectoral opportunities for development such as in the life sciences.  I will pursue his query as to the reason for the lack of quarterly meetings by the forum.  My impression is that there is quite an amount of bottom-up commitment in the region.  I will raise those questions and see what can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">The enterprise agencies are treating Waterford as a special case and this needs to be reflected elsewhere across Government in order to meet the infrastructural and structural problems.  I have no doubt that the Pathways to Work initiative under the remit of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, will focus on the south east because of its high levels of unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Deputy Deasy makes the point that six months on, we have not reversed the trends but it will take longer than six months to address these problems.  However, in my view, with consistent attention to the challenges, we will make progress here.  Nationally, improvements across many areas will be required under the action plan for jobs, such as access to finance and the encouragement of start-up companies and competitiveness, the resolution of broadband access deficiencies and other infrastructural factors.  We need to continue with the agenda of work in order to undertake an economic transformation nationally.  It will be a difficult period but the action plan for jobs process which is an annual programme of actions that will make a difference, is vital in tackling not just the south east's problems but also the wider problems.  The Government has a policy vehicle which will bring together all Departments in a more meaningful way in order to address the employment challenge.  I believe this will help in the south-east region which has been affected by many challenges other than enterprise challenges.</p>

I ask the Government to consider the introduction of legislation to cover cases where the intent can be proven that a person who enters a property or a premises intended to use physical force against the occupant.  I refer in particular to cases involving people living in isolated rural communities and small towns and villages and where scumbags arrive to their house, tie them to a chair with a rope or cable ties, beat them up in order to force them into giving information on the location in the house of a few pounds or the cash in a handbag, or the recently collected pension.  There is a real fear in rural communities because of the number of robberies but also of the nature of the recent robberies.  The time has come for the introduction of mandatory sentencing for those found guilty of committing an act of burglary and who intended to use physical force against the occupant of the house.</p>
            <p eId="para_563">These are not just burglars or criminals, these people are some sort of sub-human beings.  In some cases, they would tie an elderly person to a chair with cable-ties, and beat them up to get information on where there is money in the house.  They should not be eligible for early release.  They should serve the full sentence, which should be mandatory and reflect the scale of the crime they have perpetrated - not only on elderly or vulnerable persons living alone who may be intellectually or physically disabled, but also on the wider community which they have left in fear.</p>
            <p eId="para_564">Now is the time to address this matter in order to reflect public anger.  Such people in isolated rural areas are being targeted in a vicious fashion by some sort of sub-humans who need to be treated as such by the State.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
            <p eId="para_565">I wish to thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me and Deputy O'Donovan to raise this issue.  While I have the utmost respect for the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, it is disappointing that the Minister for Justice and Equality is not present.  Deputy Shatter was able to leave the Seanad 30 minutes ago to make a good news announcement but he cannot be here to listen to this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_566">Deputy O'Donovan is correct in saying that there is currently huge fear in rural communities over burglaries.  The Minister of State will be aware of this also.  In the Sligo-Leitrim region last year burglaries increased by 30%, in Laois-Offaly by 32% and in Meath by 40%.  I acknowledge that the Garda is operating Operation Fiacla to target gangs.  However, there is frustration in communities because when such people are picked up, they are not afraid of the law.  There is no set policy on sentencing, despite the terror such people cause.</p>
            <p eId="para_567">I wish to extend our good wishes to the victims and families of those involved in the incidents in Tuam and Limerick last week.  Such incidents are happening all over the country but they do not get media publicity in the way those two did.  It is, however, very unusual for that kind of incident to occur during the summer.  Such incidents are normally associated with the long winter nights but they are now happening in broad daylight.  Gangs do not seem to have any fear of the law or of the consequences of being caught.</p>
            <p eId="para_568">The issue of mandatory sentencing needs to be examined.  Deputy O'Donovan is right to say that a strict sentencing procedure is required, with no remission.  The kind of incidents that occurred in Galway and Limerick last week, are also happening all over the country.  People of any age but particularly the elderly who have served their communities and the State, do not deserve to live in fear.  They most certainly do not deserve that kind of violence to be perpetrated upon them.  The full force of the law should be applied to those who perpetrate it.  They also need to know that when caught they will face a minimum sentence and will not receive any remission.</p>
            <p eId="para_569">In addition, gangs should be investigated by the Criminal Assets Bureau given the kind of financial assets that seem to be available to them.  If we hit them at every level, we might be able to give some sort of peace and security to older people in this country.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Dinny McGinley)</from>
            <p eId="para_570">I thank Deputies Calleary and O'Donovan for bringing these important matters to the attention of the House.  I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who regrets that he is unable to be present due to other business.</p>
            <p eId="para_571">The Minister was appalled to hear of the recent incidents of aggravated burglary, where elderly people were terrorised in their own homes.  I am sure that the House will support the Minister's wish that the unfortunate people affected by these despicable crimes will be able to recover quickly.  As a number of Garda investigations are underway and some arrests have already been made, the Deputies will appreciate that it is not appropriate to comment on any of the particular cases.  The Minister is, of course, concerned about the incidence of burglary in recent times but he welcomes the fact that gardaí are responding effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_572">As the Deputies will be aware, the Garda Commissioner has introduced a wide range of measures aimed at tackling gangs involved in burglaries.  These measures are encompassed in Operation Fiacla, which is particularly focused on identifying and targeting mobile gangs involved in burglaries around the country, and bringing them before the courts.  Operation Fiacla is intelligence-driven and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda region in support of this national operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_573">Prevention is also a key issue in tackling burglary and the national crime prevention unit and crime prevention officers at divisional level provide advice, information and support to individuals, organisations and businesses to help reduce the incidence of burglary.  The Garda Síochána is proactive in supporting communities and a few weeks ago the Garda Commissioner launched the national Garda Supporting Safer Communities Campaign.  This important campaign highlights a range of key issues, including burglary prevention in particular.  A further campaign will take place in September.  In addition, the "Crime Call" television programme, which is broadcast once a month to an average of 400,000 viewers, is often used to highlight burglary prevention.</p>
            <p eId="para_574">Burglary is a criminal offence which carries serious penalties.  The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides for sentences of up to 14 years imprisonment for burglary and, in regard to aggravated burglary, up to life imprisonment.  In addition, section 25 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 provides, subject to certain criteria, that if a person who has been sentenced to a term of at least five years for a specified offence, including aggravated burglary, commits another specified offence within seven years of the first conviction, the court must impose a sentence of at least three-quarters of the maximum sentence - unless it would be disproportionate in all the circumstances of the case.  Where the maximum sentence is life imprisonment, the court must specify a sentence of at least ten years.  The Deputies will appreciate that the maximum sentences provided for in the legislation cannot in any way be considered inconsequential, and reflect the seriousness of such offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_575">In so far as the question of mandatory sentencing generally is concerned, the Deputies will be aware that there is currently a mandatory life sentence for murder and there are certain offences which are subject to a presumptive minimum mandatory sentences regime.  The previous Attorney General asked the Law Reform Commission to examine the issue of mandatory sentencing.  The LRC published a consultation paper on this issue last January.  As is the normal practice, the LRC has invited submissions from interested parties before it prepares its final report.  The Minister will examine and consider the LRC's recommendations as soon as the final report is available.</p>
            <p eId="para_576">The Government will do everything it can to support the Garda Síochána in its work and provide resources as public finances permit.  The Minister is confident that gardaí will continue to provide a robust response to those who engage in crimes aimed at vulnerable people, and will bring them to justice.</p>

          <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" eId="spk_305">
            <from>Deputy Patrick O’Donovan</from>
            <p eId="para_577">I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I do not believe in a yellow card system whereby mandatory sentencing would only kick in after the first crime, particularly when it is of an aggravated nature such as assaulting an old person in their own home.  The mandatory system needs to kick in from the start.  Part of the reason we are in the current position, is that State-sponsored do-gooders and civil libertarians have diluted the role of the criminal justice system.  They have done so to the point where ordinary people feel the criminal justice system is just that - justice for the criminal.  Victims are thus left in isolated rural areas, waiting for the next time some criminal walks in their gate.  We saw a high profile case in County Mayo where a person at his wits end, was driven to doing something he will probably regret for the rest of his life, but the man had no alternative.</p>
            <p eId="para_578">There should be no remission for these type of people who need to be exorcised from society.  There should be no early release for them and no yellow card system.  There should be mandatory sentences.  Such people should not repay their debt to society by having gym membership, menus and satellite TVs in prison.  They need to repay their debt to society in the strongest possible terms.  The criminal justice system should revert to a situation where it provides justice for victims, not criminals.</p>

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_306">
            <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
            <p eId="para_579">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  The robust response he spoke about has been undermined, particular in rural areas, by a number of cuts the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has made.  There has been a severe cut in the community alert scheme and we do not have the resources to launch new community alert schemes or expand existing ones.  Second, as a result of the substantial cuts to the senior alert scheme, which provides enormous security to older people in their homes by providing them with a pendant which alerts someone when an incident arises in the house, this scheme cannot be expanded.  Perhaps the Minister for Justice and Equality will meet with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to discuss the possibility of spending unspent money in the rural development fund and, perhaps, within the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, on those two schemes which support community initiatives to protect older people in their homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_580">My final comment is specifically a justice issue.  The €79 million in the Garda Siochána budget this year is impacting on overtime and on the availability of patrol cars.  Patrol cars are being withdrawn from rural areas, which is also undermining the robust response of which the Minister of State speaks in terms of the Garda Síochána's ability to deal with this issue.  I ask that the Ministers, Deputy Shatter and Deputy Hogan and, perhaps, the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, meet to consider whether there are funds available within the community section of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and within the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, that could allow for some expansion of the community and senior alert schemes, particularly at a time when the figures in respect of burglaries are increasing.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dinny McGinley</from>
            <p eId="para_581">On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, I again thank the Deputies for raising these important matters and for this useful exchange of views.</p>
            <p eId="para_582">I reiterate the Minister's revulsion at the recent burglary attacks on the homes of elderly people.  The Minister is very conscious of the deep distress which such crimes cause, in particular to more vulnerable members of our communities.  The sentences which exist in law reflect the seriousness with which these offences are regarded.  I have already mentioned some aspects of the targeted operational response being pursued by the Garda to address burglaries.  It should also be mentioned that underlying much of the Garda approach to crime prevention is a firm commitment to the principles of community policing which forms part of the ethos of the force.  At local level, Garda district and divisional offices configure policing responses in a manner appropriate to local circumstances and the needs of local communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_583">The gardaí continue to engage in a range of local partnership programmes such as neighbourhood watch and community alert, which provide an important support, particularly to the elderly and other vulnerable people.  In regard to concerns about the closure of Garda stations, the Garda Commissioner reviewed all aspects of An Garda Síochána's policing model and all divisional offices were asked to assess the level of activity in each Garda station in their area.  It must be stressed that the key objective of station closures is a more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than a securing of modest cash savings.  In this context, the Commissioner concluded that Garda resources could be more effectively used if particular stations did not have to be staffed and maintained.  Despite constraints in public finances, substantial Garda resources remain in place.  These must be seen in the context of the programme of real reform which is being delivered in An Garda Síochána in the context of the Croke Park agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_584">The Government has confidence in the Garda Commissioner and members of the force to continue to deliver on this reform so as to provide effective front line policing.</p>

          <speech by="#AodhanORiordan" eId="spk_308">
            <from>Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin</from>
            <p eId="para_585">I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's office affording me the opportunity to raise this issue.  I also welcome the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to the House to discuss this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_586">I do not normally raise matters concerning constituents on the floor of the House.  However, a telephone call which I received last night from a distressed person distressed me so much I felt I had to raise this matter not alone on behalf of the person concerned but on behalf of all persons in Ireland who may be experiencing such financial constraints they cannot pay their bills.</p>
            <p eId="para_587">My understanding was that the Minister had reached agreement with service providers that no essential service, be it electricity or gas, would be cut off from a household so long as a payment plan was in place.  The person concerned is a working woman and single parent.  Her electricity was cut off yesterday by Airtricity and she spent last night in a relative's house.  She feels completely humiliated, dehumanised and shamed.  That this company believed it had the power to disconnect electricity from her home, which she needs to keep her household going, is shameful.  Perhaps the Minister will say if all service providers were party to the agreement reached with him.  If not, is it his intention to bring all service providers around the table again to ensure this does not happen again?</p>
            <p eId="para_588">I have a few specific questions for the Minister.  Have other similar cases come across his desk or been received in his Department?  I fear this is not an isolated incident.  Also, is the Minister aware that Northern Ireland Electricity has since 1966 operated a zero disconnection policy for domestic customers, except where fraud is identified?  Where domestic customers get into serious arrears a meter is installed in the home and a proportion of the money put into it goes towards paying off the arrears.  This policy follows direction from the North's utility regulator, which viewed electricity supply as a health and safety issue.  Does the Minister believe, as I do, that electricity supply is a health and safety issue?  Does the energy regulator have an opinion on competing service providers who offer inducements to customers to switch providers and who then utilise small print to punish them when they find themselves unable to pay?  Does the Minister or the energy regulator have an opinion as to the payment options offered to customers, which often restrict the capacity of some customers to pay, which is the situation in the case I have raised today?</p>
            <p eId="para_589">I understand that the Minister cannot respond to each individual case raised by a constituent with a Member of this House.  I raise this issue not on behalf of the person concerned but on behalf of all people throughout the country who may find themselves in a situation where they are unable to pay a utility bill.  I heard today on "Liveline" of a woman who borrowed money from a moneylender and whose life is now fundamentally falling apart because of the pressure being put on her by that moneylender.  People make unfortunate decisions when pressure is put on them.  Does the Minister share my concern in regard to utility providers cutting off essential services to households and what in his opinion can be done about this in the short and long term?</p>

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_309">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources  (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_590">I thank Deputy Ó Ríordáin for raising this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_591">The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, is a statutorily independent body established under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and has responsibility for overseeing the regulation of Ireland's electricity and gas sectors.  The regulator promotes competition in the electricity and natural gas markets so that customers can ultimately benefit from competitive pressures on prices.  The CER also protects the interests of final customers, in particular the disadvantaged and the elderly, by ensuring that standards of services are set and codes of practice are in place to protect customers.  In this regard, the CER was of the same mind in respect of my initiative that a protocol be concluded with regard to disconnections.  I can confirm to Deputy Ó Ríordáin that while at the outset not all service providers wanted a disconnection protocol, the protocol put in place applies to all suppliers.</p>
            <p eId="para_592">I am also well aware that, as stated by the Deputy, some consumers are having trouble meeting their electricity and gas bills owing to challenges facing the economy and the fact that gas and electricity prices are increasing as a result of a significant rise in the price of gas worldwide.  As previously stated, I asked the regulator to work with all electricity and gas supply companies to implement initiatives to ensure that disconnection for non-payment of accounts will not take place where customers are experiencing genuine financial hardship and have either entered into a payment plan agreement or have agreed to the installation of a pay-as-you-go meter, as appropriate.  I did not know that there is a zero disconnections policy in Northern Ireland.  However, following what Deputy Ó Ríordáin has stated I will check it.  I understood it applied in Northern Ireland so long as one is party to a payment plan or one has installed a meter.</p>
            <p eId="para_593">In November 2010, the regulator introduced a number of initiatives on disconnections policy.  These included updating the guidelines for the disconnections code of practice and reducing the cost and allocation of costs of disconnection and reconnection for domestic customers.  Now, instead of the customer bearing the entire cost, these costs are shared equally by the supplier.  This is an interim measure effective until December 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_594">The regulator is also working with the energy supply industry on interim prepayment solutions and has consulted on the challenges of so-called "debt-hopping" with industry and other interest groups.  These groups included the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  In October 2011, the regulator introduced debt flagging into the change of suppliers processes.  This debt flagging will encourage customers and suppliers to address arrears in an upfront manner and hence prevent the accumulation of further debt and possible disconnection in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_595">The regulator has also proactively facilitated a pay-as-you-go metering system, also known as a prepayment meter, in both the natural gas and electricity industry to allow customers to manage their bills more effectively.  The pay-as-you-go metering system is being rolled out by all suppliers throughout the country.  In addition to providing a useful budgeting tool to customers, suppliers are required to offer customers facing disconnection the option of a pay-as-you-go meter, where it is suitable, instead of proceeding to disconnect the customer.  In these circumstances the customer's outstanding debt is placed on the meter and repaid over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_596">In late 2011, the regulator carried out an audit of the guidelines of the code of practice on disconnections to see whether suppliers were in compliance.  The audit showed that all suppliers had implemented the guidelines.  In the case of all examined domestic customer disconnections, the suppliers had exceed the regulator's requirements in terms of the timing of communication with customers and the numbers of attempts made to engage with customer prior to disconnection.</p>
            <p eId="para_597">The regulator will continue to monitor the retail electricity and gas markets, looking specifically at the issues of customer debt and disconnections over the coming months, and from now on will report quarterly on these matters in its electricity and gas retail market reports.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AodhanORiordan" eId="spk_310">
            <from>Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin</from>
            <p eId="para_598">I appreciate the Minister's extensive reply.  The case to which I referred is one I hope will not be repeated throughout the country.  I am glad the regulator conducted an audit of all service providers late last year and that quarterly reviews take place.  It is important to reiterate to anybody in the country under payment pressure that these criteria are in place; this agreement has been reached; it happened because of a Government initiative; some of the companies not involved initially have come on board; and customers have armoury when dealing as individuals with service providers.  Companies competing in this market make the switch from one service provider to another seem seamless, profitable and beneficial to customers experiencing serious financial strain.  Customers may switch from a more traditional service provider to a new company on the market but before they know it, it appears to be the worst decision they ever made because the new service provider has found a glitch in the terms and conditions, which may have been glossed over by the customer, whereby the company can come down heavy with regard to payment.  There is also an issue with regard to the payment plans which companies permit customers to enter.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">I congratulate the Minister on his initial initiative.  We would not be having this discussion unless the initial initiative had been initiated.  I urge the Minister and the Department to be rigorous in this regard.  The phone call I received last night was very distressing.  I can only assume it is happening throughout the country.  I do not trust the companies involved.  The fear factor with regard to people having their services disconnected helps the companies to pressurise those in various communities to pay money they may not necessarily have.  I make the point that the last thing we need is people accessing money - which they cannot pay back - from moneylenders or loan sharks in their communities who give simple answers.  The problems are compounded.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">Service providers have a huge responsibility.  This is a health and safety issue.  If people are legitimately trying to get their house in order, their bills regulated and their situation on a more sound financial footing they should be assisted.  They should not be dealing with unscrupulous service companies trying to browbeat them into paying money they do not have.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_311" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_601">I agree with Deputy Ó Ríordáin that this is a distressing case.  We were fortunate to have had a milder winter than was the experience in the previous two years.  However, the fact of the matter remains that gas prices globally have been on a constantly upward trend.  The weakening euro also makes it more expensive because of imports.  The weakening euro is probably helpful for many of our exporters selling goods on our neighbouring island but one area where it is certainly not helpful is in terms of the import costs associated with oil and gas.</p>
            <p eId="para_602">There has been an increase of approximately 6.7% in the rate of disconnections which, against the background I just painted, is unsurprising.  The regulator's assessment is that 30% of these domestic premises are vacant.  Nonetheless it is a concern.  I sincerely hope that between now and December the uptake of pay-as-you-go meters will continue to rise because it is very important that the protocol is observed on both sides.  The no disconnections protocol assumes one is in a payment plan or has installed a pay-as-you-go meter and I recommend this be done.  Factors such as the weather seem to motivate people.  If we have a very cold winter people realise they ought to have taken these steps, but if it is a relatively mild period there are fewer installations.  We also see this with regard to retrofit.  I acknowledge the work of organisations such as MABS and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and I urge them to spread the word about the no disconnections protocol and encourage as many people as possible to sign up.</p>

        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_312">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Fergus O’Dowd)</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_603">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_604">Tá mé ag tógaint an Bhille seo thar cheann an Aire Post, Fiontar agus Nuálaíochta, an Teachta Richard Bruton.  I thank the Deputies for facilitating the debate on this urgent issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The Bill, which has already passed all Stages in the Seanad, is compact and focused in nature and proposes a small number of changes to an existing company law measure.  The Bill is proposed in the interests of maintaining a dynamic and flexible operating environment for the commercial enterprises in question.  To ensure its continued relevance, legislation must be regularly appraised and adjusted as necessary.  Company law meets these criteria for relevance, and can take pride in its spirit and tradition of responsiveness to continuously evolving corporate circumstances.  The body of company law at this time comprises some 15 Companies Acts and it is not standing still.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is currently progressing a major legislative project on the reform and consolidation of company law from the seminal 1963 Act onwards.  I will address this later in my contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The Bill amends those provisions of the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which permit the use of US accounting standards - referred to as US GAAP - in the preparation of the accounts of the category of company specified there, and which allow for the prescription of the use of other internationally recognised accounting standards.  The Bill extends both the timescales relating to the availability for use of US accounting standards and the period for which an individual company can avail of this provision without changing the eligibility criteria.  It also correspondingly extends the periods in respect of the provision in that Act for prescription of other internationally recognised accounting standards also based on the 2009 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">The general context in which the proposal can be viewed is that of the Government's policy of stimulation and facilitation of foreign direct investment.  FDI continues to be a key element of our economic regeneration strategy.  The statistical data testify to its vital contribution to the economy, where it accounts for a total of 250,000 jobs which equates to one in every seven of our people at work.  This performance is holding up despite the general international economic downturn and the immediate outlook for Ireland's foreign investment portfolio is positive.  Up to the end of May, IDA Ireland had made 44 announcements in 2012 with the potential to create over 5,000 jobs.  We can take encouragement from this vote of confidence in Ireland's economy, reaffirming our attraction as a foreign direct investment location.  In accordance with the Government's action plan for jobs, IDA Ireland is working to target another 144 new FDI investment projects in 2012, which are expected to create 12,500 new jobs with an associated 8,750 in the wider economy, giving a total impact of 21,250 this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Since taking office, the Government has made a priority of addressing the major task of repairing our economy and restoring our international reputation.  This has required us to take action on a variety of fronts.  We are engaging with our European colleagues, the United States and many other countries to demonstrate that Ireland is squaring up to its economic difficulties, and has the intent, resolve and imagination to overcome them.  The restoration of our fortunes is an incremental process to be attained by the accretion of a large number of measures which of themselves may appear small, but which, in aggregation, develop substance and significance.  Accordingly, there is scope for the population as a whole to contribute, in their own way, to the process of national recovery.  The part the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has played has occupied much of his time since taking office last year.  I understand the Minister has undertaken eight major trade investment missions involving either IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland, in the course of which he met companies from one coast of the United States to the other, and from Saudi Arabia, India, China and elsewhere.  The Government has seized these opportunities to promote Ireland's many inherent strengths and its strategic location as a gateway to the European market.  This has generated keen interest in all aspects of what Ireland has to offer, including our skilled workforce, our pro-business environment, our tax offering, the strong base of multinationals already here and our embedded links with Europe.  Ireland is open, ready and eager for business and investment, and our hope is that this will lead to further jobs being created here in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">Ireland's approach to capturing FDI has undergone significant adaptation over time to achieve the optimum advantage and effect, with the result that the FDI landscape has continually undergone a transformation, scanning the horizons of enterprise focusing on and securing FDI using novel technologies, innovative business models and new markets.  Ireland's economy has been the beneficiary of these agile approaches and techniques, evolving in various phases from that of a location based originally on manufacturing to a rebranding of ourselves as the "young Europeans", through to the model of the smart economy built on the dual strengths of our innovativeness and entrepreneurship.  On a global scale, Ireland scores extremely well in many of the key areas of importance to investors, helping drive FDI.  The IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2012 ranks Ireland's overall competitiveness at 20th, up from 24th last year.  It also ranks Ireland first in the world for investment incentives, first for the availability of skilled labour and first for flexibility and adaptability of people.  The same report also ranks Ireland second in the world for foreign investors, third for labour productivity, third for exports of commercial services and fourth for corporate tax rate on profit.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">As a member of the European Union, Ireland offers international investors a stable political and economic environment and a sophisticated, well-developed corporate, legal and regulatory environment.  The quality of our economic regulation is a significant factor in our competitiveness and growth.  It is critical, therefore, that we have the capacity to respond to economic circumstances as they unfold in a way that is both strategic and reflective of the evolving needs of business and investors.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Those companies with a presence in Ireland and availing of the US GAAP facility under the 2009 Act provide significant employment here which the Bill should help to consolidate, with the possibility of further jobs being created, particularly in the event of an improvement of the economic situation in export markets over the coming time.  These companies are involved across a range of industry sectors, including health care, technology and services.  This is the broad policy context for the US GAAP measure contained in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">As I have already mentioned in outline, the Bill allows for the so called US GAAP facility and the provision for prescription of the use of other international accounting standards as provided for in the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 to be extended from the financial year ending on 31 December 2015 until 31 December 2020 with a removal of the restriction of a four-year maximum period for the use by a beneficiary company of either of the provisions.  The Minister is introducing this proposal in response to a strong approach to him from a number of US multinational companies, most of which have a significant operating presence in Ireland, requesting a prolongation of the US GAAP facility provided for in the 2009 Act.  High-level transatlantic initiatives have been afoot for some years to converge, or at least significantly align the International Financial Reporting Standards, known as IFRS which are used in the production of company accounts in the EU, with US GAAP accounting standards which are used in the US.  This would lend greater comparability to the financial performances of listed companies in the two jurisdictions because the ingredients used to produce these financial reports were similar or practically identical.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">The request that has persuaded the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to introduce this measure has a basis in delays in the process of international convergence of the US GAAP and IFRS accounting standards which is lagging behind the expectations of 2009.  In addition, the 2009 Act imposed a restriction on the time period allowed for use by a beneficiary company.  The current situation as regards the US Administration's attitude to this standards-convergence process or to a move to permitting this category of company to list in the US using IFRS accounting standards continues to be inconclusive.  While the attitude of the US Administration on this issue is likely to clarify over time, it is difficult to predict with accuracy when this may occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The four-year maximum period allowed to companies to use US GAAP under the existing legislation means that a number of the companies seeking the extension would be faced with having to put measures in place, as of the present time, to provide for the move by them to preparing accounts under IFRS.  Certain companies' entitlement under the 2009 Act expires at the end of this year.  If these companies were to be required to take on IFRS, which is a very different set of accounting standards, a considerable lead-time would be required for the necessary groundwork to be undertaken to provide for such a transition.  These companies, which are listed on US exchanges, need legal certainty now as to whether the time extension for the use of the US GAAP is being permitted.  This clarity is required from a number of perspectives, including considerations of corporate risk and corporate obligations relating to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and companies' shareholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">To deny the requested facility would entail significant costs and resource implications for the companies in question.  Appropriate mechanisms would be required to be in place to provide for the preparation of accounts under IFRS, and subsequently applied in the production of the accounts of these companies.  It would be particularly onerous and expensive for a company to convert to IFRS if the obligation to do so were to arise over a relatively short period.  Additionally, these companies would be still required to produce accounts using US GAAP and report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, to remain compliant in the US.  This would mean these companies would be required to produce two sets of accounts, which would be costly and burdensome on them.  The legislation is designed to facilitate multinational companies that have operations in Ireland to consolidate, and if possible, add to their activities here.  Such developments would contribute to further economic activity by them in Ireland and provide additional valuable employment opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The legislation, therefore, provides for the extension of the use by this very specific category of companies of US GAAP as provided for in the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 until the financial year ending at the latest on 31 December 2020.  The restriction on the use by the relevant parent undertaking of this facility to a maximum of four years is removed.  In the interests of maintaining the flexibility provided for in the 2009 Act in this area, the Minister is extending the enabling provision for ministerial prescription of other specified internationally recognised accounting standards if such a demand arose, and it was considered appropriate to do so.  This term of this extension will parallel that for US GAAP.  A point of prudential significance to make is that companies will continue to be subject to Irish company law generally, including, of course, all the provisions which relate to accounts.  In fact, Irish company law will override any provision of US GAAP which may be in conflict with the Companies Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">Allowing these companies to prepare their Irish accounts using US accounting standards for a further period of time would eliminate the significant duplication of cost and effort of preparing two sets of accounts under two different accounting standards.  It will also create a bridge to span the period during which significant international developments may occur with regard to the international harmonisation of accounting standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I will now turn to the details of the Bill.  Section 1 is the interpretation section.  Section 2 provides for the extension of the use of US GAAP as provided for in the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 by certain parent undertakings which are defined in the section.  This is subject to the proviso that the use of those principles in the preparation of the undertaking's accounts does not contravene any of the provisions of the Companies Acts or any regulations made thereunder.  The accounts in question are the company's group accounts and the individual accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">As heretofore, this arrangement will be limited to a specified category of companies.  In addition to existing beneficiary companies, the specified category of companies also comprises parent companies incorporating in Ireland for the first time whose securities are not traded on a regulated market in the European Economic Area, EEA, whose securities are registered with or who are subject to reporting to the US Securities and Exchange Commission and who, on the date that this Bill passes into law, have not already incurred an obligation to file their first accounts with the Registrar of Companies.  The section also provides for this arrangement to apply from the financial year ending at the latest on 31 December 2015 until the financial year ending at the latest on 31 December 2020, with the four year restriction for a beneficiary company removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Section 3 extends the Minister's power to make regulations to prescribe other specified internationally recognised accounting standards under which specified categories of companies may prepare accounts from the financial year ending on 31 December 2015, as provided for in the 2009 Act, up to and in respect of the financial year ending on 31 December 2020 at the latest, with the four year restriction for a beneficiary company removed.  The criteria applied under the 2009 Act remain.  These require that any such regulations shall specify the accounting standards, which shall be internationally recognised, and generally accepted accounting principles or practices of a jurisdiction where a majority of the subsidiaries of the parent undertaking have a substantial connection or where the market is situated in which the shares of the parent undertaking are primarily admitted to trading.  In preparing accounts using other internationally recognised accounting standards companies must not contravene any provision of the Companies Acts or any regulations made thereunder.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">Section 4 is a standard provision and simply contains the Short Title and provides that the Bill and the Companies Acts shall be read as one.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">I referred earlier to the ongoing major review and consolidation of the Companies Acts being undertaken in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and I welcome this opportunity to brief Deputies on the status of this major undertaking.  The Companies Bill will consolidate existing Irish company legislation dating from 1963 and introduce several reforms.  It will consolidate the existing 15 Companies Acts, or 16 when the Bill currently before the House becomes law, dating from 1963, as well as other regulations and common law provisions relating to the incorporation and operation of companies, into a single Act, which is expected to comprise some 1,400 sections.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">Parts 1 to 15 of the Companies Bill, which correspond to "Pillar A" of the general scheme, were published in soft copy format on the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation website in May of last year.  Parts 1 to 15 contain all of the law relating to the most common company type in Ireland, the private company limited by shares.  These parts comprise some 952 sections, together with six Schedules, and represent more than two-thirds of the entire Companies Bill.  The decision to publish Parts 1 to 15 in May 2011 was made to afford stakeholders, including business owners, practitioners, advisers and representative bodies, an opportunity to become familiar with the proposed new legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">In summary, the provisions of the Bill cover the incorporation of companies, corporate governance duties of directors and secretaries, financial statements and auditors, receivers, reorganisations, examinerships, windings-up and compliance and enforcement.  The provisions are brought together in a coherent structure which will facilitate business people in incorporating and operating companies on a day-to-day basis.  The Bill also modernises company law to reflect modern business practice.  Given that almost 90% of companies in Ireland today take the form of a private company limited by shares, the Bill sets out all of the provisions relating to that type of company in sequential Parts.  In subsequent Parts the provisions for the private company limited by shares are modified for other company types such as public limited companies, PLCs, and guarantee companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Furthermore, to promote compliance with the law and to protect members and creditors, the Bill also sets out clearly the duties of, for example, directors, company secretaries and auditors, including corporate governance duties.  The Bill also sets out the functions of the Companies Registration Office, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority in ensuring compliance with the law and brings together the provisions relating to compliance and enforcement, such as company investigations, compliance and protective orders, disclosure orders, disqualification and restriction of directors and prosecution, offences and evidential matters.  I can also confirm that drafting of the remaining Parts of the Bill - those corresponding to "Pillar B" - is at an advanced stage and the Minister hopes to be in a position to publish and introduce the Bill into the House towards the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">In conclusion, the extension of the timelines both in the US GAAP provision and in the scope to designate other internationally recognised accounting standards is a facilitative measure which signifies the Government's practical and active approach to industrial promotion and stimulating foreign direct investment.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
          <p eId="para_628">I do not believe I will need 30 minutes.  I thank the Minister of State for his contribution.  When considering any legislation, Members must consider it in context and against the backdrop against which it is being introduced.  In this case, one part of the backdrop is persistent and devastating unemployment and emigration, as outlined in the recent report by the Central Statistics Office, which is a problem that appears to be worsening steadily.  Another part of the backdrop is the uncertainty, despondency and - it is not too strong a word to use - despair that has been visited on the Irish people by the political leadership or rather the lack thereof by some people from outside this country.  The latest example in this regard was the recent slapstick performance in Brussels in which €100 billion, that is, 100,000 million euro, changed hands to calm the markets and succeeded in so doing for all of two hours.  This is the backdrop against which this legislation is being introduced.  Against such a backdrop of high and persistent unemployment, as well as debilitating uncertainty, one point stands out.  Approximately 1.75 million people are employed gainfully in this country and economy at present and as the Minister of State observed, one in seven of them is employed as a result of foreign direct investment.  My part of the country has considerable experience of foreign direct investment and I can state, without fear of contradiction, the vast majority of jobs provided as a result of foreign direct investment are well-paying and have contributed enormously to the surrounding economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The purpose of the Bill before the House is to consolidate certain aspects of the aforementioned foreign direct investment in the hope of expanding on it and from that perspective, I certainly am supportive of the Bill and find it difficult to argue against it.  Many of the foreign companies and multinationals that have invested in this country undoubtedly have done so to make profits for themselves and their shareholders.  They have made a decision to locate here for reasons that have little to do with feelings of love or sentimentality towards Ireland and everything to do with their own interests.  Nevertheless, as I have stated, the other side of that coin is they are providing much-needed, gainful and productive employment in Ireland and are helping the Irish economy to survive through a traumatic period.  Consequently, my party and I can understand fully the necessity for this Bill.  I will take this opportunity, in passing, to congratulate the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, on its continuing success.  However, I note that in so far as attracting industry or investment into Ireland is concerned, the authority is heavily focused on Europe and North America.  For example, of the 61 new investments announced by the IDA last year, only four or five came from outside of the aforementioned two areas and it will be necessary to broaden our horizons in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">In so far as the details of the Bill are concerned, the accounts of a company are meant to show its financial health.  This phenomenon of the financial health or financial status of a company can be measured in different ways and there is no uniform method of measurement.  The position in Ireland at present is that the Irish generally accepted accountancy principles, GAAP, are in use.  These are practically identical to the generally accepted accountancy principles of the United Kingdom.  As the Minister of State mentioned in his speech, there is an international standard, namely, the international financial reporting standards, IFRS, which is generally applicable to countries within the European Union.  All the different member states, such as France, Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom etc., have accounting systems which are slight variations of the IFRS.  Were one to apply the pure international IFRS system to any particular company in any particular period, while it may throw up a different result for the first year or two to the national standard in use here, this would be a temporary phenomenon.  On the other hand, my understanding is an attempt is being made to extend the IFRS system to Irish companies.  While it appears to be confined to major companies at present, my understanding is some variation thereof is being applied to middle-ranking companies in Ireland.  In any case, it is a particular system that one can co-ordinate and apply to different European Union member states because the systems are so similar.  The ambition had been to bring about a convergence between that standard, which for convenience I will refer to as the European Union standard, and the American way of producing accounts or measuring the financial health of a company.  It had been hoped to achieve a form of convergence or alignment between the two systems that would allow the present exemptions in the 2009 Act to be phased out.  Unfortunately, as the Minister of State has indicated, the timetable within which this could be done has proved to be wildly optimistic and from what I have read recently, there is a certain element of uncertainty as to whether this goal ever will be achieved, which would be unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">However, were the Government not to proceed with such legislation and to impose the requirement immediately, it would result in negative consequences for those companies that are investing in this country and are providing gainful and well-paid employment for the people.  The Minister of State has outlined some of these consequences, such as, for example, the cost of putting in place this system quickly.  I do not refer simply to the financial cost as the amount of red tape would be enormous for companies that would be better employed expanding their businesses and providing more employment, hopefully here in Ireland.  In addition, my understanding is even if the American multinationals to which this legislation applies were obliged to produce accounts here under the Irish accounting system, they also would be obliged to produce accounts under the American accounting system because to remain compliant in that country, they must still report to its Securities and Exchange Commission.  One need not emphasise how difficult that would be and how much red tape would be involved.  While unnecessary costs would be involved in so doing, there is a more significant consequence, which is that the accounting system in the United States is very different to that which pertains in Europe and this can lead to very different results for the same company within the same accounting period.  For example, I read recently about the example provided by Daimler-Benz, which is a major German public company.  When applying the European accounting system to a recent period, it showed a profit of DM 615 million, whereas applying the accounting system of the United States to the same period for the same company showed a loss of DM 1,800 million.  The two systems are very different and forcing a company to produce two different set of accounts showing wildly different results for the same period has profound consequences.  It has consequences for the confidence of investors and potential investors in the company, as well as to that of those who would trade with the company.  It would not be going too far to state it has the potential to have a highly destabilising effect on such companies, which surely is the last thing Members wish to do to enterprises that, for whatever reason, are providing gainful employment and are helping to sustain Ireland's economy through a rocky period.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Consequently, I supported the Bill and recognise its necessity.  I note the Minister of State's reference, in his concluding remarks, to the new companies legislation, which I believe contains 1,400 sections.  I cannot wait to begin debating the aforementioned 1,400 sections.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">One of the matters the Minister mentioned would be dealt with in the first part of the new companies legislation, which is germane to the topic we are discussing, is the responsibilities and duties of auditors.  I will not delay the House unduly but we are all aware of the shortcomings and difficulties that have arisen in regard to how auditors of major companies and financial institutions in this country have fallen short, in recent times, of what I would regard as a proper standard for auditors.  The test for what an auditor's responsibilities are was laid out by the House of Lords more than 100 years ago, acting in its capacity as supreme court of the United Kingdom.  The court stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_634">An auditor is not bound to be a detective or approach his work with a suspicion or a foregone conclusion that there is something wrong.  He is a watchdog but he is not a bloodhound.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">I do not believe anybody could accuse some of the auditors I have in mind, who have produced some of the results I have in mind, of being bloodhounds and it would be stretching the English language to breaking point to describe them as watchdogs.  If I could take the canine analogy to its logical conclusion the word "poodle" springs to mind.  The fact is-----</p>

I urge the Minister of State and his colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to take this on board.  I know there are certain movements within the profession to deal with this sort of situation.  It is difficult, for the reasons I stated, but the Government should use the opportunity of the new companies legislation to deal with the duties and responsibilities of auditors.  This was brought to my attention in respect of a certain company that collapsed recently because of a major hole in its accounts, an event that was newsworthy all over the country.  When I looked at the accounts and was satisfied as to what had been done, it is bewildering how it was passed by the auditors.  I will not be more specific.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">My party supports this legislation and we wish it a speedy passage.  We know representations were made to the Minister and we know why they were made.  The Minister was right to accede to those representations but in regard to the particular topic of accounting, accounting standards and measurement of profits the Government should deal as comprehensively as it can with the responsibility of auditors in the new companies legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_640">Go raibh míle maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  Is rud iontach tabhachtach í infheistíocht ó thar lear agus braitheann an tír seo uirthi.  I mo thuairim, braitheann an geilleagar an iomarca ar infheistíocht ó thar lear.  Foreign direct investment is extremely important to this State and brings massive positive benefits in regard to jobs, output, GDP and taxation and also in respect of bringing skills, cross-fertilisation of ideas, management styles and knowledge into the economy.  It also offers, as it should, opportunity for the supply side of the domestic side to meet the needs of the foreign direct investors.  As was discussed in the Chamber, there are major benefits in regard to the figures.  They include 146,000 people who work in the area, in some 1,004 foreign businesses operating in Ireland.  It is also a key instrument from the Government's current perspective, given the fact that the domestic economy is sinking.  In an effort to try to keep the totality of the economy afloat a large level of effort has gone into creating more foreign direct investment in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">As I have stated repeatedly in this Chamber, what we see, however, is a tale of a two-tiered economy.  On one side, the FDI side, there is quite a bit of activity but the domestic economy, which provides six out of seven jobs, is under major pressure.  It is important that when we have these debates we do not overstate the importance of foreign direct investment and that we realise it is not a panacea or a silver bullet that will solve the economic problems we face.  Yesterday I watched the RTE programme, "Reeling in the Years", which, looking at a year in the mid-1980s, carried a report about the shocking emigration figures in the period it covered, stating that 30,000 people had left the shores of the State during that period.  The Central Statistics Office will tell us that 76,000 people left the shores last year.  On this side of the House, we have stated that figure means nine people every hour for every day of every week of every month, making up all those people who left Ireland last year.  It is a shocking indictment of the employment situation.  No matter what way we try to scrub up the spin, the CSO also showed last week there is 14.8% unemployment in this State, some 3% off the percentage maximum figure there was in the mid 1980s.  The actual figure, not the percentage figure, is one of the highest figures the State has ever seen.  There has been a steady decrease in the number of people at work and a massive increase in the numbers of those who are considered long-term unemployed.  We talk about a possible 5,000 jobs coming though the foreign direct investment system.  That is to be welcomed but that 5,000 is the equivalent of three weeks emigration from this State.  The size of the problem and the proportionate response by the Government are out of kilter.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">On this matter the IMF has stated that foreign direct investment operates as an enclave in the Irish economy.  By that I mean there are not nearly enough organic links between domestic economy and foreign direct investment.  If one looks at the chemical and pharma sections they account for 60% of material exports of this State but that sector imports 80% to 90% of the components it uses to make those exports.  Its reliance and impact on the natural domestic economy is extremely low, shockingly so.  Those types of figures are not seen in FDI statistics across the rest of Europe.  We have seen that foreign direct investment is extremely capital intensive.  There has been a large upscaling of production in many FDI firms over the past ten years without any increase in employment in those companies.  In addition, foreign direct investment is very light on taxation contributions, much more so than the domestic economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">I highlight these issues not to lessen the good work that is done in regard to attracting foreign direct investment into this State but to try to put it into perspective and motivate the Government in regard to the necessary steps to take to develop the channels that will allow the domestic economy to start to supply into foreign direct investment companies.  I do it also to motivate the Government to increase its efforts to focus on the domestic economy which employs more, contributes more and has a bigger impact on this State but is strangled due to the fact there is no credit going into it and because demand has fallen off a cliff, both here and in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">In addition, I am disappointed in the regional delivery of foreign direct investment.  I come from County Meath which has one of the biggest populations of any county within the State yet we receive a fraction of foreign direct investment compared to what County Kildare, for example, receives.  Kildare gets 12 times more investment and jobs from IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland than Meath does.  In many ways, Meath has been relegated to commuter county status.  Most of the jobs are located outside the county; we have the highest commuter distances to travel, the greatest number of people leaving the county every day to go to work.  There is the danger, when enterprise organisations and authorities are organised on a regional basis, that they will prefer one county over another.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">Most of the jobs that came to County Meath during the boom times related to the construction industry.  Those jobs are now gone.  This creates major difficulties in counties like my own.  When jobs are not there, not only does it mean that people's quality of life is reduced because they have to travel such distances to go to work, but it also means that local authorities receive less income and consequently are less able to deliver services.  That is especially the case in County Meath.  We have the lowest<i>per capita</i> number of local authority jobs in the State and the lowest <i>per capita</i> local authority spend in the State, which can mean that young people who leave to go to third level colleges do not get to come back to their local areas to live near their families.  It is important for us to organise our enterprise development authorities in a way that allows for a fair spread of jobs and investment.  I am worried that as the county enterprise boards morph into the local area enterprise offices, they will become more regionally focussed and their delivery will be uneven as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I would like to ask the Minister about another important matter.  In recent years, EU regulations have determined the level of grant contributions that can be offered to foreign direct investment as it comes into Ireland.  The BMW region is allowed to offer far more than the mid-east region, which is considered to be wealthier than the BMW region.  There is a logic to that.  As I have stated previously, Meath gets much less than the rest of the mid-east region.  It is time for the grant contribution regulations, which were initially negotiated at the height of the boom, to be renegotiated now that we are living in a completely different space.  It is wrong that businesses in Navan cannot receive the full level of foreign direct investment grants that can be given to businesses 17 miles up the road in Drogheda.  I appreciate that might be to the advantage of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd.  It is time to reorganise and reappraise the determining factors that allow us to offer foreign direct investment grants in each area.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">I am broadly supportive of the thrust of this Bill, particularly in so far as it pertains to the functioning of the foreign direct investment sector in this part of Ireland.  In the absence of a greater degree of international convergence in the sector, it is important to avoid the unnecessary costs that would have to be borne by companies if they were forced to recalculate their financial statements under different systems.  We should work with foreign direct investors to make life easier for them, albeit at no major cost to the State.  I am conscious that section 3 of the Bill, which is an enabling provision, will allow other international codes to be used in the future.  As Deputy O'Dea said, there is no doubt that different codes will give different results.  He mentioned the difference in deutschmarks in the profits and losses made by Daimler-Benz, depending on the code that is used.  It is important to give complete confidence to the House that any standards that are used will not have a negative financial impact in this State.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on that.  Equally, the standards that are used should not cloud people's understanding of the functionality of a particular business.  When different codes are used - like different languages - some people are able to understand one better than another.  The financial health of a company, as indicated on its balance sheet, should be properly understood.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">I note that the State is engaging in a selective incorporation of standards.  I would like to refer to an issue that is quite similar to the one we are discussing.  The White House recently said it would introduce measures to discourage accounting games that allow companies to shift profits abroad in the absence of actual relocation of production overseas.  It is understood that one of the accounting games the White House has in mind is the notorious "double Irish" tax avoidance scheme, which is said to be used by some American firms in this State.  Under the scheme in question, multinational companies use subsidiary companies to route their overseas profits through Ireland and onto a tax haven like the Cayman Islands or Bermuda.  If they do so by means of royalty payments, they can reduce or negate the taxation exposure they might experience.  The reality is that such routing does not have a material impact on job creation or wealth creation in this State.  In fact, it unfairly inflates the income of the State.  At a time when we are talking about working towards international taxation convergence, I suggest we should be trying to ensure such loopholes do not exist and firms cannot take advantage of Ireland's taxation policies in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">I have similar concerns about potential abuses of Ireland's research and development tax credit system.  Although that does not relate directly to the legislation before the House, it is relevant to the broader context of the foreign direct investment sector and transfer pricing.  We support the facilitation of those involved in foreign direct investment who have asked to be allowed to trade in a fair and equitable manner.  The Government needs to ensure that short-term gains with regard to tax loopholes do not have the effect of corroding long-term international relationships.</p>

          <p eId="para_652">I think I welcome this Bill.  I do not want to disturb the unanimity that exists in this House on it.  My reservations in this regard are partly based on my ignorance or lack of experience of the difference between the International Financial Reporting Standards and the US GAAP facility and partly based on my in-built suspicions about any legislation that introduces deregulation of any sort at this time.  There are obvious historical reasons for my difficulties in that regard.  Questions should be asked about the accounting standards that were used at the time of the banking crisis and the collapse in the property market.  I refer particularly to the process that led to various debts and property values being written off or provisioned and to the discretion that is used by accountants and auditors.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">We heard a good illustration of the difference between US accounts and Irish accounts from Deputy O'Dea when he mentioned a company that had massive losses under the US system but could produce a large profit under the Irish system.  I suppose it makes one particularly suspicious of accountants or auditors using their discretion.  It is alarming and revealing to those who are not conversant with the accountancy profession and its methods that different accountants can produce such extraordinarily contrasting results.  One has to ask where the truth lies in such cases.  Why are US companies looking for this concession, which has so readily been given to them by the Government?  According to the Government - the Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong - it is a straightforward question of introducing measures to encourage multinationals to come here and stimulate foreign direct investment.  The Government claims that this Bill is not fundamental, but that the thrust of it is to make concessions and give it the right to extend US GAAP accountancy standards to these companies, rather than giving such companies an absolute right.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">It is obvious that the US Chamber of Commerce and others have put a great deal of pressure on the Government to make this concession.  There is nothing wrong with that<i>per se</i>.  Every speaker, including the last one, has conceded that US companies have played an extraordinarily valuable role in the economy.  I remember when a Minister in the last Government told me he was very worried about the economy because it was depending on the construction sector and on multinational companies.  It was a prescient warning.  I will not identify him because it was a private conversation, but he was right.  The second of those pillars is the only one that survives now.  His analysis might not have been particularly sophisticated, but it was a pretty rough estimate of two parts of the economy that were vibrant at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">I was interested in Deputy Tóibín's point that indigenous business should be encouraged, as it should be.  The easy part, in some ways, is what we are doing with multinationals.  I wish to applaud the Government for its encouragement of multinationals and its successes in bringing multinationals into this country at a time of great difficulty.  I am a great supporter of multinationals.  Nonetheless, it sometimes amazes me the success the Minister, Deputy Bruton, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, and others have had in continuing to attract multinationals with household names to locate their headquarters here at a time when Ireland is getting such a bad press around the world.  That is a great success story at a very bad time.  God knows what we would do without them at the moment.  It should be recognised that the concentration, encouragement, effort and energy which has gone into this has been successful.  Some are leaving and some, tragically, are laying off some of their workforce, but others are coming here and are still recognising Ireland as a good place in which to locate and develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">This measure, if it is part of a concession to those particular demands, is<i>prima facie</i> a good idea.  I would issue a caveat in saying that we should be careful about deregulation and about allowing the rules to loosen because they can be exploited in a way which might come back to bite us.  The multinationals are employment driven and I understand there are some 250,000 employees in the multinational sector here.  They have to be encouraged and kept at work as we cannot afford to lose them.  Therefore, we have to give them reasonable concessions when they want them.  If this is one of their reasonable demands, which I understand it is, it is right that we should do it for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">We must also look towards the future for multinationals here, and let us hope they are here for many years to come.  The reasons they are here are taxation-based, and this Bill is related to that matter.  They are here because there is a 12.5% corporate tax rate and because there is a young, well educated workforce.  All of those reasons still stand.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">On the corporate tax rate, I suggest the following, not as a way-out idea but as one which the Government should consider at some stage.  We have had a lot of flak from France, less from Germany and other countries, about harmonising our tax.  We have also had a lot of flak from several countries, including the US, about some of our practices such as transfer pricing.  This is such a success story.  Can we not learn the lesson from the 12.5% tax rate and say that we will consider lowering it?  I do not know how much less tax would be raised although, when capital gains tax was lowered, this country boomed and revenue boomed as well.  Were we to lower corporate taxes even further, there is very little doubt that we would offend our European colleagues but, God knows, we do not owe them much in the present climate and they are not showing any signs of giving us anything else we want at the moment.  Therefore, were we to lower it to a psychologically powerful and pivotal place like 9.9%, does the Government not agree this would send a message around the world that Ireland was open for business, including multinational business, and that it was multinational friendly?  If we were to combine that with the audit concessions we are giving them in this Bill, I believe we could become a focus of even greater attention from multinationals, not just from the US but from elsewhere in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">I want to issue a word of warning which I have issued in this House before.  One of the core aspects of the success of the multinationals here has been the tax position and one of the great beneficiaries has been the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  While I do not know what are the Government's intentions, there is a real danger to the IFSC by the financial transaction tax which is proposed and is lurking around the high tables of Europe.  It seems to have got very little publicity here but if one reads what is happening in Germany, one will see that the fiscal stability treaty is about to go through the German Parliament at some time in the next six weeks.  A deal is being concocted in the German Parliament and the treaty will go through, but the price that is being paid for it going through is a concession to the opposition - the Greens and the SPD - and that concession is the financial transaction tax.  It is about to become part of German Government policy that a financial transaction tax should be introduced in Europe.  How far that is going to be extended and how far they will push it, I do not know, but it is lurking on the horizon and it is a very strong threat.  It is also likely to get the support of France and many other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">If it were to be introduced, nobody in this House needs the consequences explained to them.  It would provide a threat to the IFSC because it might well not be introduced in the UK as the UK would not be subject to the same compulsory imposition of this tax by the other nations.  If that were to happen, the danger is that many of those companies which are located in the IFSC would move over to the UK and others would not come here.  We would be sending out a signal that Ireland is not as attractive a place to do business as it was because there would be a financial transaction tax on transactions that take place in the IFSC.  This would be dangerous to companies coming to locate here and because a large number of them are, if not brass-plate organisations, somewhat inactive organisations in terms of cerebral activity, they can relocate very easily.  The revenue we would get from that would presumably not be adequate but there is also the danger that the many thousands of people who are located in the IFSC would suffer and there would be unemployment as a result.  Let us watch this carefully while we are trying to encourage multinationals.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">I will focus my final words on the auditors.  I sometimes wonder when we are discussing auditors, GAAPs, US-GAAPs, IFRSs and all of these complicated formulae which nobody really understands, why we put these people on such an extraordinary pedestal and why we believe very much of what they say.  So many of them, whether they are Irish auditors or US auditors - many of them are the same firms - dominate the companies which they audit in this country and the US, and produce accounts which are very little short of fictional.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">One of the problems in this country is that we insist on using the "big four" auditors-accountants for nearly all the business which is given by the Government.  That is very difficult to understand.  The "big four" auditors gave the all clear to the banks up to 2008 and later, which gave an extraordinarily unclear and inaccurate picture of what was actually happening inside the banks.  One of the problems with the auditors was that they missed everything.  They seemed to be unable to spot things happening that they ought to have spotted.  As Deputy O'Dea said, nobody wants to suggest they should necessarily be bloodhounds.  However, if they cannot insist that the big banks make proper provisions and produce accurate accounts or if they allow the banks produce accounts that are misleading, one would have to wonder why we put them on such a pedestal and why we believe they are producing a true and fair view of what is going on inside the company they are auditing.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">With regard to auditors' fees, I do not know what is happening in the US in comparison to here, but fees are significant here.  PricewaterhouseCoopers got over €100 million over ten years and KPMG got over €40 million for three years, just for auditing the Bank of Ireland.  The accounts they passed as true and fair are questionable and in such a case we must ask why we are paying auditors so much and why we regard them as some kind of icons with particular skills.  We must also ask whether they are so cosy with the banks and companies they audit that the value of what they do is only of value to themselves and the banks, but of no use to shareholders, the nation and employers.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelHealyRae" eId="spk_322">
          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae</from>
          <p eId="para_664">I thank Deputy Ross and the Technical Group for allowing me some of their speaking time and I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State.  I was glad to get the opportunity a couple of months ago to raise the issue of the Companies (Amendment) Bill with the Taoiseach because of specific issues I wanted to raise.  We have had an interesting debate on this Bill this evening, with bloodhounds and poodles being mentioned.  The debate has been wide-ranging and interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">There is a welcome growth in the diversity of cultures, lifestyles and backgrounds in our country.  It is only by being tolerant of something that is different that respect for the diverse cultures that make up present day communities can grow.  This diversity has been a great learning curve for me as a public representative and I have learned that with drive and determination all things are possible.  I have seen projects that were just an idea a few years ago come to fruition, despite the downturn in the economy.  This has been achieved through the consuming passion that drives communities upwards and onwards.  I have learned of the many obstacles that come in the way of communities when they attempt to improve their respective areas or when they try something that is totally new.  However, these people drive on and find some imaginative way of circumventing problems.  We in this House must put up our hands and admit we are guilty of creating a few problems for these community groups.  The Government must also raise its hands in this regard and admit that sometimes some of its decisions are not in the best interest of these groups.  There can be no doubt that the wheels of bureaucracy grind ever so slowly, which can be very frustrating for voluntary groups.  We must work together to come up with innovative and imaginative ways to deal with problems more speedily.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">On the positive side, local authorities must be complimented done by community and enterprise departments, chiefly through the community and voluntary forum.  The initiative on insurance has been a resounding success and has saved community groups up to 50% on their insurance costs.  The recent proposed changes in charity legislation and the fact that most, if not all, community groups are registered companies with limited liability mean that all groups are now subject to an annual audit to comply with both company and charity legislation.  This can prove a financial burden on small not-for-profit groups.  I intend to request the Minister to examine the feasibility of setting up a scheme, through the community and voluntary forum, whereby community groups will be able to access audit on a competitive pricing structure.  This would be of enormous benefit to the many groups registered with the community and voluntary forum.  The Minister may look at ways to allow exemptions for community groups registered with community and voluntary forum whose total turnover is less than a set figure or groups which have no financial transactions but are limited companies for insurance purposes only.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">I have a concern also with regard to company law.  There should be some system in place to protect small sub-contractors.  There have been situations where the State has issued contracts to contractors who have then hired sub-contractors but have not paid them, despite having been paid themselves.  Many small businesses have had to close as a result.  These contractors walked away with money paid by the State and the taxpayer for public contracts, such as the building of schools or hospitals.  I am aware personally of some such situations.  I am aware of a particular school that was built where the small sub-contractors working for the lead company did not get paid.  This has put those small businesses to the wall.  They were glad to get the work at the time but they now find themselves in the situation where they would have been better off if they had not got it.  There must be some imaginative way for company law to provide protection for all those who work for lead companies awarded contracts, particularly in the case of public contracts.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">Multinational companies have had an enormous impact in Ireland over the years.  The Liebherr crane company in Killarney is one such example.  Hans Liebherr came to Killarney in the late 1950s or early 1960s and has made an enormous contribution to County Kerry, up to the present day.  I was glad to see a two-page article in<i>The Examiner</i> last week which tracked the company’s huge success and the huge contribution it has made to Kerry over the years.  That has brought a spin-off throughout the country because the company sub-contracts a significant amount of its work.  It is amazing that despite the fact it has a big facility in Fossa, it must still outsource much of its work.  We must ensure that we create at all times the proper environment to attract people like Liebherr, people who will come in and make enormous changes for the good of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">The Minister has said this Bill is proposed in the interest of maintaining a dynamic and flexible operating environment for the commercial enterprises in question.  The only objection anybody could have in this regard would be one such as I raised with regard to community groups and that it may need tweaking here and there.  Broadly speaking, everyone would support this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">I enjoyed Deputy O'Dea's contribution, but I take issue with him with regard to praise for the IDA.  I will not praise people here who only visited my county twice in 12 months with people potentially interested in starting up new businesses.  I want to see the IDA being more proactive in County Kerry and would like to see it bring in more people interested in setting up businesses.  It is like fishing.  If the IDA only brings two in 12 months, it does not have much hope of landing one.  However, if it brings ten, 20 or 120, it will surely land a few.  Therefore, I will not praise the IDA for the work it is doing on our behalf but will encourage it to be a lot more proactive and workmanlike.  While I am pleased to see jobs coming to other parts of the country, I want to fight for my corner and want to see some new start-up businesses coming to it.  However, they will not come if the IDA does not bring people to the area.  I broadly welcome the Bill and thank the Minister and his officials and all who have worked hard to bring it forward.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_686">Well, it was not available.  We only got it at 6.45 p.m.  The report must have been sent all around the world; we were looking for it all afternoon but could not find it.  It became available on the Internet only at 6.45 p.m.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">I welcome the publication of the report.  Above all else, we need to have confidence, and the public needs to have confidence, in the planning system.  Anything that undermines this confidence does no service to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">During the term of the last Government, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government set up an internal review into planning in six local authority areas - to which I understand Donegal was later added - where complaints of irregularities were reported.  When the internal reviews were completed, it was decided to have an external examination of the case based on the internal report so that the conclusions from the internal report would be externally validated.  The previous Government had gone a long way down the road to appointing the external panel, with the tendering process complete and letters of appointment ready to issue to members of the panel.  I know the Minister of State has not been in the job long, so I will not hold her personally responsible for what happened, but it seems that when the Government came into power it sat on the issue.  It never appointed the external panel; in fact, it did not really do anything about the investigation at all.  Thankfully for all concerned, Fianna Fáil continued to pursue the issue and has forced the Government into action by raising it regularly, particularly in today's motion.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">A year and a quarter after coming into power, and two years since this process started, we have at last received the report, at 6.45 p.m. today.  It is now 7.30 p.m. and, as the Minister of State will appreciate, I have not had an opportunity to peruse the report, which I understand is quite a lengthy one.  I am glad the Minister took the decision to publish the report.  However, if it were not for the tenacity of Fianna Fáil on this matter, it would not have been published today.  In fact, it might never have been published.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">There is a saying that we should take into account more in this country, across Government areas and in administration in general: justice delayed is justice denied.  Two years was more than adequate to produce this report, and I believe justice was delayed in this case.  The Minister of State might nod her head to indicate whether I am right in understanding that no malfeasance was found by the Department and that the local authorities have been cleared of any serious wrongdoing.  Is that correct?</p>

            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_691">There was no malfeasance.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_692">I also understand a whole series of recommendations has been issued, some specific to certain local authorities and some general.  I commend this, and I look forward to having an opportunity to read the report.  As a Deputy and former county councillor from Galway, I have always felt the planning procedures followed by Galway County Council were good, but I will read with interest what the report has to say about Galway County Council.  If the complaints by An Taisce about Galway County Council related to the rate of turning over of planning permissions for one-off houses by An Bord Pleanála, I believe - I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would agree - that the judgment and the procedures followed by the county council are more consistent than those of An Bord Pleanála.  However, as I said, I will read the report with great interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_693">I would like to make a suggestion to the Minister of State.  If the Government was able to make recommendations to local authorities, the report must have been ready for some time.  This report should now be forwarded to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht for further consideration and so that it can make recommendations on foot of it.  For nearly two years, a cloud has hung over local authorities, as people did believe there could have been malfeasance.  It is important that Departments realise that when issues such as this arise, they should be investigated and a report issued as speedily as possible.  Prevarication is a bad thing, and it is never excusable.  I hope that when the Minister of State comes to speak on this motion, she will give a full explanation to the House of the reasons for the delay and dithering in dealing with this issue.  I hope she will cover the term of office of the Minister's predecessor, and that she will outline the role, if any, of the senior Minister in pushing - or not pushing - for this matter to be brought to a speedy conclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">Many people were wondering whether there was a reluctance to bring the matter to a conclusion.  Why was there such seeming hesitancy about this?  If it was because the Government just could not be bothered, that is a grave injustice to the people who are under examination.  It is also important to ask whether, with all the reform and new governance we talked about, it is possible for Departments to carry out examinations such as this in an expeditious manner.  Given the relationship between the Department and local authorities, an independent review would be better, particularly as there were previous internal reports, including one, I understand, in 2010.  I ask the Minister to consider external validation of the report, as that would add to public confidence on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_695">Under the previous Government, I served on the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, which did two exceptional things.  One was its production of the review of energy; on a subject that caused more slagging than enlightenment, we achieved clarity and managed to agree on a coherent position.  The other instance in which the committee performed well was in its consideration of the Carragher report into RTE.  It is not a committee's role to establish the facts.  Having received a report on the facts, however, committees can play an extraordinary role in examining a report, bringing in witnesses, which in this case would include An Taisce and the local authorities, and making recommendations to the relevant Minister on the actions that should ensue.  If the Oireachtas is serious about committees and the work they can do, it might consult the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resource and Agriculture, Deputy Doyle, who did exceptional work in getting the committee to examine issues in depth and come up with balanced and reasonable conclusions.  If such work is done in the public forum of a committee, we will increase the public's confidence in the ability of the Oireachtas to look coldly at the facts and reach consensus in a non-partisan manner.  Rather than take a confrontational approach we should hold robust debates with a view to agreeing a solution which appears to be the obvious conclusion after examination and debate.  By referring reports to a committee for open and fair examination, we would also help the public to understand the issues raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_696">This approach would benefit the two Government parties in particular because six of the seven councils in question are dominated by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  There are those who believe the Government's reluctance to deal with this issue is connected to that dominance.</p>

If, as I hope, the report proves that politicians were not central to the events described, it is time we knew that.  I have pride in our role as politicians.  We have been much maligned and, as the Government is now starting to learn, the suspicion of politicians is not directed solely at Deputies on this side of the House.  The criticism of politicians by other politicians, as if the vast majority of us do not do a genuine day's, and in many cases night's, work on behalf of the people, does our profession no service.  By publishing this report and allowing a robust debate that examines all the issues, we can clear the air and enhance the role of politicians in this country.</p>

            <p eId="para_699">I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this motion and I commend Deputy Niall Collins and others for bringing it before the House.  In June 2010 the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, John Gormley, announced an independent inquiry into planning irregularities in six local authorities.  In January 2011, six planning consultants were selected to carry out inquiries into the alleged planning irregularities.  The consultants were independent and were to carry out a full review.  In June 2011, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, stood down the consultants and downgraded the inquiry to an internal review.</p>

            <p eId="para_701">This was done even though internal reviews by departmental officials had been carried out in November 2009.  The abandonment of the external process despite the fact that a framework had already been put in place indicates that he had an ulterior motive for his actions.  I had hoped he would be in the Chamber to explain his decision but the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is more than capable of addressing the issue and I hope she will provide an explanation.  The most appropriate way to investigate these issues is by means of an independent review because there are close links between the Department and local authorities.  The appointment of senior positions in local authorities, such as county managers, have to be sanctioned by the Minister.  It is not good practice to allow people from within the system to carry out reviews but clearly the Minister believed otherwise.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">The Minister of State published the Department's internal report today.  She appears to have decided to make a pre-emptive strike given that the motion was coming before the House tonight.  Its publication was clearly rushed in an effort to spare the blushes of Government backbenchers when it came time to vote against an effort to restore public faith in the planning process.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Browne</from>
            <p eId="para_704">From what we have seen of the report thus far, it is clearly another whitewash.  It was initiated with the sole purpose of rolling back on the proper scrutiny offered by a series of time limited and fully costed independent investigations.  Internal reviews were carried out by the Department in 2009 and 2010 on foot of complaints about planning practices in local authorities.  While other local authorities may also merit investigation the then Minister, Deputy Gormley, sought internal reviews into six and subsequently ordered independent investigations on the basis of the findings of the reviews.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">I look forward to hearing the Minister of State outline what new information may have come from the reviews.  It is also important that we know who carried them out, who acted as liaison between the Department and local authorities and who supplied the information to the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">The departure from the previous reports which prompted Mr. Gormley to initiate independent reviews and the lack of hard findings indicate that the internal report cannot be taken seriously.  It sets out 12 recommendations which will be overseen by a consultant hired by the Minister of State.  Clearly she believes her Department is capable of carrying out a sensitive internal review of councils which are dominated by Government parties and have been unable to implement reform.  Why is she not in favour of independent experts?  She defends the recommendations as representing a comprehensive programme of reform but in reality they are shallow and cosmetic changes.    For example, the Department issued a circular letter to every local authority reminding it of the law.  The planners and the director of planning in my county are aware of the law and how they should operate within the law.  I wonder why the Minister is sending out circulars to remind them of the law.  If we had an independent inquiry, we might have a different response from the Minister and the Government but the Minister thought differently.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">Another shallow recommendation is that there should be a meeting once a year between the Minister and the County and City Managers Association.  From my time on local authorities and from hearing about it in recent years, I know every Minister meets city and county managers on a regular basis.  There is nothing new about it.  The county and city managers meeting with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government does not constitute comprehensive reform.  It is a good idea that Ministers and county and city managers meet on a regular basis because the majority of work in local authorities is handed down from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, as is the money.  One expects a two-way process between the Minister and his officials, and the local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">It was not the irregularities in planning but incompetence during the boom years.  During the Celtic tiger era, up to 6,000 planning applications were dealt with by Wexford County Council.  I doubt the council had the planning staff to deal with the applications in a comprehensive way.  The council had to make planning decisions within eight weeks unless it sought an extension of time.  It was under pressure to ensure planning decisions were made quickly and that the best decision was made.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">Local authorities refused planning permission on the grounds of local knowledge, the environment and on the grounds that the development was not suitable to the area before An Bord Pleanála overruled the decisions of local authorities.  It is regarded as an independent body but in overruling the refusals of local authorities and granting permission it left much to be desired.  An Taisce did not want one-off rural housing built and objected strenuously in Wexford and elsewhere to one-off houses on environmental grounds and on any grounds on which they could object.  They wanted to drive everyone into the urban centres and to downgrade rural communities.  It caused major problems with the lack of population in rural communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">The Minister of State should consider reverting to independent reviews to be carried out by consultants in an independent manner.  The report carried out by the Department is not independent or comprehensive and it does nothing to bring about expertise or methods so that people believe planning is being carried out in the correct way.  The report is a whitewash.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, is responsible and should leave this report to one side and carry out the local authority reports initiated by John Gormley.  The report is not in the best interests of planning for the future in the country.</p>

It is a matter of fundamental importance to the House.  We have seen the negative effects of planning decisions taken for the wrong reasons over the past decades.  We have seen the impact on the built environment and the way in which politics is viewed by many citizens.  It is of fundamental importance that the work of this House or a Government, of whatever hue or background, is done in a way to regain the trust and confidence of the Irish people in the planning process.  That might require the Minister of State going a step further than she would have wanted or a step further than necessary.  If that is what it takes to remove the perception of a culture of corruption or the potential for corruption, poor planning and lack of adherence to standards, it is a step worth taking.  The Minister of State is constrained by Government decisions and her position in the Department but she must fight her colleagues to ensure the perception is no longer the prevailing belief by the end of her time in office.</p>

I refer to the perception created by the bundling of the announcement with other announcements.  The other reports related to the amalgamation of Limerick County Council and Limerick City Council and Tipperary North County Council and Tipperary South County Council.  The effect of the decision to abandon independent inquiries was overshadowed by the shift in local government structures but the impact was no less profound.  It reminds me of one the spin doctors associated with the Clinton era.  In his memoirs, he said the policy of the Clinton White House was to put out bad news on Thursday.  They packaged all the rubbish together and hoped it would get lost.  For a process as fundamental and important to the State as the planning process, and one that is totally debased, it was a poor decision by the Government and the Minister to try to camouflage what appears to be putting to one side thorough investigations into irregularities identified over a period of time.  It was a cynical move by what - it could be argued - is a cynical Government to bury a story it did not want to emerge.</p>

This Government was going to do things differently, with a far greater level of transparency and it was going to clean up the act.  However, it is politics as usual from where I am sitting.  Instead of independent inquiries carried out by external experts with no vested interest in the structures involved, the Government decided on a structure of internal departmental inquiries.  These inquiries were undertaken on seven local authorities, six of which were under the control of Fine Gael and Labour.</p>

            <p eId="para_726">I suggest that the Minister of State's Government is not supporting her in her desire to do so.  How are members of the public to place their faith in an internal inquiry into local authorities controlled by the Government parties?  One cannot but think that the Government, which had declared that the matters involved were "spurious mostly", as the Minister, Deputy Hogan, said, had already come to a decision before the reviews were launched.  Furthermore, the Government has conducted another internal review on top of the previous internal reviews which had been ordered by the former Minister, John Gormley.  There are reviews on top of reviews.  Why not go with the process set out by the previous Government?  I do not think there is anyone in this House or outside who has anything but the height of respect for the integrity of John Gormley and his party with regard to this issue.  For that reason I would have thought that there was a file or a series of files in place to allow the Minister of State to take the high moral ground, if that is what she wished to do.  It would certainly have levelled the concerns and would have dealt with the perception to which I referred.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">It was on the back of these internal reviews of the problems in the planning system that the Minister felt it was necessary for an independent review staffed by external experts to identify the systematic problems and put forward recommendations.  What was different about this internal review from the ones that had been completed in 2010?  Why did the then Minister feel that their findings were serious enough to merit an external review while this review did not?</p>
            <p eId="para_728">Another lie peddled by the Government is that the previous Government had done nothing to progress the creation of an independent planning inquiry.  This view has been coming from backbenchers in an effort to support the position of the Minister, Deputy Hogan.  In my view, in today's report the Government misleadingly states that the panel was not formally established.  On "Prime Time" last March, the Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, stated that then Minister, John Gormley, had done nothing to progress the external reviews.  In reality, the Government had made significant progress in setting up the panel of independent external experts to probe the planning complaints.  By January 2011, a panel of experts had undertaken a thorough tendering process and the Department had written to six planning experts to notify them of their appointment.</p>

It was a lazy excuse by a Government looking to cover up its own efforts to avoid the issue and to kick it to touch.  This is disappointing.  The matters dealt with by the inquiries were spurious, as the Minister, Deputy Hogan, put it at the time.  Deputy Joanna Tuffy was the environment spokesperson for the Labour Party and she stated it was unclear what Mr. Gormley had hoped to achieve by carrying out the review of planning policy in the six councils.  Taking into consideration the matters involved it is clear what an independent review hoped to achieve.  The results of poor planning decisions are visible across the country in ghost estates and flood plains.  I say this in the acceptance that much of this is not associated with the Minister of State's party but rather is a combination of a whole series of mishaps across the political process.  It is a fact that Fianna Fáil has not controlled too many local authorities over the past 20 years and certainly over the past 15 years, when many of the decisions were taken.</p>

In many cases there were no corrupt payments, rather these were poor planning decisions and the decisions made by planners were overturned.  If the Minister is saying that Fine Gael councillors have a clean slate with regard to the particular issues I have raised, then we would need to spend a lot of time teasing out the issue, location by location.</p>

            <p eId="para_744">The core of the problem is that once the asset value of land is changed from agricultural to developmental use, then the decision, whether under section 4 or section 140 or a decision to be taken by the membership of the council when reviewing the county development plan, will inevitably result in trouble.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">I hope we can learn from the experience of the past 20 years so that in the future we will have a decision-making process to deal with these issues and which will strike a reasonable balance between the obligations of the public representative on one hand and what constitutes good planning on the other hand.  However, we must learn from the mistakes of the past.  If there were irregularities in six or seven local authorities in this instance - I am not immediately familiar with any of them - or varying degrees of irregularities, these need to be examined and there must be openness and transparency.  We must tell the world and its wife exactly what went on in these places.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">When the Minister comes to review this general area, he must be able to learn from the bad experiences of the past in order to ensure that we avoid those pitfalls in the future.</p>

First, I wish to respond to some of the issues that have already been raised.  I think the Fianna Fáil Party has been misinformed about what has been published today.  I am appointing an independent planning expert to review the 12 recommendations that were published today, as well as to examine six further themes.  That independent planning expert will be free to go back to any of the issues that are in this report.  There is, therefore, a misunderstanding in relation to that, because I am appointing an independent expert.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">Second, a number of Fianna Fáil speakers referred to the seven local authorities as being controlled by Fine Gael and Labour.  It is extraordinary to hear Fianna Fáil people coming out in relation to planning in view of the Mahon report and all that has happened.  I know my colleagues will address this in more detail.  To be clear, it was the former Minister, John Gormley, who selected those seven local authorities.  We are completing the review that was intended by Mr. Gormley.</p>

            <p eId="para_768">For the record, the subsequent decision was taken by the Minister of State for housing and planning, Deputy Penrose.  His decision was initially to have a review by departmental officials, which was carried out as quickly as possible.  I will go into the timescale of this in more detail later on, but I wanted to put that on the record first.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">This extensive report runs to over 900 pages.  In addition to the report, I am also publishing the complaints that formed the basis for Mr. Gormley initiating the concept that he would carry out a review, even though he never actually initiated one, as such.  I am also publishing the responses from the various local authorities.  It will all be in the public record so Deputies can examine it and I have no problem with the report going to the relevant committee, as Deputy Ó Cuív suggested.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">I got the report at the end of last week and we intended to publish it on Thursday.  However, in deference to this House, which was going to spend three hours debating the issue, we felt it was important to have the report out in time for this debate, rather than after it had concluded.  Therefore, while the intention was to publish it on Thursday, I published the report of the planning review this afternoon.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">The report is a robust and thorough analysis of various aspects of the planning system in Ireland.  Together with the appendices, it comes to nearly 1,000 pages.  Importantly, this rigorous review proposes action across a number of fronts and I am committed to implementing the proposed reforms.  First, having examined planning practice in seven local authorities, the report sets forth 12 actions at both departmental and local authority level.  I will immediately begin to implement those 12 actions which will enhance transparency, improve consistency and provide greater public confidence in our planning system nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">In addition to accepting these 12 areas for reform I also announced today my intention to appoint an independent planning expert.  The task for that planning expert will be twofold: first, to examine the entire review and specifically the 12 actions arising from its recommendations, and to suggest additional measures if deemed appropriate; and, second, to examine six substantial themes that emerged from the review, which would benefit from additional independent consideration, and to report back to me by December 2012 in relation to additional measures necessary to address issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">Taken together the actions flowing from this review represent significant body of reform.  It is by no means a panacea for restoring public trust in a planning system that has been devalued by the criminal and corrupt actions of a minority.  However, it will complement the whole-of-government response to the Mahon tribunal, which my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, will publish in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">The issues in the Mahon tribunal are extremely substantial.  The idea that the Deputies opposite would consider that a motion on planning was appropriate, given what is in the Mahon report, beggars belief.  The whole issue of trust in politics being raised is-----</p>

            <p eId="para_785">I stand over what I said.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">There has been a lot of speculation and misinformation around the planning review, the report of which I published this afternoon.  The motion put down by Fianna Fáil is timely therefore and I hope that our debate tonight and tomorrow night will allow some much needed clarity to be shone on the report itself, its background, the nature of the issues under review and the next steps in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">I would like to provide the House with some of the background to the review.  In June 2010, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, John Gormley, announced the initiation of a planning review.  The announcement published at that time stated that the purpose of the review was to assess the application of planning legislation, policy and guidance within the development plan and development management systems at local level, with the aim of identifying measures to ensure consistency of approach to these issues across all planning authorities, and to improve the delivery of planning services generally.  It is important to recognise what Mr. Gormley actually intended.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">The process was not intended at any stage as an investigation of any specific alleged irregularity or impropriety on the part of particular planning authorities.  Nevertheless, the scope of the review provided for the carrying out of such further actions as might be deemed necessary on foot of the review.  Mr. Gormley's announcement followed consideration of a number of sample complaints and concerns referred to the Minister by a mix of stakeholder groups and individuals.  These were broad-ranging relating to such issues as the preparation of development plan policies that accord with national and regional priorities, the application of such policies in the consideration of specific planning applications, and certain aspects of the decision-making process itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">The complaints were spread across seven planning authorities: Dublin and Cork city councils, and Carlow, Galway, Cork, Meath and Donegal county councils.  It was felt that these represented a broad geographical spread of both urban and rural areas, as well as both large and small authorities.  It is important to note that in a given year hundreds of representations are made to the Minister and the Department in respect of planning matters.  A large proportion of these are complaints from individuals or organisations regarding some aspect of forward planning, development management or enforcement.  For example, correspondence might be received from an unsuccessful applicant for planning permission, or appellant of grant of permission, alleging that the decision reached on particular case by a planning authority was unfair or irrational.  This is not so surprising in my view.  The planning system touches the lives of every citizen of this country on a daily basis and it is an emotive subject for many people.  In other cases, individuals may make allegations of unauthorised development, seeking the intervention of the Minister or the Department.  Section 30 of the Act specifically bars the Minister from involvement in any case with which a planning authority or the board is or may be involved, so in many instances a complainant will be referred either to the relevant planning authority or An Bord Pleanála.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">Given the separation of responsibilities between the Department and Minister on the one hand and planning authorities on the other, the focus of the review was on general procedures and practices within planning authorities rather than individual planning decisions by either the authorities themselves or An Bord Pleanála.  Mr. Gormley wrote to the seven councils involved, seeking a report on each of the issues raised and these reports were received in the Department in July 2010.  Subsequently, the Department prepared and issued an open request for tender in September 2010, seeking external planning experts with the necessary competencies and skills, to be included on a panel of experts to undertake these reviews.  It was intended that such proposed appointments could be made under section 255(3) of the Planning Act, which states: "The Minister may appoint a person or body, not being the planning authority concerned, to carry out a review in accordance with sub-section (2)."</p>
            <p eId="para_791">Some 40 eligible submissions were received by the closing date for receipt of tenders on 22 October 2010.  The tenders were evaluated and a panel of six individuals or firms was provisionally selected to carry out the reviews, pending the receipt of further information by the Department.  It was made clear in the tender documents that selection to the panel did not guarantee allocation of specific reviews.  Ultimately, however, the panel was not formally established.  The recent suggestion, therefore, that Mr. Gormley had launched any independent investigation is clearly not correct.  To be clear, his proposed investigation had not been commenced, no contract had been awarded, and no preferred tenderer had been selected.  Mr. Gormley's successor as Minister for the Environment, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, did not progress the matter during his period as Minister.  The question of reinstating the reviews does not arise, therefore, because they were never cancelled in the first place.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">In April 2011, the then Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning, Deputy Willie Penrose, outlined to the Dáil that the resources of his Department would be directed primarily towards supporting the implementation of the Government's commitments in these areas and that he was currently reviewing in detail a number of specific complaints, following the initiation of the process by former Minister, Mr. Gormley.  He also stated that when the review was completed he would issue a public statement outlining the complaints at issue, his response and any appropriate actions to be pursued in regard to further policy development and guidance in line with commitments in the programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">In July 2011, a preliminary commentary from the Department on the complaints was received by the then Minister of State, Deputy Penrose.  Noting the preliminary commentary, he asked in September 2011 that a further report be furnished to him dealing with the issues arising from the original files, the planning authorities' responses, an evaluation of the responses and recommendations for any further action.  On taking up office, I accepted the course recommended by former Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, and in April my officials carried out site visits to each of the seven planning authorities.  During these visits in-depth discussions were held with senior officials on the issues involved.  Each of the authorities was then asked to respond to a series of specific written queries from the Department.  The authorities were also invited to make recommendations for the enhancement of the planning system, including in regard to any actions taken by them on foot of lessons that may have been learned in the cases in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">The report I have published today has, therefore, been informed by the initial complaints received, the responses provided by the relevant planning authorities in 2010, the Department's preliminary analysis, structured site visits to each of the planning authorities and further formal responses from planning authorities.  With regard to the findings of the review, in the case of each of the seven planning authorities I consider that the allegations made range from serious to very serious.  They deserve and have received the fullest attention.  My Department's rigorous analysis has found that the allegations do not relate to systemic corruption in the planning system.  Similarly, the review did not find any<i>prima facie </i>evidence of malfeasance in any of the seven local authorities subject to inquiry.  This, after all that has come to light through the work of the Mahon tribunal, is very welcome.  Nonetheless, each case has raised serious matters.  These range from maladministration to inconsistency in application of planning policy or non-adherence to forward plans such as development plans.  </p>
            <p eId="para_795">A key issue arising in respect of several of the cases reviewed is the fact that the development management process involves, of necessity, an element of interpretation or discretion on the part of the final decision-maker.  Decisions on planning applications - and particularly so in the case of complex applications - involve the weighing up of various factors, which may sometimes be conflicting.  It may be simplistic to assume that there is always a right or wrong answer in the development management process.  It is, therefore, important that allegations which compare the decisions of a planning authority and of An Bord Pleanála are considered in their proper context.  For instance, it is important to examine not just a selected sample of cases but to consider the full volume of planning applications received by a particular planning authority in a given year, the number of decisions by a planning authority appealed to An Bord Pleanála and, within this, the rate of overturn of planning authority decisions by the board on appeal.  Furthermore, it must be acknowledged that because a planning authority and An Bord Pleanála arrive at different judgments on the same application, this is not necessarily a reflection on the abilities or competence of the staff of the planning authority nor does it necessarily signify a disregard for the council's planning policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">In the case of six of the seven authorities, the review has identified areas of policy and procedure where greater clarity, consistency and transparency will improve the planning system.  It also vindicates the decision of my predecessor, former Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, not to rush headlong into appointing seven external planning consultants to embark on costly, open-ended inquiries.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">As I mentioned earlier, the report contains 12 actions, all of which I am committed to implementing.  These actions will entail legislative change and consolidation, revised non-statutory guidelines and improved management systems in planning authorities.  It is a comprehensive programme of reform, which I intend to implement.  I believe that these measures, together with the further reforms the Government will bring forward as part of its response to the report of the Mahon tribunal, will significantly improve the planning system, bring about increased transparency and consistency and enhance public confidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">In the case of the seventh authority, Carlow County Council, the review accepts fully the findings of the Quinlivan report<i>. </i> In that case, the former Louth County Manager carried out an on-site, in-depth analysis of the corporate governance structures relating to the administration of planning in Carlow county.  He identified irregular practices and administrative deficiencies and provided the Carlow county manager with more than 120 recommendations to address these.  These recommendations are now all at various stages of implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">Members are all too aware that over recent decades the planning system has suffered serious reputational damage.  During my time as Minister of State, I want to do all that I can to restore the reputation of Ireland's planning system.  As part of this, I fully recognise and appreciate the need for the absolute maximum level of transparency.  I am conscious that whatever the outcomes of this review, there will be some who will view the process and the report with scepticism.  I want, therefore, to do all that I can to ensure that the process, the report and its findings stand up to independent scrutiny.  For this reason, while I have accepted fully the review completed by my Department, all actions and recommendations and the full review on which they are based are to be considered by an independent planning expert who will undertake a thematic evaluation of the review and its associated proposed actions.  The themes to be considered are communication of planning policy, availability of preplanning application records, the local area plan process, the means by which related socioeconomic considerations can be factored into the decision-making process, the role for structured dialogue between planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála and remaining gaps in the existing package of statutory planning guidelines.  In addition, this expert will be invited to suggest further actions and make any further recommendations deemed appropriate.  Crucially, this process will be time-bound and concise.  The last thing the planning system needs is for this process to become another running sore.  It will be a condition of contract that the evaluation is completed within three months of appointment.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">I want to be clear in what I am saying to the House.  This review did not find any<i>prima facie </i>evidence of malfeasance in any of the seven local authorities subject to inquiry.  Having said that, the conclusions and recommendations made should not be read as criticisms of the entire planning system nor should the report be read as giving a clean bill of health to planning in Ireland.  Undoing the damage done to the reputation of the planning system by past actions and incidents of corruption is a process to which I and the Government are collectively committed.  It will not be achieved overnight.  However, I believe that this review process, its openness, the transparency of the report, the extensive list of actions and the next stage of external, independent assessment, provide a starting point of sorts.</p>
            <p eId="para_801">We cannot, however, ignore just how damning was the report of the Mahon tribunal.  This review should be seen as a precursor to the publication of a comprehensive whole-of-Government response to the Mahon tribunal report within the coming weeks.  I am not going to prejudge the Government's overall approach, but I am confident that it will, in tandem with the actions arising from this review, significantly improve the planning system, bring about increased transparency and consistency and enhance public confidence.  We badly need this.</p>

            <p eId="para_804">The signatories listed below this motion are, for the most part, people who for many years supported a Taoiseach whose financial affairs were to any person with a modicum of reason or understanding, of a highly questionable nature.  Some of these Members, with mustache a quivering, were highly vocal supporters of former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, and acted as attack dogs on any investigation into planning matters in this country and on Mr. Ahern's probity.  That such persons have the brass neck to sign a motion like this is evidence of shamelessness that exists within certain political parties in this House.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">The Mahon tribunal report is littered with the names of Fianna Fáil members and makes hundreds of references to that party.  Fianna Fáil is constantly referenced in the report, which bears testimony to the corrosive and destructive nature of Irish politics as a consequence of the effect that Fianna Fail has had on Irish politics down through the years.  This rampant corruption of many of Fianna Fáil's members and public representatives is part of the philosophy of tolerance that existed within that party.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">The Mahon tribunal was disgracefully and scurrilously attacked by some of the persons whose names appear beneath this motion.  I have yet to hear any of those persons withdraw their comments or apologise to this House for those scurrilous attacks.</p>

            <p eId="para_808">One can only wonder if they still stand over the statements they made prior to publication of that report or during the investigation.  The inquiries to which this motion refers was a political act by former Minister, Mr. Gormley which was, I believe, designed to cause damage to Labour and Fine Gael in an effort to throw up political smoke in the defence of the Green Party's then coalition partner, Fianna Fáil.  Former Minister Gormley did little, if anything, to advance those inquiries and did not allocate one cent towards them.  Even after he was replaced by Deputy Eamon Ó Cuív, no effort was made to advance the process.  Yet Fianna Fáil now wishes to cry foul on this issue.  Deputy Willie Penrose dealt with this matter when he took office, having had to take account at the time of the dire fiscal restraints placed on the Government as a consequence of the ruination visited on the economy by the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government.  He initiated a full internal review of the complaints with a view to determining what further actions would be required.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has published the review and taken into account all actions required.  All of this was known before Fianna Fáil placed the motion before the House, yet it still engaged in what can be best described as a waste of the House's time for political point scoring.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">If Fianna Fáil members have information on planning corruption in local authorities I ask them please to report it to the Garda Síochána.  I am aware they failed to do so in the past when it concerned members of the party but such a course of action would be a first and important step in the recovery of the honour of the political party.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">Fianna Fáil has attempted to cast aspersions on the Labour Party in this respect but we have an honourable record in local authorities, and the only mentions of the Labour Party in the Mahon report concern a member whom the party removed and expelled immediately; the efforts of our deputy leader, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, to raise concerns about planning corruption; and acknowledgement that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, returned a cheque.</p>

It was quite correct to publish the review so it can inform this debate.  The review has taken too long and I agree with previous speakers who made this point.  I would have much preferred if the review had been conducted in a much more speedy fashion.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">I agree with Deputy Ó Cuív that confidence in the planning system has been undermined.  He is quite right; it was undermined by Fianna Fáil.  Tonight's motion tabled by Fianna Fáil is wrong on several points.  It is incredible that Fianna Fáil should try to mix up political control by the Labour Party with incorrect or bad planning decisions made by planning departments.  What brought on people's scorn of planning is what Fianna Fáil got involved in with regard to zonings which was absolutely despicable.  However, there is no mention of this in the motion.  I had some hope after the general election that we might see a Fianna Fáil nua but unfortunately I do not think we will.  What we are seeing tonight is nothing more than an attempt by Fianna Fáil to smear my party with its manure-----</p>

            <p eId="para_818">I welcome the fact the report proposes 12 concrete actions to address the problems documented in the planning process.  I also welcome the decision by the Minister of State to back up the review with an independent review by an independent planning expert.  It is important to note that according to the original terms announced by the then Minister, Mr. Gormley, in 2010 it was a review and not an inquiry but this seems to be mixed up this evening.  According to his press release, the purpose of the review was not to examine particular planning decisions but to assess the process and the system that enabled such decisions to be made.  This is exactly what has been done and the report contains a detailed examination of each council and proposes clear solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_819">Let us examine the proposals made by Fianna Fáil in the motion.  No independent inquiry had been started prior to the general election so it could not have been terminated by the Government.  No planning consultant had been appointed by the previous Government so how could the current Government stifle progression of this?  The tender process was not completed.</p>

In council chambers throughout the country the motto of officials and elected representatives was that developers were good, large development was good and community participation was bad.  During that time I was a councillor and huge pressure was put on all of us to rezone and pass material contraventions.  Some of these were good and some were terrible.  It is worth bearing in mind that most councillors I saw were very honest and had the interests of their community at heart.  However, there was undue influence from developers and that lobby.  Any councillor who raised concerns about over-development was considered to be backward looking, anti-progress and anti-jobs, whereas in reality he or she was in favour of sustainable development, and for good jobs and progress.  Following the general election, the parties coming into government promised a new type of politics and that things would be different from now on.  Unfortunately for the public little has changed.  Within weeks of taking office the Minister of State decided to terminate the independent inquiries into planning irregularities in the seven local authorities-----</p>

            <p eId="para_854">The local authorities concerned were Dublin City Council, Carlow County Council, Galway County Council, Cork City Council, Cork County Council, Meath County Council and Donegal County Council.  All these councils, bar Donegal, are controlled by the parties in government.  Many communities in these local authority areas and others have been victims of bad planning and they deserve to have the causes of bad planning dealt with in a public fashion.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">We need to restore confidence in politics and reform local government.  It must involve reform of the planning process and we need to move forward from where we are.  Local authority reform over the past 20 to 30 years has been used as an excuse to undermine local authorities.  Democracy has been eroded with increasing powers residing with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and unelected city and county managers and their officials, who remain unaccountable.  I look forward to changes in that area.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">Some of the worst decisions regarding the standards of developments were made once a certain amount of power was taken from local authorities.  We should consider the disaster of what happened with self-regulation over building standards, leading to disasters such as Priory Hall and hundreds of others throughout the country.  We have a legacy of 18,000 empty houses and more than 2,000 unfinished housing developments.  I welcome the progress made on finishing some of those estates.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is in the House.  I hope she continues the good work commenced by the former Minister of State, Deputy Penrose.</p>
            <p eId="para_857">When the report of the Mahon tribunal was published, Sinn Féin put on record our view that political corruption did not start or finish with Mahon.  The attempt by the Government to bury the inquiries into planning irregularities is further evidence of this and is the wrong way to go.  We propose to reform the planning process.  This reform must be radical and solution-based.  Good planning makes all the difference for community and family life.  Responsible ethical and sustainable planning underpinned by equality considerations is the right of all.  Property developers must never again be allowed to build new housing developments without taking into account the need for the provision of basic facilities and amenities.  Developments must be economically, environmentally and socially sustainable.  To thrive and be sustainable all communities require physical and social infrastructure.  Sinn Féin has developed sustainable community criteria based on meeting the economic and social needs of communities.  All planning decisions must meet these criteria before earning the support of local authorities.  These include a sufficient supply of social and affordable housing, safe water supply, adequate sewerage, access to public transport, employment, health care, child-care centres and schools.  They also include reasonable access to local amenities, such as shopping, public areas, recreational facilities, social centres and cultural amenities.</p>
            <p eId="para_858">I raised the proposed reform of local government on the Order of Business today.  I suspect the Minister has gone a long way down the process of local government reform and local authority members are only now being consulted.  I say this in a constructive way.  Many have yet to be consulted.  I checked this afternoon and found some town clerks who did not yet know about this even though it is supposed to be returned by Friday.  I appeal to the Minister to give them an additional week.  Local authority members of all parties, Fine Gael, Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil and others take their job seriously and we should give them at least ten days to get those questionnaires back.  The views of those people who work on the ground are very important regardless of the parties they represent.  It is important that they have some input into the shape of local government in coming years.  If the Government wants to break the legacy of the past, it requires serious reform of local government with power devolved, decisions that are transparent and local authorities that are accountable.  I hope we can move forward with that.</p>

            <p eId="para_859">One thing is beyond debate and beyond doubt when we consider the Irish planning and development process.  We went through a decade of madness, badness or both in planning and development.  That madness or badness has brought the nation to its knees.  I welcome tonight's Private Members' motion.  It is extremely hypocritical that it was moved by Fianna Fáil given that the ink is not yet dry on the Mahon tribunal report, outlining the relationship between members of Fianna Fáil and property developers.  However, that should not detract from the central issue we are debating.  As a member of Leitrim County Council I was among the first people to stand up and ask a very simple question: "Who will live in all these houses and apartments that are being built around us?"  No new jobs or major industries were coming in, but houses were being built with nobody to live in them.  At the time I was vilified and ridiculed, and accused of being anti-development because I asked that very simple question.  If I speak to developers now, they acknowledge that if they knew then what they know now, they would have studied the question much more closely.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">Throughout Sligo and Leitrim the scars of these bad planning decisions remain.  It is not just about numbers because people are living in unfinished or half-occupied estates with their homes in negative equity and still heading south with mortgages for over-priced houses that they cannot afford to repay.  The Government's decision in June 2011 to terminate the independent inquiry into planning irregularities in seven local authorities shows that very little has changed.</p>

            <from>Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_885">It is rather opportune that we are having this discussion.  Last week I raised a topical issue, with Deputy Kevin Humphreys, regarding the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  The Minister was not present for that, and it would have been great if she had been.  What happened in that development offers strong lessons about what went wrong in this country.  One can see the disease in respect of land, whether it was buying it, speculating on it, planning it or building on it.  It amounted to a serious abuse of the planning regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">I referred in that debate to a parliamentary question which the late Tony Gregory put to the then Minister, former Deputy Dick Roche, on 4 November 2004, in which he asked about the conflict of interest which would inhibit the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, from making balanced planning decisions in the docklands.  The Minister's answer was that the board members had a wide range of experience and that it was difficult, in a relatively small city, to select people with the talent and time and who were willing to give service to the public through these boards.  We know the type of service those people gave.  The recent report was damning about it.  It outlined the various issues, including the shortcomings in financial management, planning functions and the management of board business, not to mention the Irish Glass Bottle site which was valued at €220 million but was sold for €431 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">What emerged clearly in the reply to Tony Gregory's question was that the board was effectively the planning authority.  There were people sitting on the board who were seeking planning permission but they were also the people who were making the decisions on the planning applications.  Some of those people were also members of the Anglo Irish Bank, which was funding the development.  We use the phrase "something rotten in the state of Denmark" but there was certainly something very rotten at that time.  There are other examples of it.  The then Minister said that there was a relatively small pool of people from which to select people, but what happened was appalling.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">I wish to emphasise the positive aspects of the docklands as well.  The current chairperson of the authority is doing great work.  However, it was battle after battle for the communities in the docklands areas for their survival.  The developers were arriving with brown envelopes and other incentives to get people to move out of communities in which their families had lived for generations.  There were many David and Goliath battles.  The development plans are drawn up and it is a question of economics and drawings on paper, with no account taken of the impact and effect on people's lives or of facilities, infrastructure, community life and green space.  The Minister is winding down the DDDA but there are still two vacancies on it for community representatives.  It is vital that they are appointed and that when the new authority goes to Dublin City Council, community is at the heart of any type of development there.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">Another planning issue about which I feel strongly, and I have spoken about it previously, is the way in which planning has allowed some of our vital heritage and historical sites to be taken over by developers.  The prime example is the Moore Street area, a place associated with one of the most historic moments in our city.  It has been given to a developer for a shopping mall.  That is just one example.  Other heritage sites are also at risk from extremely bad planning.  So much of this could have been avoided.  I gave the example from 2004.  In 1974 the Kenny report was produced.  If that had been implemented, much that was wrong with planning in this country might never have occurred.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">With regard to the motion, it is a case of what the previous Minister, former Deputy John Gormley, did or did not do and what exactly happened.  Recently, I read an article he wrote.  In it he spoke about what he had left in the area of planning before this Government took over.  He says he left an extensive dossier prepared by planning officials following the internal review, that he had reports from managers in which each of the local authorities responded to that request from him, that there were terms of reference for a panel of planning consultants to carry out an independent review in the six local authorities, there was a completed tender process to select the panel and that the letters of appointment issued.  All the preparatory work had been done and it was ready to go.  I note the Minister refers in the amendment to an internal review.  I have just returned from my constituency so I did not hear all the Minister of State's speech and what her plans are.  However, the central issue is the independent planning regulator and I support the call from An Taisce in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">I am from a docklands community.  My family are from there and I live there.  It is awful to see what went wrong.  However, this is an opportunity for the Government and, being an optimist, I hope that we get it right eventually.</p>

            <p eId="para_893">There are currently 93,800 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided €436 million for 2012.   The current maximum rent limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available.  Consultation with a number of staff administering the scheme was undertaken as part of the review process.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market.  The report is available on the Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">For all counties, all major urban population centres were tested as part of the review to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access temporary housing arrangements whilst seeking employment opportunities.  Analysis shows that for Kildare, rental accommodation is available for rent supplement tenancies within the prescribed limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">The number of rental properties available in North Kildare is somewhat lower than the numbers available in the rest of the county.  It must be stressed, however, that the purpose of the review is to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide rent supplement tenants with access to all housing in all areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_897">Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met; there will be no incidence of homelessness due to these changes.</p>

            <p eId="para_904">The Budget 2012 proposals relating to disability allowance have been referred to the independent Advisory Group on Integrating Tax and Social Welfare, which is chaired by Ms Ita Mangan.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">The Group is considering two measures: increasing the minimum age for new claimants from 16 to 18 years of age with a corresponding extension in the age of entitlement for domiciliary care allowance from 16 to 18 years of age, and introducing lower age-related payments for new disability allowance claimants aged from 18 to 24 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">The review of the disability allowance scheme, published in November 2010, recommended increasing the qualifying age to 18 years.  The review noted that the payment of disability allowance at age 16 carries with it the risk of creating a dependency on social welfare from a very young age.  Similarly, the purpose of the proposal to align disability allowance rates for new claimants aged 18-24 with jobseeker allowance rates was intended to discourage the development of welfare dependence at an early age and to avoid the creation of disincentives to young people to taking up opportunities for education, training and employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_907">I am conscious that these measures gave rise to serious concerns about the impact on families of people with disabilities, most notably in the case of families of children and young adults with profound disabilities and these very real concerns are being taken into account by the independent Advisory Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">It is envisaged that the review will be completed by September 2012 and, at that stage, together with my Government colleagues, I will reflect carefully on the findings of the Advisory Group.</p>

            <p eId="para_912">The Department is committed to ensuring that claims are processed as expeditiously as possible.  As can be seen from the data in the table below (showing processing times for 2011 and for April 2012) which I will make available to the House, schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">As part of the Department's programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">In addition, the staffing needs of the Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  The Department will continue to source available staff to fill critical vacancies by way of redeployment, or transfer from within the Department and other Government Departments, taking account of the employment control framework (ECF) target, as determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>

            <p eId="para_979">The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  The average time taken to award a carer's allowance is 28 weeks at present.   A major service delivery modernisation project is underway to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme.  This involves the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business process re-organisation.  It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer.  However, full deployment will be achieved by mid-June so it will be a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.</p>

Of the total number processed in 2011, 1,461 (45.7%) had a successful outcome for the appellant.  Of these decisions, 618 (42.3%) were  revised decisions made by statutorily appointed deciding officers of the Department who reviewed the claim, following the initial disallowance.  These revised decisions arose as a result, in many cases, of new facts or fresh evidence produced by the claimant after the original decision on his/her claim.  In such cases an appeals officer decision was not necessary.   In 2012 (to 31 May 2012) of the total number processed, 386 (55.8%) had a successful outcome for the appellant.  82 (21.2%) were revised decisions made by statutorily appointed deciding officers of the Department who reviewed the claim following the initial disallowance.</p>

At the end of January 2012 the number of Community Employment (CE) places flagged as being occupied by those engaged in drug rehabilitation places (DRP) was 824, of whom 157 (19.05%) were categorised as lone parents.  The number of CE places flagged as DRP as at 4th   June 2012 is 817, of whom 162 (19.82%) are categorised as lone parents.  This indicates a slightly increased uptake by lone parents of CE drug rehabilitation places in the period where the income disregard became effective.

            <p eId="para_1010">There are currently almost 17,900 households benefiting from mortgage interest supplement, for which over €50m has been allocated for 2012. The Department's review of the administrative, policy and legal aspects of the mortgage interest supplement scheme was published in July 2010 in conjunction with the interim report of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group.  The final report of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group was published in November 2010.  These reports set out a number of recommendations which centered on the delivery of customer service improvement by ensuring that State support for those unable to deal with mortgage arrears is better targeted, consistent and easily understood.  Allied with the focus on customer service improvements are recommendations that seek to ensure that lending institutions, borrowers and the Exchequer share responsibilities and commitments in a balanced way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">The report's recommendation to remove the 30 hour rule was made within the context of the mortgage interest supplement scheme becoming a time-bound payment.

            <p eId="para_1017">Support for farmers on low incomes is available through the farm assist scheme.  While this means-tested payment is broadly similar to the jobseeker's allowance scheme, it has a more generous means test, which takes account of the specific nature of farming and, unlike jobseeker's allowance, farmers claiming this payment do not need to be available for work outside of the farm in order to qualify.</p>

The average time taken to award a carer's allowance application is 28 weeks at present.  This is not a satisfactory position.

This involves the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business process re-organisation.  It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer.  Full system deployment will be achieved by mid-June so it will be a number of months before the backlog is reduced to an acceptable level.</p>

            <p eId="para_1028">As the Deputy is aware, domiciliary care allowance (DCA) can be paid in respect of children under 16 years of age who have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  Eligibility for the DCA is not based primarily on the medical or psychological condition, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating the degree of extra care and attention required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029">Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of the evidence submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030">A review policy in an integral part of all social welfare schemes and is necessary to ensure that payments continue to be made only to those customers who meet the qualifying conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">DCA cases are routinely reviewed to ensure that all the conditions for receipt of the payment continue to be met.  Cases are reviewed based on either a scheduled review on the recommendation of the medical assessor when the claim is initially processed or on information received about a change of circumstances which potentially affects the continued entitlement of a case already in payment.  Where a child's condition is not expected to improve, their claim is noted accordingly and the eligibility to DCA is not reviewed again.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">Scheduled reviews, on the recommendation of a medical assessor, are based on the prognosis of the child's disability and how their care needs may change over time. Customers who are reviewed are asked to provide relevant up-to-date medical evidence and details of the additional care needs of their child versus a child of the same age who doesn't have their disability.  This information is assessed by a medical adviser and a decision is made based on the medical opinion they provide.  Payment of DCA continues to be made until the review process has been completed.  Where payment is stopped as a result of a review, the customer can submit any new information or medical evidence they may wish to have considered and that information will be further examined by a medical assessor, and/or they may appeal the decision directly to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033">I have recently announced that a policy review of the operation of the scheme will be carried out over the coming months.  This will look, amongst other things, at the current application and assessment process with a view to identifying any potential improvements to the delivery of service to customers that can be implemented while retaining an efficient and effective operational model.</p>

            <p eId="para_1035">Social structures in Ireland are changing rapidly and the structures of our social support need to change to accommodate this.  The decision to increase State pension age was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives.  The standardisation of State Pension age to age 66  is one of the measures planned which aims to improve the sustainability of the Irish pension system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">The responsibility for setting retirement age in employment in the private sector is a matter for the individual and the employer under the contract of employment.  Overall State responsibility for employment matters is held by my colleague, Mr Richard Bruton, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">However, my Department is working with the relevant agencies of State who have a role to play in identifying and breaking down barriers to remaining on in work past the age of 65.</p>

This projected reduction in payments to certifiers is being facilitated by a reform that has been introduced in the fee administration system i.e. reduced frequency for issuing certificates for certain categories of customers.  The total payment of €12,560,890 issued in respect of the first half of 2012 indicates that payments are within this target profile.</p>

            <p eId="para_1079">I propose to take Questions Nos. 135, 143, 146 and 155 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">The domiciliary care allowance (DCA) scheme has been administered by the Department since April 2009.  As the Deputies are aware, it can be paid in respect of children under 16 years of age who have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time, so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.  Each application is assessed on an individual basis taking account of all the evidence submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">Recently I announced that a policy review of the operation of the scheme is to be carried out over the coming months. This will look, amongst other things, at the current application and assessment process and identify any potential improvements to the delivery of service to customers that can be implemented while retaining an efficient and effective operational model. The terms of reference for the review and the appointment of a chairperson are being finalised at present and I will be making announcements in this regard shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">In terms of consultation, the Deputies should note that officials from the Department have met parents and representatives of advocacy groups on a number of occasions in recent months. I would envisage that a consultation process will be a key part of the forthcoming review.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">The Australian assessment process referred to by the Deputy is known to officials in the Department. As part of the upcoming review, the format of the application and assessment process used in the DCA scheme will be examined to ensure it best meets the needs of customers and the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">I want to assure the Deputies that I am committed to ensuring that those children who meet the conditions for the DCA scheme will continue to receive the payment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1087">Child benefit is a universal payment that assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around €2 billion in respect of some 1.15 million children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1088">The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. The social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment. Both of these provide a level of assistance which is directly or indirectly linked with a household's income situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness and effectiveness of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and recently completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in setting out a pathway towards a more appropriate system of child income supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">As the Deputy will be aware, issues relating to changes in taxation policy are a matter for my colleague, Michael Noonan T.D., Minister for Finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_1093">As set out in the NEES project plan and the Pathways to Work policy documents published by the Department, the development and implementation of the Pathways to Work service model entails a multi-annual programme of work to the end of 2014.  This programme requires the amalgamation and integration of three separate organisations and the design and implementation of new work processes and supporting computer and administrative systems. To date all of the major milestones in the project plan — including the transfer of FÁS community and employment services and the Community Welfare Service — have been completed on schedule.    The possible involvement of third party contractors is currently being considered by the Department, however, no decision has yet been made on the matter.   As part of this process the Department has examined and reviewed experience in other countries and has consulted with a number of interested parties and experts including representatives from the UK's Department of Work and Pensions, representatives from international employment service providers, representatives of Irish service providers and a leading international academic who has a particular expertise in the contracting models used by  state agencies to engage third party providers of employment services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">It is to be noted that the use of external contractors to complement the Department's own resources is not unusual. For example, the Department already engages 24 Local Employment Service (LES) providers to provide services and funds these activities to the value of over €19m (2012).  There are currently c 300 full time equivalent staff engaged by LES providers in the provision of these employment services.  The Department also has similar external contract arrangements in place for the provision of client services in over 60 locations around the country.  These branch offices complement the Department's own network of public offices.</p>

            <p eId="para_1114">There are some 52,000 people in receipt of carer's allowance from my Department.  Of these, almost 22,000 are getting half rate carer's allowance in addition to another social welfare payment.  This means that a person with one child who is in receipt of  a one parent family payment of €217.80 per week will receive an additional payment of €102 per week while a person in receipt of State pension (contributory) would receive a total payment of €349.80 per week.  In addition, they may also qualify for the household benefits package and free travel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115">In Budget 2012, the basic rate of carer's allowance and the respite care grant were not reduced.  The means test for carer's allowance is one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system.

            <p eId="para_1118">Responsibility for Community Employment Schemes transferred to the Department with effect from 1 January 2012. Since the transfer of Community Employment to the Department, DSP staff, including former FÁS staff, have been involved in a series of discussions with CE sponsors. These discussions have shown that while notionally focussed on activation, in reality Community Employment programmes deliver a range of services from childcare, healthcare, drugs support to environmental works.</p>
            <p eId="para_1119">The financial review of Community Employment (CE) Schemes is near to completion. This review has proved to be a valuable exercise for both the schemes themselves and for the Department.  Given the volume and breath of the data being returned, and the requirement for staff to engage with each scheme has taken longer than originally envisaged to complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">The outcomes of this review will be communicated directly to CE sponsoring organisations by staff in the Department as soon as these are finalised and the overall position agreed by Government.  This should be possible to do this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">While no final allocations of materials and training grants have been made pending completion of the financial review, the existing commitment in relation to the financial support of schemes will continue to apply. The Department is committed to supporting the CE participants and the sponsors in continuing the valuable contribution the programme makes to individuals and communities.</p>

As part of the Department's programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.  While representations are received on a regular basis in relation to individual customers and their claims and also from community based charity groups, given the volume of representations the Department receives, I am not aware of any recent specific representations from charity groups in relation to hardship caused due to delays in processing of applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">The staffing needs of my Department are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  The Department will continue to source available staff to fill critical vacancies by way of redeployment or transfer from within the Department and other Government Departments, taking account of the employment control framework (ECF) target, as determined by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">Since May 2008, some 990 staff have been assigned across the Department to fill critical vacancies and additional posts allocated to deal with the increased volume of claims.  Taking into account the numbers of staff who have left the Department and the vacancies that exist currently, a net total of 226 additional staff have been assigned to the Department.</p>

At the week ending the 1st  June 2012, 4,386 participants and 234 supervisors have been engaged in the provision of services to their communities.  Recruitment to supervisory positions is conducted by local development companies and governed by the same eligibility criteria as apply to random selection of participants.  This requires that a candidate must have been continuously unemployed for at least 12 months and be in receipt of a jobseekers' allowance payment at the time of application.</p>

            <p eId="para_1141">I propose to take Questions Nos. 150, 152 and 154 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142">There are currently approximately 93,800 persons in receipt of rent supplement, for which the Government has provided €436 million for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">New maximum rent limits were introduced from January 2012 following analysis of the most up-to-date market data available.  The emphasis of the review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">The revised limits are applicable to new rent supplement tenancies from January 2012 and existing tenancies on review. Approximately 21,300 claims have been awarded in 2012, indicating that it is possible to secure accommodation within the revised limits. There were 96,800 persons in receipt of rent supplement at the end of 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">Where rents are in excess of the limit, customers are being asked to contact their landlord and renegotiate the rent.  Where landlords do not agree to reduce the rent within the limits, staff will discuss the options open to the tenant, including seeking alternative accommodation. Information on the numbers securing alternative accommodation is not available. The Department does not intend negotiating directly with landlords to reduce rents on behalf of a tenant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1146">Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met; there will be no incidence of homelessness due to these changes.  Rent levels are being monitored and at this point I have no plans to revise any of the existing rent limits.</p>

            <p eId="para_1148">I assume that the Deputy is referring to the question of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay, whereby employers would directly meet the costs of sick absence for an initial period of illness.  This is being considered in the context of the need to reform the social welfare system to bring it into line with practices in other countries in this area; the need to address the deficit in the social insurance fund; the need to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability; and in the wider context of enhancing the health of the workforce and addressing levels of absenteeism.  I hosted a consultative seminar on the feasibility and implications of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay in February 2012.  This seminar was attended by a broad range of key stakeholders and afforded an opportunity to discuss the complex issues involved.  A report of that seminar will be published very shortly and will provide the basis for further consultations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">A range of complex issues need to be addressed before any decision could be taken by Government on the possible introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme.  The potential impacts of introducing such a scheme will be developed and refined as consultation with key stakeholders progresses.</p>

         his views on choosing the participants for the upcoming constitutional convention; if it is still proposed to randomly select 66 citizens to participate; the measures being taken to ensure a fair representation of LGBT citizens; if he plans to engage with key organisations such as Marriage Equality in relation to the deliberations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2214">The Government expect to introduce Resolutions in the Houses of the Oireachtas shortly to establish the Constitutional Convention. The Resolutions will propose that the Convention should consist of 100 members, including a chairperson.</p>
            <p eId="para_2215">A polling company will be engaged to select 66 people on the electoral register to be members of the Convention on the basis that the persons selected are representative of the population generally in terms of gender, age, social class and region. Legislation will be required to use the electoral register for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_2216">The selection process will be overseen by the independent chairperson of the Convention, who must be a person of exceptional ability with a high degree of public acceptability. The Government will seek consensus on the nomination of a chairperson in the context of the proposed Resolutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2217">The remaining 33 members of the Convention will be made up of Oireachtas members and one parliamentarian from each of the politicial parties in Northern Ireland which accept an invitation to be represented.</p>
            <p eId="para_2218">I am aware that a number of interest groups have signalled a desire to participate in the work of the Convention. The view has also been expressed that specific sections of society should be included in the membership of the Convention, including vulnerable, disadvantaged or marginalised groups; children; persons from Northern Ireland, especially Northern unionists; the Diaspora; and Ireland's newest citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_2219">The Government is firmly of the view that the Convention should be composed of ordinary citizens and elected representatives. It is not practical to accommodate as members, in a fair and representative manner, all of the groups or sections of society that have been proposed.  However, it is anticipated that interest groups will be able to interact with the Convention, including by making submissions. It is also expected that the chairperson and members of the Convention will be anxious to hear from a representative spectrum of opinion in carrying out their work.</p>

         asked the

         the progress and actions taken by him following the visit of an EU Commission delegation sent by President Barroso to discuss youth unemployment on 21 February 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_2221">Following the informal European Council meeting in January, President Barroso wrote to the eight Member States with youth unemployment levels significantly above the EU average, including Ireland.  In his letter President Barroso offered the assistance of the Commission to explore ways to combat youth unemployment and increase supports for small and medium sized enterprises.  A team of European Commission officials then visited Dublin in February to discuss the challenges of youth unemployment.  The Commission's main focus was on how best to maximise European structural funds in order to meet the challenges posed by youth unemployment.  The team met with officials from Government Departments and relevant stakeholders and discussed the various measures being carried out by Ireland to combat unemployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2222">The Government officials conveyed to the Commission team that Ireland was acutely aware of the urgency in tackling the issue of youth unemployment and outlined the measures currently being taken to get youth back to work, while recognising that youth unemployment also needs to be viewed against the backdrop of a very difficult labour market situation generally.  The Government outlined the wide range of measures contained in the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work, which were aimed at improving employment prospects, including for young people.  As part of the European Commission initiative, Member States were asked to consider whether Structural Funds could be re-allocated to help tackle youth unemployment.  However, Ireland, uniquely among the Member States in question, has fully absorbed its Structural Funds allocation, through careful prioritisation exercises, thus providing little scope for reallocation of funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_2223">Following the Commission visit and subsequent engagement, it was decided that the new Labour Market Education and Training Fund for 2012 would be co-financed at a rate of 50% by the ESF (up to €10 million).  This fund is an important Government labour market initiative and one of the Fund's four core themes is specifically dedicated to the under 25s.  Furthermore, in his oral update to the recent informal European Council President Barroso noted that the Department of Education and skills has further identified €25 million in ESF funding that will support continued investment in the Youthreach programme which provides education, training and work experience to young people who have left school early.</p>
            <p eId="para_2224">The Government remains committed to tackling youth unemployment as part of its overall and ongoing efforts to rebuild the economy and create jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2226">My Department's mission statement at this time is to help the Government and me to resolve the current economic crisis, to implement the Programme for Government and to build a fairer society and a better future for Ireland and her citizens.  By its nature, the work of my Department mainly entails close engagement with other Government Departments and State agencies, other representative groups, Northern Ireland political representatives, civil society groups across the island, international organisations, other Governments etc.  My Department has limited interaction with the general public other than in its reception area, my office, the offices of the Ministers of State assigned to my Department and the Government Press and Information Service.  Of the 179.61 whole time equivalent staff (wte) employed by my Department at the end of May 2012, 40 (wte) were employed in these areas.  In addition, 8 staff from my Department who are assigned to other duties during the week, work on the Saturday tours of Government buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2227">The 2012 estimated pay costs for staff working in these areas is €2,573,086, which is 23% of the total estimated 2012 pay costs for my Department.  In addition to the two Ministers of State at my Department and myself, approximately 42% of staff are in management grades (Assistant Principal and above) and 56% are in administrative grades.  The estimated pay for my Department on this basis is set out in the following table:</p>

         asked the

         the reason that female members of Ireland’s international election roster seem to be selected far more often for overseas missions than their male colleagues; if the review of the election roster will consider this gender imbalance and when he expects the review to be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2259">The Government believes that international election monitoring missions have an important role to play in the promotion of human rights and democracy, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of observers for election monitoring missions.  We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for elections and constitutional referendums.  Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.  The EU and OSCE are committed to achieving a gender balance in their election observation missions.  Member States are encouraged to nominate an equal number of male and female observers for each mission.  In 2011, Ireland seconded 60 observers to election observation missions.  Of these, 40 were male and 20 were female.  This breakdown reflects the gender composition of the current roster, with some 200 men and 100 women available to serve on election observation missions.  I have asked officials to review the working of the roster and to prepare proposals on future membership, which will include proposals on how to achieve a better gender balance when nominating observers to international election observation missions.</p>

            <p eId="para_2261">Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains a roster of observers for election monitoring missions.  We aim to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for elections and constitutional referendums.  Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but have also been involved in missions organised by the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Carter Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_2262">Observers who participate in missions supported by Irish Aid are entitled to one pre-departure grant of €600 in every twelve month period to cover any costs incurred in preparing for the trip, including vaccinations and doctor's certificates.  Additional costs for observers participating in EU-led missions are covered by the European Commission.  Costs incurred by observers on OSCE missions are covered by the participating countries, in Ireland's case from the Irish Aid budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_2263">The election observation programme is subject to continuous monitoring to ensure that it operates efficiently and effectively and provides the best possible value for money.  A list in tabular form of the cost associated with each Irish election observer deployed since the beginning of 2012 is set out below.  For obvious reasons, the costs associated with sending long-term observers (LTO) are higher than those for short-term observers (STO).</p>

            <p eId="para_2425">Matters relating to the processing of driving licences in Ireland and reciprocal exchange agreements are the responsibility of the Road Safety Authority which falls under the aegis of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Driving licences in Canada are issued on a provincial rather than federal basis.  Therefore, in response to requests from a number of people seeking to exchange their Irish driving licences for a Canadian licence, our Embassy in Ottawa has contacted all the main provincial authorities to establish details of their driving testing schemes and their willingness to enter into a reciprocal driving licence exchange scheme.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_2442">The Passports Act, 2008 provides, among other things, that only Irish citizens are entitled to be issued with Irish passports.  Each application received by the Passport Service must, therefore, demonstrate that person's entitlement to Irish citizenship before a passport can issue.  The Passport Service must operate within the law on this as in all matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_2443">The Department received an application from the person in question last month.  At this stage, it cannot be finalised until her entitlement to Irish citizenship, if it exists, is demonstrated.  The reasons for this are set out below.  The applicant was born in Portlaoise on 19 December, 2006.  Her entitlement to Irish citizenship must, therefore, be shown under the terms of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended (the Act).  This Act provides that a person, born in the State on or after 1 January 2005, where neither parent is an Irish or British citizen or otherwise entitled to reside in the State or Northern Ireland without restriction at the time of that person's birth, may claim citizenship by birth in the State (and thereby establish eligibility for an Irish passport) only where a parent has been lawfully resident in the State for three years of the four years preceding that his/her birth.</p>
            <p eId="para_2444">The applicant's father became a naturalised Irish citizen after his daughter's birth.  Her mother is a Nigerian citizen and no evidence has been presented with the child's application to show that she had acquired Irish citizenship at the time of her daughter's birth.  As neither parents were Irish citizens in 2006, their residence in the State during the four year period from 19 December, 2002 to 18 December, 2006, which immediately preceded their daughter's date of birth, has to be examined by the Department to determine her entitlement to Irish citizenship.</p>
            <p eId="para_2445">In line with guidelines provided by Department of Justice and Equality, which is the Department responsible for immigration and citizenship, the proofs of lawful residence, which are accepted and considered by this Department for passport applications, are immigration stamps in passports and/or the registration cards/books.  These are issued to persons registering their lawful presence in the State with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB).  In addition, the Department will accept letters from GNIB that state the various permission details which have been issued to a person.  All of these are official documents/permits, which can be objectively verified by the Department, if required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2446">The evidence provided in the submitted application related to the mother's residence in the State.  Her passport contains two stamps that were issued by GNIB prior to her daughter's birth.  These show a registered presence in the State from 30 September, 2004 to 18 December, 2006.  The amount of residence that accrues from this period is less than three years.  As the statutory requirement has not been met, the daughter's entitlement to Irish citizenship has not been demonstrated.  Accordingly, her application for a passport cannot be finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_2447">On 5 June last, the Department wrote to the parents to inform them that, on the basis of the information provided to date, their daughter's application cannot be approved at present and to explain the reasons for this decision.  In that letter, it was suggested to them that evidence in relation to the father's residence could be submitted to see if he has sufficient reckonable residence to demonstrate his daughter's entitlement to Irish citizenship.  Their reply to the Department's letter is awaited.  Subject to the receipt of their reply, their daughter's application will remain open.  The parents also have the option of pursuing the matter of their daughter's entitlement to become a naturalised Irish citizen with the Department of Justice and Equality.  In the event that she does acquire Irish citizenship by this or any other means, the Passport Service will be in a position to issue a passport on receipt of a new application.</p>

            <p eId="para_2449">In January 2011, with a view to preventing identity theft and the circulation of falsified passports, a range of additional safeguards were introduced into the passport application procedure for those seeking to replace a lost/stolen passport.  Applicants in this category are required to submit the following additional evidence in support of their passport application:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2450">A completed and suitably witnessed passport application form and four photographs, (two of which must have the application form number written on the reverse and be signed by an approved witness);</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2451">The long form birth certificate of the applicant and a civil marriage certificate, if appropriate, and evidence of entitlement to Irish citizenship, where applicable;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2452">Additional form of photo-identification; e.g. certified copy of a drivers licence, work ID; student card; social club membership; passport from other country, etc.;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2453">Documentary evidence to show use of name, e.g. payslips; records of unemployment or disability payment; bank statement; college registration, etc.; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2454">Evidence of residency at the application address, e.g. utility bills; official correspondence from public or private sector, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2455">Upon receipt of an application the Passport Service undertakes a series of checks to verify the veracity of the application made.  As the Deputy will appreciate it would be inappropriate to confirm the exact nature of these checks.  However, as these checks take some time to complete, the Passport Service has advised that the fastest turnaround time for applications in this category is three working days.  I should also explain that for those who have had multiple passport losses that the fastest turnaround time will be at a minimum ten working days.</p>
            <p eId="para_2456">I believe that these measures are reasonable, proportionate and have been designed to mitigate the risk of identity theft and to protect the international respect for and integrity of the Irish passport.</p>

         if his attention has been drawn to the concerns of human rights NGOs based in Palestine that the Israeli government and prison service are not honouring all of the terms of the recent agreement that culminated in the ending of a mass hunger strike by Palestinian political prisoners; if his attention has further been drawn to the possibility that the hunger strike may resume with all the potential political instability that it may cause and the efforts he his making to ensurer that all sides honour their commitments to this agreement.

            <p eId="para_2460">During the course of the recent hunger strikes by Palestinian prisoners, I called on the Israeli authorities to seek a solution which would avoid a tragic outcome, and I made clear here in the Dáil my view that the widespread use by Israel of administrative detention should cease, and that the punitive conditions imposed on Palestinian prisoners while Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was in captivity should be ended.  I was very pleased when agreement was reached last month following successful Egyptian mediation between the Israeli authorities and the various groups of prisoners, apparently addressing these and other issues.  I am therefore concerned at reports that some of the terms of those agreements may still not have been fully implemented.  However, no coherent picture has yet emerged as whether this is the case, although our Embassy has discussed the matter with the Israeli authorities, with EU colleagues, and with NGOs dealing with the prisoners.  Prisoners had been on hunger strike for a number of different reasons, and separate agreements were made with separate groups of prisoners on the issues of concern to them.  The terms of those agreements, including commitments made by both the Israeli side and the prisoners, have not been fully disclosed publicly, while the basis for reports that they are not being implemented in all cases remains unclear. It may be that some changes are taking time to enact.</p>
            <p eId="para_2461">I am encouraged by the fact that both the Israeli authorities and the prisoners clearly recognised the danger of the hunger strikes spiralling out of control and found agreement last month to avoid this.  I very much encourage them to follow through in that spirit and ensure these agreements are implemented.  I am also very concerned about two prisoners who did not end their hunger strikes, and are now believed to be in a critical condition. I strongly urge both sides to seek to resolve the issues involved in these cases with all possible urgency.</p>

However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy, I am providing below a table containing a full breakdown of the core staffing of the Department at home and abroad on 30th April 2012.  Just less than 590, or approximately 42% of posts are based abroad and a majority of those would be regarded as frontline staff.  At Headquarters, some 40% of the 810 posts are filled by staff involved in the provision of passport and consular services and would also fall into that category, as would smaller numbers of staff in some other areas of the Department.  Overall, about 36% of the Department's staff are graded at Higher Executive Officer or equivalent level, or above, and would be regarded as management staff.</p>

The Report's recommendations were agreed by all members of the Commission, including the representatives of the credit union movement.  I have welcomed the Report.  The Commission on Credit Unions has provided a landmark Report with far reaching recommendations to restructure the Irish credit union sector and strengthen its legislative and regulatory framework.  Its recommendations will influence the shape of the credit union sector for many years to come.</p>
            <p eId="para_2535">The Report sets out the key features of credit unions in Ireland, their history and development, examines the financial position of the sector and considers findings from a survey of credit unions, a public consultation process and a separate efficiency study of the sector.  It provides an overview of alternative financial co-operative models in various countries across Europe and North America and considers future models for credit unions in Ireland.  The Report incorporates the recommendations of the Commission's Interim Report, published in October 2011, with regard to deposit protection, resolution, stabilisation, and liquidity and initial recommendations on legislation, regulation and governance.  The key recommendations are in relation to sector restructuring, the details of the proposed new legislative and regulatory framework, and new governance requirements for credit unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2536">The Report also recommends that a consultation protocol should be put in place between the Central Bank and credit unions and that, when setting out new regulations, the Central Bank should undertake a Regulatory Impact Analysis in line with existing requirements and having regard to international best practice.</p>

            <p eId="para_2542">Ireland, as with other countries, has experienced an increase in the cost of petrol and auto-diesel. This is an international phenomenon driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty in Northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.    The excise rates (including the carbon charge) in Ireland on motor fuels are 58.8 cent per litre of petrol and 47.9 cent per litre of auto-diesel. However, our rates remain lower than many of our main trading partners and significantly lower than our nearest neighbour the UK. The rates for petrol and auto-diesel were increased with effect from 7 December 2011, arising from an increase in the carbon charge for those fuels from €15 to €20 per tonne of CO2 emitted. This represented an increase of less than 1.5 cent per litre in the case of petrol and just over 1.5 cent per litre in the case of diesel, when VAT is included. The rate of VAT that applies to those fuels increased from 21% to 23% with effect from 1 January 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2543">The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2544">It should also be noted that businesses are of course entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel. For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel and marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system. VAT on petrol cannot be deducted/reclaimed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2545">There are no plans for temporary taxation adjustments, as to do so, could lead to significant costs to the Exchequer. The issue of rising fuel prices was discussed by EU Finance Ministers at an ECOFIN meeting last year where they reconfirmed the approach taken in 2005 and again in 2008, when oil prices were very high, which endorsed a coordinated approach towards not making distortionary fiscal adjustments.</p>

            <p eId="para_2547">I am advised by NAMA that it is the Agency's practice to allow debtor companies to retain overhead costs from rental or other income that are produced by their assets where this is necessary for the operations of the debtor companies. The level of overhead is only agreed following a thorough and rigorous evaluation of the debtor's business plan by NAMA. Each cost element is reduced to the minimum and the level of overhead sanctioned by NAMA typically represents a very significant reduction on the level which prevailed prior to NAMA acquisition of the loans: typically, reductions of 50% to 75% in overhead costs have been imposed by NAMA.   I am advised by NAMA that overhead costs fall into two broad categories:</p>
            <p eId="para_2548">1. Costs associated with the repair and maintenance of properties, insurance premia, local authority rates and professional fees. These are essential costs which would be incurred regardless of whether the assets were being managed by debtors or receivers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2549">2. Overhead costs also include an allowance for the debtor's salary and the salaries of staff employed by the debtor to manage the assets. The alternative in these cases is to appoint receivers and I am informed by NAMA that receiver costs tend to be substantially higher than debtor and associated staff salary costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2550">NAMA has collated data on overhead costs for 2010 relating to 41 debtors who managed a total par debt of €18.6 billion or 25% of the total NAMA portfolio. Approved overheads for the 41 debtors was €55 million. This represents less than 0.3% of the par debt involved. Of the €55 million in overhead costs, I am informed by NAMA that the bulk of the costs related to essential costs associated with maintaining and preserving the assets and only €4.1m relates to remuneration. NAMA is currently collating data on all debtor overhead costs and intends to publish this analysis at a later stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_2627">The Deputy will be aware that the Bank's policy in relation to fees is a matter for the management and board of the institution. I have no role in the day-to-day commercial and operational decisions of the banks, which include these matters. These decisions are taken by the board and management of the institution. Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in the institution, I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.   However, AIB have informed me that with effect from 28th May 2012, AIB Personal current account customers who maintain a minimum daily credit statement balance of €2,500 in the account for each fee quarter can qualify for maintenance and transaction free banking.</p>
            <p eId="para_2628">AIB also continues to provide a significant proportion of personal customers with the opportunity to avoid maintenance and transaction fees, through the new qualifying criteria in addition to the free banking offerings for student and graduate account holders and AIB Advantage customers (over the age of 60). Following the change circa 40% of AIB's personal current account customers will qualify for banking free of maintenance and transaction charges under the revised criteria and the propositions for student accounts, graduate accounts and AIB Advantage customers (over 60s).</p>
            <p eId="para_2629">The estimated additional revenue is commercially sensitive.  Details of the proposed changes were notified in advance to the Central Bank of Ireland and to the Department of Finance.

            <p eId="para_2668">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated in terms of 2012 profits, of increasing the standard rate of corporation tax from 12.5% to 13% is tentatively estimated on a straight line arithmetic basis to be about €135 million. A corresponding reduction in the rate would result in a cost to the Exchequer of a similar amount.  This estimate does not take into account any possible behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of the proposed changes. In terms of an increase in the 12.5% rate, estimating the size of the behavioural effects is difficult but they are likely to be relatively significant. An OECD multi-country study found that a 1% increase in the corporate tax rate reduces inward investment by 3.7% on average. While a reduction in the rate might be expected to have a positive impact on inward investment, it would be difficult to justify such a move in the context of Ireland's consistently strong view that it will not change its corporation tax strategy. Even a marginal change would undermine both our long held stance on this issue and the certainty of business, domestic and international, in our resolve to maintain that position.</p>

            <p eId="para_2692">The NAMA Report for the fourth quarter of 2011 confirms that of the loans transferred to end December 2011, 20% of the nominal debt was classified as performing and 80% was reported as non-performing. This is a disimprovement on the third quarter when 21% of the nominal debt was classified as performing and 79% was reported as non-performing.  NAMA advises that performance can only be accurately measured based on the terms and conditions recorded on participating institutions' systems at the reporting date. The overall performance was reported as being 20% at end 2011. However, based on an analysis of the performance profile of these loans prior to the restructure event and comparing it to the performance profile at 31 December 2011, the Agency advises that the impact of debtor restructures on the performance of the portfolio to be a positive 1.6%. Accordingly, the proportion of performing loans held by NAMA by reference to loan nominal values excluding the effect of any loan restructuring is estimated to have been 18.4% at end-December 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_2693">It should be noted that as NAMA divests itself of assets it is more likely to be selling performing assets and therefore each disposal will mean that the percentage of performing assets in the remainder will fall, even where no material change has occurred in that status of the remaining assets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2694">NAMA is continuing to address the issue of non-performing loans in the course of the Debtor Business Plan process. The outcome of NAMA's deliberations on the viability of a Debtor's business plan will determine whether these delinquent loans will be enforced or re-financed on new terms set by NAMA. It should also be noted that where Debtor Business Plans are agreed, the loans may be restructured and the performance profile of the overall loan book will change as performance is assessed against the restructured loans. The restructuring of loans will not reduce the amount owed to NAMA.</p>

These interest rate swap contracts were formally designated into hedge relationships during 2010 when the fair value of these derivatives was an unrealised loss of €30.4m.

NAMA continues to be engaged in an exercise to put legal documentation in place to capture all rental income so that it will be applied to service the loans. This control was not in place when the loans were acquired from the participating institutions.</p>

Under a direction issued by NAMA to the institutions under Section 131 of the NAMA Act, staff of the NAMA Unit within the institutions may not be involved in the relationship management and administration of any loans or debtors with which they were involved prior to the establishment of NAMA.  This means that debtor business plans are not analysed by staff involved in the original lending decisions or original loan management.  I am advised that in the cases of the largest debtors which are directly managed by NAMA, third party professionals were used to analyse the debtor business plans. However, NAMA did not authorise the use of third party professionals for analysis of debtor business plans of those debtors who are managed directly by participating institutions.</p>

The Chairman of NAMA has had discussions with me and has reaffirmed that it is NAMA's expectation that, over its projected ten-year life, it will redeem, at minimum, the Senior Bonds issued as consideration for acquired loans in addition to recovery of its carrying costs and the working and development capital expenditure it has advanced to debtors.</p>

Arising from these reviews, questions were raised about the enforceability of security in certain cases and as a result, it was necessary to impose appropriate legal discounts. To account for these and to account also for financial obligations identified during the course of legal review, downward adjustments aggregating to €477m were made to the acquisition value paid by NAMA on these loans. As a direct consequence, the consideration paid to the participating institutions was duly discounted to take account of poor documentation.</p>

These costs include legal due diligence costs, loan valuation costs, property due diligence and audit costs. The loan valuation methodology approved by the EU Commission and used to value acquired loans makes an allowance for due diligence costs as a reduction from the acquisition value of the loans. Arising from this, NAMA was in a position to recover most of the costs of due diligence from the participating institutions.

In terms of determining the commerciality or otherwise of funding advanced by them, the institutions were asked to apply for non-discount treatment for advances which, in their view, were covered by the Central Bank letter. I understand that NAMA put a very thorough process in place, backed up by a requirement for documentary evidence, to review applications made by the five participating institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2726">I am advised by NAMA that arising from that review, approval was granted for €971m of expenditure, which is 41% of the amounts for which the institutions made application.

SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period. This lending capacity is incorporated into the banks' deleveraging plans which allow for repayment of Central Bank funding through asset run-off and disposals over the period to 2013.   The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending, including lending for working capital purposes, of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2738">In terms of the pillar banks' progress in achieving the 2012 targets, the information reported to my Department and the Credit Review Office (CRO) is commercially sensitive. As such there is limited specific detail that can be divulged on the tracking of the banks' performances. However, Head of the CRO John Trethowan notes in his eighth quarterly report that combined loan sanction levels in quarter one are broadly similar to the figures for quarter one last year. Lending transactions recorded by the two banks in quarter one are 15% lower than quarter one last year. He goes on to state that these numbers are a function of a number of variables:</p>

Financial assistance is to be provided by the EFSF / ESM and is to cover all possible capital requirements which will be estimated by the external audit that is currently taking place.

            <p eId="para_2765">As has been stated previously to the house in an answer to Question 42 on 23 May 2012, I have no role in the day-to-day commercial and operational decisions, which include these matters. Ultimately, the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial decision for the management team and board of Permanent tsb (PTSB), having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability. It should be noted however that PTSB recently announced a 0.5pc reduction in its standard variable rate for residential mortgage customer effective from 14 May 2011 and it now stands at 4.69% bringing the rate more in line with those charged by other institutions in the Irish mortgage market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2766">The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned.  This interest rate is determined, taking into account a broad range of factors, including European Central Bank base rates, deposit rates, market funding costs, the competitive environment and an institution's overall funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_2767">While I am very conscious of the difficulties facing mortgage holders I have no function in the matter. However the Central Bank has advised me that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Bank will continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds. The Bank has also advised me that it wrote to all lenders in October 2011 and asked them to consider the impact on arrears when considering any future interest rate increases.</p>

            <p eId="para_2769">Section 188 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for an exemption from income tax for a couple who are jointly assessed to tax and either of them is 65 years of age or over during the tax year where their combined incomes do not exceed €36,000.   However, where their combined incomes exceed €36,000, a measure of relief from full taxation (called ‘marginal relief') is still available.  Under marginal relief the couple's income tax liability is computed on the basis of the lesser of—</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2770">- 40% of the difference between €36,000 and the couple's combined income, and</p>

            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2782">Tax liability   €2,843</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2783">Marginal relief method:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2784">40% of (€41,421 — €36,000) = €2,168</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2785">Income tax due   €2,168</p>
            <p eId="para_2786">Income is also subject to the Universal Social Charge (USC).  USC is not payable where an individual's income does not exceed €10,036 (€4,004 for 2011) for a tax year.  However, where this amount is exceeded, USC is payable on the full amount.  The first €10,036 of income is charged at 2%, the next €5,980 at 4% and the remainder at 7%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2787">These standard rates are modified in certain circumstances.  Thus, where an individual holds a full medical card or is aged over 70 years at any stage in a tax year the rate of USC is capped at 4%.  In addition, social welfare payments, including social welfare pensions, are exempt from USC.</p>
            <p eId="para_2788">In the case of married couples or civil partners, the USC thresholds apply to each spouse or civil partner individually and cannot be combined where one spouse or civil partner is below the threshold and the other above.</p>
            <p eId="para_2789">Taking the example given earlier, the employment pension of €18,721 is liable to USC.  Assuming the person in receipt of that pension is over seventy years of age or holds a medical card, the USC liability arising on it is €548 (€10,036 @ 2% and €8,685 @ 4%).  Combining the income tax liability (€2,168) and the USC liability (€548) gives a total tax and USC liability of €2,716.</p>
            <p eId="para_2790">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in the absence of complete details of the nature of the income of the couple and their entitlement to various tax reliefs (e.g. medical expenses) it is not possible to fully reconcile their tax and USC liability with the details supplied.  However, it would seem, taking into account entitlement to marginal relief and their USC liability as demonstrated in the example above, that the couple's tax and USC liability as set out in the question would appear to be broadly correct.  If the individuals concerned contact their Revenue office with all relevant details their liability to income tax and USC can be examined and explained to them in detail.</p>

            <p eId="para_2825">The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), on behalf of the Minister for Finance, provides a wide range of State Savings products through An Post and the Prize Bond Company.  These State Savings products allow people to save in a simple and efficient manner by, for example, a lodgement of as little as one euro into deposit accounts in post offices or the purchase of children's savings stamps through their schools.  The suite of State Savings products also includes Instalment Savings, Savings Certificates, Savings Bonds, Prize Bonds, and the National Solidarity Bond.  Thus, people can avail of State Savings products with maturities ranging from on-demand deposit accounts to 10-year National Solidarity Bonds.  With the exception of the 30-day notice deposit accounts and prize bonds (where funds may not be withdrawn within the first three months of purchasing the bonds), people have the option of withdrawing their money from any product on giving seven days' notice.  State Savings is the brand name used by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) to describe the range of savings products offered by the NTMA to personal savers.  These products have been an important and dependable component of Government borrowing for many years and make a valuable contribution to the national finances.  Thus, all money placed in State Savings products contributes towards the funding of the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_2829">The Consumer Protection Code was introduced by the Central Bank under its own powers to issue codes, including under the Central Bank Act 1989.  Section 184 of the Credit Union Act 1997 disapplies the Central Bank Acts as far as credit unions are concerned, which means that the Central Bank code-making powers cannot be used for credit unions.  However, the Consumer Protection Code does not apply to credit union activities, other than when a credit union is acting as an insurance intermediary.</p>
            <p eId="para_2830">The recent report from the Commission on Credit Unions made recommendations for stabilising and restructuring the credit union sector and for strengthening its legislative and regulatory frameworks.  However, the Commission made it very clear that this must take into account the credit unions' not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect members' savings and financial stability overall.  The Commission on Credit Unions has specifically recommended that the powers available to the Central Bank under the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Bill 2011 should apply to credit unions.  Section 40 of that Bill includes extensive regulation-making powers aimed at the protection of consumers, including many areas currently dealt with under the Consumer Protection Code.</p>

            <p eId="para_2835">This Government has protected education as much as it can. Far greater reductions in expenditure and in the number of public servants are being made in other sectors relative to those in schools. But there are limits to the level of expenditure on education and the number of teaching posts we can afford.  The Budget 2012 measures in relation to the post-primary sector are set out in the documentation that was published by my Department last December. This envisages a net overall reduction of about 450 posts at post-primary level between the current school year and the 2012/13 school year.  This net reduction in posts takes account of the impact of the budget measures, demographics and the budget decision to shelter all the DEIS post-primary schools through a reduced staffing schedule of 18.25:1.</p>
            <p eId="para_2836">My Department has published Circular 0009/2012 to inform all post primary school management and staff of the staffing arrangements for post-primary schools for the 2012/13 school year, including in particular, the requirements to manage guidance from within the standard allocation.  The circular is available on the Department website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2837">I want to re-assure the Deputy that all schools must continue to provide guidance to their pupils. However, from September 2012 guidance provision must be managed by schools from within their standard staffing allocation.  Schools will have autonomy on how best to prioritise its available resources to meet its requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to its students. Decisions on how this is done will be taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
            <p eId="para_2943">I understand generally there is an exemption process for the "programme (Course) Recognition of Prior Learning RPL" which normally applies to programme entry level.  There is also a separate system for exemption from "parts or all of the award, RPL" for the award.  The first part of this process is conducted by FÁS which happens at the discretion of the manager of the programme.  Generally this would be at a module level, however the learner can only be certified for the awards actually taken on the programme.  Typically a learner would only apply for this exemption if he or she already had a component already certified.  To apply for exemption from part of the award the learner would however have to apply to FETAC as FÁS does not have the authority to operate RPL for the award.</p>

A dedicated Capital Asset Test implementation group has been established.  The group has been charged with bringing forward detailed implementation proposals on new means testing arrangements for student grants, to include the value of assets, for new applicants from the 2013/14 academic year.  No decision has been taken on the treatment of farm or other business assets.  In the circumstances, I am not in a position to say at this time what assets may be included.  However, any proposals will require further Government agreement and necessitate legislative amendment.</p>

            <p eId="para_2949">I wish to advise the Deputy that 10,575 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) Special Needs Assistant (SNA) posts have been made available for allocation to schools by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) throughout the current school year, subject to qualifying applications being received.  In September 2011 the NCSE allocated 10,100 posts to schools while retaining 475 posts to cover late and emergency applications.  This measure ensured that there would be sufficient posts to support all children who required such support in line with Departmental criteria.  Details of the 10,100 SNA allocations made by the NCSE have been published on their website at<i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2950">To date the NCSE has allocated 10,324 WTE SNA posts to schools.  Therefore, no child who met the criteria for access to SNA support has been denied this support.  Schools have been advised to make applications to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012.  Schools will subsequently be advised by the NCSE of their allocation for the 2012/13 school year, based on the number of valid applications received and in the case of SNA support, the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2951">Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that no reduction has been made to the overall number of SNA posts which will be available for allocation to schools for the 2012/13 school year.  This is representative of the Government's commitment to protecting services for children with special educational needs, at a time when there has been a requirement to make savings across a range of expenditure areas.</p>

The education began in 1919 with the founding of the first Waldorf School in Stuttgart, Germany.

My Department has given provisional recognition to two primary schools in Co Clare that follow the Steiner ethos of education.</p>
            <p eId="para_2971">My Department will continue to consider the recognition of new schools including those with a Steiner ethos in accordance with demographic growth in an area, parental demand, the potential for extending diversity of provision and available resources.  All schools regardless of their ethos are expected to comply with the Education Act 1998 and the rules and regulations of my Department, particularly in relation to patronage, board of management, implementation of the curriculum, admissions policy and procedures for the appointment of teaching staff. Permanent recognition is contingent on schools fully meeting these requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_2990">Teacher allocations are approved annually in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. My Department has published the staffing arrangements at post primary level for the coming school year, 2012/13. The relevant Post Primary circular is 0009/2012 which is available on my Department's website. At post primary level schools will have autonomy on how best to prioritise its available resources to meet its requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to its students. Decisions on how this is done will be taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2991">A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level schools in DEIS, including those schools referred to by the Deputy, have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1.

            <p eId="para_2995">My Department is aware of a number of pilot schemes in schools involving the use of individual student devices and the e-books.  This is a welcome innovation and demonstrates the commitment of schools to the full integration of ICT in teaching and learning.  The use of individual student devices and the availability of e-books is part of the emerging technologies which help to create the environment which enables all students to become confident and self-directed learners.  Student devices in tandem with e-books provide greater opportunities for more active and personalised learning.</p>
            <p eId="para_2996">In relation to the VAT rate charged on the purchase of e-books, I am advised that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. The general position is that school books are zero-rated. The zero rate applies to printed books. All digitised publications are treated as the supply of a service liable at the standard rate of VAT. The EU position is that digital information services are not the direct equivalent of traditional printed products, including books. Even where the content is similar, the additional functionality (e.g. search facilities, hyperlinks, archives, etc.) associated with electronic content produces a fundamentally different product.</p>

            <p eId="para_3076">The National Procurement Service, based in The Office of Public Works, is responsible for eProcurement and for the operation of the eTenders public procurement portal (<i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i>).  Each year an average of 5,000 tenders for the procurement of goods, services and works are advertised on eTenders. The overall procurement spend by the public sector in the Republic of Ireland amounts to an estimated value of between €14 and €15 billion per year. The figure of €21 billion quoted by the Deputy refers to the estimated combined all-island value of the public procurement market in the Republic and Northern Ireland. The figures for public contracts awarded to Irish companies in 2010, the latest year for which such figures are available, are included in the table below. The Deputy should be aware that these statistics relate only   to contracts placed that were above the EU Thresholds*, where a contract award notice was published and where the nationality of the winning tenderer was also disclosed. It should also be noted that the statistics do not distinguish between companies in the UK and those based in Northern Ireland, so of the contracts going “abroad” many of the contracts may have stayed on the island of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3077">* The EU Thresholds, above which tenders must be advertised on the eTenders website and the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), in 2010 were:</p>

            <p eId="para_3125">Of the €3.3 billion spent by the State on above threshold contracts only 8.7% went to non-domestic companies.  In terms of overall procurement budget (approximately €14 billion in 2010), the NPS estimates that less than 5% of the overall spend went to non-domestic suppliers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3126">The public procurement market in the EU is estimated to be valued at €2 trillion. In this regard, it is worth noting that the open market regime affords opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad as part of the EU Single Market. In a recent survey conducted by the National Procurement Service 20% of respondents said that they had won public procurement contracts in the United Kingdom and 15% said that they had won public procurement contracts in other member states.</p>

            <p eId="para_3133">The position regarding opportunities for employment in the Public Service generally is limited by the recruitment and promotion moratorium which was announced on the 27th March 2009.  The moratorium applies, with limited exceptions, to the civil service, local authorities, non-commercial state bodies, the Garda Síochána, the Permanent Defence Forces and to certain bodies established by enactment and wholly or partly funded out of the Central Fund.  The arrangements have been modulated in relation to the education and health sectors to reflect the particular needs in those sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_3134">In relation to the civil service, the area of the public service for which I have direct responsibility, a number of Departments and Offices are participants in the Willing Able and Mentoring Programme which is a graduate work experience programme aimed at persons with disabilities.  This programme is not subject to the moratorium.</p>
            <p eId="para_3135">The 3 per cent target for the employment of people with disabilities in the Public Service remains in place, notwithstanding the moratorium.  The National Disability Authority (NDA) reports on compliance with this target under Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005. In its latest published report in 2011, the NDA noted that 4.1 per cent of staff employed in the civil service had disabilities.  In relation to other areas of the Public Service, each Minister is responsible for compliance with and reporting on the target set in the Disability Act 2005 for the employment of persons with disabilities in public bodies under his or her aegis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3136">Finally, the Civil and Public Service is an equal opportunities employer and all recruitment campaigns are conducted in strict compliance with the Codes of Practice set out by the Commission for Public Service Appointments. Codes include the Code of Practice governing the External and Internal Appointments of Persons with Disabilities to Positions in the Irish Civil Service and Certain Public Bodies.</p>

            <p eId="para_3138">I announced the review of allowances and premia payments, to be carried out by my Department, in my address on the 2012 Expenditure Estimates on 5 December 2012. This announcement was made on foot of a Government decision which requires the public service to take additional measures to deliver further efficiencies in 2012 so as to ensure that pay bill targets are met and with a view to delivering additional pay savings in 2013 and subsequent years.  The measures include a reduction of 10% (approx €40 million) in overtime payments in 2012 which is being achieved by a reduction in allocations for overtime by the necessary amount for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_3139">To date, my Department has reviewed well over 800 business cases for allowances and premia payments.  Due to resource constraints coupled with the volume of submissions received, and the complexity and variety of allowances across the sectors, it was not possible to complete the review in a short time frame. Indeed, business cases continue to be put forward for review by Offices and Departments. I expect to be in a position to bring proposals to Government shortly in relation to the findings of the review. In the interim, urgent business case requests are being processed in so far as is possible in order to ensure that the work of the public service is not unduly disrupted by the review.</p>

            <p eId="para_3141">As part of the Croke Park Agreement management and staff representatives have agreed to work together to deliver increased productivity and maximise efficiencies in the delivery of public services.  It is estimated that the cost of sick leave across the public service is over €500m.  The State is no longer in a financial position to be able to sustain the cost of the existing sick leave arrangements in the public service.  It is the view of public service management that a reduction in the amount of paid sick leave across the public service will result in increased productivity, a reduction in the cost of sick leave and improved morale.  Therefore management has made proposals to reduce the arrangements for paid sick leave across the public service.</p>

            <p eId="para_3144">The Government decided in March this year to set up the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service (IGEES). The work of the Service will support Departments in evaluating policy and expenditure options; value for money exercises; cost-benefit and regulatory impact analyses; and regulatory and competition issues. Postgraduate staff with economic qualifications were targeted through an Administrative Officer (Economist) competition run by the Public Appointments Service earlier this year.  Staff recruited initially under this competition are due to take up placements in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance later this month, as well in a number of other Departments.  These recruits will supplement the existing economic and evaluation expertise already within the public service, including the Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit within the Department of PE&amp;R.  After a period of training and development, some of these recruits will be seconded to other Departments with identified economic analysis needs.</p>

At all times I have endeavoured to keep exceptions to a minimum and in all cases value for money considerations were uppermost in my mind when approving exceptions to the Guidelines.

            <p eId="para_3297">I propose to take Questions Nos. 290 and 291 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3298">The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for our EU/IMF Programme of financial assistance was signed in December 2010, and following each of the subsequent quarterly reviews by the Troika, an update of the MoU is agreed. Each update to the MoU can include the continuation of, or revisions to, existing commitments along with new commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3299">The Government is making good progress on achieving all of our objectives by delivering on all the conditions and targets in the EU/IMF Programme by the required deadlines.  We are bringing public expenditure back to a sustainable level and driving forward the public service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_3300">This Government's approach has been clearly set out in the<i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014</i> published on 5 December last, the <i>Capital Infrastructure Plan</i> published on 10 November 2011, the Implementation Body publication of the Public Service Agreement<i> Progress Report</i> on the 17 November 2011, and the <i>Public Service Reform Plan</i> also published on 17 November 2011.  Indeed, an updated <i>Progress Report </i>  is due to be published shortly and I anticipate further significant and tangible progress to be identified in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_3301">Implementation of the Government's<i>Public Service Reform Plan</i> , which was launched last November, is being led and coordinated by the Reform and Delivery Office which I established within my Department.  The Office is working closely with organisations across the Public Service and good progress continues to be made in the implementation of the Reform Plan.  For example, we are continuing to reduce Public Service numbers which were around 28,000 lower at end Q1 2012 than they were at end 2008 — the Government is on target to meet its ceiling for 2012 of  294,400; expanding the use of eGovernment through the recently published eGovernment Strategy, the establishment of a CIO Council and rolling out the Public Services Card; reforming how we are organised by having a strong focus on business process improvement, considering innovative new business models for the delivery of non-core services, increasing the use of aggregated procurement and developing new shared services (for example, I have recently announced plans for the establishment of a Human Resources Shared Service Centre for the Civil Service); reforming how people are managed through the introduction of new working arrangements, including new rosters, redeployment and workforce planning, a greater emphasis on performance management and development of the Senior Public Service; and reforming the management of expenditure through the introduction of Performance Budgeting, the Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks and the new Value for Money Code.</p>

            <p eId="para_3303">As advised in my reply to the Deputy's previous question in this matter on 11th October, 2011, the River Suck forms part of the River Suck Joint Drainage District. As such, responsibility for maintenance rests with Galway and Roscommon County Councils, which is undertaken through the River Suck Joint Drainage District Committee. The report for the year ended 31st December 2010, submitted by the River Suck Joint Drainage District Committee, shows that the Committee expended €203,000. Maintenance expenditure of  €200,000 approximately was undertaken and the Committee envisaged a similar level of maintenance spending in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_3304">Significant funding has been provided by the Office of Public Works under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works Scheme to allow Galway and Roscommon County Councils undertake specific flood alleviation projects at locations along the River Suck. To date, over €1.7m has been approved to Galway County Council for this purpose, and over €300,000 to Roscommon County Council. The majority of these projects have been completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_3307">Since coming into office, the current Government has been working on a range of measures to boost employment and help stimulate economic growth beginning with the Jobs Initiative which was launched in May 2011. Further work to stimulate economic growth and create employment is ongoing across Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3308">My Department undertook a review of the public capital programme last year, the results of which were published in the "Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2012-2016: Medium Term Exchequer Framework". The Framework sets out €17 billion worth of Exchequer investment intended to address critical infrastructure investment gaps in order to aid economic recovery, social cohesion and environmental sustainability. The sectors prioritised for investment in the Framework include education, health, jobs and enterprise. While this represents a significant level of spend that will generate activity throughout the country, I am conscious that there is more that we could do if we had additional funding available.</p>
            <p eId="para_3309">The Government is now considering carefully what potential further projects could be supported should a source of additional funding become available. It is likely that such investment would be focused on areas that meet the Government's key investment priorities, boost employment and help stimulate economic growth. My Department has established a high level interdepartmental steering committee which is considering potential projects for investment that meet these criteria. Proposals from Departments are under consideration and I am confident that a pipeline of necessary and worthwhile projects will emerge over the course of the coming weeks. My Department is working closely with the Department of Finance and the NDFA to ensure that additional funding sources are available in order to deliver any proposed pipeline of projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_3310">In relation to public transport, the five year capital Framework prioritised funding to ensure maintenance of existing investment and to advance a small number of important projects which can add value to the existing network such as the Luas BXD. Larger public transport projects such as Metro North and Dart Underground were deferred for consideration in advance of the next capital programme which will be drawn up in 2015 and will cover the period from 2016 onwards. Given the multi-billion scale of private finance required to advance these major infrastructural projects it is unlikely that private investors would be willing to commit the level of funding necessary to progress them for some time. Both projects also require substantial Exchequer funding that would have to be diverted from other more critical areas and this would not be justifiable at this time. Any additional funding which may become available will be focused on those smaller scale projects which are deliverable in our current circumstances and which provide value for money for the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_3312">I am very aware that public procurement can be an important source of business for local enterprises.  Current guidelines (Circular 10/10) issued by my Department require public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts. These guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote SME involvement in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime. The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3313">supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of €25,000 or more to be advertised on the<i>www.etenders.gov.ie</i>  website;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3314">less use of "restrictive" tendering procedures and greater use of "open" tendering;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3315">ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3316">sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_3317">Circular 10/10 has been in place for almost two years. It is clear that there is a need to ensure greater consistency in relation to the implementation of this circular. In this regard, the National Procurement Service (NPS) recently established a Working Group on Small and Medium Enterprises to respond to public procurement issues arising for SMEs. The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association. The Working Group will develop measures to highlight the scope that contracting authorities have under circular 10/10 to encourage SME participation in public procurement processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3318">Finally, it is worth noting that in terms of overall procurement budget (approximately €14 billion in 2010), the NPS estimate that 5% of the overall spend went to non-domestic suppliers.</p>

            <p eId="para_3320">As I have pointed out in response to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 445 of 18 April 2012 and 55 of 2 May 2012, the role of the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 1990, is to facilitate the settlement of industrial disputes and its authority in this regard stems from the voluntary nature of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3321">Since the primary purpose of the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts is to assist parties to settle their disputes and thereby promote harmonious industrial relations, co-operation between the parties remains the inspiration of all proceedings under these Acts. The Act does not empower the Labour Court or any other body to impose a settlement in disputes referred to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_3322">As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I have been engaged in a detailed review and reform of the State's complex workplace relations systems and processes. I am satisfied, moreover, that the system of industrial relations in Ireland should remain essentially voluntarist in nature with the terms and conditions of employment of workers being determined in the main by a process of voluntary negotiation and agreement without the direct intervention of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3323">The Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process. I have consistently emphasised, as the Minister with responsibility in this area, that the parties should come to the process in good faith and should demonstrate their willingness to give serious consideration to the Court's recommendation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3333">I propose to take Questions Nos. 297 and 298 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3334">The Health and Safety Authority, an agency under the ageis of my Department, are named as a Competent Authority in relation to ADR (European Agreement Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road) under the European Communities (Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment) Regulations 2011, (S.I. No. 349 of 2011).</p>
            <p eId="para_3335">There are no new enforcement arrangements being proposed by the Irish Authorities in respect of the transport of dangerous goods between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3336">However, as a result of a decision taken by the UK Authorities in 2011 in their enforcement policy regarding the transport of dangerous goods, the transport requirements in Northern Ireland have now been changed. The UK decided that the carriage of dangerous goods between Ireland and Northern Ireland is an international journey and is subject to the full provisions of ADR. In effect, this means that operators engaged in cross border operations while using vehicles or tanks that are certified for national use only are in breach of ADR and failure to comply with ADR provisions may result in enforcement action including prosecution while operating in either jurisdiction. Heretofore, such vehicles had previously benefited from a local agreement between the respective Authorities in Ireland and Northern Ireland that allowed vehicles and tanks that met national standards to operate freely between the two jurisdictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3337">The Health and Safety Authority have been actively providing information and advice to help operators in Ireland who may be affected by the change since it was announced. In addition, an agreement was made with the Northern Irish Authorities that there would be a transition period until December 2012 when enforcement action would not be taken. This was done to allow those operators who were not compliant with ADR to make the necessary changes. It should be noted that many of the Irish operators involved are already compliant with ADR and therefore would not incur any additional costs. There may be costs incurred by operators who may need to bring vehicles and tanks up to the required ADR standards. With respect to ADR driver training certification, all drivers involved in the carriage of dangerous goods by road, are required to undergo training and examination under the National Regulations and under the ADR agreement. The training certification obtained is mandatory for all affected national and international transport of dangerous goods operations. There is no separate driver training certification required for national transport operations. This activity is standardised by the ADR Agreement and various EU Directives which bring the Agreement into EU Law. The certification obtained following training and examination is therefore recognised by all jurisdictions signed up to ADR (over 40 countries, mainly the EU and adjacent countries), thus providing an equal and high level of safety for the transport of dangerous goods and a single market for ADR operators.</p>

            <p eId="para_3339">The Youth Employment Levy was introduced in 1981 and was subsequently amended in 1989 and re-named the Employment and Training Levy. The Employment and Training Levy was set at 1% of an individual's total income with some exceptions. The levy was abolished with effect from 6 April, 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_3340">Only relatively small residual amounts of money under the Levy continue to be collected by the Revenue Commissioners. These relate to historical payments of taxes that would have had a component element attributable to the Levy, had the taxes been paid at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_3341">These residual amounts are paid over to my Department by Revenue on a monthly basis and in turn passed on to Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (previously, Department of Finance).</p>

            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)</from>
            <p eId="para_3355">Banking policy is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan TD.  Minister Noonan commissioned Mazars to conduct a new survey in April 2012 on the demand for credit by SMEs and I look forward to the publication of this independent report shortly.  This report will further enhance the ability of the Government to understand the business environment in which SMEs operate and their relationships with the banks. The results of this survey will be a valuable resource in informing policy decisions in this area and will be of benefit to all stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_3356">The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending, including lending for working capital purposes, of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 targets. The progress on their lending plans is closely monitored each month.</p>
            <p eId="para_3357">Notwithstanding this close monitoring, access to finance in the current risk averse lending environment remains restricted for certain cohorts of SMEs. As Mr. John Trethowan stated on Tuesday last in his 8th report, that although pillar banks are being supportive of medium and low risk new lending to well established SMEs and farms, there is little evidence of support for "enterprise risk taking" on new and increased lending in the banks' lending policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3358">The Deputy will be aware that I am introducing two targeted initiatives to support an additional flow of credit into the economy. I am currently finalising primary legislation to establish a MicroEnterprise Loan Fund and a Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme, thereby supporting specific categories of SMEs with commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_3359">Further work with the banks is continuing to adapt to the needs of the non-traditional sectors, such as the technology and emerging sectors.  Enterprise Ireland is working with the banks to develop propositions for exporters and technology companies that are suited to different stages of growth and to adopt cashflow lending as opposed to the asset backed approach that has been the norm in recent years.  Knowledge sharing is on-going, including reciprocal secondments, sector briefings, and trade mission involvement.  Furthermore, the Development Capital Fund Scheme announced as a central recommendation in the Action Plan for Jobs will assist in increasing the availability of risk capital and closing the "equity gap" experienced by SMEs seeking risk capital in excess of €2m.</p>

            <p eId="para_3361">The Deputy's question appears to arise from the concerns of workers affected by the non-implementation on the part of an employer of a recommendation made by the Labour Court in a dispute in relation to a claim for enhanced redundancy terms in excess of the employees' statutory redundancy entitlement, following the acquisition of the company and the closure of its Dublin offices in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_3362">As I have pointed out in response to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 445 of 18 April 2012 and 55 of 2 May 2012, the role of the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 1990, is to facilitate the settlement of industrial disputes and its authority in this regard stems from the voluntary nature of the process.  In this particular dispute between the company and the workers concerned, the workers referred the issue to the Labour Court under Section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969 and they agreed to be bound by the Court's recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3363">Since the primary purpose of the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts is to assist parties to settle their disputes and thereby promote harmonious industrial relations, co-operation between the parties remains the inspiration of all proceedings under these Acts. The Act does not empower the Labour Court or any other body to impose a settlement in disputes referred to it under Section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969.</p>
            <p eId="para_3364">As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I have been engaged in a detailed review and reform of the State's complex workplace relations systems and processes. I am satisfied, moreover, that the system of industrial relations in Ireland should remain essentially voluntarist in nature with the terms and conditions of employment of workers being determined in the main by a process of voluntary negotiation and agreement without the direct intervention of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3365">The Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process. I have consistently emphasised, as the Minister with responsibility in this area, that the parties should come to the process in good faith and should demonstrate their willingness to give serious consideration to the Court's recommendation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3367">The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 contains a range of supports for small and medium-sized businesses, including a €150m Development Capital Scheme aimed at addressing a funding gap for mid-sized, high-growth indigenous companies with significant prospects for jobs and export growth, a Loan Guarantee Scheme and a €100m Micro-Finance Loan Scheme.

            <p eId="para_3368">The agencies under my Department are also rolling out their plans of support for businesses in Co. Meath.  Enterprise Ireland is actively promoting entrepreneurship in Meath and provides a range of enterprise programmes and other initiatives to approximately 172 companies in the county to ensure that emerging technologies and business ideas with export potential are supported to become a commercial reality.  The agency approved almost €3m to companies in Co. Meath in 2011, and so far this year, almost €1.2m has been approved for payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3369">In February this year, Enterprise Ireland launched a new Community Enterprise Centre (CEC) Programme for the maintenance or establishment of a strong business development function in Community Enterprise Centres funded by the agency.  Since the foundation of the first CEC Programme in 1989, Enterprise Ireland has paid out more than €600,000 in funding to three Community Enterprise Centres in Co.

            <p eId="para_3370">Meath County Enterprise Board (CEB) provides a wide range of supports to help new and existing small businesses to grow and develop.  It is anticipated that the Board will continue to provide an extensive array of business support services which include:</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3372">Providing management development training to some 400 owner/managers;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3373">Providing mentoring support by appointing Mentors to over 26 companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3374">In 2011, Meath CEB paid out €459,658 in grants to 26 projects.  This resulted in a net job creation figure of over 200.  In addition, there were 405 participants in the CEB's training programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3375">So far this year, Meath CEB, has approved 13 grants to the value of €67,690.  Four ‘Start Your own Business' courses have been delivered to 62 participants, with further courses scheduled over the course of the year.  Also, eight one day seminars and workshops on business related topics were delivered to 83 participants in the first quarter of 2012 and similar seminars will be hosted throughout the remainder of the year.  In addition, ‘Women in Business' Seminars have also been popular this year with over 90 women partaking in the first 3 ‘Women in Business' workshops.</p>

         if she will correct the faults that are appearing in the jobbridge scheme which was originally set up to help persons without experience to gain experience to enable them to get a job, however it now appears that the jobs being advertised on the jobbridge website are looking for persons with two to four years experience; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3395">The National Internship Scheme was launched on 1st July 2011.  It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals at all skills levels.  The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.  The Scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_3396">The Scheme has made significant progress to-date.  As at 31st May 2012, 7,495 internship placements have commenced since the launch of the Scheme in July 2011.  There are currently 4,872 interns undertaking internship placements.  In addition, there are in excess of 1,800 internship posts currently advertised on the JobBridge website<i>www.jobbridge.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3397">Host Organisations are not permitted to advertise an internship that specifies a requirement for interns to have prior experience in order to avail of the internship on offer.  The JobBridge team check all internship advertisements to ensure that the request for prior experience does not appear on Internship advertisements.  If an internship was to be advertised in error requesting jobseekers to have prior experience in order to apply the JobBridge team would amend immediately once the error is highlighted.  I would ask the Deputy to please highlight any specific examples that he may have to the JobBridge unit and these matters will be investigated immediately.</p>

            <p eId="para_3399">The person concerned is seeking rent supplement at a rate to cover both himself and his child. In cases where parents have joint custody of a child, the needs of both parents to have adequate accommodation to look after the child are taken into account when an application for a rent supplement is being determined.  However, as the child is already accommodated with his mother, he has been requested to reduce the rate to the limit applied for a single person in Kildare.  The person concerned can be facilitated when this reduction has taken place.</p>

            <p eId="para_3636">My Department receives over half-a-million telephone calls per month, across its network of Local Offices and Headquarter buildings.  At certain times, due to peaks in the amount of incoming calls, customers may encounter some difficulties in getting through to certain areas of the Department.  The Department has implemented a number of initiatives to minimise any such delays for customers including the introduction of new telephony systems and work arrangements.  These initiatives have resulted in improvements in telephone response times and overall call management.</p>
            <p eId="para_3637">The Department's customer service standards are set out in its Customer Charter which includes a commitment to serving our customers in a fair, courteous and timely manner. In order to equip staff to deal effectively with all customers, the Department provides training in customer service which includes communicating effectively with customers, effective telephone techniques, active listening and the importance of understanding and empathy.  Training courses also include the raising of awareness of disability, mental health and diversity issues relevant to staff and customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3638">The Department has a formal comments and complaints procedure in place to allow customers give feedback on the quality of services they receive and customers can report poor customer service by email to<i>qcs@welfare.ie</i>, by calling 1890 66 22 44, online on <i>www.welfare.ie</i> or by writing to Customer Services, Department of Social Protection, College Road, Sligo.  All such complaints are investigated and appropriate action taken to address any complaints received.</p>

            <p eId="para_3644">Responsibility for Community Employment Schemes transferred to the Department with effect from 1 January 2012.  Since the transfer of Community Employment to the Department, DSP staff, including former FÁS staff, have been involved in a series of discussions with CE sponsors.  These discussions have shown that while notionally focussed on activation, in reality Community Employment programmes deliver a range of services from childcare, healthcare, drugs support to environmental works.</p>
            <p eId="para_3645">The financial review of Community Employment (CE) Schemes is very near to completion.  This review of CE Schemes has proved to be a valuable exercise for both the schemes themselves and for my Department.  Given the volume and breath of the data being returned, the financial review of CE schemes has taken longer than originally envisaged to complete.  This has allowed more time for schemes to engage with local officials in the finalisation of their respective budgets and for my Department to bring forward improvements to the overall operation of Community Employment which will improve the budgetary situation for schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3646">The key findings will be part of the published review.  As you will appreciate the review is of interest and importance to the many stakeholders involved, accordingly I am unable to provide an outline of its content prior to its publication.  I will ensure, however, that stakeholders will be able to contribute and respond to the findings.</p>
            <p eId="para_3647">Due to the current economic circumstances, this Department has had to find significant savings in the Budget for 2012.  However, the allowance grants for Supervisors are unchanged, as are the working hours for staff employed under Community Employment.  There will also be no decrease in the number of Community Employment places allocated in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_3648">The findings of the separate Labour Market Activation Schemes policy review will also inform the Department's decisions in relation to the CE programme.  While no final allocations of materials and training grants have been made pending completion of the financial review, the existing commitment in relation to the financial support of schemes will continue to apply.  My Department is committed to supporting the CE participants and the sponsors in continuing the valuable contribution the programme makes to individuals and communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_3653">The National Internship Scheme was launched on 1st July 2011.  It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals at all skills levels.  The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.  The Scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_3654">The Scheme has made significant progress to-date.  As at 31st May 2012, 7,495 internship placements have commenced since the launch of the Scheme in July 2011.  There are currently 4,872 interns undertaking internship placements.  In addition, there are in excess of 1,800 internship posts currently advertised on the JobBridge website<i>www.jobbridge.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3655">Given the success of the programme to date I have asked my Department to review the criteria for availing of the programme to ensure that the scheme gives opportunities to as many as possible so that they can benefit from the success of the programme.  In this regard I had previously indicated that I would undertake to have graduate architects who have not formally completed their professional examination included in the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3656">Currently, the Internship Programme requires that an internship should not be part of a training contract (e.g. as part of a training course for a professional qualification from the Law Society or one of the Accountancy Bodies or Architects).  In addition, the programme currently limits access to full time third level education during the time they are with the host organisation.  The rationale behind this approach is that such training contracts with professional bodies come with terms and conditions including remuneration.  I can advise the Deputy that I have asked that these terms and conditions be re-examined to determine how best graduate architects can be supported to secure their professional qualifications.  This process is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_3657">It must also be articulated that the Scheme is open to Host Organisations to provide internship opportunities for qualified architects.  In fact, there are currently 11 architect internships posts advertised on the JobBridge website<i>www.jobbridge.ie</i>.</p>

At the week ending the 1st June, 4,386 participants and 234 supervisors have been engaged in the provision of services to their communities.  The purpose of Tús is the provision of quality work for those who are unemployed in order to break the cycle of unemployment and to improve a person's opportunities in returning to the labour market.  I consider the existing 12-month period on Tús to be adequate to meet the objectives of the initiative.  It is also essential that we ensure that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from this initiative and this would not be facilitated by extending the duration of existing placements.</p>

         the discussions she has had with the pensions industry in respect of addressing the funding shortfall faced by many defined benefit schemes; the way sovereign annuities may assist in addressing this; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_3709">The Government is conscious of the significant structural and affordability problems with defined benefit (DB) pension provisions due to a range of factors such as underestimation of longevity, poor investment decisions and the market turmoil that occurred in 2008. While pension funds have recovered somewhat, significant underfunding challenges remain for many schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3710">The requirements of the Funding Standard were suspended on a temporary basis to allow trustees time to respond to the challenges facing pension schemes.  In 2009 and 2010, a number of amendments were made to the Pensions Act to assist trustees respond to these challenges. The changes included the establishment of a Pensions Insolvency Payments scheme, changes to how the assets of a scheme are distributed should a scheme wind-up, and broadening the scope for schemes to restructure scheme benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_3711">The sovereign annuity is an initiative proposed by the Irish Association of Pension Funds and the Society of Actuaries and is a new type of annuity product where payment under the policy will be directly linked to the proceeds of Euro denominated bonds issued by any EU member state.  Legislation for sovereign annuities was introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions, Act 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3712">Work commenced on an examination of the DB pension model in 2010.  A consultation process on possible options in relation to changes to the DB  model was conducted in late 2010 and summer 2011.  This included the pensions industry, trade unions and employer representatives. The outcome of that consultation is available on my Department website at the following location:<i>www.welfare.ie/EN/Policy/Legislation/Regulatory%20Impact%20Analysis/Documents/ riapension.pdf</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3713">Following the consultation, the Government approved changes to the DB model and legislation was introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012 to give effect to some of these changes. The primary change is that pension schemes will be required to hold a risk reserve in addition to those required under the Funding Standard. The level of the risk reserve that the scheme needs to fund is related directly to the amount of investment risk the scheme is carrying.   Credit under the Funding Standard will be given to schemes that reduce their investment risk and better match their pensioner liabilities.  This risk reserve will act as a "buffer" against future volatility in financial markets and is designed is to help the security of members benefits and the sustainability of DB pension schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3714">The Funding Standard was re-introduced by the Pensions Regulator on 7 June 2012 and schemes will be required to submit funding proposals in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_3715">The sovereign annuity initiative provides pension schemes with an additional option which was not previously available.  Pension schemes that purchase sovereign annuities or the underlying bonds will benefit from a reduction in their liabilities under the Funding Standard to the extent that they actually make those purchases.  The nominated bonds underpinning these annuity policies can also be bought by investors or by pension scheme trustees who wish to pay pensions directly from the pension fund.</p>

            <p eId="para_3718">In 2012 funding of some €18 million has been provided to support the MABS and in December 2011, sanction was received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the retention of 12 temporary posts within the MABS network for a further two year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3719">Since 2009 MABS and member institutions of the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) have had an operational protocol on debt management which is a means through which IBF members and MABS work together to put in place sustainable, affordable repayment plans for customers/clients.  The process of putting in place such plans for people who are experiencing financial problems can be complex due to the high levels of debt and much reduced level of income.  The protocol provides a framework for agreeing financial arrangements and also provides a mechanism through which MABS and IBF members can work together to address and resolve issues which may impede progress.</p>

            <p eId="para_3728">There is no discrimination on grounds of nationality or ethnic background in social welfare legislation and to introduce such a provision would be contrary to the equality principles that Ireland has adopted in its equality legislation, the Treaties of the European Community and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and other international conventions.</p>

            <p eId="para_3747">In the last four years the numbers in receipt of a jobseekers payment who are also working on a part-time or casual basis has increased by almost 200%.  At the end of May 2012 there were some 87,578<b/>people in this situation on the Live Register and some 40,687 of these were claiming jobseeker’s benefit. </p>
            <p eId="para_3748">In line with other Budget measures the effect of this measure will not impact on any person whose sole income is from social welfare.  It will only apply to those who have earned additional income from working some days during the week.</p>
            <p eId="para_3749">The effect of this measure will be to reduce the contribution from jobseeker's benefit to the weekly amount of total income and help towards a reduction in the reliance on the welfare system among those who currently avail of a mix of welfare and earned income. As a savings measure, the change will reduce costs within the jobseeker's benefit scheme but the scheme will continue to deliver incentives towards additional employment for part-time and casual workers.  It is important to note that the measure applies to jobseeker's benefit only and that recipients of jobseeker's benefit may opt for jobseeker's allowance, which is subject to a means test.</p>
            <p eId="para_3750">Entitlement to jobseeker's benefit is based, inter alia, on the claimant being unemployed for three days in any period of six days with benefit being paid at a flat rate, irrespective of earnings. Jobseeker's allowance is also based on satisfaction of ‘three in six' criteria but entitlement is thereafter determined by reference to weekly means. Therefore the jobseeker's allowance scheme takes account of the earnings of part-time and casual workers, via means reduction in respect of any day in which they have earnings from employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_3798">Under the conditions of the BSCFA scheme, income assessed from employment includes earnings before tax, excluding PRSI and travelling expenses of up to €20 a week.  Income received under family income support (FIS) is disregarded when determining entitlement to BSCFA.</p>
            <p eId="para_3799">The assessment under FIS differs in that income from earnings is assessed as gross pay minus tax, employees PRSI, Universal Social Charge, contributions to Personal Retirement Savings Accounts, superannuation and public service pension levy where payable.  The more generous assessment for FIS makes it possible for more people to qualify for this payment which is designed to preserve the financial incentive to take-up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might be marginally better off in employment than on social welfare payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3800">I have no plans to revise the income assessment under the BSCFA scheme at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_3908">The domiciliary care allowance (DCA) scheme has been administered by the Department of Social Protection since April 2009.  I recently announced that a policy review of the operation of the scheme will be carried out over the coming months. This review will look, amongst other things, at the current application and assessment process with a view to identifying any potential improvements to the delivery of service that can be implemented, while retaining an efficient and effective operational model.  The terms of reference for the review and the appointment of a chairperson are being finalised at present and I will be making announcements in that regard shortly.  In terms of consultation, officials from the Department have met parents and representatives of advocacy groups on a number of occasions in recent months and I would envisage that  further consultations will be an important part of the forthcoming review process.</p>

            <p eId="para_3912">The National Internship Scheme was launched on 1 July 2011. It provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals at all skills levels. The aim of JobBridge is to assist individuals in breaking the cycle where they are unable to get a job without experience.  It provides them with an opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge and skills within a working environment.  The Scheme is open to organisations in the private, public and community or voluntary sectors.  The Scheme has made significant progress to-date.  As at 31 May 2012, 7,495 internship placements have commenced since the launch of the Scheme in July 2011.  There are currently 4,872 interns undertaking internship placements.  In addition, there are in excess of 1,800 internship posts currently advertised on the JobBridge website<i>www.jobbridge.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3913">From 28 May 2012, the eligibility criteria were extended to include those in receipt of One Parent Family Payment and Disability Allowance.  The terms and conditions of the Scheme provide that an individual cannot apply for a Jobbridge internship with an organisation that they have previously completed a WPP with.   The rationale behind this is to prevent a company from accessing multiple placements with the same individual.  My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme on an on-going basis. However, currently there are no plans to amend these regulations.  Finally, it is important to highlight that an individual who has partaken in the Work Placement Programme may also undertake an internship with a different Host Organisation.</p>

Information provided includes the qualifying conditions for schemes and details of means assessments.  The Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets which include guidelines on means assessment and these are available from a number of outlets including Social Welfare Local Offices, Citizens Information Service offices and Post Offices. Information can also be requested through the Department's website<i>www.welfare.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_3916">Comprehensive information on means assessment for the various social assistance schemes is also published on the Department's website under the operational guidelines relating to each scheme and is also available on the website of the Citizens Information Board.  The Department operates a network of some 125<b> </b>  local and branch offices throughout the country where advice may be sought in relation to specific schemes.  These locally-based services are supported by a central Information Unit which operates a LoCall information line (1890 66 22 44) which customers may call for information and guidance on their entitlements.  LoCall information lines are also operated in the individual scheme areas where more detailed information may be obtained in relation to qualifying conditions and means assessment for specific schemes.</p>

        <b> Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</b>
         asked the

         if she will review the criteria for determination of entitlement to rent allowance with particular reference to the need to take into account variations in rent costs driven by local market factors which in may cases disqualify applicants from any entitlement and who are consequently forced to live in unsound or unsuitable conditions which in some cases are in breach of good practice in the absence of adequate local authority housing; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4141">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 93,800 persons in receipt of rent supplement, for which the Government has  provided €436m  in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_4142">New maximum rent limits were introduced from 1 January 2012 following analysis of the most up-to-date market data available.  The emphasis of the review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation. The rent levels are being monitored by Department officials and at this point there are no plans to revise the existing limits.  Responsibility for setting and enforcing housing standards rests with the Local Authorities. However, accommodation occupied by rent supplement tenants should at least meet minimum housing standards. In consultation with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, S.I. No. 572 of 2006 and Section 25 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 introduced the condition that allows the Department's officer administering supplementary welfare allowance to decide that a rent supplement may not be payable where it has been notified by a housing authority of the non-compliance with standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_4143">Where such a notification is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant it is recommended that the designated officer would discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action it decides is necessary in the best interests of the tenant. This condition for rent supplement supports the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government in their aim to promote further improvement in private rented accommodation standards.</p>

            <p eId="para_4145">On 16th June 2011, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing and Planning published a new housing policy framework statement. This framework statement reflects the content of the Programme for Government and sets out the principles to underpin the development of housing policy into the medium term.  The framework statement specifically contains the announcement for the transfer of responsibility for providing housing needs for long term rent supplement recipients to housing authorities on a phased basis. The focus of this approach is to achieve a key Government commitment to remove barriers to employment, and at the same time, returning rent supplement to its original purpose of a short-term income support. There are currently approximately 93,800 persons in receipt of rent supplement, for which the Government has provided €436 million for 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_4146">A multi-agency steering group has been established by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government to give effect to this initiative and this group is currently developing proposals and operational protocols for the transfer of responsibility from the Department of Social Protection to housing authorities of persons who have long term housing requirements. A commencement date for the new arrangements of 1 January 2013 has been approved by Government, subject to further consideration of the matter by it.  Such consideration will include a detailed economic assessment of the proposal, the possibility of centralised management and reporting arrangements, any required amendments to Housing and Social Welfare legislation and consistency with overall expenditure ceilings for 2013 and 2014 set out in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure Report.  The consideration of an Exchequer neutral mechanism for funding and resourcing the proposed measure having regard to medium term expenditure targets will be examined.</p>

            <p eId="para_4148">My Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers and is taking all available steps to ensure appropriate resources are in place to deliver its services.  Since May 2008, some 990 staff have been assigned across the Department to fill critical vacancies and additional posts allocated to deal with the increased volume of claims.   Taking into account the numbers of staff who have left the Department and the vacancies that exist currently, a net total of 226 additional staff have been assigned to the Department.   These were sourced mainly through transfer and redeployment from other Government Departments.   In addition, the Department has recruited new medical assessors and appointed additional staff to the social welfare appeals office.  The Department also makes judicious use of overtime and employs temporary staff as appropriate to address particular service issues as they arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_4149">In relation to processing times, these vary across schemes depending on the differing qualification criteria.  In order to improve services in this area and to enhance customer service in general, the Department has embarked on a major programme of process redesign and modernisation, including the development and roll-out of new computer systems.</p>

            <p eId="para_4152">I propose to take Questions Nos. 372 and 380 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4153">Statistics are not available on the number of rent or mortgage interest supplement applications received for the past 2 years and to date in 2012 or the outcome of those applications. However, below is a tabular statement showing the number of rent and mortgage interest supplement claims awarded during these periods.  The timescale for determining applications is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant's income, bank statements etc.  In addition, some aspects of the application are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where investigations such as home visits or third party evidence are required.  Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.</p>
            <p eId="para_4154">The provision of a prompt service is a major objective for the Department's staff dealing with applications.  However, this is tempered by the necessity to ensure that every case is fully investigated and that all cases are dealt with in a consistent and fair manner.  While statistics are not available on the average length of time taken to assess mortgage interest supplement, I am satisfied that the Department's staff dealing with these applications make every effort to ensure claims are processed in an efficient manner.</p>

         if she will clarify the entitlement to rent allowance in respect of single fathers who have shared custody entitlement derived from court decisions but who do not seem to qualify for rent support other than as a single person resulting in their failure to meet their obligations to the courts arising from family law settlements; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4405">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 93,800 persons in receipt of rent supplement, with €436 million provided in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_4406">Any person seeking a rent supplement must first satisfy the Department's representative that they have a housing need that they are unable to meet from their own resources.  In addition, the Department must be satisfied that the residence is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant.  The Department must also be satisfied that the rent payable is reasonable having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_4407">In a case where parents have joint custody of a child, the needs of both parents to have adequate accommodation to look after the child are taken into account when an application for a rent supplement is being determined.  In such cases, documentation is normally required showing that a joint custody arrangement is in place and being availed of before a decision can be made. Every claim for rent supplement is determined having regard to all of the circumstances of the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_4409">It is the policy of my Department to standardise and simplify its application forms as much as possible.  Plain English principles are applied in the design of all primary application forms to ensure a simple, clear, easy to read format that is accessible to people with different levels of literacy ability.</p>
            <p eId="para_4410">The design and layout of each application form must also have regard to the particular requirements of the individual scheme or payment and ensure that the form captures all of the information required to process the application.  The content and layout of application forms are reviewed annually to ensure they are kept up-to-date and that any changes comply with our Plain English principles.</p>
            <p eId="para_4411">The Department has a continuous programme of process improvement initiatives underway aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology.  The standardisation and simplification of application forms complements the introduction of more streamlined processes and procedures, including scanning and automated processing.</p>
            <p eId="para_4412">The Department's website<i>www.welfare.ie</i>, provides comprehensive information on all the Department’s schemes and services as well as a range of online services which include online claiming for state pension contributory, household benefits, child benefit, jobseeker’s payments, widow(er)’s and surviving civil partner’s contributory pension and redundancy payments and insolvency payments.  The objective is to enable people to access services at a time and place that best suits their needs.  The use of online application forms reduces the administrative burden for the customer and facilitates efficient processing of claims by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4413">I am satisfied that the initiatives underway in the Department,  the improvements to processes and procedures supported by the redesign of application forms, and the Department's use of modern technology will deliver an improved and efficient service to customers.</p>

            <p eId="para_4415">My Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  As part of its programme of service delivery modernisation, all scheme areas are subject to continuous business process improvement, and a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in recent years.  The Department has already automated the State pension (contributory) scheme, and in 2011, as part of the Department's programme of service delivery modernisation, the State pension (non-contributory) moved onto the new IT platform.  This has enabled the Department to deal with a very significant increase in claim load without increasing staffing resources. Claims are processed in the most efficient and expeditious way possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4839">In 2010, there were a total of 52,603 overpayments amounting to €83.4 million.  The Department categorises overpayments as f  raud, non-fraud and estate cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_4840">Fraud cases arise mainly on foot of false declarations by customers concerning their employment, income or family status while non-fraud cases are primarily due to customer, third party or departmental error.   Estate cases arise where undisclosed means by customers (usually pensioners) come to light after their deaths.</p>
            <p eId="para_4841">The breakdown of the 2010 overpayments is as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4842">€25.9 million — fraud (15,899 cases);</p>

In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  For employees earning less than €356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 4.25%.</p>
            <p eId="para_4848">Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits, including jobseeker's benefit or social insurance illness benefits, would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.  I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year to meet the commitment made in the programme for Government.   The advisory group will,<i> inter alia</i>, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.   In addition, the actuarial review of the social insurance fund, which is due to be completed in mid-2012, will examine this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_4849">Self-employed people can become unemployed if their business has to close down.  It may also be the case that, although the person continues to be self-employed, the amount of work that they are getting has reduced so much that it no longer provides them with sufficient income.  Self-employed people can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  Self-employed customers do not have to de-register as self-employed persons in order to claim jobseeker's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4850">Legislation provides for the assessment of all income in cash and any non-cash benefits which the person or his or her spouse or civil partner may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year.  While accounts provide significant information, a means assessment is not based solely on audited accounts.  The income from the previous 12 months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings but it is not simply assumed that the previous year's earnings will be received in the following year.  Any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person's income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_4851">If a self-employed person's situation changes after they have made an initial claim for jobseeker's allowance, the person can apply to have his or her means reviewed in the light of these changed circumstances.  In addition, it is open to the individual to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office if he or she is dissatisfied with the level of means assessed.</p>

            <p eId="para_4916">The question of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay, whereby employers would directly meet the costs of sick absence for an initial period of illness, is being considered in the context of the need to reform the social welfare system to bring it into line with practices in other countries in this area; the need to address the deficit in the social insurance fund; the need to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability; and in the wider context of enhancing the health of the workforce and addressing levels of absenteeism.</p>
            <p eId="para_4917">I hosted a consultative seminar on the feasibility and implications of introducing a scheme of statutory sick pay in February 2012.  This seminar was attended by a broad range of key stakeholders and afforded an opportunity to discuss the complex issues involved, including the questions of potential abuse of the system and the potential impacts on employers.  A report of that seminar will be published shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_4918">As the potential impacts and range of issues to be addressed are complex, further development, refinement and consultation with key stakeholders is needed before any decision could be taken by Government on the possible introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4920">My Department is currently in the process of a major transformation programme.

            <p eId="para_5014">Ireland is situated on a tectonically benign part of the world, unlike for example Japan, California, New Zealand or parts of the Mediterranean and is therefore not at risk from high magnitude earthquakes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5015">The magnitude 4.0 earthquake that occurred 60 km off the north Mayo coast at 08:58 local time on 6th June was located on a geological fault system that drops the Slyne-Rockall basins down to the west off the Irish shelf.  These naturally occurring faults, formed millions of years ago, have had a long geological history and are related to the continuing opening of the Atlantic ocean.  Seismicity of this magnitude has not been recorded along the fault system in this area since instrumental records began in 1970.  While the location and magnitude of this event were unexpected, there is a clear geological reason for it.  Future seismic activity along the fault system may be anticipated, but not of significantly larger magnitude.  The magnitude was far below the threshold for generation of a seismogenic tsunami or indeed to cause significant structural damage.</p>

            <p eId="para_5020">The provision of electronic communications services, including broadband services, is, in the first instance, a matter for competing service providers using one of the available technology platforms i.e. DSL, fixed or mobile wireless, cable or satellite and operating in Ireland's fully liberalised telecommunications market which is regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</p>
            <p eId="para_5021">The State only intervenes in areas where licensed service providers have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  In this regard, the Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband into those areas.  In the case of one such intervention, namely the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), broadband services are available from 3, in all of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) designated to be covered under the Scheme since October 2010, the vast majority of which are in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_5022">In keeping with State Aid clearance for the Scheme, the broadband service contracted under the NBS is a basic, affordable, scalable product.  The NBS mobile wireless service currently offers minimum speeds of 1.6Mbps download and 1.2Mbps upload subject to a maximum contention ratio.  These speeds will be upgraded in October 2012 to 2.3mbps and 1.4mbps respectively at no cost to NBS customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5023">I understand 3's NBS subscribers include businesses as well as domestic customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5024">As regards service quality, the Department has well-established monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that the NBS delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on 3, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.</p>
            <p eId="para_5025">Any NBS customer who is experiencing problems with the NBS service can contact 3's customer care centre 24 hours a day 7 days a week by phone at 1913 (free of charge) or by email to<i>nbssupport@three.ie</i>.  Additionally, a team of field engineers has been established to address NBS specific maintenance issues at customers’ premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_5026">My Department has a role when customers have fully utilised the established complaints process and still feel their complaint has not been resolved.  It operates a dedicated NBS mailbox, which NBS customers can contact by email at<i>nationalbroadbandscheme@dcenr.gov.ie</i>  with any comments or complaints they may have about their NBS service.</p>
            <p eId="para_5027">With basic broadband services available throughout Ireland, the challenge now  is to accelerate the roll out of high speed services.  This Government accepts that the widespread availability of such speeds is required to deliver future economic and social development.</p>
            <p eId="para_5028">Following the recent publication of the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce (NGBT), and a short public consultation on its findings and recommendations, I will be bringing proposals for a National Broadband Plan to Government shortly with a view to agreeing a comprehensive set of policy actions to underpin the provision of high speed broadband services on a national basis.</p>

I have impressed on the Company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard and have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins.  The acknowledgment by the IPU that it is supportive of delivering new services is clearly positive in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_5036">In the context of public sector transformation, I have stressed to my Government colleagues that the increased use of the post office network should be considered by public sector bodies where this is appropriate.</p>

The conditions attaching to the survey approval include that the survey must comply with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, together with my Department's Rules and Procedures for Offshore Petroleum Exploration and Appraisal Operations.  The approval conditions also require that a marine mammal observer and a fisheries liaison officer will be on board for the duration of the survey.</p>

            <p eId="para_5070">My Department issued comprehensive guidance to local authorities on the treatment of mortgage arrears, including local authority mortgages for shared ownership transactions, in March 2010.  That guidance was closely based on the Central Bank's first statutory<i>Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears</i> to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.To reflect the content of the Central Bank’s revised Code of Conduct — which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt — my Department is currently preparing updated guidance to local authorities in consultation with the City and County Managers Association. </p>
            <p eId="para_5071">There are two aspects to the guidance: there is borrower focused guidance which will e.g. set out the types of arrangements that authorities should be offering to borrowers, the details of how contact should be initiated with a distressed borrower and the frequency with which an authority should make contact.  The second piece of the guidance is the back-end accounting treatment of the various solutions being put forward to ensure that authorities are treating people consistently and managing their own resources consistently too.  While it is of obvious importance that authorities offer compassionate and practical solutions to those mortgage holders who require some support, it is, equally, incumbent on all authorities to protect as best as they can their overall financial position.</p>

            <p eId="para_5078">In order to be able to vote at elections and referendums in this jurisdiction, a person's name must be entered in the register of electors for a constituency in the State in which the person ordinarily resides.</p>
            <p eId="para_5079">Postal voting is provided for in electoral law in respect of certain categories of person who are entered in the register of electors. The Electoral Act 1992 provides for postal voting by whole-time members of the Defence Forces, members of the Garda Síochána, and Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses or civil partners. Subsequent legislation enacted by the Oireachtas has extended postal voting to other categories: electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996); electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day and full-time students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State — in these cases, the law provides for completion of the necessary voting documentation at a Garda station (the Electoral Act 1997); certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001); and electors who  because of the circumstances of their detention in prison pursuant to an order of a court are likely to be unable to go in person on polling day to vote (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006).</p>
            <p eId="para_5080">While electoral law is subject to ongoing review, I have no proposals at present to extend existing arrangements for postal voting.</p>

            <p eId="para_5134">The Temple Bar Cultural Trust organisation is a private limited company with the Dublin City Manager as the sole shareholder. Therefore, in the first instance, governance arrangements and financial management of the Trust are a matter for Dublin City Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_5135">I understand that the current staffing level in Temple Bar Cultural Trust is 15.  The Board Members are listed below.  The fees for the new Chair are currently being addressed as are the fees for the new Board Members, other than City Councillors and City Council Staff Members.</p>
            <p eId="para_5136">The Trust has no planning powers. The total value of assets under the control of the trust, as per the 2011 financial statements, is €48.4 million which includes €9 million investment properties and €39.4 million of cultural properties.</p>
            <p eId="para_5137">There are currently no consultants engaged by the Trust.  The accounts for 2011 have been audited by Smyth and Williamson Freaney  and are currently before the Board for approval. Temple Bar Cultural Trust is financed through its property income and receives no subsidy from Dublin City Council or central Government. The Trust,  however, receives various grants from Government Departments for particular pieces of work it undertakes throughout the year. An annual grant for Culture Night amounting to €100,000 is also received from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p>
            <p eId="para_5138">No decision has yet been made on the future of the Trust. I understand that an independent consultancy report into the operation of the Trust, commissioned by Dublin City Council, was presented to the Council in 2011. The contents of the report were circulated and discussed in detail at a City Council meeting on 3 October 2011.  The City Manager has tasked the Board with examining the recommendations in the  report.</p>

            <p eId="para_5156">Given the imperative to reduce costs and to increase efficiencies across local authority operations, local authorities are reducing the costs of goods and services to the sector by using the most advanced methods of procurement available through appropriate national and regional frameworks supported by ICT reporting systems. In this regard, local authorities reported savings in terms of procurement of over €26 million under the first report on the Public Service Agreement (PSA) and further significant savings will be reported in the second report on the PSA, which is due to be published soon.</p>
            <p eId="para_5157">In order further to improve the procurement function in the sector local authorities are establishing national and regional procurement structures to ensure that all opportunities for economies of scale and efficiencies in terms of procurement are exploited.

            <p eId="para_5160">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides the legislative basis for the household charge.

This is to ensure that future development at locations on, or in the vicinity of, national roads is guided to the most suitable location and that work on Ireland's national roads network is planned for and managed in a complementary and integrated manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_5455">I propose to take Questions Nos. 436 to 438, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5456">Ballymun Regeneration Limited (BRL) is a company limited by guarantee, and not having a share capital, established by Dublin City Council under the Companies' Acts. It was incorporated in June 1997 and is wholly owned by Dublin City Council. BRL's principal objects are, inter alia, to prepare plans for the redevelopment and regeneration of Ballymun and to act as developer/contractor for the regeneration project.</p>
            <p eId="para_5457">In this context, BRL acts as<b> </b>  a disclosed agent for Dublin City Council in carrying out its brief in accordance with the Memorandum and Articles of its incorporation. Dublin City Council formally appointed BRL in 1997 as agent for the achievement of the redevelopment and regeneration of the Ballymun area. In accordance with the Memorandum and Articles of Association, all contracts, including services and works contracts procured by BRL, are in the name of the company.</p>
            <p eId="para_5458">BRL is staffed in a number of different ways including through secondment of staff from Dublin City Council and secondments from other local authorities. These secondees remain permanent and pensionable employees of their respective local authorities. The company also recruited a number of fixed-term contract staff directly through open competition. It is a matter for BRL to determine the numbers, duration and terms of individual contracts having regard to work demands and the particular skill-sets required to plan and deliver individual projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_5459">Ballymun regeneration is now moving into the completion phase and all demolition and construction projects are expected to be substantially completed by 2014.  In light of this, it is expected that staff numbers will decline in line with the decrease in the overall level of planning and construction activity in Ballymun.</p>

            <p eId="para_5461">Unlike for Dáil constituencies, there are no constitutional or statutory requirements in relation to the frequency of local electoral area boundary reviews. The most recent reviews of local electoral areas were carried out in 1998 and 2008. The June 2009 local elections took place on the basis of the local electoral areas enacted following the 2008 review.</p>

            <p eId="para_5507">I propose to take Questions Nos. 452 and 453 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5508">Section 14 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for a process for the inclusion by planning authorities of public rights of way in development plans.  The process provides for the referral to the Circuit Court, by the landowner affected, of a proposal to include a right of way and where the court is satisfied that no right of way exists, the planning authority may not include it in its development plan.  Section 14(7) provides that "the inclusion of a public right of way in a development plan shall be evidence of the existence of such a right unless the contrary is shown".</p>
            <p eId="para_5509">The question of whether a public right of way exists is therefore ultimately a matter for the courts to determine.</p>
            <p eId="para_5510">Ireland's Waymarked trails and the majority of other walking routes are "permissive access routes" that have been developed with the landowners' agreement; they are not public rights of way.  Accordingly, the recent ruling regarding rights of way is not expected to have any significant impact on the existing network of permissive access routes currently available to walkers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5511">The State's involvement in Rural Recreation developed against the backdrop of significant difficulties at key walking destinations during the 1990s, including, inter alia, issues regarding access to trails, many of which traversed private lands.  In this context, Comhairle Na Tuaithe (the Countryside Council) was established January 2004 to address the three priority issues of:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5512">access to the countryside;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5513">developing a countryside code; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5514">Developing a National Countryside Recreation Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5515">It comprises representatives of the farming organisations, recreational users of the countryside and state bodies with an interest in the countryside. From this the National Countryside Recreation Strategy was published in 2006. Access to the countryside which had proven to be an ongoing problem for private landowners, state landholders, recreational users and tourists alike has been progressed though the efforts of Comhairle na Tuaithe and the introduction of the Walks Scheme in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_5516">With regard to access to the countryside, An Expert Group reported to the then Minister in May 2007.  It did not set out specific recommendations but examined existing legislation and explored the implications of introducing legislation, such as granting a right of access to recreational users. It was determined that the best way forward was to develop permissive access with the agreement of landholders The consensus approach adopted is underpinned by the principle of mutual respect between landowners and recreation users, with the acceptance of the rights of landowners over access to their land and the need of recreation users to have reasonable access to the countryside. The report by the Expert Group established to examine and make recommendations on "the Legal Issues of Land Access for Recreational Use" is available on my Department's website.<i>http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Community/Rural Development/FileDownLoad,27109,en.doc</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_5522">The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, which introduced the non-principal private residence charge, places the onus on individual property owners to assess their liability for the charge in the first instance.  There is no obligation on local authorities to issue demands or invoices.  The charge is set at €200 per dwelling and is being levied and collected by local authorities.  A late payment fee of €20 for each month or part of a month the charge remains outstanding is provided for in section 6 of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_5523">A person who is ordinarily resident abroad and owns a property in the State which is not his or her main residence is liable for the charge in the same manner as a person resident in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_5524">National advertising has taken place in each year since the introduction of the charge to ensure general awareness of the charge and the liability dates.  Some advertising on the charge was also placed in publications/newsletters circulating in areas in which large Irish populations are residing abroad.  In tandem, local authorities have undertaken their own advertising campaigns locally and have separately sent reminders to property owners registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).  Communications have also been issued to persons who paid the charge in respect of previous years reminding them of their possible liability for the charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_5525">Significant efforts are being made to ensure that property owners are aware of the charge and the liability dates.  However, the charge is based on self assessment principles and it is a matter for persons with a liability to pay the charge by the due date to avoid late payment fees.</p>

            <p eId="para_5545">Under the Coroners Act, 1962, coroner remuneration is fixed by local authorities, with my approval, following consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Coroners are graded according to their work-load, and are paid a basic fee (a "retainer") which is intended to cover administration and support costs.  This is either €12,807 (Grade 3), €17,932 (Grade 2) or €21,774 (Grade 1) per annum depending on the number of deaths dealt with.  There are separate fees for the Dublin Coroner (€27,595) and the Cork City Coroner (€44,152).</p>
            <p eId="para_5546">Coroners are also paid fees per item of service in respect of each of the three core elements of their work - the number of deaths reported to them, the number of post mortems held and the number of inquests held.  This means that increases in workload are reflected in remuneration.  There is no provision for sharing of workload because a coroner's jurisdiction is confined to his/her district.</p>
            <p eId="para_5547">The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 provides for certain reforms in coronial matters, including an amalgamation of the Dublin County and City coronial districts, as well as other districts as vacancies arise, following appropriate consultation.</p>

I am aware that it is the practice of our coroners to be especially sensitive in so far as is possible, to the needs of families in the handling of all inquests and particularly so where suicide may be in question.  I am aware of the hurt and trauma involved for family members and relatives in all tragic death situations, but perhaps especially in regard to suicide.</p>

            <p eId="para_5644">My Department last sought applications from Executive Officers and Higher Executive Officers for posts in visa offices overseas in April 2010.  The Office Notice seeking applications was issued to all staff in the grades referenced by the Deputy as well as Administrative Officers.  All candidates who applied were interviewed and a panel was created.</p>
            <p eId="para_5645">As part of the application process all successful candidates were notified of their placement on the panel and when offered an overseas appointment were asked to produce a copy of their Irish passport.  The assessment of eligibility for any post occurs, as a practice, at the point where an assignment is about to be made.  During the currency of the panel established one officer who was unable to provide an Irish passport was not in a position to take up an assignment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5646">The present panel for overseas appointment is in place until 30 June 2013.  These posts will be advertised again when the present panel expires or unless previously exhausted, provided the business case to maintain visa officers overseas remains valid.  All officers in the relevant grades will be allowed apply for future competitions.  The requirement to hold Irish citizenship to take up a posting in the visa offices overseas will still apply.  Under the 2008 Passport Act, Irish passports, whether standard, official or diplomatic, may only be issued to Irish citizens.</p>

That is to say, while the centres are managed by private contractors under contract to RIA, the land and buildings are owned by the State.  At appendix A below is a list of those 7 State owned centres showing their capacities and residents' profiles.</p>
            <p eId="para_5653">The Deputy should be aware that RIA has recently completed an EU tender competition for the management of these State owned centres.  The relevant contracts have now been signed and are effective from 14 June, 2012.  The list at appendix B indicates how these 7 centres were tendered for in terms of 'lots' and the winning contractors for those lots effective from 14 June, 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_5654">The RIA does not hold past financial information on individual State-owned contracts in an easily accessible form.  Relevant information in relation to these centres is being compiled and details of the costs of each of these centres will be forwarded directly to the Deputy shortly.  In this respect it is important to note that, as explained in replies to previous Dáil Questions, it is not in the interest of the taxpayer that details of current individual contracts are known to the public or to other parties who are, or may be in the future, engaged in negotiations with RIA.  Therefore, details of current contract rates are not provided.  The policy is that the updating of the table of contracts will take place only at the end of January each year in respect of all financial information up to the end of December two years previously, e.g. at the end of January, 2012 the records are updated to end of December 2009.  This policy has been upheld by the Office of the Information Commissioner.</p>
            <p eId="para_5655">To assist the Deputy in getting a broader picture of spending on the Direct Provision system in general terms, I set out at appendix C below a breakdown of the total of €69.459 million expended by RIA in 2011.  The Deputy will note that a total of €8.258 million was spent in 2011 on the fixed costs — i.e. the costs related to the provision of management and other services — of the 7 State-owned accommodation centres and that a further €1.458 million was spent on utility and maintenance costs at these 7  centres.</p>

The distribution of the Reserve throughout the state on the same date was as set out in the table below.  Recruitment to the Reserve is ongoing and nationwide.  The last Garda Reserve Graduation took place on 17 February 2012.  All Divisions, apart from Westmeath, Roscommon/Longford, Sligo/Leitrim and DMR East, were assigned Garda Reserve members from those who graduated on that date.</p>

        <b> Deputy Sean Fleming</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice and Equality</b>
         if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties that have arisen following the implementation of the Property Services Regulation Act 2011 in relation to auctioneer’s licences which came into effect on 30 May without sufficient advance notice for various practitioners involved in the area and that many of them had already placed advertisements and incurred significant costs in renewing their auctioneers licences in respect of court sittings to be held in during the month of June and that now these cannot proceed as the matter is being dealt with through the Property Services Regulatory Authority and not through the courts and that large numbers of auctioneers and solicitors have incurred expenditure in terms of putting advertising notices in papers and so on because they had to have the notice in the papers 28 days in advance of the court sitting; if he will make some arrangement to compensate persons for costs incurred in addition to the stamp duty and that the courts will re-fund in respect of these applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_6122">I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that a valid application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in September 2009. The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation, such as good character and lawful residence, and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_6123">It is recognised that all applicants for citizenship would wish to have a decision on their application without delay.  Considerable resources are deployed to process applications and these resources together with the necessary administrative arrangements are kept under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_6124">As well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is also a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_6125">Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p>

            <p eId="para_6141">The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) is responsible for the accommodation of asylum seekers through the Government policy of direct provision while their applications for asylum are being processed. The system provides asylum seekers with full board accommodation, free of utility or other costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_6142">The Clondalkin Towers Accommodation Centre, Ninth Lock Road, Clondalkin is one of currently 37 centres within the RIA accommodation portfolio. There are 222 asylum seekers currently residing in Clondalkin Towers.  Out of those 222 persons, there are 47 family units (i.e. parent/s with children).  There are 78 bedrooms in the centre and the number of persons assigned to any particular room is based on the size of the room.</p>
            <p eId="para_6143">Facilities for families in Clondalkin Towers include an indoor play area, equipment for which has been grant approved by Pobal, and a preschool.</p>
            <p eId="para_6144">The 2011 Annual Report by RIA will shortly be published on its website —<i>www.ria.gov.ie</i>.   This will provide, <i>inter alia</i>, a full overall breakdown of each centre, including Clondalkin Towers, at the end of 2011 in terms of residents’ gender, nationality and age.</p>
            <p eId="para_6145">Asylum seekers are not assigned to particular centres based at the stage they are at in the asylum determination system.  Neither does the centre they're residing in have any bearing whatsoever on the outcome of their claim for international protection. Therefore, no statistics are maintained in relation to these aspects of the question, as to maintain such statistics would have no practical benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_6146">Clondalkin Towers is one element of the system of direct provision system and dispersal and that system is one of the central features of the State's response to the asylum issue.  I am satisfied that, through the coordinated service delivery under this system, the treatment of asylum seekers here is at least on a par with that of any other country and that it delivers a high standard of service and value for money to the taxpayer.</p>

            <p eId="para_6149">I propose to take Questions Nos. 488 and 489 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6150">The median processing time for asylum decisions in 2012 is 8 months (or 32 weeks) from date of initial application at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.  I should point out that some cases can take longer to complete due to, for example, delays arising from medical issues, or because of judicial review proceedings.  All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.  For the sake of completeness, I should also state that persons who are refused a declaration under Section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) enter what is commonly referred to as the "leave to remain" process which generally has two elements to it; an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). This is separate to the asylum or refugee status determination process.</p>
            <p eId="para_6151">The processing of cases at this point is complex and extremely resource intensive given that where an application for subsidiary protection is lodged in addition to representations for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the subsidiary protection application must be considered first to assess whether the applicant has an identifiable need for international protection. Where such an application is refused, consideration must then be given to the case in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), at which point the Minister must make a decision whether or not to make a deportation order in respect of the person. All of this must be done in strict compliance with the Constitution, together with relevant international law including the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_6152">The total number of persons granted asylum for the years 2008 - 2011 was 586, 393,157 and 132 respectively. While there is not an exact correlation between the number of asylum applications and the decision date of applications, there has been a very substantial reduction in new applications over the same period and accordingly the numbers granted asylum should be seen in this context.</p>

            <p eId="para_6180">In June 2011 I introduced formal citizenship ceremonies for the first time since the foundation of the State. The ceremonies which are being met with universal approval and are held at no extra cost to applicants allow candidates for citizenship make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State and receive their certificate of naturalisation in a meaningful and dignified manner which befits the importance and solemnity of the occasion. To date, 47 such ceremonies have been held at which almost 11,000 candidates have become Irish citizens under the new procedures. On 14 June a further 4,000 persons will conferred with Irish citizenship.</p>
            <p eId="para_6181">The prescribed fees to be paid by applicants on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation were last increased by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Fees) Regulations 2008, which came into effect on 1 August 2008. The standard certification fee is €950 while a reduced fee of €200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain circumstances when the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen. In the case of refugees and stateless persons no fee is charged.  The increases in certification fees were in line with inflation for the period 1993 to 2008. While the fees are designed to reflect the effort and cost involved in processing the different categories of applicant, the certification fees do not recoup the full cost of processing the applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_6182">In November 2011, I signed into law Statutory Instrument 569/11, which introduced an application fee of €175 for new applications for a certificate of naturalisation. The application fee was introduced to contribute towards the costs of processing those applications that do not attract any certification fee and to reduce the proportion of invalid and ineligible applications being lodged. The Statutory Instrument also introduced a series of changes to the application forms, in particular to facilitate applicants who are the civil partners of Irish citizens. Prior to the enactment of these regulations no fee was paid in advance of a person being naturalised.</p>

As the Deputy will be aware the Working Group set up to advise me on practical issues in relation to the merger recommended that the new Commission as a priority initial task should undertake a review of its staffing needs to compile the evidence for a business case for any essential additional staff needs it may identify.

I am further informed that there is a 'no left turn' restriction in place at the junction between 7 am and 10am during which time pedestrians are frequently dropped at the location which adds to traffic restrictions and congestion.

            <p eId="para_6213">The visa application referred to by the Deputy was received in the Visa Office, Dublin on the 22 February 2012.  The type of visa sought was a multiple entry visit visa.  Following consideration it was the decision of the visa officer to refuse the granting of the visa sought.  The visa was refused as the visa officer was not satisfied with the obligations of the applicant to return to their country of origin following the proposed visit.  One suggested way in which an applicant may seek to establish obligations to return to their country of origin is by way of social ties, e.g. other family members.</p>

An appeal must be made within two months of the date of refusal, in this instance before the 10 July 2012.

Guidelines regarding the visa appeals procedure are available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service —<i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_6218">I propose to take Questions Nos. 502 and 503 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6219">The position in relation to this matter remains as indicated in my written Reply to Question number 313 of 8 May 2012. I have also addressed this matter in the course of my speech and open discussion of the modernisation and reform of the legal sector at the Annual Conference of the Law Society on 14th April — the full text of the speech remains available on my Department's web-site,<i>www.justice.ie</i>, for ease of reference.</p>
            <p eId="para_6220">As I have conveyed on such previous occasions, the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority to be established under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 will be independent of the legal professions and of the Government in the performance of its functions. This will include new and independent procedures relating to allegations of professional misconduct by either solicitors or barristers. Such complaints will be dealt with under the auspices of the Authority's Complaints Committee and supported, where appropriate, by the work of the new and independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal. Under the Bill, members of the public will no longer go to the Law Society or to the Bar Council and their respective disciplinary tribunals to deal with complaints, as happens at the moment, but will instead do so through the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_6221">The Law Society has, earlier this year, recognised that it would be "in the best interests of the public and the profession" if complaints about solicitors were no longer to be dealt with by the Society but by the new Regulatory Authority to be established under the Bill.  I have commended this development because it will underpin public perceptions of impartiality in the regime governing the conduct and discipline of the legal professions to the utmost degree. The independence of the new Regulatory Authority and of its attendant complaints and Disciplinary Tribunal procedures is, therefore, fundamental to their success and to the avoidance of any perception that complaints about lawyers are being dealt with by lawyers themselves or by their representative bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_6222">Under the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 the complaints systems currently operated by the legal professional bodies are to be replaced by new procedures the independence of which will have to be reflected in the relevant recruitment and appointment processes. In closing the Second Stage debate on the Bill and in my address to the Law Society of 14 April, I have confirmed that I am considering possible Committee Stage amendments to create appropriately independent procedures for the appointment of members of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its Complaints Committee and of the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal. Similarly, I expressed the view that staff appointments to the new Authority would be better made by the Authority itself under a public competition carried out by the Public Appointments Service. While the transition to a new and independent complaints procedure under the Bill will have an impact on staff currently involved in that area it will be open to such staff — who would obviously possess the relevant skills and experience — to offer to apply for positions advertised by the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_6224">The visa applications referred to by the Deputy were lodged in April 2012 and were processed in the Visa Office, Dublin.  It was the decision of the visa officer on 21 May 2012 to refuse the granting of the visas sought.</p>
            <p eId="para_6225">The visas were refused as the visa officer was not satisfied with the obligations of the applicants to return to their country of origin following the proposed visit.   One suggested way in which an applicant may seek to establish obligations to return to their country of origin is by way of social and or economic ties.  The visa officer further noted that no clear link to the contact/host had been established.  The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) website states that visit visa applicants are required to submit details of how they are known to or related to their contact host and to provide supporting evidence of this.  While immigration stamps in an applicant's passport demonstrate previous entry to Ireland, this does not establish how they may be known to the present contact/host.</p>
            <p eId="para_6226">The Deputy may wish to note that the previous visits referred to occurred in 2008.  At that time nationals of Mauritius were not required to be in possession of a visa when seeking to enter the State.  The visa requirement for nationals of Mauritius entered in to force on 1 January 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_6227">It is noted that the persons concerned do not propose to appeal the decisions to refuse the visas.  It is, of course, open to them to lodge a fresh visa application at any time.  Where doing so, the persons concerned should be in a position to address the concerns raised by the Visa Officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_6228">Queries in relation to general immigration matters may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p>

            <p eId="para_6230">The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 updated the law concerning the acquisition of easements, including rights of way other than public rights of way. Parts 12 and 13 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 contain amendments to the 2009 Act and the Registration of Title Act 1964 respectively which simplify the procedures for registering easements acquired by prescription under the 2009 Act. Rules applicable to the new arrangements are set out in the Land Registration Rules 2011 (S.I. No. 559 of 2011) which have been published on the web site of the Property Registration Authority (<i>www.prai.ie</i>). The procedures to be followed are set out in a Practice Direction entitled ’Registration of Easements and Profits a Prendre acquired by Prescription under Section 49A’ which has also been published on the Authority’s web site.</p>

Subsection (9) of that section states that failure on the part of a licensee to observe any provision of such a code shall not of itself render the licensee liable to any civil or criminal proceedings but such failure shall be considered as relating to the good character of the licensee for the purposes of renewal of the licensee's licence under the Courts (No. 2) Act 1986. Under the latter Act, the grounds on which objection to renewal of a licence permitting the sale of intoxicating liquor may be made include the good character of the licensee and the peaceable and orderly manner in which the licensed premises were conducted in the year ending on the expiry of the licence.</p>

            <p eId="para_6603">The White Paper on Defence, published in February, 2000, provides the current Defence policy framework. As part of the process leading to the development of a new White Paper, I decided to expand the public consultative process by initiating a Green Paper on Defence. On publication, the purpose of the Green Paper will be to  elicit an appropriate level of debate on Defence which will better inform the development of the new White Paper on Defence. Work is underway in this regard.  A Memorandum for Government setting out the proposed approach and timeframe was circulated to cabinet colleagues and subsequently approved by Government. The Green Paper on Defence will be published at the end of 2012. Members of the public and other interested parties, including representative associations, will then be given their opportunity to submit their views on Defence policy and Defence provision. A new White Paper on Defence will be prepared and published by end 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_6607">Agri-environment measures for the programming period 2007-2013 are provided for in Council Regulation 1698/ 2005, as amended, which sets out the rules governing the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). Detailed rules for scheme implementation are set out in Commission Regulations 1974/2006 and 65/2011, as amended. In practice, all agri-environment schemes must be approved by the Commission and form part of the Rural Development Programmes submitted by each Member State and approved by the Commission. The Rural Development Programmes set out overall objectives, the measures to be implemented and funding arrangements, including the level of EAFRD funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_6608">Ireland's Rural Development Programme, 2007-2013, as approved by the Commission currently provides for agri-environment payments under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS), the Organic Farming Scheme (OFS) and the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS). Farmers with designated Natura 2000 land can apply for payment under the REPS and AEOS. Details of the specific measures or schemes for which farmers may receive payment are set out in the Programme, as amended.  Where a Member State intends to introduce actions other than those already approved, an application to amend the existing Rural Development Programme must be submitted to the Commission. Whereas REPS was included in Ireland's originally approved Programme, AEOS was later introduced by way of an amendment to the Programme with Commission approval.</p>
            <p eId="para_6609">While Ireland's Rural Development Programme provides for the possibility of opening an agri-environment scheme on an annual basis, the opening of schemes and their format is dependent on the availability of resources.  Due to the on-going situation in the national finances, strict budgetary constraints remain in place and, as a result, management of the limited resources represents a very challenging situation involving difficult choices.  In this context, the re-opening of a new agri-environment scheme would involve additional expenditure by the Department. I am actively considering the possibility of re-opening AEOS later in the year having regard, in particular, to the budgetary implications and I will be making an announcement on the situation in due course.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)</from>
            <p eId="para_6670">Under the Seafood Development Operational Programme 2007-2013, BIM pays cooperatives 55% of the market price of berried lobsters presented by co-op members for v-notching by a BIM officer and returned alive to the sea by the fishermen in order to spawn.  I understand that some fisherman's co-operatives pay their members the remaining 45% of the market value of the lobster from funds derived from the subscriptions of their members, while other co-operatives do not.  Where this other 45% is paid to the co-op member, he or she receives the full market value of the lobster and this makes participation in the v-notching programme a very attractive option for the co-op members.  V-notching rates tend to be higher for such co-ops, but this practice also places a great strain on the finances of those co-ops, particularly if co-op membership numbers are falling.</p>
            <p eId="para_6671">V-notching is a very important conservation measure for the lobster stock.  In those areas with particularly strong v-notching programmes, a very positive impact on the lobster stock has been noted.  Lobster fishermen in those areas get a much better return for their effort.  It is very much in the interests of lobster fishermen to maximise v-notching rates in their area in order to ensure the sustainability of the fishery and their livelihoods into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_6672">Funding for the Operational Programme is limited by Ireland's allocation from the European Fisheries Fund and there are many demands on BIM to provide supports for many important areas of the seafood sector.  BIM endeavour within the budget available to support a range of important programmes and initiatives.  Taking account of the limited funding allocation available to Ireland, if the scheme was revised to provide the full market price for v-notched lobsters, BIM advise that this would lead to the budget for the scheme being used to v-notch fewer lobsters overall, which would undermine the progress of the scheme in achieving the conservation objectives set for the fishery.  I am very supportive of the V-Notching Programme and would urge all lobster fishermen to recognise its importance in preserving their future livelihood and to participate fully in the Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_6685">I am satisfied that Ireland has made good progress with the implementation of EID requirements for sheep, in line with EU rules.  This has, in fact, already been acknowledged by the EU Food and Veterinary Office. The Deputy will know that we are now moving to implement the final elements of the tagging arrangements for EID in sheep coupled with the appropriate revisions to NSIS.  This is the best way of ensuring that we continue to have a robust identification and traceability system in compliance with EU rules and have improved market access for our sheep meat products.  The continued co-operation of all stakeholders is important if we are to achieve a successful outcome in the implementation of EID.</p>
            <p eId="para_6686">The Deputy should be aware that although EID has been a mandatory EU requirement for some years now, there does not appear to be an additional problem, in general, with lost tags as a result of its introduction. This is also the case with regard to sore and infected ears post tagging as long as appropriate practices are observed. These include correct placement of the tag in the ear, tagging at the correct time of year in order to avoid fly strike and also the disinfection of equipment and the sheep's ear prior to tagging each animal.  These guidelines are outlined in a booklet that my Department is forwarding to each flock owner.</p>
            <p eId="para_6687">If a farmer has sheep with infected ears post tagging then he can seek veterinary advice from his own practitioner. If the advice is to remove the tag(s) then the sheep farmer should record the event in his/her farm flock register and retain the removed tags. The affected sheep should be re-identified as soon as possible after the ears have healed — correlating the new tag number to the removed tag number.</p>
            <p eId="para_6688">Where a farmer's experience of a particular tag type is not to their liking, they are free to use another of the nine approved suppliers.</p>

            <p eId="para_6690">My Department, in the context of delivering the Direct Payments Schemes is required to carry out annual inspections covering land eligibility and cross compliance to ensure compliance with EU regulatory requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_6691">Eligibility checks for land must be carried out on 5% of applicants. These checks are carried out to verify that the actual area claimed on the application form corresponds to the area farmed by the farmer and to ensure that any ineligible land or other features are correctly deducted.  Up to two-thirds of these inspections are carried out without a farm visit as the information is verified using the technique of remote sensing via satellite.</p>
            <p eId="para_6692">The rate of inspections for cross-compliance is 1% of applicants to whom the Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) and Good Agricultural Condition (GAEC) apply. However 3% of farmers must be inspected under the bovine identification and registration requirements while 3% of sheep/goat farmers must be inspected covering 5% of the flock.</p>
            <p eId="para_6693">In conducting a sheep inspection, every effort is made by officials of my Department to minimise disruption to farming activities and to avoid stress to livestock on the holding. Inspection timings are organised to avoid in as far as is possible conducting inspections when lambs are young or the need to bring sheep down from the hills. Where young lambs are found particular care is taken to avoid such risks as mis-mothering.</p>

            <p eId="para_6767">The maximum grant available was €50,000 (including VAT).  The aim of the funding is to provide support to child care settings to address remedial, maintenance and renovation work or to purchase equipment.  Following a robust appraisal of all applications received, 290 applications were approved for funding with the average amount approved being €21,000.  Of the total number of applications approved, 125 were from private child care facilities.  Of the total amount approved, 63% was approved for renovation and expansion works, 25% was approved for the purchase of equipment, 11% was approved for maintenance works and 0.5% was approved in respect of professional fees associated with the capital works.  The figures available to my Department are broken down in line with the city and county child care committee structures.  Accordingly, the figures relating to the Dublin 15 postal district are part of the overall figure for the County of Fingal.  This figure indicates that five child care services were approved for funding for Fingal.  The total funding approved for these groups amounts to €34,098.  The successful applications were those that represented the most complete, coherent, precise and compelling cases for funding.  The investment has been directed, to the greatest extent possible, to addressing the most urgent works and supporting the quality of services making the greatest impact for disadvantaged children and communities.  All applicants were notified by Pobal of the outcome.  The Pobal website provides a facility for unsuccessful applicants to request by call-back information to assist them in understanding the reasons for the outcome of their applications.</p>

            <p eId="para_6769">The maximum grant available was €50,000 (including VAT).  The aim of the funding is to provide support to child care settings to address remedial, maintenance and renovation work or to purchase equipment.  The programme, which was administered by Pobal on behalf of my Department,is a national programme and there was no geographical basis to the appraisal process.  Each application was competing on its own merits with every other application received.  In appraising the applications, particular consideration was given to Applications accompanied by a HSE pre-school inspection report supporting the need for the proposed works in terms of compliance with the Pre-School Regulations; Applications best demonstrating the need for the proposed works in terms, for example, of quality improvement to the child care service; Services previously funded under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme or the National Childcare Investment Programme; Services located in or servicing areas of disadvantage; and the service's record in relation to adherence to contractual obligations under previous capital and current funding programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6770">Following a robust appraisal of all applications received, 290 applications were approved for funding with the average amount approved being €21,000.  Of the total number of applications approved 125 were from private child care facilities.

All applicants were notified by Pobal of the outcome and the Pobal website provides a facility for unsuccessful applicants to request by call-back, information to assist them in understanding the reasons for the outcome of their applications.  I wish to point out to the Deputy that being in receipt of previous capital funding under the child care support programmes was only one element of the criteria considered when assessing the eligibility of applicants for grant support under this programme.  The reason it was included was to safeguard the substantial investment already made by the State in child care infrastructure.  The overall aim of the programme was to ensure that child care services were in a position to remain open and to deliver quality childhood care and education as required under the child care programmes.</p>

As part of this, the Government is committed to introducing Universal GP Care within its first term of office.  Primary legislation is required to give effect to this commitment.  The Department of Health is drafting legislation to provide for the phased introduction of a universal GP service without fees in line with the commitment set out in the Programme for Government.  Initially, it is intended to extend GP cover without fees to people with certain long-term illnesses.  It is my intention to have the Bill published and enacted before the summer recess.</p>

            <p eId="para_6886">While there are no plans to consider a regulatory licensing system, the approach adopted by the HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme on this issue is, among other things, to further raise the public profile of State-funded crisis pregnancy services.  In this regard, the Programme is working on a wide range of actions that include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6887">continuous promotion through the "Positive Options" campaign of the availability of free, non-judgemental and confidential State-funded crisis pregnancy counselling services.  This campaign has been very effective in disseminating information on State-funded services.  For example, statistics show that in 2011 72% of the target audience could recall the TV advertising.  The website for this campaign<i>positiveoptions.ie</i> received 68,483 visits in 2011, an increase of 37% compared with 2010, and 9,055 text messages were received requesting crisis pregnancy counselling information; </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6888">Section on the "Positive Options" website to highlight the actions of disingenuous agencies and to give guidance on how to deal with same. This section outlines the tactics used by agencies with a hidden agenda; provides questions for people to ask before they make an appointment to assess the nature of the service being provided; gives guidance on what to do during a session if people feel they are being pressurised or influenced; and provides a mechanism for people to make contact with a State-funded service or other<i>bona fide </i>service; </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6889">Prominent advertising of "Positive Options" in the Golden Pages, including the regional directories, under "Pregnancy Testing and Counselling" and "Family Planning" sections.  The use of a common logo for all State-funded counselling services in current editions of the Directories;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6890">Funding of resources which provide clear objective information on the adoption process.  The Programme provides information on adoption in manuals used in the training of<i>bona fide </i>crisis pregnancy counsellors; </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6891">expansion of crisis pregnancy counselling services nationally by over 50% since the Programme was established in 2001;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6892">Collation of data through State funded crisis pregnancy counselling services in relation to the level of incidence of clients attending their services who have reported previous contact with a "disingenuous" counselling service;</p>

            <p eId="para_6897">A number of clinical programmes to manage the care of people living with long term conditions have been developed by the HSE.  These include programmes for cardiovascular disease (Acute Coronary Syndrome, Heart Failure and Stroke), respiratory disease (Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)), diabetes, cancer and primary care.  Focusing on these existing programmes will be the Chronic Disease Prevention Programme which has recently established by the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_6898">The Chronic Disease Prevention Programme is proposing to concentrate on three suggested key areas as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6899">Ensure that people at known high risk of recurrence of illness or death through CVD, diabetes, respiratory or cancer conditions, receive an evidence-based programme of care in primary care and hospital.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6900">To detect people not previously identified with risk factors which place them at high risk of illness or death. These may be risk factors common to cardiovascular, diabetes, respiratory, and cancer, and initiate an evidence-based programme of care in primary care and, to a lesser extent, in hospital.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6901">To address the high population burden of risk factors for chronic disease in Ireland through measures open to the HSE and also in association with other stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_6902">In addition a current priority for my Department is the development of a national plan in relation to the issue of rare diseases. EU proposals on rare disease, which Ireland fully supports, recommended the development of plans or strategies preferably by the end of 2013.  We are now well advanced in developing this work.</p>
            <p eId="para_6903">In April 2011, I established a National Steering Group to develop a policy framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of rare diseases based on the principles of high quality care, equity and to be patient centred.</p>
            <p eId="para_6904">An integral part of an effective policy framework will be the development of a dedicated HSE clinical programme which the HSE has agreed to establish.  I understand that arrangements are currently being made by the HSE to put in place management and clinical leads for the new National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases.</p>
            <p eId="para_6905">The steering group is also consulting with stakeholders in preparation for the final phase of the plan's development.  A consultation day was held yesterday and an online survey facility is available on the HSE's website for the next five weeks. I expect the plan to be submitted to me later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_6907">The Report of the National Advisory Committee on Palliative Care (2001) published in 2001, highlighted the need for a review of children's palliative care services.  A Palliative Care Needs Assessment for Children was undertaken and the results published in 2005.  The findings of the needs assessment in Ireland were consistent with those undertaken in other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_6908">A key finding of the assessment was that the preferred location for caring for children with life limiting conditions is the family home, with parents receiving adequate professional support.  Following on from the Report, ‘Palliative Care for Children with Life-Limiting Conditions' — A National Policy was launched in March 2010.  Ultimately, this policy aims to ensure that all children with life-limiting conditions will have the choice and opportunity to be cared for at home. In line with the key findings of the Palliative Care Needs Assessment for Children, this policy prioritises community based care for palliative children.</p>
            <p eId="para_6909">The priorities for Palliative Care for this year are as set out in the agreed HSE Service Plan 2012.  As the specific issue raised by the Deputy is, in the first instance, a matter for the HSE, I have referred the question to the Executive for direct reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_6938">I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including the management of referrals from GPs by hospitals. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</p>
            <p eId="para_6939">As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.

            <p eId="para_6983">The Forum on Fluoridation advised in 2002 that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which was established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_6984">The Expert Body confirms that, based on the review of all previous and current international and national scientific data, the balance of this scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be effective for protecting the oral health of all age groups. The EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), published its ‘Opinion on critical review of any new evidence on the hazard profile, health effects, and human exposure to fluoride and the fluoridating agents of drinking water' in May 2011.  The main conclusions of the SCHER report are that there are no known health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU. There is also extensive evidence in Ireland from a series of national, regional and cross-border studies conducted between 1984 and 2006 that fluoridated drinking water substantially improves the dental health of children and adults.</p>
            <p eId="para_6985">My Department has no plans to conduct a cost benefit analysis on the policy of fluoridation. Policy on this issue is guided by international studies, which indicate that the cost of water fluoridation is a small fraction of the savings in dental treatment costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_7006">I take it that the Deputy is referring to Dr. Martin Connor, who has been appointed to provide expert advice to the Department of Health and, in particular, the chief operations officer of the SDU. Dr. Connor's appointment is for a period of three years, commencing in December 2011 and ending in December 2014, and which appointment follows on from a successful earlier appointment for a period of six months in 2011. Specifically, Dr. Connor has been engaged to provide expert advice and research analysis in relation to:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7007">the development of a new monthly performance management and improvement process;</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7010">the development of management information and escalation systems and processes to align activity and performance of the health system with policy priorities;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7011">the achievement, on a phased basis, of a 6-hour ‘patient experience time' in unscheduled (emergency) care;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7012">improvement in processes for timely and equitable access to outpatient services;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7013">gradual reductions in the waiting times for scheduled (elective) inpatient treatment;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_7014">related areas, such as the development of hospital trusts, social care networks and primary care integration.</p>
            <p eId="para_7015">The advices and analysis provided by Dr. Connor and taken into account by the SDU have already shown significant results: by the end of 2011, very significant progress had been made on SDU initiatives on unscheduled care in emergency departments (EDs); the cumulative number of patients waiting on trolleys was 27% lower than in the previous year. This reduction has continued and the first four months of 2012 show a reduction by 17% overall in the numbers of people on trolleys in EDs in the first four months of 2012, compared to the first four months of 2011. In regard to scheduled care, at the end of 2011 all hospitals with the exception of Galway/Merlin Park had achieved the 12 month maximum waiting time target set by the Minister in July 2011. At the end of May 2012, a total of 203 patients were waiting in excess of 12 months, a reduction of 78% since January 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_7016">Dr. Connor is a renowned international expert, with a proven record in health service transformation.  I believe that he has the exceptional knowledge and skills needed to guide the Special Delivery Unit in the next phases of its work and to assist it in successfully meeting the complex challenges that lie ahead in improving performance and building capacity in the healthcare system.</p>

            <p eId="para_7024">The Forum on Fluoridation, which was established by the Minister for Health and Children in 2000, advised in 2002 that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which was established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.  The Expert Body advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups. I have no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation of public water supplies, which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_7100">The revised eyesight standards introduced in 2010 were not determined by the Road Safety Authority.  They were introduced through the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2010 (S.I. No. 544 of 2010) which, in turn, represent the transposition into Irish law of European legislation, and specifically of Council Directives 112 and 113 of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_7101">The Directives in question set different standards, including standards for monocular vision, for two groups of licence classes.  In the first group — categories A1, A, B, EB, M or W — a competent medical authority must certify that monocular vision has existed for sufficiently long to allow adaptation, and that the field of vision in the eye meets the requirement.   After recent loss of vision in one eye, there should be an appropriate adaptation period of a minimum of 6 months, during which driving is not allowed. After this period, driving is only allowed following a favourable opinion from vision experts.</p>
            <p eId="para_7102">For the second group of licences — categories C1, C, D1, D, EC1, EC, ED1 or ED — after substantial loss of vision in one eye, there should be an appropriate adaptation period of a minimum of six months during which the subject is not allowed to drive. After this period, driving is only allowed after a favourable opinion from vision experts.</p>
            <p eId="para_7103">The Irish Regulations for both groups follow the requirements of EU legislation.  Where an individual has had sufficient time to adapt to monocular vision, they should have no difficulty in receiving the appropriate certification from a qualified practitioner.  However, they would need to receive such certification rather than carrying it over from a previous licence.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Alan Kelly)</from>
            <p eId="para_7118">I established the National Integrated Rural Transport Committee (NIRTC) last April to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport. The Committee which is chaired by the National Transport Authority, is drawn from organisations representing key stakeholders inlcuding rural transport groups, the HSE, Pobal, Local Authorities, Bus Éireann and policy makers from relevant Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_7119">Since its establishment the Committee has been meeting monthly to ensure momentum is maintained in addressing the many complexities associated with local and rural transport service provision. The structure of RTP Groups, the nature of local and RTP operations and the extent of HSE and school transport services varies across different areas. Consequently, the NIRTC has established sub-groups to examine the four key areas of health related transport services, school transport services, logistics e.g. trip-booking systems, ticketing, information, and appropriate structures to support integration. The sub-groups are, where appropriate, involving other stakeholders in their work and are seeking input from relevant sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_7120">A key aspect of the work of the sub-groups will be to identify constraints or high level impediements to integrated local and rural transport, along with recommendations on how these should be managed or overcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_7121">The output from the sub-groups will also inform the design of the model areas which are to be developed. These model areas will, with an evidence based approach, test how integrated local and rural transport services can best operate to achieve greater synergies, better meet identified transport needs and deliver increased value for money for the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_7122">This new approach which is endorsed by Government is the first time that a national focus and coherence has been brought to the delivery of an integrated rural transport service. This reflects the importance that the Government attaches to the contribution that a carefully designed and efficient rural transport service based on local needs, will make to overcoming social exclusion in rural areas.</p>
