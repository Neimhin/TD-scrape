        <heading>Exploring Education and Overcoming Social Disconnection: Discussion with Minister for Education and Skills<recordedTime time="2013-05-30T10:30:00+01:00"/></heading>

          <p eId="para_11">As we have a quorum we will commence in public session. Apologies have been received from Deputies Regina Doherty, Seán Crowe, and Joe O'Reilly.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> I remind members of the usual drill regarding mobile telephones. I ask that they switch them off or put them on silent mode.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> We will have a discussion with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, to explore education as a tool for empowerment and overcoming social disconnection. In layman or laywoman terms, that means we will have a good conversation about education and how we can learn and share experiences in terms of tackling disadvantage. The Minister will give account initially and then I will open up the discussion to the members. </p>
          <p eId="para_14"> The Minister is very welcome. It is his first time to attend before this committee. We appreciate him coming here and giving of his time. We hope to have a good engaging conversation this morning. His presence here today has garnered considerable interest in this discussion. I appreciate the attendance of members from different organisations and individuals in the Visitors Gallery who have come here today. </p>
          <p eId="para_15"> I will throw out a statistic that would be in the back of everybody's mind, namely, that of all the students who go to university in the Republic, only 0.5% are from Northern Ireland. That 0.5% statistic from 2008 has been a recurring one. There are issues around mobility, mobility challenges and mobility opportunities into which we will hopefully delve today.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> I invite the Member to make his presentation and I will then open the discussion up to members.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)<recordedTime time="2013-05-30T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_17">I thank Chairman and committee members. I will speak to the paper I have prepared, which has been circulated, and go down through the headings rather than read it formally into the record, but I presume it can be taken as being read formally into the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> The first issue is literacy and numeracy. In 2009, this State got a wake up call in regard to our presumption that we had one of the best education systems in the world. It was a presumption that was based on an internal form of arrogance because we had nothing with which to compare it. It was a case of if one says it often enough, one begins to believe it. We dropped from fifth place to seventeenth place. We had a similar but not as precipitous a drop in terms of mathematics. The Department got word of it in August, did some research and when the results were published in October, it had started to create a response. There was a change of government in March 2011. A draft literacy and numeracy strategy was prepared and it was finalised and formally launched by me in June of that year. It is appropriate to say to this committee that much of the reform and change in the system, and I can get details on this if people want it, was based on some of the experience in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Department of Education had started to reform the way in which it was teaching literacy and numeracy. There is very close co-operation between the inspectorate in the North and in the South. There is co-operation with Wales and Scotland as well because they have separate education systems under devolution. We have now put in place a literacy and numeracy strategy on which we will probably get some results later this year because we are into the new cycle. I would be happy to answer any questions on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> One of the changes we made in the context of the literacy and numeracy strategy is around initial teacher education, and this is confirmed in a document that will be published later today. We have had 19 centres of teacher education for both primary and post-primary in the country. We realised that there needed to be a change in the way teachers were educated. The changes, which I can speak to in detail, are, in summary, that the 19 colleges - most of them privately owned by the Catholic Church or the Church of Ireland which reflects the history, our system of primary education being 182 years old having been established in 1831 - are being reorganised into six clusters of education provision. A primary school teacher will now study for four years rather than three years. The fourth year will be focused very much on pedagogic skills, namely, learning how children learn.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">The post-primary secondary school teacher will now do a two year H.Dip course rather than the one year course, and again there is an emphasis on the way people learn, learning techniques and so on. I can go into the detail on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> I have already referred to PISA. There are two other literacy testings - TIMSS and PIRLS - in which we have participated. The results of the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study, known as PIRLS, and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, TIMSS, are very positive from our primary school point of view. Primary school students scored above average in literacy, mathematics and science. In mathematics, Ireland was placed 17th out of 50 participating countries, and in science we were placed 22nd out of 50 participating countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> The PIRLS report shows that in reading, Irish students were ranked tenth out of 45 participating countries. Students in only five countries performed significantly better than Irish students. They were Hong Kong, Finland, Singapore, the Russian Federation, and Northern Ireland. As I said, we are learning from our colleagues in Northern Ireland the way they have been able to improve their performance, and there is very good co-operation between both systems at institutional and ministerial level between myself and John O'Dowd, and also at a personal level in terms of individuals on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> The second aspect I want to discuss is the change in our junior certificate. The most significant development is our plan to reform the post-primary junior cycle for children from ages 12 and 13 to 15 and 16 in our secondary system. The framework published in October 2012 sets out the principal statements of learning and key skills that will underpin the new junior cycle. </p>
          <p eId="para_24"> We have concerns about the literacy and numeracy standards achieved by students. Consequently, the key tenants of the literacy and numeracy strategy are integrated within and complement the framework. The framework is designed to provide schools with flexibility rather than restrict them as they develop a junior cycle programme that reflects the educational and personal needs of their students.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> In addition to its own range of literacy initiatives provided through the school system, the Department has had some involvement in the prevention and early intervention programme in Dublin through the work of the Department's inspectorate. These projects, undertaken in Tallaght, Ballymun and Darndale, involve a range of pilot programmes to improve outcomes in areas such as literacy, speech and language, parenting, health and pro-social behaviour. The projects, which are now concluding, are currently being evaluated by national and international experts.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> In Tallaght west,<i>
						</i>the emphasis was to ensure that the initiatives complemented existing education disadvantage initiatives. In Youngballymun,<i>
						</i>the Department participated in the Write Minded Implementation Team, which, in partnership with local schools and other key stakeholders, developed a local literacy strategy which focused on two strands: school-based literacy support to complement Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, and family and community-based literacy support. Overall, the principal strength of the Youngballymun interventions is that they built on and enhanced the work of existing mainstream services in an integrated manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> The Department has also participated in a number of education-related initiatives to support Limerick Regeneration. These have largely been run by the Programme Innovation Development Fund, which is a joint initiative of Government and Atlantic Philanthropies, and Strategic Innovation in Education, a project set up by the University of Limerick to support the education sector in responding to Limerick Regeneration.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> My colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, recently announced a new area-based poverty initiative, which will be jointly funded by her Department and Atlantic Philanthropies, and will seek to implement programmes which have been proven to work in improving outcomes for children and families at risk of disadvantage. The new initiative reflects the programme for Government commitment to adopt an area-based approach to child poverty in co-operation with philanthropic partners, drawing upon best international practice and existing services, to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> In the context of the literacy and numeracy strategy, it is particularly important that learning from previous and current literacy initiatives being delivered in schools can be mainstreamed to ensure the widest possible benefit from the considerable investment that has been made. </p>
          <p eId="para_30"> It is important to note that in all cases PEIP literacy initiatives are being implemented locally alongside schools which are part of DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, the Government's main policy initiative for tackling educational disadvantage. This means that they can all avail of the considerable additional resources allocated to DEIS schools in those areas where disadvantage is most concentrated. Smaller classes and support programmes, one of which is the home-school-community liaison officer, usually a teacher, who makes contact with families that are having difficulty of one kind or another. The other is the school completion programme, which is an attempt to ensure young people stay in school for as long as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> We believe it is important that we operate an inclusive school system where all children feel welcome. The Education Act 1998 sets out clearly that schools are required to operate admissions policies that provide for maximum accessibility to the school. Most schools in Ireland, most of the time, are inclusive and welcoming of all children. The Education Act, however, is light touch in terms of providing ways and means of ensuring that all schools welcome all children. Other than appeals under section 29 of that Act, which have become cumbersome and often adversarial both for schools and parents, the Department is of the view, and I share the view, that the current legislation does not include an adequate set of provisions to deal with this matter, which is the reason we will change the system. I will shortly bring to Government the draft heads of a Bill entitled the education (admission to school) Bill 2013. In bringing forward legislative proposals, I do not want to unnecessarily intrude into the way schools do their business. The aim is to ensure that schools decide on applications for enrolment in a structured, fair and transparent manner. The proposals will be published in draft form along with the statutory instruments to give them effect. They will be referred to the Oireachtas committee here. I hope to have a fairly comprehensive debate and then bring back the final proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> Turning to North-South co-operation, specifically on literacy and numeracy, I am pleased to note the ongoing dialogue which takes place here under the auspices of the Good Friday Agreement between the education authorities in both jurisdictions on a range of issues of mutual interest, but particularly in relation to measures to improve educational outcomes in our schools. In particular, I note that the last meeting of the North-South Literacy and Numeracy Working Group<b>
						</b>discussed the prospect of a joint report by the two inspectorates, focusing on best practice in both literacy and numeracy in post-primary settings.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> Encouraging an appreciation of the value of learning is a key task for all of us who are interested in raising educational standards. Last year's promotional media campaign in Northern Ireland - Get Involved Because Education Works - emphasised the fact that education does not begin or end at the school gate and that families and the wider community can contribute to and enjoy education.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> A current initiative in this jurisdiction is "The Family Project", a weekly television programme which showcases the educational tools and techniques available to all families. It demonstrates how families can work together to improve collective learning. Since 2000, the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, has been using the mass medium of television to highlight literacy issues, outline supports that are available, motivate people to return to education and provide opportunities for learning in the privacy of their own home. NALA has also developed a website to help parents support their children's education. Entitled Help My Kid Learn, it is a website where people can see that supporting a child's literacy and numeracy development is a natural, easy and fun activity that can be integrated into any part of their day.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> Although there are a number of marked differences between our education systems, we face similar challenges North and South when it comes to raising standards, particularly in the area of literacy, and I believe that we have much to gain from a sharing of learning and experience in order to develop sound policies for future action in this important area.</p>

          <p eId="para_37">I thank the Minister for the overview he has given on education.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">On the proposed four-year primary teacher training course, I have spoken to some students who are looking forward to it. However, this means there will be a gap in a particular year when no students will emerge from the teacher training colleges. If I recall correctly, this happened previously when the teacher training course was lengthened from two to three years. Certain issues arose and teachers who wished to retire were persuaded to stay on for another year. Has the Minister thought this through in the context of the teacher training courses at Hibernia College and whether there might be more students on such courses? As I understand it, the Department of Education and Skills is aware of how many primary school teachers emerge from the colleges each year. Consequently, it is possible to control the numbers, unlike, for example, second level teacher training. Has the Minister given consideration to what might be done if there is a shortage of teachers? This certainly happened in the past when we moved from a two to a three year course. However, my understanding is that students are looking forward to the extended course.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> The Minister has also mentioned the number of teacher training centres which he is talking about reducing. What is the final figure? Can he give members further information in that regard?</p>

          <p eId="para_41">While I am on the issue of teachers, the practice of appointing or retaining teachers on the basis of enrolment levels in the previous September has been followed for years. Has the Minister given consideration to it? As members are discussing North-South bodies today, does this happen in the North or in any other European country? Obviously, difficulties arise when enrolment increases in a school, but teachers are still being appointed or retained on the basis of old figures which obviously are out of date. </p>
          <p eId="para_42"> I refer to the panels which I gather are still based on the diocesan system. There appear to be many issues where people cannot transfer from one diocese to another. A person could live in one diocese while teaching in another and could find himself or herself, when on a panel, being obliged to travel long distances. While the panel system is good from the perspective of job security, it is not very good if one is obliged to travel very long distances to the next school.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">I have two questions for the Minister. First, on the area-based rural initiative to tackle child poverty, will this be based in DEIS areas or will it be expanded to cater for other areas also? On the point as to whether an inclusive school system is operated, most schools in Ireland most of the time are inclusive and welcoming of all children. Obviously, the system has been tested, probably by parents and schools. Will the Minister outline incidents that give a flavour of where problems actually arise and what precisely does he intend to do about it?</p>

          <p eId="para_45">The Chairman should try to ensure my answers are short, as I have a tendency to go on a bit. </p>
          <p eId="para_46"> To answer Deputy Kitt's question, we do not expect that there will be a gap. Some teacher unions have complained about the number who are qualifying as teachers or applying to undertake a transfer degree course. For example, someone with an arts degree can apply to take the conversion course to become a qualified and recognised primary school teacher. It is one profession which is in short supply worldwide. Irish people are particularly well suited, for example, to teaching in the United Kingdom and the south of England has a massive crisis in the provision of both primary school places and teachers. Sadly, the same situation does not obtain across the rest of United Kingdom, but there is a shortage of teachers. Consequently, we cannot stop people from doing these courses. We can limit the supply in the public sector, but as of now, we do not anticipate, on the basis of what we can foresee, that there will be a crisis in the gap to which the Deputy referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> In respect of the enrolment numbers and the payment of schools, I have just come from a new school that is opening in Swords, where people were complaining about the problem they had experienced. When the school started, it had 24 pupils, but it now has 224. However, it is being paid a capitation grant based on last year's enrolment figure - just 100 pupils. I am told the reason the system was put in place was that when the primary school system was, in population terms, declining, it was a way of providing some stability within the school system. The White Paper published in the mid-1990s by a previous Minister for Education, Niamh Breathnach, stated the big challenge facing the primary school system was managing decline. It was then thought we would be losing population in schools. At the time, there were just under 500,000 pupils, but we now have 520,000 and rising. There will be 70,000 additional primary and post-primary kids in the system within the next seven or eight years. It is a cash-flow problem for some schools and as we are in straitened economic circumstances, I do not have much room for manoeuvre. However, I recognise this is a major challenge for rapidly growing schools and it will become an even greater challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> On the panel system and the diocesan structure, I share the Deputy's view. We would like the Catholic authorities to modernise their system of allocating school teachers and resources and some progress has been made in this regard. The Deputy's family has made a great contribution to the world of education and I am merely telling him things he knows well, but, in effect, we have a public private partnership system of education which, as I stated, dates back to 1831. In a sense, the State undertook to pay the salaries of teachers, set the curriculum and provide for the examination process, while the partner on the private side, namely, the patron, provided the premises, either completely or partially in the form of a site, as well as providing the board of management and for supervision. The patron became the employer that ran the school. That was a 32 county system which, by and large, is still in place and essentially has not changed. We had a primary school examination at the end of sixth class which I think - Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin should help me - was abolished in 1967.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">It was a long way back.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> On Deputy Frank Feighan's question about the area-based initiative, I am not entirely sure and must revert to him to ensure greater clarity. While there is an application process, I do not have the details to hand, but I will forward them to him. </p>
          <p eId="para_52"> On the reference to inclusive schools and the reason for the enrolment policy measures I have discussed, we have three kinds of post-primary school, namely, VEC schools, community colleges of one kind or another and the traditional free voluntary schools, as they are known in the jargon and which, by and large, have been run by the religious teaching orders. The community schools evolved from a situation in which, typically, a town had the brothers at one end, the sisters at the other and a technical school in the middle. The three schools then came together and are now funded by the State. However, they are independent of the VECs, although there is an involvement with them and their structures can vary.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> The National Council for Special Education has recently published a report with a new set of 28 recommendations which I received on 17 May. Having spoken to parents of children with special needs, the council found they encountered a kind of soft barrier, where schools would decline to enrol such pupils, even though they had space for them. A school would suggest to the parents that it thought the VEC school down the road would be better equipped to meet the challenges the child would present. Alternatively, schools would claim they did not necessarily have all the requisite resources or state they would not take in the child in question without an undertaking from the Department of Education and Skills that a full grant would be given. One must be careful in how one decodes all of this because one is not sure one is getting the code right, but part of it is that schools compete for pupils in parts of the country. They compete on the basis of their school examination results and it is suggested they may do this if they consider that taking in such a pupil will require more time and will not necessarily enhance the academic performance of the school at junior cycle in the junior certificate examination.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">We do not have proof positive but we know that the number of appeals under section 29 for non-admission to a school have risen exponentially, are costly and take up a great deal of teachers' time in July and August. That is the reference to that.</p>

I am aware that there is a slight disjoint in terms of the two Departments because in the South, the Minister covers first, second and third and in the North, the Department of Education covers first and second and the Department of Employment and Learning covers third level, although the proposed restructuring of the Assembly and the Executive might well resolve that. I would be concerned that a joint survey which was ready in January of this year was to be taken at the February meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, but they did not get round to that. It is now scheduled to be taken at the October meeting. I seek reassurance that there would be no further slippage on that report being dealt with.</p>

          <p eId="para_59"> Second, I understand that the universities in the South are independent and, therefore, the Minister can have influence but not necessarily control. The recognition of A level qualifications of the North in the system in the South needs to be resolved so that we have a broad understanding of how it works. There are some specifics that keep being raised in our constituency offices which we find difficult to deal with.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> Third, there is a programme of promoting Southern institutions in the schools in the North and we hope to build on that. I am not aware of any such programme in the South promoting the two universities in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> Finally, and this may be anecdotal rather than survey based, the education systems on these islands are broadly rated as follows: Scotland is the best, the South is the second best, the North is the third, Wales is the fourth and England is the bottom of the heap. In his introductory remarks, the Minister spoke of dropping from fifth to seventeenth place and the efforts needed to move both North and South further up that list.</p>

Has the idea of co-operation on access to schools on both sides of the Border been mooted? Some travel from North to South and <i>vice versa</i>, but the numbers are small.

          <p eId="para_67">I thank the Minister for his presentation.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> First, following on from what Pat Doherty stated regarding recognition of A levels from the North, I do not accept that is a contributing factor explaining he low entrance rate from the North in third level here. I think the rate is 0.5% or 0.6%. It is a mitigating factor in building a harmonious and all-island aspect to our education policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> Getting back to the Twenty-six Counties, I would concur with the Minister who linked child poverty, regeneration and educational disadvantage. Where there is economic disadvantage, there is educational disadvantage and a lack of early intervention which is vitally necessary. Is there any cognisance given to the need for an enhanced programme of lowering the pupil-teacher ratio, particularly in the most disadvantaged areas, for a child who is born in economic circumstances outside his or her control?</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> I have one other questions relating to the Six Counties. I strongly believe in de-sectarianising the institution of education. The power that various church groups have over education is grotesque.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> Regarding a forward management plan on education in an all-island capacity, has any progress been made towards moving in that direction?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_19" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills">
          <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn<recordedTime time="2013-05-30T11:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_72">I welcome Pat Doherty. We go back a bit in time.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> The joint survey to which he refers was an initiative proposed by my Northern counterpart, Mr. John O'Dowd, MLA, and it responds to some of the matters about which Deputy Smith asked. There was an initial resistance from the Unionist side in Northern Ireland to it but I fully supported it. We undertook a survey of parents on either side of the Border, at 20 km for post-primary and at 10 km for primary, to see whether there was an interest in doing exactly what Deputy Smith stated, to offer parents, because of the arbitrary nature of the Border, the ability to send their child to a school of their choice on the other side of the Border if that is what they wanted. Frankly, the results were less than promising. I would like to offer it and see it happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> I can link that matter to Deputy Smith's second question, which was about the small schools. It would be a way in which we could sustain the viability of small schools in rural areas, by allowing children from, for example, the reformed church tradition in the South to travel to reformed church schools in the North and vice versa. Perhaps residents in the North, if there was a gaelscoil south of the Border, would be able to access that. The principle is removing any barrier that exists and then enabling parents to simply make that choice themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> As Deputy Ferris referred to it, I will be trying to move this at the October meeting, which will be held in Armagh, to try to advance it. It is not threatening. We had to assure people that it was not some kind of hidden agenda and it was only to facilitate parents. We are doing it pragmatically in the area of health. Altnagelvin Hospital, for example, regularly accepts patients from across the Border. I cannot see any difficulty. If the parents are left in charge and if they want to make the choice to send their child in any direction, then it is a matter that should be facilitated rather than prevented.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> The question of the A levels is a problem. The Central Applications Office, CAO, system in the South, which is the college admissions office, is owned and controlled by the seven universities. It was set up in the late 1980s or early 1990s. They have offered participation to all of the other educational institutions, including Griffith College which is a private college, so that pupils finishing second-level school fill out their CAO form in the months of January and February.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">The CAO grades leaving certificate results alphabetically according to the grades A1, A2, etc., and it is according to these grades that points are awarded. We have referred the matter in question to the CAO already. It was referred by a North-South enterprise working party because complaints were made in the North about the fact that an A* is not being accorded the value it should get in the CAO form. I will be raising this with the CAO again. We are talking about transitions to determine whether there can be an increase in the value. We are being told by Northern Irish students that the full value of their educational achievement is not being properly recognised by the CAO system in the South. Hence, there is a very low take-up. There are many more southerners going to study in the North than there are northerners coming to the South. It is claimed this is one of the factors responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> Deputy Smith raised the question of a common curriculum. There are no proposals on this at present and none has been suggested.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> With regard to skills shortages and co-operation, I am publishing today my response to the Higher Education Authority's survey of third level educational institutions' reformation. There is a reference therein to better co-operation between the North and South in the area of third level provision and access. The next phase of the overall study will show that we need to achieve better value for money, eliminate duplication and waste within the system and have better co-operation between colleges within the South. However, I would like to see better co-operation between colleges on an east–west basis also. I hope that will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> Deputy Ferris referred to child poverty. It hardly comes as a surprise that all the studies point to the fact that deprivation in the home contributes significantly to deprivation in educational achievement. By the time many young people go to primary school, they carry disadvantage into the classroom. The DEIS programme, which has been in operation for some years, is an attempt to deal with this by giving extra resources to the affected schools and by having a more favourable allocation of teachers per pupil than is the norm. The schools are inspected in a different way from others. They must prepare educational programmes. In many cases, they do achieve good outcomes relative to their starting point.</p>
          <p eId="para_81"> At a recent ESRI conference I attended, reference was made to improving the quality of the preschool ECCE year. I acknowledge we are discussing this in the context of the controversy over a crèche. I hope that, in the context of SOLAS, the body replacing FÁS in the field of further education, money can be spent on upskilling people who work in preschool year facilities to level 5 on our national framework of qualifications. The objective is to improve the quality of preschool education. This is not to be confused with the minding of children for parents at work. The latter is a different phenomenon.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> I believe I have answered all the questions. If I have not answered one, I apologise.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">I thank the Minister for attending. One reason I was looking forward to this conversation was that, in the northern context, we believed this committee could determine how it could be of benefit in the educational sphere. The Minister has touched on many of the issues already. When analysing some of the areas we have been to and some of the issues that underpin sectarian tensions in the North with a view to overcoming them, education arose time and again as the great liberator, the one thing that will help youths and others who have experienced conflict to bounce back, regardless of their circumstances. How can we be of benefit to the institutions in the North? Can we share experiences, particularly regarding educational disadvantage? Conflict tends to happen in areas of social and economic deprivation and tends to be something that poorer people engage in. Particularly in the North, victims have tended to be from a lower socioeconomic status.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> Will the Minister elaborate on literacy, oral language skills, numeracy and the area-based strategies that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is trying to roll out in the South? I wish to ask about the capacity to share experience in respect of areas of the North that are mirrored in the South, and areas where there is deeply entrenched disadvantage. We must examine the capacity to empower parents. The problem with schooling is that children do not live in schools. There is a limit to what a teacher and a school can achieve in giving children basic skills to survive in life. It is a question of empowering parents also. The tragedy with the Irish education system, both in the North and South, is that schools are used as an enforcer of identity, not just as educational institutions. Children are sent to a particular school because it espouses the identity with which their parents feel most comfortable. Parents feel their child's identity can be enhanced in the school, and this is almost the priority. We have had an interesting discussion on the motivation of Catholic and Protestant parents in respect of their children. There is deep suspicion regarding integrated schooling. I noted this on both sides of the divide in the North. I found this interesting because, from the outside, integrated schooling might appear to be an obvious move to make. In the North, it is not as popular. What capacity have we to share experiences? What can we learn from what is happening in the schools system and wider community in Northern Ireland? The Minister referred to the preschool experience. How can we learn from the Northern Ireland experience?</p>

          <p eId="para_85">This follows on from the debate we had in the Seanad yesterday. I really welcome the Bill that is to come before the House on admissions policy. It will assure us of the existence of an open system for including people with special educational needs, those with different ethnic backgrounds and religions, and people who move to another area during the school year.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> With regard to the extension to the higher diploma for secondary school teachers and the four-year degree for primary school teachers, will there be more teacher training? Will it be more practical in effect? I hope it will be more practical rather than just a book-learning and rote-learning experience, which has been the case to date. I hope additional time will be devoted to concentrating solely on special educational needs such that teachers can be trained to teach pupils with a variety of needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> Coming from Dundalk and being well aware of the problems there, I draw the Minister's attention to the article by Andy Pollak, which I was given some days ago and which is contained in the notes. It is an excellent study on cross-Border mobility. Again, we return to the problem of recognition of qualifications, which others have raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">I would ask that institutes of technology, in particular, could be included in the UCAS system and listed in its directory.

          <p eId="para_92">I welcome the Minister and thank him for his presentation. It is very disappointing that since the Good Friday Agreement, the national strategy for higher education - particularly under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority - has not driven collaboration between North and South. The Minister should push the authority to drive that strategy and get the message out that we are in favour of collaboration.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> I would like to hear the Minister's opinion on pre-school education. Would it not be a good idea to attach pre-school education to the national school structure? I was involved in opening a pre-school in Athlone. The school principal had a free classroom and gave it to two ex-SNA teachers who had undertaken further education. It was a very satisfactory situation in that school building. </p>
          <p eId="para_94"> A new school that was opened a few years ago in County Monaghan has its own privately-run pre-school attached. The Minister knows the point I am making. Would it not be ideal if our pre-school education was in the same building and on the same format as the national school?

          <p eId="para_98">I agree with the Senator, but the legacy is of junior and senior infant classes at INTO rates of pay. That is the cost factor, to cut to the chase. I have just come back from a new school where there was capacity, and there is a not-for-profit pre-school in it. It is facilitating parents and it works.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> I would like to see co-operation on the history curriculum. We should get away from the kind of Celtic-Rangers controversy - where our victories are their defeats and <i>vice versa</i> - to a wider approach using modern media. The junior cycle reform will give students at that level a better opportunity to explore modules, particularly from Dundalk to Letterkenny where they are living in the reality of a cross-Border zone and know about this. It is something that I can see evolving.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> Because we are mainstreaming children with learning difficulties, teachers in training colleges will be introduced to a pedagogy of how different learners learn and particularly those with different kinds of disabilities. In that way, they will be aware of it. </p>
          <p eId="para_101"> As regards the H.Dip., I personally want to see a break in the umbilical cord system whereby a bright girl or boy goes to college and comes back to do their H.Dip. in a school and stays in that school. They consequently have no broad experience outside that very narrow path. It should be made a requirement before somebody can get into the system on a permanent basis, that they would have experience of teaching in two or three different types of school. </p>
          <p eId="para_102"> As regards the special access programmes, Trinity College in particular has a very good one. Students who do post-leaving certificate courses and examinations are better equipped to get into university if they come from a disadvantaged area and have not been in that narrow academic stream in the traditional leaving certificate class.</p>

          <from> Mr. Paul Hannigan<recordedTime time="2013-05-30T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_107">I thank the committee for its invitation to present to it today. Professor Terri Scott could not make it today as she is, coincidentally, speaking at a career guidance conference in Derry.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> The Good Friday Agreement placed emphasis on matters such as agriculture, transport, tourism and urban and rural development as areas for North-South co-operation and implementation. Education received only a single mention because of the profound complexity of the issues involved and the many sensitive subtexts in 1998. Despite the immense challenges that still lie ahead on the path to reconciliation, pluralism and mutual cultural respect, there is today much greater social and political maturity. Accordingly, the opportunity now exists to address North-South co-operation in higher education. Much has been achieved since April 1998 upon which we can now build.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> Higher education has mutually enriching objectives. It prepares participants for the employment marketplace, contributes to job creation and economic prosperity through research and technology and knowledge transfer and helps to contribute to social stability by imbuing participants with civic values and awareness of the responsibilities of citizenship. Across the two jurisdictions, there are now many opportunities to give impetus to the aspirations of the Good Friday Agreement and to contribute to economic regeneration and competitiveness by greater co-operation and harmonisation of the higher education systems. This would help to articulate strand two of the Agreement which aims “to develop [areas of] consultation, co-operation and action within the island of Ireland”. Another and no less important legacy of greater occupational and student mobility would be a much higher awareness of what the Agreement refers to as shared “cultural identity and heritage”.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> Such mobility and harmonisation can only be achieved by taking practical steps to bring it about. This paper sets out some of the relevant issues. There is currently capacity in the institutes of technology sector. There is under-capacity in Northern Ireland, as it is the only one of the 13 regions in the United Kingdom that has a cap on higher education numbers. Each year, this forces many thousands of students from Northern Ireland to go to Great Britain with the additional costs to them and their parents, a situation exacerbated by the increase in fees. Although some go by choice, many are forced to go because of a perceived absence of opportunities North and South. Equally important, there is evidence that up to three quarters of such students do not return to Northern Ireland or the Republic to contribute their knowledge and skills to economic regeneration and social progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> The national strategy for higher education 2030, currently being implemented in Ireland, proposes to create a dynamic new globally competitive higher education system to the benefit of all participants. There is a misperception of the institutes of technology sector in Northern Ireland due to the confusion caused by its name. Many potential participants are unaware that each of the 13 institutes of technology offers a wide programme of internationally recognised degrees and areas of study up to doctoral level. The Central Applications Office, CAO, entry mechanism needs reform because it disadvantages students coming from the North to the South. Careers guidance services in the North must also have a greater awareness of opportunities in institutes of technology in helping second level students to make informed choices.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> Online learning is an integral part of the future of higher education throughout the world. Not least of its benefits is that it allows access to higher education for many socially disadvantaged but talented students who cannot afford to study in traditional institutions. There is an urgent need not only to promote and facilitate access to online higher education but to incentivise students to study by virtual means. Sligo Institute of Technology has led the way in this growing means of provision and has the largest population of online students in the island. One means of encouraging greater student mobility would be the establishment of several scholarships and bursaries in fields of study of particular importance to developing an island-wide knowledge economy. This could begin in the Border counties where there exists an established tradition of graduates travelling from one jurisdiction to the other every day to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> The stated longer-term objective of higher education in both the North and the South is to create genuine and inclusive systems of lifelong learning. IT Sligo commissioned a scoping study to look at some of the issues underlying choice of location and participation in higher education North and South. To fully understand the opportunities for North-South co-operation and harmonisation, a much wider scoping study would need to be undertaken under the aegis of this committee to examine the factors acting upon student choice and mobility and to make appropriate recommendations. Its terms of reference must include the impact of demographic changes in the next decade upon capacity and participation in both jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> The Northern Ireland Assembly’s independent review of variable fees and student finance arrangements is also pertinent. Both sets of findings need to be part of the wider consideration. The establishment of a joint working group to create greater harmonisation within the two higher education systems North and South and to help break down the boundaries to island-wide higher student mobility would be a significant step forward. By such an initiative we could ensure existing capacity North and South is optimised and increased and that reciprocity and complementarity would characterise higher education North and South.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> The most recent work on undergraduate mobility North and South was completed by Andy Pollak and D’Arcy Smyth. The Higher Education Statistics Agency, HESA, in the UK and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, in Ireland collate data and provide analysis. Pollak identifies some conclusions regarding the obstacles to undergraduate mobility on a cross-Border basis. The underlying themes emerging from this research are a lack of information and clarity regarding recognition of qualifications and entitlements to financial support.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> The D’Arcy Smyth report concentrates more on the number of students moving between jurisdictions, with a particular focus on the financial barriers impacting upon them. It concludes with a number of suggestions for education policy with a particular focus on the impact of fee differentials on the movement of undergraduates. There are suggestions for pupils, parents, and guidance counsellors which are useful. The report suggests “a need for a new and substantial joint North-South initiative to co-operate and co-ordinate the responses of both jurisdictions to the likely changes in cross-Border third level study.”</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> Figures provided by Dr. Vivienne Patterson from the HEA identify the flow of students from North to South over the period 2007-2008 and 2011-2012. The number of undergraduate new entrants to higher education in the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland has stubbornly stayed at 0.5 % or below over that period. The actual number of entrants varied between 113 and 177 with 168 registered in 2011-2012. However, when the statistics are further investigated from 2007-2008 to 2010-2011, an average of 86% of new entrants went to Irish universities, with institutes of technology averaging 13%.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">There is a relatively consistent number of students from Northern Ireland going to high-points courses in TCD and UCD, with 82.5% of those attending university going to these two institutions. However, the year 2011-2012 shows some change, with this percentage dropping to 61%. In the same year, the combined entrants to Letterkenny IT, IT Sligo and Dundalk IT totalled 21%, almost twice as many as the previous year.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> The number of applications from the UK to Irish institutions decreased from 1,291 in 2012 to 1,159 in 2013, a decrease of 10.2%. Applications from Northern Ireland applicants showed an increase from 1,139 in 2012 to 1,223, an increase of 84. Overall, applications from the UK and Northern Ireland make up 3.3% of all applications in 2013, the same percentage as in 2012. Therefore, given these figures, it is unlikely to show any major change in undergraduate new entrants for 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> While there is an expectation among staff in each of the institutes in which we work that cross-Border mobility of undergraduates should be intuitive, it is obvious from the figures that this is not the case. Despite various initiatives by single institutions, the level of North-South mobility remains lower than one would expect between neighbouring jurisdictions. There is a necessity in Border areas to consider an institute's broader hinterland in the context of regional development and this requires strong political support. I will ask Mr. Cummins to take us through the recommendations.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">The institutes of technology at Dundalk, Letterkenny and Sligo are closest to the Border and have the greatest interest in improving student mobility, particularly from North to South. The three institutions are working in a co-ordinated way, have a number of recommendations to make and seek the support of this committee. I will quickly run through them.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> The three presidents of Dundalk IT, Letterkenny IT and IT Sligo recommend that the committee support the establishment of a North-South higher education joint working group. The purpose of the group will be to promote student mobility between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. In particular, the group will promote the following: providing improved co-ordination in respect of admission and progression opportunities for students on an all-island basis; increased student recruitment on a cross-Border basis; the establishment of a programme to facilitate cross-Border staff mobility programmes between higher education institutions; the monitoring of cross-Border student mobility programmes; ensuring the CAO system provides equitable treatment to students from Northern Ireland; facilitating better co-operation between careers services in the higher education institutions, particularly to promote job opportunities for graduates on a cross-Border basis; an annual conference targeted at second level guidance services on a cross-Border basis to promote greater awareness of the portfolio of courses available at higher education institutions on either side of the Border; and the establishment of a scholarship fund targeted at promoting cross-Border student mobility for students from low-income backgrounds.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2013-05-30T11:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_126">Like the Chairman, I welcome our visitors and very much welcome their presentation, which was good and concise and shows the potential for co-operation on an all-island basis. I welcome the recommendation for a North-South higher education joint working group. It is a proposal that we should be willing to vigorously support and pursue with the Higher Education Authority and the Minister for Education and Skills. I will add one particular bullet point for consideration - a proposal that we optimise existing capacity, to which Mr. Hannigan referred earlier in the presentation, and minimise course provision in the case of courses in niche areas with small numbers of students. There is no point in having a particular course in both the North and the South when it does not have a critical mass of students pursuing it. Given the challenging financial circumstances facing administrations North and South, we must optimise existing capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> One of my bugbears is the fact that we have good infrastructure, such as the different facilities in institutes of higher education and universities, lying idle for substantial parts of the year. We should be trying to derive benefit from this area on an year-round basis rather than on the basis of the academic year. </p>
          <p eId="para_128"> I warmly welcome the fact that the three institutes of technology in the Border area are working together. The witnesses mentioned that the Good Friday agreement had only a passing reference to education. Teagasc, which is an educational research institute authority here, has a close working relationship with its counterpart north of the Border, as have the two Departments. There is a lot of co-operation that is not specified or prescribed in formal agreements, but the Good Friday agreement was the backdrop to much of the increased co-operation between those institutions. Obviously, it is an area that needs to built upon. Representing two of the southern Border counties, we must be more outgoing and stronger advocates for Border regional development. If we do not utilise and maximise the potential of our third-level sector, we will not maximise the potential of our economies, North or South.</p>

          <from>Deputy Frank Feighan<recordedTime time="2013-05-30T11:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_129">I welcome the delegation and very much value its presentation, which was concise and informative. The aspirations of the Good Friday agreement with regard to education have not been followed through. I wonder what we were doing for the past ten or 15 years, because it reflected the economy of our island. We have capacity down here and there is a cap on education in Northern Ireland. We were just lazy. The colleges needed to look at a market that effectively was not there, and it has not been successful. However, we need to move on from there.</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> A total of 82.5% of Northern Ireland students attending colleges in the Republic of Ireland went to Trinity College Dublin and UCD. I do not think anybody needs to pat themselves on the back over this figure. If I was a student in Northern Ireland, Trinity College would be the Ivy League college to aim towards, so those figures are very much manipulated. I would like to know how many of those students attended Trinity College. I suspect the figure is much higher than that for UCD, although I may be wrong. </p>
          <p eId="para_131"> We are where we are and I very much welcome this report. I very much welcome the idea of a higher education joint working group. This committee must work very closely with the three institutes of technology to promote that working group. How will the scholarship fund operate? Who does the delegation hope to target and what areas does it hope to target? It is very sad that only half of the people from the Unionist tradition in Northern Ireland go on to higher education. This anomaly is very worrying and people should not be clapping themselves on the back for it. We should not forget about the Nationalist community but this is one area that could be targeted and focused upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">It could help that community integrate or see what is on this side of the Border.</p>

          <p eId="para_133">I thank representatives of the three colleges for their presentations. I have some broad questions, the first of which is very simple. I support their recommendations but I also suggest that they approach the Committee for Education in the Assembly and the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection. I have been a Member of the Legislative Assembly for 14 years and I am well aware of the potential for joint North-South committee meetings on issues of relevance. If the witnesses were to make presentations to both committees and encouraged them to enter into a joint undertaking they might advance their proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> They spoke about the misperception about the status of institutes of technology. That offers a challenge to us as politicians to change these perceptions but the institutes also have a role in addressing the issue by giving politicians the tools to act on their behalf. I am familiar with Letterkenny Institute of Technology through family members who studied there and other interactions with the college.</p>

          <p eId="para_135">I will address the questions on scholarships and misperceptions and Mr. Hannigan can address the other questions. In one sense, a scheme is already in place, namely, the Erasmus programme for student mobility across Europe. My own institution hosts up to 200 students at any one time from partner universities in France, Germany, Finland and Spain. I am not aware of a single exchange with Northern Ireland, however. It may be a case of making better use of the Erasmus programme rather than funding a new scholarship. I would prefer to target scholarships at low income students and, in the case of Dundalk, I would love to see students coming from the Protestant community in Northern Ireland. At present we have approximately 50 students out of 5,000, which is a small drop in the ocean. As far as I know all of them are from Nationalist backgrounds. This year for the first time in our history a Protestant school visited during our annual open day. The point was made that Protestants avail of higher education to a much lesser extent than the Nationalist community. I would like to increase their participation as a way of building mutual understanding.</p>

          <from> Mr. Paul Hannigan<recordedTime time="2013-05-30T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_136">There is a degree of overlap with the questions raised and I will attempt to deal with them on that basis. I am originally from Ballyshannon in County Donegal, which is a Border town. For ten years I worked with Mr. Cummins in Dundalk Institute of Technology before returning to Letterkenny Institute of Technology, where I have been for the last 15 years. I have spent my entire life around the Border and I am well aware of the issues that have to be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> In the context of the overall situation, cross-Border collaboration has undoubtedly gone down the political agenda. Deputy Smith made reference to the attitudes of people who do not live in Border areas and noted that they do not regard cross-Border educational initiatives as being relevant to them. We have to fight that battle initially within our own constituencies to persuade people that such initiatives are vital for Border colleges. We work alongside people from both sides of the Border but few students from Northern Ireland study in our institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> Deputy Feighan suggested that we were lazy in the context of implementing the agreement and that we should be doing more to develop relationships with Northern Ireland. However, each of the three institutions have invested considerable amounts of money, effort and time on changing perceptions in Northern Ireland. It is difficult to identify the obstacles to mobility on both sides of the Border. The central issue is, as Andy Pollack has noted, the complete confusion that exists about what is on offer in our respective institutes. We put obstacles in front of people without meaning to do so. This issue arose in the earlier discussion about entry levels and confusion about A levels. We recently dealt with the question of how we should set entry level requirements for students with applied A levels. There is a problem of misinformation but the wider context is that people regard it as solely a matter for Border counties. I am glad to hear the commitments expressed by members regarding political support for our recommendations. The proposal to make a presentation to both education committees offers one way of progressing the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> To put the issues facing Letterkenny Institute of Technology in a context with which Deputy Ferris will be familiar, they are the equivalent of the Institute of Technology Tralee not taking students from any other part of Munster. A large hinterland would be removed in terms of student participation, with knock-on effects on how the institute operates and serves the region. We should not lose sight of the spatial strategy in this debate. Letterkenny is a joint gateway with Derry city. We need to continue reminding people of the importance of cross-Border co-operation and its impact on the day-to-day operation of the institutions.</p>

          <p eId="para_140">The single biggest obstacle we face is misperception. Focus groups we have worked with in Northern Ireland simply did not realise the opportunities available in our institutes of technology. We are confused with further education in Northern Ireland and students are often unaware that we offer degree and post-graduate courses. Clearly our institutions can do more to address that misperception but political support would help in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> The second biggest obstacle is the way in which the CAO system unfairly disadvantages students from Northern Ireland. The best performing student from Northern Ireland would be capped at 450 points, whereas the best performing student in the Republic of Ireland is capped at 600 points. We have examples of students who are refused admission to DKIT but get places in Queens University Belfast. Something is not right in the way the system is working. Our three institutions are committed to developing direct entry procedures on the basis of a fair apportionment of points.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">One could argue that we were lazy but we are now moving much further and faster to address the matter. Significant effort has been invested in developing links with Northern Ireland but the biggest problem is misperception. When I was recently in King's Hall representing IT Sligo, a group of students came around the corner and, on seeing our sign, said they were not planning to study IT. I had to explain that we teach all sorts of subjects, including business, science and engineering. In regard to being mixed up with further education in Northern Ireland, we have sought to link with further education colleges. We are in a process of mapping how people can come from further education to advanced entry level in courses in science, engineering and business. The CAO system and the misconception of what we do are major difficulties.</p>

I am amazed, if not shocked, at the number of people from Northern Ireland who do not avail of the opportunity to attend institutes of technology along the Border. If the witnesses need any help, there will be no problem whatsoever. I come from Dundalk and I know Mr. Cummins pretty well. The Dundalk Institute of Technology, DKIT, is looking to give university level higher education to graduates, and that would be a major plus if it can go ahead with that. The education opportunities in DKIT are very high. The entrepreneurship is excellent. DKIT is doing a lot of cross-Border developments. Within a 90 minute drive of DKIT is a population catchment of more than 3 million people. I see no reason we cannot push hard and try to get as many people from Belfast and Derry as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> Regarding value for money, the cost of going to DKIT or other institutes of technology in the Republic compared with the universities in the North is vastly different. On the range of courses in the Republic compared with the North, I was talking to Mr. Cummins recently about potential new courses coming up in DKIT. He mentioned the school of business and humanities and the school of engineering, and these are all bachelor of arts, BA, courses. He mentioned the school of informatics and creative art and the school of health and science. He has a fantastic agriculture programme in DKIT and it is growing significantly. Agriculture is keeping the country going with its exports.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> The witnesses mentioned equal status. Could they elaborate on what they mean by that? They also mentioned the opportunity for cross-Border jobs. Mr. Cummins already spoke about the scholarship fund. He mentioned improving admission. We will do anything we can to help because the education is fantastic. DKIT has more than 5,000 students and 80% are from the Louth, Monaghan and Cavan area. Mr. Cummins is trying to advance the colleges all the time. We have a goldmine here in our area around the Border and it is very important we get out that message not only to Northern Ireland but also to the UK. More than 400 Chinese students attend DKIT.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> One of the main reasons companies such as eBay and PayPal come to the area is because of the education we have there. The infrastructure will be a big help. Ms Louise Phelan of PayPal has been picking Mr. Cummins's brain and requesting language courses, and I am sure he is bending over backwards to facilitate her. I have nothing but praise for the work the witnesses are doing and I would love to see the institutes of technology go from strength to strength. Another major plus is the number of people they employ locally. I am very enthusiastic about the whole thing and if the committee can give any help, we will be more than happy to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_147">I welcome the witnesses from Letterkenny, Sligo and Dundalk. The contribution of the institutes of technology to education is phenomenal. I sat on the board of DKIT for nine years. Unfortunately, I had to leave it when I was appointed to the Seanad, but I am aware of the great work that is being done in DKIT. Are all the witnesses happy with today's report on the future of third level education? How will it impact on their institutes? How will it help in the efforts to get students from the North into our institutes of technology? That is the most pressing issue I have to ask about.</p>

          <p eId="para_148">I, too, commend the witnesses on their work. I apologise for not being here for their briefing but I have a fair idea of what they are proposing and I wholeheartedly pledge my support for it. Coming from Dundalk, DKIT is the one with which I am most familiar. I see it growing from strength to strength. In my area of music I studied my masters course in DKIT, which I would not have been able to take anywhere else were it not for the courses and how it was laid out for people on a part-time basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> The establishment of this North-South higher education forum would be a wonderful initiative to encourage movement. We have all seen the facts and figures and the lack of students coming North to South. Earlier this morning I raised better communication and awareness for the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, UCAS, and the Central Applications Office, CAO, to get on. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn explained what is happening in the CAO system but it gives us scope to work on that and impress on him the importance of ensuring there is better scope and that people have more mobility, North and South.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> We also spoke about people from low socioeconomic and low income backgrounds. The idea of a scholarship fund is great and should be encouraged. It would be a pledge to show the institutes of technology are progressive in their thinking and are catering for people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. The issue of the A levels and the fact that when one transfers them one has only 450 points in the Irish system is ridiculous. That is the huge barrier we must overcome first.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">I raised the matter of the lack of activity and neglect by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, on North-South co-operation with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn. He listened. It is disgraceful. Many years ago, Charles Haughey appointed me to the HEA so I have an interest and I know what happens there. It is quite a closed organisation in its own way. It is a pity the North-South co-operation has lapsed and the HEA does not have it as part of its strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> The establishment of the joint working group to create greater harmonisation within the two higher education systems, North and South, will help break down the barriers to higher island-wide student mobility and would be a significant step forward. Business people, such as the management of PayPal in Dundalk, do not see the Border. If people have experience and qualifications, it does not matter where they come from. The quicker we get this back on track, the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> I congratulate the two colleges and the Institute of Technology Sligo on the fantastic work they do. It is a brilliant contribution. The committee will support them in any way we can. Formally, under the Good Friday agreement, I raised with the Minister the lack of drive by the HEA in its action plan. The HEA action plan does not mention co-operation at all.</p>

          <p eId="para_158">I thank everyone for their positive comments about our institutions, which is encouraging. I will deal with the questions raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick and Senator Brennan, and my colleagues will deal with the others.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> The future strategy of DKIT is built around a collaboration and alliance with Dublin City University. We have mentioned the greatest challenge we face in recruiting students from Northern Ireland is the misplaced perception. The existence of an alliance with DCU will help to deal with that. The progression path that will be followed by other institutes of technology is towards technological universities. Mr. Hannigan will comment on that shortly in response to Senator D'Arcy's question about the early publication of the future strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned PayPal in Dundalk. We are working closely with the company to help recruit employees. Only yesterday we had a meeting involving our careers services, language department and work placement office. There is great potential both with PayPal and eBay.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> Deputy Smith mentioned agriculture, and he will be aware of a successful collaboration between DKIT and Ballyhaise College in County Cavan, which we are keen to grow. There is huge demand for agriculture programmes and we are not able to meet the demand. One of the difficulties in our system is what while there areas in which we have spare capacity, there are other areas where we cannot cope with demand and it is not easy to move resources between departments. We provide an honours degree course in sustainable agriculture, which we run successfully with Ballyhaise College. We have an ambition to introduce an agrifood degree, and there is big demand in our region for that, but we are challenged in doing that because of staffing restrictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> Senator Brennan asked whether we are happy with the number of students recruited from Northern Ireland. All three institutions would say we are not at all happy about that. My institute's new strategic plan sets targets to increase recruitment from Northern Ireland. We referred earlier to the problems and barriers, but it is up to us to break them down. Some are cultural and political and they are difficult, but others are related to simple logistics such as how students make applications and providing better information. We have made a proposal for a scholarship targeted at students from Northern Ireland specifically to come south. Our three institutions have a bigger interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> I refer to Senator White's criticism of the Higher Education Authority. The authority looks at the overall system for the entire country. Our institutions, given their location, are particularly interested in Northern Ireland. I suspect this will not be an issue in Tralee or Cork but better mobility will be key to our future development.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_49">
          <from> Mr. Paul Hannigan<recordedTime time="2013-05-30T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_164">I will respond to Senator D'Arcy's question about whether we are happy with the landscape document published by the Minister. Mr. Cummins and I are at a disadvantage in that the report issued as we were heading here and, therefore, we have not yet had an opportunity to read it. However, I would like to correct the front page article in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning, which said three technological universities were approved by Cabinet yesterday and an application from GMIT, Sligo IT and Letterkenny IT was refused. That is news to me because we did not make an application to be turned down. That is a major inaccuracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> I will refer to the broader report shortly but there was a major missed opportunity. Two higher education strategies were developed over the past two years. The national higher education strategy in the Republic of Ireland was published in January 2011 and, in the middle of last year, the Northern Ireland higher education strategy was published. Having spoken to those developing the strategy on both sides of the Border, I thought there was a great opportunity at that stage to have a common chapter within both strategies to address cross-Border issues, including student mobility and so on. That did not happen. Paragraph 5.7 on page 23 of the Northern Ireland strategy refers to "cross-Border co-operation and student mobility". That is the extent of the commitment to cross-Border activity in the strategy. Our national higher education strategy contained commitments about collaboration between institutes of technology and universities in Northern Ireland. We were particularly interested in that because, at the time, we were pursuing a close collaboration with the University of Ulster. Those opportunities remain. There is a possibility that both strategies could be revisited and there could be an overlap. A common element could be developed within them because it is crazy that they are both developing with no overlap at all. Given both were developed at the same time, this does not make sense. That is where there should have been an engagement by the HEA to ensure that occurred. From the point of view of colleges in the Border region, we would have been dealing with an entirely different context because we would have had something specifically to work with.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> We are engaged in rearguard action now where we are trying to redress the strategies that have been published and to examine the issues causing difficulty for student mobility and other elements of collaboration, to retrofit them in the strategies. That was a missed opportunity to commit to cross-Border collaboration generally and specifically in higher education. However, it is something the joint working group we propose could revisit and in which it could engage in a more proactive way. It seemed like the simplest thing in the world from my perspective, but obviously our comments at the time fell on deaf ears.</p>

However, I asked whether the institutes were happy with today's report and the proposals for clusters. Will DKIT be given the space and scope to move forward with its link to DCU, in particular? I thought the report was like a curate's egg.</p>

          <p eId="para_168">I am shocked by the report from a Northern Ireland perspective with only one paragraph referring to it.

          <p eId="para_170">I was glad to hear the Minister say earlier this morning that there is some element of cross-Border collaboration mentioned in the document to which Senator Jim D'Arcy referred. Earlier drafts of that documents did not include a reference to cross-Border collaboration. This is on both sides of the Border, not just on one side.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> What I have been saying for a long time, and I have been shot down a number of times, is that because of the economic circumstances on both sides of the Border, from the political perspective this has become of less interest to people. It is also of little interest to anybody at present. While our institutions see it as vitally important to the hinterland we serve, we have to get the issue back on the political agenda and ensure that it is an issue worthy of consideration, which it did not get in the past. When we see a draft document with no element of cross-Border collaboration and highlight the fact, there is no point when it comes back with a paragraph in it.</p>

          <p eId="para_173">Yes, there was definitely consultation. To set out the chronology, last year in 2012, the Minister met with the chairs and the presidents from each of the colleges, institutes of technology and universities. In that discussion in February 2012, there was an element of North-South collaboration. He subsequently met us again in November 2012 and there was no mention of cross-Border collaboration. A document was issued in January 2013, on which we were consulted and again there was only a slight mention, just one sentence on cross-Border co-operation. From our perspectives we went back with a very strong position on clusters - to which Senator D'Arcy referred - and raised the question of whether we would have a cross-Border regional cluster. We put it that we should engage from that perspective so that there is direct engagement with higher education institutions in the North. We try to deal with issues from that perspective. I am not sure what is in today's document, but I know the Minister said earlier that there was some element of cross-Border collaboration within the document he is publishing today.</p>

Before we consider the ways we would follow up on it, may I ask the witnesses if they are getting a reciprocal buy-in from their colleagues north of the Border? Do the representatives from colleges in the North think in the same way as they do? If they do, should they not be part of the proposal for a North-South higher education working group? Is there work going on behind the scenes? I am trying to tease this out as to how we as a committee can develop this proposal with a buy-in from universities north of the Border.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">We have very good working relationships with the University of Ulster and Queens University, particular in the area of enterprise support programmes and INTERREG programmes.

          <p eId="para_178">There is a lot of collaboration and work and we are pushing on with the University of Ulster specifically in terms of trying to develop a cross-Border higher education region in the north west. Probably most of the impetus to develop that is coming from ourselves. I think the University of Ulster is very interested in developing it but once the economic circumstances changed on both sides of the Border, everybody went into retrenchment mode and that had a direct impact in terms of how we try to develop this. I think there would be an interest in looking at this issue because the demographics in Northern Ireland, as outlined in their strategy, is that there will be a decline in the number of school leavers for the next ten to 15 years in Northern Ireland. In the South it is the complete opposite. As a result there must be some synergy in terms of how we follow that through.</p>

          <p eId="para_193">We are starting the conversation. I think Mr. Paul Hannigan rightly pointed out there is a HEA and other reports with references to cross-Border provisions. It is up to us to work on the issues. This is not set in stone and we can drive it and work on this together.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">What might be relevant is the future projected enrolment at third level North and South. There has been a significant increase in the level of participation in the South in the past 12 to 15 years. I do not know, but presume there has been a similar increase in the number north of the Border. With increasing levels of participation we need to maximise existing infrastructure and co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> If we had the projected enrolment figures for third level, it might bolster the case for increased collaboration.</p>
