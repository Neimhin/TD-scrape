        <speech by="#NiallCollins" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Deputy Niall Collins<recordedTime time="2014-10-03T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> The past 12 months have seen public confidence in the administration of justice in Ireland undermined in a most significant manner. Not only have we witnessed some of the most severe cutbacks in the provision of services, such as the reduction of approximately 1,600 gardaí in the Garda force, the closure of more than 139 Garda stations and more than 30 court houses and the fact that over 16% of the prison population is on temporary release at any point in time, we have also witnessed a stream of revelations and investigations which have damaged the public perception of An Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> The problems which have manifested themselves in An Garda Síochána and GSOC and which were reported to the former Minister for Justice and Equality were ignored, dismissed or glossed over in order to save the embarrassment of those in senior positions who decided that not taking responsibility was a key management skill. This approach did a massive disservice to the ordinary members of An Garda Síochána and to the citizens of Ireland. As a result of this dereliction of duty, we have seen the resignation of the Garda confidential recipient, the Garda Commissioner, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Secretary General of the Department. We have also witnessed the establishment of an unprecedented number of commissions of investigation surrounding the Department, and there are still more commissions to be established. One would hope, then, that lessons are learned as to how to deal with issues arising in the Garda force and the Department of Justice and Equality from this date forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> Fianna Fáil has been calling for a strengthening of the Ombudsman's powers since the maladministration of justice outlined by Sergeant Maurice McCabe was revealed. Central to the failure to address these problems was the lack of own-initiative investigations and actions which could be taken by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission as a result of the legislation setting out the powers of that commission. The fact that GSOC was restricted in its actions by either the Minister or the Garda Commissioner or by the limitations in regard to those who can make complaints to it undermined the commission's ability to carry out its statutory functions. The legislation I am bringing forward today would significantly increase the powers and independence of GSOC and would go a long way towards ensuring that future difficulties are addressed well in advance of their becoming major institutional challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> This Bill is simple, straightforward and precise and would enhance the work of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and help to end the cycle of superficial reform that we have witnessed so far in the justice area. If enacted, it would amend the Garda Síochána Act 2005 in order to make the Garda Commissioner responsible to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. It would allow the commission to investigate complaints concerning the conduct of any member of the Garda Síochána made by another member of An Garda Síochána. It would remove the requirement for consent in order for the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to reach informal resolution of complaints. It would grant the commission access to the Garda PULSE computer system and it would permit the commission to examine any practice, policy or procedure of An Garda Síochána in order to prevent subsequent abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> The Bill seeks to close the gap between An Garda Síochána and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and rebalance that relationship. It seeks to give GSOC the powers to act independently and in a manner not in any way reliant on key figures in either the Department of Justice and Equality or An Garda Síochána. We saw the failure of the current system when members of the commission had to take to the public airwaves to air their concerns about the shortcomings of the legislation which enables them to carry out their functions. This Bill, which was published in February of this year, seeks to address the issues that arose in recent controversies and to include the Garda Commissioner, as chief of police, among the positions over which the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission will have oversight, except with regard to issues of national security. We have been seeking this for some time. Commentators from outside the world of politics have contributed to the debate, including Nuala O'Loan and Conor Brady, a former member of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. We have taken their suggestions on board and presented them in this Bill. We agree that it is not logical or consistent to think that the chief of a body such as the Garda Síochána, which is subject to oversight, is not subject to the same degree of oversight. There is a disconnect and this gap needs to be closed. The Bill will close that gap.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> Another issue is that of providing GSOC with access to PULSE. This would benefit its investigations greatly. There is much common ground among Deputies on providing GSOC with unfettered access to the Garda PULSE system to allow it to do its job. Currently, GSOC has access to PULSE only under the supervision of a seconded Garda superintendent, which is not in keeping with GSOC's status as an independent investigator of malpractice within An Garda Síochána. The legislation would allow serving members of An Garda Síochána to refer internal complaints to GSOC. This issue was crystallised in the whistleblower controversy, the revelations outlined by Sergeant Maurice McCabe and former Garda John Wilson and the more recent revelations about the penalty points system.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> The Guerin report highlighted the fact that Sergeant Maurice McCabe was correct in his actions to highlight the failure to administer justice in the Bailieborough Garda district. To be frank, the findings were an embarrassment for the Government, which denied that there was ever any issue in the Department and defended the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, month after month. He dismissed and belittled the whistleblowers and was supported by the Taoiseach while doing this. Through this legislation, people such as Sergeant McCabe will no longer be frozen out of the system. GSOC must provide an avenue for people such as Sergeant McCabe to report misconduct.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> Fianna Fáil fully supports the call for a commission of investigation as recommended by the Guerin report and believes this commission should be kept separate from any other commission that has been already established by the Government investigating matters relating to An Garda Síochána. The alleged malpractice in Bailieborough undermines the foundations of our criminal justice system. It also undermines the morale of all members of An Garda Síochána. In order for public confidence to be restored in An Garda Síochána it is necessary to establish fully and frankly how the situation surrounding the malpractice in Cavan was allowed to occur, continue and be covered up over such a long period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> The final part of our Bill would empower and enable GSOC to inquire into the policies, procedures and practices adopted by An Garda Síochána. It would allow it to review and comment on them, recommend changes to improve the policies and procedures and try to prevent complaints from arising in the first instance. This would, we hope, prevent a situation such as that in Bailieborough from arising again.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> I acknowledge the fact that the new Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has published a Bill which reflects much of what is contained in the legislation that I have introduced. However, I believe our Bill goes further and would have a greater impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">The Minister could support or amend the Fianna Fáil Bill, as drafted, in order to speed up the process of reform. </p>
          <p eId="para_13"> The reform of GSOC and the restoration of public confidence in that institution and An Garda Síochána are issues which are above party politics, given that much of what is proposed has been agreed to by all sides, whether in debates or the legislation as published. There is much agreement throughout the House and outside on the provisions set out in the Bill. We should process the legislation as quickly as possible and be seen to support the work of GSOC and An Garda Síochána. Since the controversy surrounding GSOC arose, the perception among the public is that GSOC is not being supported by the Government. This concern appears to be backed up by the fact that since Fine Gael and the Labour Party took office, the budget allocation to GSOC has been reduced by more than €1 million and its staff numbers have been cut. None the less, all parties are agreed on the four main provisions outlined in the Bill. Therefore, I suggest the Government take on board this legislation and vote to support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> It must be stated that when Deputy Frances Fitzgerald was appointed Minister for Justice and Equality, there was a general sense that the reform agenda in the justice area would be dealt with in a much more urgent, sensible and approachable way. However, the fear now is that she is being held back by a Government that does not know how to reform the institutions of State without making significant blunders along the way. Overall, the Government's credibility with regard to the proper functioning of the justice system has been deeply damaged. It has undermined the administration of justice, first, by refusing to listen to whistleblowers; second, by continuing to refuse to answer questions surrounding the Taoiseach's involvement in the resignation of the former Garda Commissioner; third, by closing Garda stations, leaving rural Ireland without police protection; and, fourth, undermining the Judiciary through a series of measures to reduce its independence. The approach of the Government to resolving the current matters of concern undermining public confidence in the administration of justice is to establish commissions of investigation and not to follow through on their recommendations. We are still awaiting significant Government action on the Guerin report which called into question the significant deficiencies in Garda management and the Department of Justice and Equality. We are still awaiting the appointment of a new Garda Commissioner, despite the fact that the former Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, resigned six months ago, on 25 March. We are still waiting on the Minister for Justice and Equality to appoint a new Secretary General and the Taoiseach's clarification of his involvement in the former Garda Commissioner's resignation.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> Other worrying developments include the massive number of bench warrants and summonses which remain outstanding, the fact that over 600 prisoners are on temporary release at any one time and the dramatic decrease in Garda numbers from a peak of 14,500 in 2010 to approximately 12,900 today. In July the interim Garda Commissioner, Ms Noirin O'Sullivan, at a meeting of the Committee of Public accounts, stated force number levels were very close to critical level. She stated: "We are very close to the point below which we should not go." This comment on Garda numbers followed a similar warning by her predecessor, Mr. Callinan, also made to Committee of Public Accounts in 2012. At the time he set the floor in terms of minimum Garda numbers at 13,000, but Garda strength at the end of May was 12,954. I believe they have dipped further since. The recent recruitment of 100 new gardaí, while welcome, will not restore the force to the level required.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> It is time to restore the pride the people had in their police force. It is time to restore their confidence in the country's justice system. It is time to act on the good will and faith people have shown to the Government in electing it to office. It is also time to pass this legislation to give GSOC the power to do the job that needs to be done. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#AodhanORiordan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)<recordedTime time="2014-10-03T10:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_17">I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on behalf of the Government on the Garda Síochána (Amendment) Bill 2014 introduced by Deputy Niall Collins. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is, unfortunately, not in a position to attend today owing to other unavoidable commitments. The substance of the Bill should be taken in the positive spirit in which it is presented. The Deputy has outlined the objectives of the Bill and I do not propose to repeat what he has said. As Members will be aware, the Bill was published last February and a lot has happened since, with reference to strengthening the operation of the criminal justice system. This is especially the case with regard to the delivery of a quality and effective policing service in which all of the people can have full confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> In April this year the Government announced a new programme of justice reform in response to the series of issues that had come to light in relation to An Garda Síochána. These issues are familiar to Deputies and are, as they know, wide-ranging and serious. The term "systemic failure" has been applied to the situation that has emerged. In that light it must be fully and honestly acknowledged that the policing system, with the standing of the Garda organisation, has gone through a difficult and challenging period. Given the overall circumstances that have developed, it is not going too far to say we are at a pivotal juncture in Irish policing. We have to look back and thoroughly examine what went wrong. At the same time, we have to look forward and decide, here and now, what kind of police service we want for the country. The Government's programme of justice reform provides a comprehensive and concrete platform for these two sets of actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> It is evident from the events to which I have referred that an essential element of the reform needed is an enhanced system of police accountability. This is, of course, a matter that is referred to in the Bill we are discussing. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government's programme of justice reform includes the establishment of a new independent policing authority, which is a very positive step. The Cabinet sub-committee on justice reform, chaired by the Taoiseach, is charged with overseeing the development of legislative proposals for the new authority. This is a project to which a very high priority has been attached and it will continue to be addressed on that basis. </p>
          <p eId="para_20"> The accountability of the Garda Commissioner is one of the most important matters being addressed in the drafting of the general scheme for the policing authority Bill. In that context, the Government has made it clear that, in policing matters, the Garda Commissioner will be accountable in the exercise of his or her functions to the new authority. The preparation of the general scheme is at an advanced stage and the Minister has confirmed that she will bring it before the Government as quickly as possible. </p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The Government appreciates the work undertaken by Deputy Niall Collins on this Bill. At the same time, I am sure he will acknowledge that, apart from the urgent work under way on the policing authority, the Government has been proactive in bringing forward measures which cover the same ground as that covered in the Bill. The Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014 was recently initiated and is expected to be debated in the House in the coming weeks. The Bill is another important element of the Government's reform programme. Its main purpose is to amend the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to expand the remit and powers of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. To a certain but more limited extent, this is one of the objectives covered by Deputy Niall Collins's Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> The Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill is concerned with a number of areas and a significant measure in its own right. In particular, it provides for the first time that the Garda Commissioner will come within the investigative remit of GSOC; will confer additional police powers on GSOC for criminal investigation purposes; provide greater autonomy for GSOC in examining Garda practices, policies and procedures; and enable the Garda Síochána Inspectorate to carry out inspections on its own initiative without the need for the prior approval of the Minister for Justice and Equality. On a point of information, the Minister has indicated that she will further consider legislative changes with regard to GSOC within the framework of the policing authority Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_23"> In addition, the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 which came into operation on 15 July deals with Garda whistleblowers by way of provisions similar to those proposed in the Deputy's Bill. The new Act inserted a section into the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to allow members of An Garda Síochána to make protected disclosures to GSOC in confidence in respect of alleged Garda misconduct. The Government has committed in the programme for Government to the introduction of legislation to protect whistleblowers.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> I note that Deputy Niall Collins's Bill contains provisions to allow GSOC to access the Garda PULSE computer system. No specific statutory amendment is needed for this purpose and I understand it is being catered for operationally on the basis of technical co-operation between GSOC and An Garda Síochána. </p>
          <p eId="para_25"> The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality commenced a review of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 earlier this year and has held hearings with interested parties, including GSOC and An Garda Síochána, following a public consultation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">The Minister received interim recommendations from the committee in June. A number of the committee's recommendations are catered for in the Government's No. 3 Bill and the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. The joint Oireachtas committee is continuing its review of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and the Minister understands that it will bring forward a more detailed and comprehensive report. She is looking forward to receiving this and she will consider all the recommendations made by the joint committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> The Government's reform programme is not confined to legislative measures. In other areas, substantial progress has been made and the current momentum is being sustained. Last month, the open competition for the recruitment of the next Garda Commissioner was announced. An appointment from this competition is expected in late November-early December. An independent review mechanism has been established to review complaints alleging Garda misconduct or inadequacies in the investigation of such allegations. A panel consisting of senior and junior counsel was established and the aim is to have the majority of cases reviewed within a period of up to 12 weeks. </p>
          <p eId="para_28"> The Fennelly commission of investigation into the operation of telephone recording systems in certain Garda stations and related matters has been up and running since June and is due to report to the Government by the end of this year. The Garda Síochána Inspectorate's crime inspection report is imminent. This report will cover a wide spectrum of policing activity including the recording, investigation and prosecution of crimes. The report will also deal with a number of concerns raised in the report submitted to the Government by Mr. Sean Guerin SC following his review of certain Garda actions. The Government has committed to establishing a commission of investigation into matters arising from the Guerin report. The terms of reference of the commission, including the timeframe and the appointment of a member, are under consideration and will be finalised shortly. </p>
          <p eId="para_29"> The Government published Judge Cooke's inquiry into reports of unlawful surveillance of GSOC in June. Recently, GSOC published a redacted version of the report commissioned from Mr. Mark Connaughton SC into the possible disclosure of confidential information. I welcome the publication of GSOC's report in the interest of public transparency. I might add, importantly, that the Government's No. 3 Bill meets a number of key commitments made arising from the publication of the Cooke report. These relate specifically to ensuring that GSOC can conduct a public interest investigation without reference to a specific complaint and also enhancing the effectiveness of the existing statutory provisions concerning the exchange of information between the Garda Síochána and GSOC.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> The Minister published the report of the Independent Review Group on the Department of Justice and Equality in July. Since its publication, an open competition to recruit a new Secretary General to my Department has been announced and the Minister is working closely with management to implement the report's recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> The Garda Síochána has been included within the scope of the Freedom of Information Bill 2013 in accordance with the commitment in the programme for Government to extend freedom of information to all public bodies. The Heads of the Bill were previously extensively debated in committee in the Oireachtas. The Bill has concluded all Stages in the Dáil and has been tabled for the Seanad. It is expected that the Bill will be enacted quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> A review under the Haddington Road agreement will make recommendations on the use by the Garda Síochána of the resources available to it with the objective of achieving and maintaining the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness in its operations and administration. The review encompasses all aspects of the operation and administration of the Garda Síochána. The review is expected to be completed by mid-November and will form a platform for the new Garda Commissioner to oversee a programme of comprehensive reform in the organisation. </p>
          <p eId="para_33"> The concept of organisational culture has been referred to in many quarters over the past several months in respect of the Garda Síochána. September saw the Garda College in Templemore welcome new recruits for the first time in a number of years. We want these men and women and the further recruits that will follow them to be members of a police force that upholds the finest and most professional standards in policing - members of a force that I and citizens of this State are justly proud of. The Government has committed itself to having in place and, as required, to changing Garda structures and systems that will provide our communities with the policing service they deserve. It is not a process that is being undertaken just for its own sake but is directed towards ensuring that the Garda Síochána will be fully up to the task of meeting the challenges of modern policing throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> With that in mind, it is very important that the measures to be put in place in the area of policing reform are properly co-ordinated. This is what the comprehensive Government justice reform programme is about. As I have indicated, the programme has already produced important results and I am fully confident that it will bring about the necessary changes so that confidence in policing can be fully restored.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> Bearing in mind the overall objectives of the Deputy's Private Members' Bill, the Government does not intend to oppose it on Second Stage in this House. However, the Deputy will appreciate that since he originally introduced his Bill, the Government has embarked on a very substantial programme of criminal justice reform. In that regard, I wish to make it clear to the House that the Government intends to proceed fully with the programme. It will, of course, be dealt with as a major priority.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn<recordedTime time="2014-10-03T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_37">I welcome Deputy Collins's Bill and its aim of making the Garda Commissioner responsible to the Garda Ombudsman Commission and to allow the Garda Ombudsman Commission to investigate complaints concerning any conduct of a member of the Garda Síochána made by another member of the force, among other proposals. Sinn Féin will support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage and we will seek to work with Deputy Collins to incorporate some of our proposals, which I will discuss later on.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> There is no doubt that we need drastic changes to our system of policing. The past number of months has seen public confidence in our policing and justice system further eroded after a string of scandals and debacles. A catalogue of recent controversies that have emerged through the courageous efforts of a number of whistleblowers relating to An Garda Síochána are both shocking and profound for the State, society and not least the gardaí themselves. The failure and inaction of our Taoiseach and this Government to respond properly to these matters as they emerged with the urgency required has been alarming and only served to further compound the crisis. We have deep-rooted and systemic deficiencies within senior levels of An Garda Síochána and other institutions of the State, including the Department of Justice and Equality. They failed to account for their actions, failed to discharge their functions and responsibilities in the public interest and failed to safeguard the integrity of these fundamental institutions of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> There is widespread public support for rank and file gardaí - those on the front line. However, it has become increasingly clear that Garda senior management does not enjoy the same support of the public. The vast majority of gardaí are decent and patriotic servants of our people but they have been failed by their senior management and by successive Governments. For example, an independent policing authority was not included in the programme for Government because it was not considered important enough. As the various scandals emerged, something rotten in the culture among senior managers in the Garda Síochána and in the Department of Justice and Equality twined with the ineptitude and worse of the former Minister for Justice and Equality was revealed. With that, a glaring need for change became an unstoppable momentum. </p>
          <p eId="para_40"> I am glad that this Government has finally accepted the need to establish an independent Garda authority and increased powers for the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission after resisting them for so long. It should have happened a long time ago. A major step change is now required in order to restore public confidence and bring about the radical reform citizens expect and indeed deserve. </p>
          <p eId="para_41"> We in Sinn Féin believe in a new beginning to policing similar to what happened in the Six Counties. We want an open and transparent policing service - not a force but a service - representative of all residing in this State. We want to see a new dispensation in order to achieve more strengthened and sustainable reform which can deliver a modern 21st century policing service now and in the future. We need to see freedom from partisan political control or influence, operational independence and policing with the community to develop maximum confidence in the policing service and to maximise co-operation between citizens and An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> As most of us here today know there are five existing dimensions to policing delivery – An Garda Síochána and the Garda Reserve; the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission; the Garda Inspectorate; the professional standards unit and the joint policing committees across the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">What is clearly absent is an independent policing authority which would hold the Garda Commissioner to account and act as a non-partisan body, free from political control, since at this time the Commissioner is directly accountable to the Government through the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> Policing accountability should be premised on the law, the courts, the Constitution and the proposed charter of rights for the island of Ireland, as expressly acknowledged in the Good Friday Agreement. An Garda Síochána should be accountable not only to an independent policing board but also to the democratically elected Houses of the Oireachtas through scrutiny committees, as well as to local government and the communities it serves through joint policing committees. We also propose that the crime and security branch of An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces Directorate of Intelligence come within the scrutiny of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, with the necessary safeguards in place based on international best standards. </p>
          <p eId="para_45"> An Garda Síochána must be accountable through a professional code of practice established by the Minister for Justice and Equality, applied by An Garda Síochána and benchmarked by a new criminal justice inspectorate which would incorporate the existing Garda Inspectorate. The criminal justice inspectorate we propose is based on what is in place in the North. It would include not just An Garda Síochána but the entire system of prisons, penal reform, the criminal justice system and the Courts Service. The Minister would be responsible for setting the overall long-term objectives for policing, after consultation with the new policing authority. The new Garda authority would be responsible for the effective and efficient delivery of the police service and would hold the Garda Commissioner to account directly. </p>
          <p eId="para_46"> Earlier this year my party launched our contribution, based on our experiences of all the submissions made in the State and those of our team which negotiated the changes to policing in the North. I do not say the former RUC was in any way comparable to An Garda Síochána, but there are lessons to be learned from the North in the context of the new beginning there, the Policing Board, the Police Ombudsman and the criminal justice inspectorate, which could be a useful contribution to reforms in the State. A copy of the document was circulated to all Oireachtas Members. I invite those who have not had the opportunity to do so to read it and give us constructive feedback. We do not claim to have all wisdom, but it is our humble contribution to this debate. </p>
          <p eId="para_47"> In terms of the unhealthy relationship we never again want to see develop, some 140 Garda stations have been closed across the State. Deputies from rural areas know the impact this has had. Garda districts were amalgamated with others. There was a 10% cut in staff, which has had a serious impact across the State. Whenever the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, was asked about it, he used terms such as "modernisation", "efficiency" and "smart policing". Every single garda to whom one spoke on the front line was disgusted, to coin a phrase, at the use of that defence by senior management. They could not believe what they were hearing. At the Garda Representative Association annual conference one could hear this year after year. The reason the former Garda Commissioner said those words and defended them was the unhealthy relationship that had been established over many years. There was a circle of trust where people defended each other. </p>
          <p eId="para_48"> Of course, when it came to criticism of senior of management in An Garda Síochána, the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, sat where the Minister of State is sitting and defended it, rejecting any criticism. He slapped us down time and again.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">That can never be allowed to happen in the State again. We can never again have an unhealthy political relationship between the most senior police officer in the State and the Minister for Justice and Equality of the day, whereby they see it as being in their interests to protect each other and circle the wagons to protect themselves from criticism. The people who were failed most by that approach were the men and women of An Garda Síochána on the front line. In the future we need an independent approach free from political interference, which includes people who are representative of society, making decisions. The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality had an opportunity to examine the models used in the North and Scotland. The Minister of State will shortly have the chance to read our recommendations for change.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> I commend Deputy Niall Collins. I have worked with him and other members of the Opposition closely in the past while trying to bring forward alternative solutions. It is welcome that the Government will support the Bill and not vote against it on Second Stage next Tuesday. The Minister of State is committed to equality and reform. He now has an opportunity in the post he holds to see it through. If there is any resistance from anybody to the necessary reform which needs to happen or any delay or procrastination, I ask the Minister of State to fight the good fight and make sure the change materialises. Crises emerge in the evolution of a state and it sometimes takes these moments for change to happen. There is an opportunity to see through the reforms which are necessary, win back the confidence of the public in the justice system of the State and, most of all, to boost the morale of the men and women of An Garda Síochána, the vast majority of whom have done no wrong and serve us honourably and courageously every day. If they see change happening, it will be the best thing we have done.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2014-10-03T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_52">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak about this Bill. I thank and commend Deputy Niall Collins for bringing it before the House. It is very important and brings the issue of reform and change back onto the agenda. I will refer to details of the Bill later in my contribution. It is not just a question of reform for the Government; all Members of the House have to lead on the reform agenda. Above all, most of us want professionalism, accountability and a good quality public service from the Garda. It is important to say this in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> In recent months we have all seen the urgent need for change. All citizens, not just the Government, have to be involved. Trust in An Garda Síochána, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Government has been seriously damaged. The people have to regain trust and senior gardaí, in particular, have to earn their respect. That is why the Bill is part of that process. It is welcome that Government stated it does not intend to oppose the Bill, but I also hope it does not kick it to touch and leave it, as happened last year when my Down's syndrome equality of access Bill was accepted by the Government and on which we are still awaiting action. </p>
          <p eId="para_54"> I referred to the need for trust and respect. In the past year or two people lost faith when they saw what was happening in A Garda Síochána and with the Minister for Justice and Equality. We have major problems in the State. There is a drugs crisis. Some 750 young people aged between 16 and 35 years who are addicted to heroin and other drugs are in the centre of the capital. They are walking the streets and there are no services available for them because the Government closed them down. They are damaging not only themselves but also small businesses and the tourism industry. We have seen people being shot on the streets because of drugs. We have seen parents being shot outside schools because of drugs and gang wars. Communities across the State have been devastated by the drugs crisis, yet the Government and the Minister of State have their heads in the sand. They need to wake up and hear about what is going on in communities. Whole streets are being intimidated. That is the reality. In the past week I have met innocent working class families who have been intimidated by a gang leader who leads a gang of between 20 and 60. That is what is going on and why we need reform, good quality gardaí and legislation such as this Bill. What is happening is not acceptable and it is not just a question of crime; it is also a major health issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">That is why I am telling the Government to get off the pot and appoint a Minister with direct responsibility for drugs. Help those who want to help the people on the ground. We need to do that to solve the problem. There are only 30 beds for detoxification in 2014 despite the fact that we have an addiction problem affecting around 15,000 people. That is the level we are talking about. While we are talking about Garda reform, we must also deal with the real issues, which is why direct responsibility for drugs should be given to a Minister. The Government needs to get its act together to deal with broader policing issues also.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> The Bill will beef up the work of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and help to end the pretend reform agenda we have witnessed in recent months. It seeks to amend the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to make the Garda Commissioner responsible to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. It is an important idea and I commend Deputy Niall Collins on including it in the legislation. We need that kind of accountability in a modern police force. There should be no worry about this among the Garda Síochána. The vast majority of gardaí to whom one speaks on the ground want the force to be accountable. While there are elements that need a good shaking and some who need to be rooted out, fresh young people are joining the force with a strong sense of public service. They must be promoted, developed and nurtured, rather than swallowed up in a rotten system as we have seen in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> While we are discussing the Garda Commissioner, I note the current debate on the advertisements for interviews for the post. I have a concern that it is being advertised internationally. It is important that citizens have total trust in the Garda Commissioner, particularly when he or she is dealing with intelligence issues. I would have concerns if someone from outside came in. People might come from an outside state with another agenda. I am not being paranoid. We have seen in our own history over the last 40 years that intelligence services were up to their necks in dirty tricks, bombings and shootings. I raise the issue as it is my view that we should look for someone with a strong policing record in the State. That might not be politically correct to say in this day and age, but it is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> Deputy Collins's legislation seeks to close the gap between the Garda Síochána and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, which is very important. The tension and grievances that have existed have been appalling and unacceptable. We must rebalance that, as Deputy Collins says. There is no point in reforming the Garda if one does not reform the Minister for Justice and Equality and modern politics. Both things go together side by side - reform of our political system and reform of the Garda Síochána. The Government has let itself down on this matter. We saw the shenanigans of Deputy Alan Shatter as Minister, the whistleblowers and many other things that have been very nasty indeed. The important thing here is to ensure that political reform matches Garda reform. I support strongly the provisions in the Bill which empower GSOC to inquire into the policies, procedures and practices adopted by the Garda and to allow it to review, comment and recommend changes. This all fits nicely into the reform agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> When one looks at Garda numbers in light of the 2011 census, one can see there is approximately one full-time garda for every 349 people in the State. That calculation excludes members of the Garda Reserve and civilian staff, but includes all ranks. It is something we must examine. How many hours of an eight-hour shift does a garda spend on the streets? I remember being in London a number of years ago to study a community policing project. We spoke to community police officers on the ground. Of their eight-hour shifts among the inner-city flats complexes, six hours were spent walking the beat in the community, talking to families, helping people strung out on drugs, and getting them into detox centres. I saw at first hand a very good example of community policing. Can any Garda Commissioner put his or her hand on his or her heart and set out the number of hours of an eight-hour shift that a garda spends in the community meeting and working with people? We have 13,000 full-time members of the force and I welcome the fact that there has been an increase in recruitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> I commend Deputy Niall Collins on his reforming legislation and I will support it strongly.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">We had a lot more in our Bill and would go a great deal further. With respect to the Government's position, we have given it the benefit of the doubt as to its intentions and how it will go about things. However, we are somewhat disappointed to date, and I wonder why the legislative programme for 2014 does not include the policing authority Bill, which had been promised. We were even told that the new Garda Commissioner would not be chosen until the policing authority was able to have an input into the process. That may still stand, but we have heard information to the contrary of late. It is very important that the selection of the new Commissioner is completely non-political. In fact, it would be better if the Government did not introduce a new policing authority if it does not intend to depoliticise it. The established parties are very keen to keep their control over the Garda Síochána, which I find worrying given that many of the problems we have witnessed over the last number of years have their roots in the fact that matters are too politicised.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> I am also worried about the fact that the acting Commissioner, Noirín O'Sullivan, claims she is doing things differently and that things are being improved. Sadly, complaints about things happening, even over the summer, continue to stream into our offices. Much of it is very disappointing. It is too bad. We have not put much of it in the public domain for various reasons. There are difficulties with some things, though obviously in time we will make some matters public. I am also disappointed that the Minister has turned down an opportunity to allow section 106 to be used to consider the Corrib issue. GSOC itself asked for this under the former Government. It would demonstrate a new intent on behalf of the new Minister for Justice and Equality if she had a rethink on this. Terrible things happened at Corrib. Innocent protesters were treated incredibly badly, and that must be looked at. It is a stain on policing in the State and will remain so until we deal with it. I do not see the logic in the Government refusing to do this. To sweep it under the carpet does not augur well.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> I will cover one of the cases that has come to my attention. I have spoken for hours with a gentleman from Kilkenny who bought a large public house premises in the centre of the city six or seven years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">He returned home from America and he has been shocked by how he is being treated by An Garda Síochána. I have listened to him for hours and, sadly, it has gone on over the summer as well. Nothing has changed despite the fact that the Commissioner has changed. My fear is, first, does the Acting Commissioner have control over the people below her? Second, can we possibly expect much to change when the vast majority of the hierarchy that has been in place for the past few years is still there? In contrast to the previous speaker, I am adamant that if the Government wants to see real change in An Garda Síochána, a good starting point will be a new Commissioner from outside the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> I will read a summary this gentleman sent me this week. I will redact most of the names in it - he has named a lot of gardaí and for the moment I will redact those.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_70">On Monday June 2nd [this year] a visibly irate Garda Sgt. entered our premises asking about tables at the front of the building. When asked by my wife Sally if this was a Garda matter, she was told to shut up. He stated that he had been sent down by Inspector Liam Connolly to get the tables in from the street. He read Sally her rights, and when asked why he did this, he stated that there may be further action and prosecutions in relation to this. This antagonistic behaviour was witnessed by a bar full of customers and tourists.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_71">On Sunday 27th July/Monday morning 12.30 am, [they] approached the doorman and manager, and notified them that the bar was to be closed. When the guards were informed and shown a special exemption for the night in question, they said that the bar was to be closed and all customers off the premises by 1am - which in fact was not correct as drinking up time brings it to 1.30am. The Garda stated that she had been instructed by Inspector Liam Connolly to inspect and clear the premises. When it was put to the garda about a nearby bar that has, and can only have the same exemption as us, she stated that “they have a different license to you - just get this place cleared.”</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_72">The following night, Monday July 28th/Tuesday morning July 29th, gardaí entered the premises of Matt The Millers bar at 2.50am. Inspector Connolly was on the premises drinking, clearly intoxicated, but was permitted to leave hastily - no names were taken and no record of this inspection was recorded on the pulse system.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_73">On August 3rd a member of the public who is not even permitted on our premises, was being spoken to by the doormen at the front of the premises, and in plain sight, pepper sprayed a customer, and then proceeded to threaten people with the spray and a knuckle duster. The guards were called in relation to this matter, but never arrived. Two hours later when the bar was closed and cleared, a single female guard came to the back door of the premises and said that they could not come before this and were busy with other matters. Meanwhile the same [gentleman] was around the town armed with a knuckle duster and pepper spray. A garda said that she would deal with it on Thursday when she came back to work, but I have heard nothing to date from her in relation to this incident. My wife Sally went to the station on the Sunday evening to speak to the sergeant in charge to find out why 2 hours had elapsed before a garda came to the premises - no satisfaction from the sergeant in relation to this - the result was an inspection by him the very same night [on their premises].</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_74">This is just a brief outline of what is a sustained and consistent level of harassment by members of An Garda Síochána towards the owners, staff and customers of The Field Bar, High Street, Kilkenny. This harassment started almost immediately after the premises was purchased in July 2007. We are at a loss to know what we did to deserve this treatment, but fully believe it is motivated by a desire to unlawfully force our customer base to go to other premises, so this process of nuisance has a purpose.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_75">A subsequent meeting with Inspector Connolly (who was acting superintendent at the time), was sought by [him] to help "resolve these matters". This meeting content is now part of a Garda Ombudsman complaint. What can only be stated in relation to this is that after this meeting took place, Inspector Connolly became vociferously [involved] with every angle of the harassment, with his name popping up at every juncture.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_76">Despite trying to address this ongoing situation [over the years] it has continued and is becoming even more threatening. Back in early September 2012 a meeting was sought with Superintendent Padraig Dunne, where a number of issues were raised, and the number of inspections of our premises by garda members discussed, and specific garda were named. Just over a week later two gardaí entered The Field premises and proceeded to arrest ... [the owner] Mr. John McDonald ... and while in custody, barraged him with quotes from his previous weeks private discussion with the Superintendent. [They put him in a cell and gave him hell for five hours.]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_77">Some members of An Garda Síochána have conspired to harass us at every turn, and we now have to bring this matter to the attention of the Garda Ombudsman and [we intend to give a copy of the details to] the Minister for Justice, as their inaction to investigate crimes against us has left us in a very vulnerable and unsafe position.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">I had intended referring to another case but I do not have time. The culture in An Garda Síochána is problematic. It is dire, and it has to change. If we leave the existing hierarchy in place, how can we expect to see a serious change in culture?</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> We met Maurice McCabe a couple of weeks ago. I know it is being looked into now but the blatant disregard for the new rules by some senior members of the force is just unbelievable. They seem to be lawless. They are certainly indisciplined and, to a great extent, dysfunctional. </p>
          <p eId="para_80"> I hope the Government takes all of this more seriously. I know it would like these problems to go away. They are not going to go away. A massive root and branch renewal is required, and it would be great if the Government had an appetite for it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2014-10-03T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_83">It is fair to say there is now a spotlight on the gardaí that we have not seen since the days of the Morris tribunal. We were told then that it was a few bad apples in Donegal but what was revealed was a systemic problem. The solutions put in place at that time have clearly failed and the systemic problem, the culture to which Deputy Wallace refers, remains.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> It has taken about two years for the Government to recognise the points we have been making about the need for change but we want to state clearly that recognising the need is one thing; delivering that change is an entirely different matter. We are a million miles away from delivering the change necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> In many ways things are exactly as they were, and I will deal with some of those issues. I apologise to the Minister of State and to Deputy Collins for being late but I was in the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, dealing with my own complaint, which is in the public domain and therefore we do not need to be secretive about it. That complaint stems back almost 20 months - almost two years - in regard to an incident whereby I was arrested on suspicion of drink driving, and that information leaked to the press less than 24 hours later in an effort to discredit me at the peak of the time we were raising the penalty points issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> Through dealing with that case and meeting all the other people who have come forward since we raised those issues, we have had considerable dealings with GSOC during that time. If anyone has had any involvement with it and met any of its members, the only conclusion they could come to is that this organisation has been set up to fail. There is no other explanation for it. In the early days we though these fellows were in there to make it look good and to deliberately cover up but having met many of the staff, I genuinely believe there is a very good capability in GSOC. There are some excellent people working for that organisation, but it will fail in what it is doing because it is bereft of resources and staff and is constructed in a manner which prevents them from seriously investigating and getting results in many of the cases to which we urgently need an answer. There are limitations on what they can investigate, a high level of Garda self-investigation, which is laughable, and some of the time ceilings are not practical.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">If we are serious, we need a more thorough overhaul of GSOC than what is proposed, although I welcome the measures in place. We must put in the public domain how things were. That means saying many citizens have been the victims of injustice at the hands of elements in An Garda Síochána. They are the very people to whom one would think of turning to seek help and support in one's hour of need, but, in some instances, they have become the biggest harassers and a nightmare for citizens. Cases include the publican to whom Deputy Mick Wallace referred and it is not an isolated example.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> Allegations about penalty points terminations which we were told were being made under a new system are under investigation because of breaches of procedures, with people having penalty points terminated on a repeat basis. We have seen evidence of this and it will be demonstrated to be true. </p>
          <p eId="para_89"> There was not just one whistleblower but a number of them. In May the former Deputy and current MEP Luke 'Ming' Flanagan named and outlined the case of another Garda whistleblower in the midlands. The man concerned brought forward serious and definitive information on Garda involvement in the drugs trade and people being fitted to sell drugs. This information which I have seen is indisputable. Four months ago the issue was raised of members of An Garda Síochána being involved in the drugs trade. Deputy Finian McGrath was making points about the serious drugs problem in our society. It is, undoubtedly, true that that is the case and when this activity is ongoing four months later and the garda against whom the complaint has been made is still in place, something is not right. All of the murmurings and nice gestures of Garda administration and the sentiments expressed that we were on the verge of a new dawn mean nothing while these matters are continuing. We have taken the Minister's word as to her intent and desire to see some of these things changed. We are not, however, naive enough to think the best Minister in the world could transform the position overnight, but much more must and could be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> The first test will be in deciding the person who gets the job of Garda Commissioner. Deputy Finian McGrath is quite wrong. If anyone linked with the existing hierarchy in An Garda Síochána is given the job, it will be a licence to say things will not change. That does not mean disrespect to any one person individually, but it is a reflection on the fact that they have come from a flawed system. The system is based on patronage and with whom people play golf dictates who gains promotion. Many able people have been bypassed. We must, therefore, look outside to shake things up.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> The Minister has indicated her desire to move forward on some of the other injustices linked with the operation of An Garda Síochána. In advance of the summer, she set up a review panel to examine cases, many of which had come through our offices. We met them and took up the issues involved. We are deeply concerned at the responses given to the Opposition justice spokespersons for other parties at Question Time. Last month the Minister indicated that there would not be much of a follow-up on the cases mentioned. If there is not, we have a serious problem. One of the cases involves Cynthia Owen, whose case is in the public domain. She was a young girl in Dún Laoghaire who had been impregnated at the age of 11 years. Her baby had been murdered and the body found in an alleyway. Her other baby was similarly taken away. She had been the victim of a paedophile ring which involved a number of gardaí. With her solicitor, she has been trying to get information on the review panel and is really frustrated. It has been in operation for months, but they cannot get answers to their queries. The solicitor has been dealing with the gardaí handling the case and they have not been contacted by anyone in the Department of Justice and Equality or from the review panel set up by the Minister. They have not been asked for information. Cynthia and her solicitor do not know what files are being reviewed and what questions are being asked. Do they have all of the information? It is a serious issue because it is a clear-cut case with much documented evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> There is the similar case of Fr. Niall Molloy, the family of whom have submitted freedom of information requests to the Department of Justice and Equality about the investigation into his murder in 1985. After two months the Department responded with inaccurate information and the family must appeal to seek more information. The Minister has not met them. The previous Minister appointed Mr. Dominic McGinn to look into the case, but he has not yet issued his report. We were told this would be done in the summer. </p>
          <p eId="para_93"> These two cases are high profile, but there are 200 other people whose cases are not high profile. However, they are just as important in terms of injustice. They do not know the people on the panel and how the Minister picked them. They have no right to talk to them. Some of the documents submitted which I have seen are inadequate, but some of the people involved do not have the wherewithal to express themselves in the clear legalistic manner required. They would benefit from meeting someone to discuss their case.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> GSOC is hamstrung and it took 20 months to investigate my case. It also has many other cases to deal with. These things take time and resources are needed if we are to do it properly. We are worried about the way the panel is shaping up. If it comes back to state nothing can be done and that the cases have already been referred to GSOC, people will have already heard these excuses. The Minister said it would be better and different.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> My final point concerns political policing, an issue we must examine. We must decouple the two. Let us imagine that a shooting takes place outside a school in suburban Dublin, with a parent being shot in the middle of the day in Balbriggan. These are things we never thought we would see in Ireland. There were warnings about the activity which took place around the school in the run-up to it. There had been a series of incidents of illegality in the feud, with children nearly being run over on the road. People in the area knew insufficient action had been taken. On the same day more than 25 gardaí were standing around policing citizens at a peaceful protest against water meter installations in Edenmore. There is a concern, which is not doing An Garda Síochána any good, that the force is acting as an agent of Irish Water, as it did in the case of Shell. </p>
          <p eId="para_96"> We must examine all of these issues. We have had a recognition of the need for change, but delivering on it is very different. We would like to see a lot more being done.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)<recordedTime time="2014-10-03T11:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_97">I welcome the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, to respond to the debate on the Garda Síochána (Amendment) Bill 2014 introduced by Deputy Niall Collins. I thank him and all other contributors to the debate. Debates such as this are invaluable as they enable us, as Deputies, to reflect on the critical issues of Garda oversight and accountability. Reflection is the foundation of effective policy-making.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> We are at a pivotal juncture in Irish policing. Collectively, we are charged with moulding the type of service we all want. I hope the Government's decision not to oppose the Bill on Second Stage will be viewed as a genuine indication that it wants to seize this historic opportunity to work collectively for reform. While it accepts the principles of oversight and accountability and decided not to oppose the Bill, it has been actively pursuing its programme of justice reform. One facet of that reform programme is new Government legislation to expand the remit and powers of GSOC and establish a new policing authority. In this context, some of the measures provided for in the Deputy's Bill have already been achieved, while others are in the process of being dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">I have spoken about the Government's legislative reforms in the course of the debate. The Government is absolutely committed to progressing the new legislation as a matter of urgency and this is being overseen by the new Cabinet committee on justice reform established this year and chaired by the Taoiseach. The Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014 will be debated on Second Stage soon. Legislation to establish a new independent policing authority is at an advanced stage. The Government appreciates the importance of establishing the policing authority and is pursuing the matter with urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> The Government's reform programme is ambitious in its scope. I outlined many aspects of the programme in my opening contribution, including the commissions of investigation, the independent review mechanism, the Cooke inquiry into reports of unlawful surveillance of GSOC and the establishment of the policing authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> However, as a Government, we must be ambitious. It has been a very difficult year for policing in the State and our chief aim is to restore not just the public's confidence in the Garda Síochána but also the Garda Síochána's confidence in itself. So much good work is done on a daily basis by gardaí throughout the country. There is much to be proud of. I suggest that those who would welcome this reform most are the decent, hard-working and patriotic gardaí who regularly put their bodies on the line for the security of the State. I refer to instances outlined by Deputies which have shaken the confidence of the public, such as the Corrib gas situation, for example. I know from my experience of instances of the difficulties encountered by young working-class men and the stories they tell me of their treatment in Garda stations. This is an issue. The relationship between working-class communities and An Garda Síochána has been a difficult one but there are many thousands of instances from all around the State of good members of the force doing excellent work beyond the call of duty in the service of those communities and of their State, an example being the CLAY project in Crumlin which I visited recently. While I am aware of some of the disturbing and difficult cases which feed into a culture which needs to be addressed, now is the opportunity for us to address it.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> I also have responsibility for new communities and there are questions about how these communities feel confident in reporting issues to An Garda Síochána and how the force reflects the society it is charged to serve. No more than other areas of public service such as this House, I ask if the force represents the community it polices. This is a question we need to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> It is critical that the current momentum of the Government's programme for justice reform continues over the coming months so the serious failings that have come to light can be dealt with effectively. We need to acknowledge that there have been serious failings. The reform programme will remain a central concern for the Government and we are determined to establish a system of police accountability that will be rigorous and robust.</p>

        <speech by="#NiallCollins" eId="spk_17">
          <from>Deputy Niall Collins<recordedTime time="2014-10-03T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_104">I thank all the contributors to the debate. The Deputies who have spoken are the Deputies who have been consistent in their pursuit of a better criminal justice system which is what we all want. I thank those Deputies for taking the time to attend today in order to contribute to this important debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> The Minister of State is a Dublin representative and I think he will agree that the situation in Dublin is nearing a very severe precipice. A chronic situation has developed in Dublin city centre and it is not receiving its due acknowledgement from Government. My colleague, Deputy Barry Cowen, raised the issues which were also highlighted on last night's "Prime Time" programme on RTE which included comments last Thursday by the Minister of State's party leader, the Tánaiste, Deputy Joan Burton. She did not seem to acknowledge or to have a handle on the problems as highlighted by the "Prime Time" programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> The tourism industry and businesses in Dublin city centre have been articulating this problem for a long time. I refer to the related problems of homelessness, drug abuse and the incidence of crime which are visible every day in broad daylight. The Government must acknowledge the problem. I refer to the CSO new model for reporting crime statistics which was introduced 18 months ago. In my view this model masks the problem. There needs to be an acknowledgement that what was shown last night on "Prime Time" is the case and is impacting on the residents and businesses of Dublin and the city centre as well as on the tourism industry of our capital city. I do not have all the solutions but as a starting point there needs to be an acknowledgement of the problem. I compliment RTE for the very fine programme and the way in which it was produced.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> The Government must prioritise the issue of gangland crime in Dublin. I refer to how this problem was addressed in Limerick with great credit due to the Government and to successive Governments for dealing with this issue which has yielded the right results. It is a situation that requires ongoing work every day of the week. I refer to the incident in Balbriggan last week but I have a constructive criticism that the Tánaiste was in pure denial in the House in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> This Bill differs in one key point from the Minister's Bill in that she proposes to keep a veto on any investigation or review by GSOC of the activities of the Garda Commissioner. This proposal needs to be teased out further. If GSOC is to have true independence in its capacity for oversight, there should not be a veto.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> All Members have signed up to the proposal for an independent policing authority and this is to be welcomed. However, there needs to be a realistic timeline for delivery of the authority but I note that the legislation is not listed on the Government's legislative programme. We were promised that this legislation would be enacted before the end of the year. I ask the Minister of State if it will be enacted before the end of the year because I am doubtful. The Government and the Minister have not given any indication that this legislation will be ready before the end of the year. This point is related to the recruitment of the new Garda Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> I refer to our recent trip to Scotland and to Northern Ireland where it was obvious that for an independent policing authority to be truly independent it is necessary that its main function is the appointment of a Garda Commissioner. If the Minister plans to appoint a Garda Commissioner in advance of the establishment of the independent policing authority, she is removing from that authority one of its most important functions. The recruitment process is under way but the independent policing authority has not been established. It could be argued that the cart is being put before the horse in this instance. I suggest that an interim independent policing authority could be appointed to participate in the recruitment process. This was the solution in other jurisdictions such as in Northern Ireland and in Scotland. It would mean that there can be no accusation that one was compromised by the absence of the other. </p>
          <p eId="para_111"> Other speakers have suggested the names of those they would like to be Garda Commissioner. I do not have a view in that regard. I wish all the applicants well; it is immaterial whether they are from outside or inside the jurisdiction, once the process is robust to deliver the best candidate for the job. I refer to the need for action on the Guerin report and that we have been promised a commission of investigation. Speakers have complimented the good work of the rank and file members of An Garda Síochána. Much of the debate in this House has rightly focused on the negative aspects and on malpractice.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">However, we must give credit where it is due.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> One section of the force which tends to be forgotten in this debate is the Garda Reserve. There are people within An Garda Síochána, namely, the reservists, who are doing tremendous work. These individuals are undervalued by the system and I am of the view that the system must be changed in order that their contribution might be recognised. They are not given any credit in terms of the recruitment process - the most recent round of which has just been completed - and neither is their service or input acknowledged. This is a matter to which we must give consideration in the context of the legislation that is coming down the tracks. Reservists perform the same duties as fully attested members of the force on an unremunerated basis, and many of them do so in the hope and with the intent of fully progressing to the full-time ranks An Garda Síochána. The contribution made by these people is both ignored and undervalued.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> The notion of establishing a criminal justice inspectorate must be taken on board and considered in a serious manner. We already have a number of self-contained inspectorates, including that operated by the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention and the Garda Inspectorate. If we had an overarching criminal justice inspectorate, it would be of great assistance in the context of the operation of the criminal justice system and its component parts, namely, the courts, the prisons, the Probation Service, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Garda Síochána and GSOC. All of the entities to which I refer play their part in the context of the criminal justice system. Unfortunately, however, there are many cracks between these different component parts. If there was an overarching inspectorate which could advise and attempt to fill the cracks to which I refer, it would be of major assistance. The inspectorates that are already in place have done fine work. We are aware, for example, of all the good reports produced by the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, Mr. Michael Reilly, a former judge, and of the fact that Chief Inspector Bob Olson of the Garda Inspectorate has produced some very fine recommendations, many of which have been acted upon. The establishment of an overarching criminal justice inspectorate which could focus in particular on the role the courts play within the criminal system would be a welcome development. Over 600,000 out of a total of 1.6 million summonses were not served between 2009 and 2012. There would have been genuine reasons why a number of these were not served - for example, if the person to whom a particular summons referred had left the country or resided outside the jurisdiction. No one has been held accountable for the failure to deliver the summonses to which I refer. The fact that they were not served resulted in a huge loss of revenue to the State. This is one of the reasons we need an overarching inspectorate.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> There are more than 300 cases involving allegations of misconduct or malpractice on the part of some members of An Garda Síochána with the panel of counsel for review. I and other Deputies on all sides of the House referred a number of those cases to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald. The latter informed me that the panel, which comprises two senior counsel and a number of junior counsel, is going about its work. I am raising this issue again because the people to whom I have been speaking in the context of some of the cases I referred to the Taoiseach and the Minister are unhappy because they have not been met in person by the panel of counsel. What is happening is that desk reviews are being carried out in respect of the paperwork which has been submitted. Many of those involved cannot afford to pay to have written submissions drafted on their behalf. In addition, they may not themselves be capable of presenting their cases in the most full or informed manner. There is no doubt that these individuals have stories to tell. I am of the view that in order to satisfy those who have made allegations and submitted the relevant paperwork to the Department of Justice and Equality should, at a minimum, be met by the senior counsel on the panel and afforded the opportunity to recount their stories. If a person is making a social welfare appeal, he or she has the option of an oral hearing and can meet an appeals officer face to face. The avenue of appeal relating to the panel of counsel is one for people who feel they have not received justice. I am going to pursue this matter at every opportunity because I am of the view that those who have made allegations should be afforded the opportunity to have face-to-face meetings with the senior counsel involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_124">I thank the committee for doing a great deal of work on this issue. It is unfortunate that there are no Opposition spokespersons or Members present, although I see that one Independent Deputy has just entered the Chamber. It would be helpful if Opposition spokespersons who have asked questions in respect of commonage areas and who have sought to understand the Government's approach to the matter were here, particularly as there are many positive things to say. From the perspective of my party and that of the Government, commonage farming is a big priority. We want to ensure that commonages will be looked after into the future and that they will be managed primarily by farmers' actually farming them, which is the best way - from the point of view of the environment, biodiversity and the need to retain people on the land in rural areas - to proceed in respect of them. We are very serious about achieving our goals in this regard in the immediate, medium and long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> Commonage lands form an important part of the farming enterprises of many farmers, particularly along the west coast. They also form an important part of the local environment from the point of view of biodiversity, wildlife, amenities and economic returns - for example, from tourism. There is a substantial risk of land abandonment as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. Under-grazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under direct aid and agri-environment schemes and to the risk of imposition of financial corrections by the European Commission. The farming of commonage lands has a long tradition in Ireland. It is, by its very nature, a complex area. There are issues about the legal right to claim and there have always been disputes with regard to the grazing relating to commonages. In the vast majority of cases, however, commonage shareholders work well together on a co-operative basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> The experience since the single farm payment was introduced in 2005 is that there is a growing problem of commonage land being abandoned by farmers. This is not good for the environment because these areas lose the specific characteristics as natural habitats for flora and fauna. In addition, the creeping ineligibility of these lands under the single farm payment scheme and other direct payment schemes poses a significant risk to the State in view of the risk of the imposition of financial corrections by the European Commission. There was also a need to replace the now outdated and no longer valid commonage grazing destocking plans, which were drawn up in the late 1990s to deal with the then over-grazing problem arising from the number of sheep maintained on the hills in order to maximise farmers' payments under the coupled ewe premium scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> It has been made clear that the intention is to achieve this by working with the farmers directly managing their lands and working with relevant agencies as well as the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders. It will not be an easy task but it is achievable if we work together on a co-operative basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> Each year approximately 4.7 million hectares of eligible land is declared by applicants under the direct aid and agri-environment schemes. Of that area, in excess of 330,000 ha of commonage lands have been declared, representing 7% of the total area declared. In 2012, almost 15,000 applicants declared commonage lands, equivalent to approximately 11% of scheme applicants.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> Commonage lands in Ireland are mainly situated along the western coast, particularly in Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry. The area of commonage lands in these counties is set out as follows and comprises almost 71% of the total commonage land declared: Mayo, 84,000 ha; Kerry, 54,000 ha; Donegal, 51,000 ha; and Galway, 45,000 ha. Commonage lands include upland and lowland grazing habitats. These lands have been used mainly for the maintenance of sheep flocks. Cattle are also grazed in some commonages, as are other animals such as Kerry bog ponies and Connemara ponies. Such traditional farming methods will be catered for in the outcome of any process.</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> At present, commonage lands in Ireland can benefit from aid payments under the single payment scheme, the disadvantaged areas scheme, the grassland sheep scheme, the rural environment protection scheme or the agri-environment options scheme. In many cases, farmers are benefiting from four payments for the same area of commonage lands, namely, the SPS, the DAS, the GSS and REPS or AEOS. The funding for these schemes comes from Pillar 1 or Pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy. A primary requirement of EU regulations governing these schemes is that the lands benefiting from aid are maintained in good agricultural and environmental condition. While over-grazing is still an issue in some known areas, the main problem facing us now is the under-grazing of commonages. A variety of factors have led to the development of this problem. One was the introduction of decoupled payments in 2005, when we went from one extreme in some areas to the opposite - that is to say, there were too many sheep and now there are too few, although the profile has been improving somewhat in recent years. The age profile of farmers with commonage lands is also an issue. Low market returns resulting in reduced livestock numbers has been a factor. More attractive returns from off-farm income during the Celtic tiger era made a major difference, but obviously that has changed somewhat in the past seven years.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> Under the reformed CAP regime, which was agreed during the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, it was decided that direct payments should be more focused on active farmers. In this regard, it will be necessary for all farmers who apply for aid under the basic payment scheme to have an agricultural activity on each land parcel for which they are claiming aid. In the case of marginal land, including commonages, this can only be achieved by grazing that land. Member states are obliged to set requirements for the maintenance of such lands.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> I have decided to set a relatively modest requirement under the Pillar 1 schemes and under the areas of natural constraint scheme - what farmers know as the DAS - for maintaining marginal land. The grazing requirement, which must be met by all applicants under the basic payment scheme, is fixed at one ewe per one and a half hectares. A lower level will be set for commonages where it is necessary from an environmental point of view. Blanket bogs are an example of such sensitive commonages. To provide flexibility for farmers who benefit from payments for commonage lands that they claim but do not graze for commonage, I decided that such applicants had until December 2015 to obtain the animals for grazing the commonage. In other words, they have plenty of time to introduce a modest stocking level on the lands that they are farming.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> With a view to having a system to meet the requirements of the basic payment and areas of natural constraint schemes, which will be implemented in 2015, my Department will be writing to all commonage claimants in the coming weeks setting out individual grazing requirements for marginal lands. The claimants will have the right to submit an assessment by a professional planner providing alternative figures if they consider that the figures provided would not meet the requirements of their commonage.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> As I have already stated, the only way to manage the vast majority of commonages, whether upland or lowland commonages, is to graze them. The <i>status quo</i> is no longer an option in some areas. If action is not taken now the areas will continue to deteriorate, which will lead to more land abandonment. If this is allowed to happen we will lose a valuable resource from the point of view of farming, the rural economy, biodiversity and wildlife. Grazing is the only method of managing much of this land.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> The eligibility requirements will not be achieved unless farmers actually manage these lands and are given a role in this regard. They have the knowledge and are aware of the most effective methods in their areas, which they understand best.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> It is worth noting, especially given recent public commentary and debates, that, currently, farmers with commonages receive €97 million in the single farm payment scheme each year. Under convergence as part of the new Common Agricultural Policy, a total of 12,000 of the 15,000 commonage farmers will benefit.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">Deputy Ó Cuív will have his opportunity to speak. Under the new CAP, a farmer with 42 ha of commonage can benefit by over €14,600 per annum if he or she participates under the single farm payment, ANC and GLAS schemes, and €16,600 if he or she benefits from GLAS plus. Such an applicant could satisfy the requirement of all schemes by grazing approximately 40 sheep.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine was published in July 2013. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_144">We recommend that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht would consider the findings and recommendations of the report. We believe the evidence and contributions from both the witnesses and the members offer a valuable insight to designing pragmatic proposals for a workable policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">The main issues identified within the report are as follows: optimum stocking rates tailored for individual commonages, to which we have responded; the effects of dormancy on preparing a management plan, to which we have also responded; collective arrangements, co-ownership and the possible impact of imposing collective responsibility, as opposed to a co-operative approach; burning and the rules pertaining, to allow for responsible burning as part of a commonage upland vegetation management plan; and a recommendation for output-driven models as an approach to achieving the objectives of commonage framework plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> Much progress has been made since the publication of the report. As I announced last July, the new agri-environment scheme, GLAS, with funding of €1.45 billion over the lifetime of the rural development programme, will provide for a maximum payment of €5,000 for up to 50,000 farmers. The targeted structure of the scheme has been refined following public consultation. The preservation and restoration of commonages and the continuation of suitable and environmentally friendly farming practices on the hills are key objectives under the new GLAS scheme. In recognition of the importance of commonages, hill farmers will get priority access to GLAS. In particular, the requirement for 80% of active farmers to participate in collective action on commonage has been replaced by a 50% rate, applying to either 50% of active farmers or 50% of the total commonage land area. I established the independently chaired commonage implementation committee to address issues that arise in practice, and it is working actively.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> The annual rate of €120 per hectare will apply for the GLAS actions applicable on commonages.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">This is a substantial increase on the €75 rate available under the AEOS. There is no imposition of minimum or maximum stocking densities and smaller commonages of less than ten hectares in size will not be subject to any minimum participation requirement. On commonages of that size farmers can enter GLAS in their own right. The minimum 50% participation requirement is achievable and workable. However, where real difficulties are being encountered, the farmers concerned can make a case to the commonage implementation committee for entry to the scheme. If it is clear that the farmer or farmers concerned have made every effort to meet the requirement but have failed through no fault of their own, they will not be locked out of GLAS.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> Some farmers have stated to me they cannot all work with the same planner, that they have different planners and would like to be able to apply using their own. That is acceptable as long as they comply with a single commonage GLAS plan submitted by one planner. If other planners are involved, that is fine as long as they ensure the farmers farm in a manner consistent with the GLAS plan for the commonage. This has been worked out through discussion and negotiation to try to be helpful on a workable basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> The joint committee recommended that my Department avoid an unnecessarily prescriptive approach and that the minimum and maximum figures be used for guidance rather than being mandatory. The National Parks and Wildlife Service, working in conjunction with my Department, undertook an exercise which resulted in a grazing plan for each commonage. There was essentially a minimum and a maximum stocking density for each commonage. However, while these figures will be made available to commonage planners, it will be on the basis that they are essentially a guide. This is precisely in line with the joint committee's recommendation. The planner will have flexibility to put forward alternative figures if they can be supported on environmental grounds. The choice of GLAS actions included in the plan is a matter for the planner and the commonage farmers, but the actions must be such that they deliver an environmental improvement and they must be above the pillar 1 baseline which is a requirement of the new regulations. The scheme must be credible to the European Commission and shown to deliver clear environmental benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> I urge all commonage farmers to look closely at the options open to them. Active farmers on commonages who participate in the GLAS scheme, as well as the basic payment scheme and the areas of natural constraints scheme, can benefit from a payment of over €360 per hectare of commonage land up to 34 hectares. This is a significant reward for farming such land. In order to make farmers fully aware of the options open to them, my Department has arranged for information meetings to be held this week and next week in areas with significant tracts of commonage land, from County Donegal to west Cork and from County Wicklow to County Louth. I want farmers to actively participate in order that together we will work through any difficulty that there might be to ensure farmers believe the schemes we will be opening in the next few months are workable, practical and reflect the realities on the ground on farms and in commonage areas.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinHeydon" eId="spk_31">
          <from>Deputy Martin Heydon<recordedTime time="2014-10-03T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_152">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the "Report on Review of Commonage Lands and Framework Management Plans" of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, of which I am a member. The committee Chairman, Deputy Andrew Doyle, has been inadvertently delayed but will be with us shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> The report represents a timely review, following on the draft guidelines sent by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on the management of commonage lands, and looks at the future use of commonage lands. Let us be honest as so much time has passed since - it is easy to forget that the draft plans and the particularly prescriptive method to find solutions caused consternation and concern around the country. The work of the committee involved bringing in the relevant stakeholders, holding a series of meetings and teasing out from where each side was coming, their concerns, the net objectives and whether the committee could make recommendations to get to the end goal in as collaborative a way as possible. The committee held seven hearings, taking submissions from numerous stakeholders. One aim was to have a clear definition of "commonage" because we quickly realised it was a loose term. It is used to describe where lands are either owned or farmed, or even both, by more than one farmer or stakeholder.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> One of the main issues we identified was related to optimum stocking rates. The Minister has outlined how undergrazing is a considerable problem. Originally, overgrazing was a significant issue. Previous Government policies to tackle that issue had a knock-on impact and went too far, leading to undergrazing; it was about trying to find a workable balance. </p>
          <p eId="para_155"> Other issues included the effects on dormancy in preparing a management plan; collective arrangements and co-ownership; the possible impact of imposing collective responsibility, as opposed to a co-operative approach; the rules pertaining to burning to allow for responsible burning as part of a commonage-upland vegetation management plan; and output driven models as an approach to achieving the objectives of commonage framework plans. We are glad that we have made so much progress and delighted that the Department has taken these issues on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> I acknowledge all of the delegates who gave of their time to submit detailed submissions, come before the committee and give us their valuable insight to designing pragmatic proposals for a workable policy. That is what we are working towards.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> It is worth looking at the recommendations of the committee to see how many of them have since been adopted and led to a much more pragmatic approach being dopted. The first recommendation was "that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine treat the improvement of commonages as a priority in order to remedy environmental damage sustained due to earlier policies, as a means to counter falling farm incomes in deprived areas, and as a measure to promote rural economic and social development". This takes cognisance of and allows for the importance of the 4,500 commonages around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> The committee recommended that we identify and assess the effects of dormancy and changing farming methods, with specific reference, for example, to the supplementary feeding of ewes and hoggets, on patterns of under and overgrazing. As I stated, we sought clarity on use of the term "commonage" for the purposes of grants and payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> The committee noted the compulsory de-stocking requirement which was not a requirement of the good agricultural and environmental conditions, GAECs, for the purposes of single farm payments and that compensation above this amount had to be paid to farmers if the Department wished to impose these de-stocking requirements on them. This matter was highlighted.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> We recommended that the management of commonages be promoted through output-driven schemes that took careful account of the insights and requirements of those who owned or managed commonages and to avoid unnecessarily prescriptive approaches - to avoid the one-size-fits-all approach. There is that level of flexibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> I will focus somewhat on recommendation No. 7, which states: "Commends to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine the approaches adopted by the BurrenLIFE Project". Representatives of the project gave the committee a detailed and interesting account of its work. I am delighted that the Minister is with us today to enable me to have the opportunity to highlight how impressive is the work of the BurrenLIFE Project. The recommendation continued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_162">This is an output-driven scheme that has provided considerable environmental, agricultural, social and economic benefits in a way that appears to be efficient and effective. Such schemes will encourage the management of the commonages along co-operative lines so as to reduce the problems caused by dormancy or disagreement among shareholders, and promote the involvement of younger farmers and other young unemployed people.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">What I would be looking for is the roll-out of output-driven schemes, over and beyond the BurrenLIFE project. There is considerable potential in this regard. In my area of Kildare South there is one of the most recognisable commonages in the country - the 5,000 acres that make up the Curragh plains. It is an outwash plain of historical and environmental significance to the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">It is also a 5,000 acre expanse one hour from Dublin that is a phenomenal resource. I passionately feel that we do not use it nearly enough for tourism and recreation. </p>
          <p eId="para_165"> Examining the model of an output-driven scheme that was achieved in the Burren, it is different to some extent, but there are lessons to be learned from that positive scheme. Those lessons can be used in places such as the Curragh. In that way we can adopt a collaborative approach with the relevant stakeholders, including sheep farmers, to address their concerns. In addition, we must look at the challenges involved in properly maintaining the Curragh and managing it better than heretofore. There are various stakeholders on the Curragh, including the Department of Defence, which is the lead State body with responsibility for the Curragh plains. In that regard, it is positive that our Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine also holds the defence portfolio. It provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to bring various State Departments together in order to work on this matter collaboratively. I have discussed this with the Minister previously and I know he shares my vision and passion for trying to bring about improved circumstances on the Curragh.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> As well as having responsibility for the sheep industry, the Minister also deals with the equine sector. The Curragh racecourse is well-known, but there are many stable yards based there too. That situation brings challenges with it in addition to huge potential, particularly for tourism. </p>
          <p eId="para_167"> Salisbury Plain in England has similarities with the Curragh, including a military base. We could examine that location and try to learn from it. Issues affecting the Curragh include over-grazing, illegal encampments and illegal dumping, but these can be improved through better management. Sheep farmers face challenges including the need for extra sheep grids on the Curragh to ensure the animals do not wander off the plains. Stray sheep can cause problems for both local residents and those passing through. </p>
          <p eId="para_168"> It should be recognised that the Curragh is hugely beneficial for our country and could be used an awful lot more. It will involve our working together as stakeholders to face those challenges and see how we can deal with them pragmatically, as was done in the Burren. I look forward to working with the Minister and the relevant Departments in order to bring that about. </p>
          <p eId="para_169"> Recognition is due to the various Ministers who contributed to this report, as well as their departmental officials. They took on board the work that went into the report, which is having a big impact. This report played an integral role in the progression from the draft guidelines to the final version. It has left us facing a much better environment concerning commonages, with a clear plan for the future. I commend the report to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_32">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2014-10-03T11:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_170">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the report by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the review of commonage lands and framework management plans. The report was published in mid-2013 and things have moved along significantly since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> The previous policy was to de-stock commonages and prevent damage. The thinking was that if animals were taken off commonages to stop overgrazing, things would correct themselves. However, following the evidence heard at the joint committee, we have now had to reverse that policy. In many commonage areas land is now being undergrazed and, thus, the policy was not having the desired impact. The idea of the commonage plan now is to graze such lands properly in order to maintain them without their being either under or overgrazed. That is the outcome that everybody wants to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Since the rural development plan was published, there has been a huge backlash from hill farmers who are concerned about the impact it will have both on them and on commonage farmers. There may be lessons for the joint committee concerning who gave evidence to it before the report was drafted. We should re-examine that matter. Hill farmers across the country feel that the IFA did not represent their views or their case in making submissions about the new rural development plan. The joint committee needs to consider whether we can broaden the scope of whom we talk to and obtain evidence from in order to inform our decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> A number of issues that arose over the summer were dealt with by some of the evidence to the joint committee, particularly concerning collective agreements, which have sparked so much controversy. Potential problems were identified by many hill farmers whereby the failure of one party to fulfil an obligation can result in other parties having to go to the trouble or expense of remedying the outstanding matter themselves. Where a conditional payment is prejudiced by the actions of a minority of shareholders, the entire group can face a collective sanction.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Many farmers are concerned about the 50% requirement to enter the GLAS scheme with commonage land. Having met with the implementation committee, the hill farmers' action group felt it had achieved a resolution of this issue. However, it was quite worrying to read that farmers walked out of a meeting in Maam Cross on Tuesday or Wednesday night because they felt the Department was rowing back on what they had agreed with the implementation committee. I ask the Minister to clarify that matter to ensure that farmers are fully aware of what has been agreed. In that way, there will be no misunderstanding. Otherwise it will raise difficult problems for farmers in the next year or two in accessing the GLAS and GLAS plus schemes, as well as sorting out single farm payments. </p>
          <p eId="para_175"> The implications and future impact of decisions on commonages can be quite technical and complicated. The Minister says that 50% of farmers whose livestock are actively grazing commonage land can enter the GLAS scheme. If they do not reach the 50% figure they can approach the implementation body, but what does that mean? What will the outworkings of that be? If farmers seek clarification on this matter from the implementation body, will they be able to participate because they have made an effort to attain the 50% figure, although it is out of their control?</p>

          <p eId="para_180">The question is how long that will take and how long will the process be drawn out. It will be difficult to manage in a lot of cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> Farmers who are claiming land and commonage as part of the single farm payment now will be required to graze that land in future in order to retain the payment for that land. That, in turn, will lead to difficulties in commonages and hills because individual stocking requirements will be very small for the relevant commonage. In the overall commonage scheme, it is impossible to manage a small amount of stock in such an area. That point should be re-examined and teased out a bit further.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> I do not know what the answer is, but it should not be beyond us to come up with solutions to achieve a workable management plan that is to everyone's satisfaction. That can only be done, however, through consultation and dialogue. The implementation committee is the body to do that and make recommendations to the Department on how to resolve those issues. Those matters need to be addressed so that farmers can buy into the rural development programme and the GLAS scheme, which are necessary to maintain their incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> Drawing up the report on the commonage plan was a useful process. We need to examine the consultation process closer for future reports and deal with the issues faced by farmers at present. I ask the Minister to examine the issues associated with the technical aspects and how farmers can comply. He should come up with solutions that satisfy as many people as possible, if not everybody.</p>

          <p eId="para_184">Táim buíoch as an seans seo chun cúpla focal a rá maidir leis an tuairisc. I am not a member of the agriculture committee. However, I attended a number of the meetings held at the time in question. They were very interesting and I am sorry I did not get to attend all of them. They were very informative and led to the formulation of this report. </p>
          <p eId="para_185"> As a former REPS planner, I am very familiar with commonages and the various schemes implemented in recent years, including REPS 1, REPS 2, REPS 3, REPS 4, the AEOS and, latterly, GLAS. As I said at a meeting in Westport, the bar has been raised consistently higher over the years because what were optional measures under REPS 1 suddenly became mandatory requirements under the code of good farm practice, requiring that land be kept in good agricultural condition. That is why standards have to rise. Having spoken to departmental officials during the time of the previous Government, I learned that even getting REPS 4 over the line was difficult because a considerable costing exercise applied to all of the basic measures and extra measures farmers had to take to qualify. It is becoming increasingly difficult to put these schemes by the Commission. That is why GLAS has generated a certain amount of difficulty. The Department has to be cognisant of the requirements of the Commission and has had to ask how it can get a scheme over the line and what needs to be done in that regard, bearing in mind that farmers are being paid. To qualify for the single farm payment and disadvantaged areas schemes for commonages, they have to do that little extra. This is to be expected considering that farmers had to take on additional options when they progressed from REPS 1 to REPS 4.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> Regarding the report, I commend all those who have been involved much more than I have been. I include all members of the committee, the Chairman, Deputy Andrew Doyle, and others. On behalf of the IFA in counties Galway and Mayo, I invited a delegation to meet the Minister in departmental offices to discuss a number of options in 2012. This preceded the issuing of the minimum and maximum stocking figures, or perhaps it was just after their publication in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>. Their publication led to considerable concern about commonages. Farmers felt their payment would drop from €100 to €30, for example, if every farmer was required to hold a minimum number of sheep on a hill. I am thankful that the Department did not send letters on behalf of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. If it had, there would have been war. It held back, but the figures were still published in the <i>Irish Farmers Journa</i>l and there was much concern about them.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> At the time of the discussion with the IFA, it was said nothing would be implemented without a liaison group. This led to the commonage implementation group, which we are discussing. Let me, first, address a few issues in the report and the proposals being considered by the Department. One is to increase the stocking of sheep on commonage lands as a means of addressing undergrazing. Problems associated with undergrazing have been exacerbated in recent years. Destocking took place, as was right and required, but, unfortunately, there was probably too much of it. In certain areas the fact that older farmers are not farming the hills to the extent that they might results in these problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> With regard to the prescribed minimum and maximum stocking levels for individual commonages, there is a focus on payments to active farmers. This is a tricky matter because there are commonages that are being actively grazed by a number of farmers but not all of them. I have expressed the view previously that if a commonage on a hill is able to take 300 sheep and there are ten shares, with none dormant and three farmers with 100 sheep each on the hill, that hill is being farmed correctly and being kept in good agricultural condition. That should be the end of the matter. The Minister expressed concern that the Commission would not allow payment for the farmers claiming a single farm payment on the land but who were not actively farming it. I do not know whether this has been clarified, but if the hill is being farmed correctly, that should be the basis of our position on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_192">If farmers have to increase stocking density – many do and some have been destocked for a period – there is a need for a lead-in period over a number of years. The Minister appreciates that one cannot just go down to Maam Cross and buy 100 ewes or hoggets and put up on a hill; they will wander everywhere unless they are bred there. The stock needs to be bred rather than bought in.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> Owing to undergrazing, the issue of burning arises. It is worth noting that the requirements and allowances in the United Kingdom are different from those here. There is an additional six weeks up to the middle of April in the United Kingdom. This could be explored, if only for a short period, be it only for one year or two. Is there any reason we have higher standards than those that apply in the United Kingdom on this issue? Where there is undergrazing, sheep will not be able to return heather to a positive state, regardless of how many there are.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> Burren farming was mentioned. I am sorry I missed the presentation by the individuals from the Burren. When the designations were first issued, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, or Dúchas, or whatever it was called at the time, decided it knew what was best. It decided that all cattle had to come down from the hills in the Burren. What happened was that the hazel scrub grew. It took a number of years before the authorities appreciated that the farmers' practice was correct all along. During the early spring the cattle ate the hazel and prevented its growth, which would obviously have an impact on the limestone pavement, flora and fauna. The farmers knew best and that must be accepted in this case also. The best award-winning lowland farmer would not know what to do if asked to farm on top of a hill. It is a quite specialised and different farming system.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> Recommendation No. 8 caught my eye. The committee urged the Department to make use of all available funding mechanisms to incentivise farmer-led improvements. It has been argued that schemes such as BurrenLIFE, in conjunction with existing REP schemes and the AEOS, should be open to all commonages where at least 80% of active farmers participate in the scheme. That is the first time I saw the reference to the figure of 80%. Obviously, the Department has been pushing it, but it appeared in the report. Perhaps this was where it felt it could go ahead in terms of GLAS. I am thankful it has rowed back and reduced the figure to 50%. I was at a meeting in Westport during the summer and was the only Government representative at it. It was quite heated, with the heat directed against both the Department and the IFA. I have been in liaison with the Minister and the local IFA representatives to try to sort out some of the issues of concern regarding GLAS.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> I did not get to Maam Cross on Wednesday. It was a farmers’ information meeting, rather than a politicians' meeting, which is why I did not go. Other than that, I have no problem attending a public meeting; I have gone to enough of them to defend the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_198">She was there and I am sure she spoke glowingly of me, as always. I am sorry I missed the meeting, but I contacted a few people who were at it. There has been some concern about this matter. As the meeting broke up at 11.30 p.m., it was time to go home at that stage. Having spoken to planners and farmers, I note there is some concern about the Westport meeting and what was agreed and is now agreed. The most important point is that we get farmers into GLAS in order that they will be paid. The commencement date is early and there is still concern about the management plans. In fairness to the IFA, with which I have been dealing, it has come a long way. Before the summer recess, when we were having debates on GLAS, the position was to have no collective agreement under any circumstance. In the interim, it has moved towards stating it will accept that it can implement collective agreements on getting farmers into GLAS but that there must be a proper lead-in period.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> Some of the planners to whom I spoke after their meeting in Westport on Tuesday expressed concerns about the implementation of the scheme and about the number of planners available. Following the meeting in Westport in August, people understood they could apply as an individual, but that over the course of the year they could give an assurance that they would comply with a combined management plan for the commonage. This seems to be the sticking point now. They feel that according to Department officials, this is not the situation and that they must now be included in the commonage management plan first. People also feel they need a lead from the Department in terms of naming a planner for each commonage or getting the Department to draw up the plan for the commonage.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> As the Minister said, it would not require significant work to get agreement from farmers on who the planner might be. They have been dealing with different planners over the years which would make it difficult for them to decide on one planner. Perhaps, therefore, the Department could have a role in that. The main concern is the difficulty that exists for commonage farmers who want and need to be part of the scheme to become part of it. I hope the issues relating to GLAS can be ironed out shortly.</p>

          <p eId="para_205">The Department's figures indicate that 50% of the farmers who farm commonage lands do not own sheep and that this means that 50% of farmers are not grazing the hills. This is a subject Deputy Kyne would know about and that I know about as a Deputy representing Galway West. The Minister is now telling us that the farmers who are claiming the hill, but who have cattle on the lowland, will not be able to get single farm payment on that hill land. That single farm payment would, effectively, be double their payment on the lowland, which means the gains the Minister mentioned are illusory, like most of the gains he speaks about. Not alone that, they will not be able to get areas of natural constraint, ANC, or disadvantaged areas scheme, DAS, payments on that land.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">In an area like Connemara, this represents approximately 50% of farmers and will take a possible €3 million of ANC, DAS and single farm payments out of Connemara. It will remove €15 million from farmers nationally and will have a huge effect on the economy. Deputy Kyne and I are both arguing that the farmers should be allowed to sort this out among themselves and that as long as farmers make sure the hills are kept in good agricultural condition, it will be their business who puts animals and what animals are put on the hill.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> Let us take as an example a commonage of 500 hectares, over 1,000 acres. Let us presume 100 farmers are entitled to that commonage, which allows 5 hectares for each farmer.</p>

If all the farmers must put up four sheep, they will have to chase the four sheep around the 1,000 acres of mountain in order to dip them, shear them etc. In the meantime, those who had significant flocks of 100 or 150 sheep - a viable amount - on the hill, must destock dramatically if other farmers take up the option being forced on them by the Department. Then everybody on the hill will wind up with an unviable flock. This is what the Minister is doing here. Deputy Kyne explained this to the Minister in his gentle way and it is the nub of the issue.</p>

Furthermore, I am astounded by the number of times the Minister mentioned "undergrazing". He mentioned the causes of undergrazing, but he did not mention the greatest cause of undergrazing, which was not a lack of interest on the part of farmers in putting sheep on the hills, but due to prescriptions from the National Parks and Wildlife Service that widely destocked the hills and prevented farmers from keeping an adequate number of stock on the hills. This was an issue I argued about when in government and I spent days discussing the matter with the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This is the reason there is undergrazing, not that farmers are unwilling to put sheep on the hills.</p>

          <p eId="para_222"> I was amused by the Minister saying that farmers "obtain" the sheep. Where are they meant to buy them? Are they to buy them in a mart? If a farmer buys sheep from Gleanntreig, a valley at the back of Cnoc Breac, between Cornamona and Tourmakeady and puts them on a hill in Recess or Maam, the sheep will travel across the mountain to wherever they were born.

          <p eId="para_226">I explained this issue at the meeting in Maam Cross because the officials did not seem to understand it. The average lambing rate on a hill is approximately 70% and generally half of the lambs born are male and half of them are female. This gives us 35 lambs per 100. Farmers lose 10% of their lambs per annum through natural mortality on hills when we take good years versus bad years, which gives us 25 lambs per 100. As well as this, farmers must replace their cast ewes every year. These ewes are getting too old to survive on the hills and are sold onto the lowlands. This means another ten are gone. Therefore, out of every 100 ewes a farmer has, his net increase in ewe lambs, if he is lucky, is approximately 15 ewe lambs.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> From where, therefore, are all the mythical ewes that farmers are going to need to comply with the Minister's great plan going to come? How and from whom are farmers to "obtain" them?</p>

          <p eId="para_230">In regard to GLAS, the collective agreement as proposed will not work, and I believe it would be open to legal challenge. It was fascinating to hear officials from the Department say at the meeting the other day in Mount Cross that they are now belatedly seeking legal advice on that agreement. They also said that only 50% agreement is needed to lock-split a commonage. Had they checked with the land commission section of the Department they would know that 100% agreement is needed. Deputy Kyne will be aware of the recently divided commonage in Moycullen. It took 20 years to achieve this because of the Department's insistence that even where people obtained sites and got nominal shares in a commonage, this needed to be legally agreed by everybody. Deputy Kyne might give the Minister the reference of the commonage in question. The Minister will then see that it is not possible to act on majority in a commonage. It has always been the view of the Land Commission and the Department that 100% agreement is required. It is vital that the Department take responsibility, in terms of the legalities and cost, for drawing up the commonage plans for GLAS on each commonage and that it do so in partnership with the local farmers. What I am saying is that the Department should commission, prepare and pay for the plans in partnership with local farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> We also found out at the meeting in Mount Cross that if a farmer was to join a commonage through some mythical arrangement in order that he or she could join GLAS next year and if other farmers signed up to AEOS were to sit out the remaining two or three years of their AEOS plan because for one reason or another they did not want to join GLAS next year, when they did choose to do so, they would only be paid under GLAS for the remaining two or three years from the date the first farmer joined. That is what was said at the meeting in Mount Cross. That is totally unfair and will set neighbour against neighbour. A farmer currently in AEOS will not cut off his nose to spite his face and allow another farmer who left REPS to sign up to GLAS, because in doing so he would lose two or three years' payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> Another amazing statement is that payment under GLAS amounts to €5,000. The payment per hectare is €120. As such, to get €5,000 one would have to have 42 hectares. Farmers with low single farm payments have small farms. Despite what is said, there are few enormous farmers in Connemara. The vast majority of farmers there have small farms.</p>

          <p eId="para_234">For example, reference was made by the departmental officials to most farmers having only eight hectares, which means they would be paid less than €1,000 under GLAS. The impression that there is €5,000 available does not stack up.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">How many hill sheep or cattle farmers are on the commonage implementation body? Following the issuance of a diktat from the Department in respect of stocking levels, without prior consultation with farmers, will farmers, who probably know better than most professional planners who, in the main, grew up on low land farms, be required to pay for the planner to rebut the Department's proposals in relation to the stocking and farming capacity of their own hills?</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael McNamara<recordedTime time="2014-10-03T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_237">I commend the Minister on coming to the House today for this timely and important date on the issue of commonages. Today's debate is based on the report of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the review of commonage lands and framework management lands. I commend the Chairman of that committee, Deputy Andrew Doyle, under whose chairmanship that review took place. The volume of work being done by that committee under his chairmanship is testament to his industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> A number of hearings attended by various stakeholders gave rise to this report, the most pertinent body in that regard being the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The BurrenLIFE group also gave testimony to the hearings. Obviously, commonages are as important a part of farming in Clare as they are across much of the west of Ireland and in County Kildare. However, commonages are not in any way limited to the Burren. There are many upland commonages close to where I live in east Clare which are affected by the proposals recently announced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> If the evidence from BurrenLIFE taught us anything it is that a prescriptive plan from a governmental organisation, be that the National Parks and Wildlife Service or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, does not necessarily work and often does not work. Commonages in the Burren have been farmed in a particular way for generations. Those who farm that land have a vested interest in ensuring it is farmed properly. As pointed out by Deputy Kyne, those who farm the commonages in Connemara have a vested interest in ensuring that land is farmed properly and is not under-grazed or over-grazed, and that the potential to farm it is maximised. Farmers who have been doing this for generations know best. What the BurrenLIFE project did was empower those farmers to seek a solution, which they did, that was acceptable to the Department and Europe and worked a great deal better than previous plans introduced by government officials, albeit well-intentioned and well-meaning government officials. </p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Like Deputies Ó Cuív and Kyne, I propose to focus on the issue of dormancy and what is proposed. The report we are discussing states that the Department was anxious to focus payments under the CFP on active farmers and so help to revitalise rural life in areas where there has been a significant fall-off in the farming population. How this is done is what is at issue. The Minister has interjected a couple of times during this debate to make the point that a commonage without livestock is not being farmed. That is only one interpretation. The Minister appeared to indicate that that interpretation is required under European Union law. I take this opportunity to point to another alternative, a Welsh model, the Glastir Commons 2014 explanatory book, which is expressly approved by the European Union in that there is a European logo and the following title displayed thereon: "The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development: Europe Investing in Rural Areas". According to this booklet, the objective is to maintain 80% of active graziers on the contract land throughout the contract period. Active graziers are defined as commoners with rights who turn out stock to graze the common land, which is in line with the Minister's proposal; commoners who are not exercising rights of common because they have agreed to withdraw their stock under a management agreement; commoners who have recently ceased to exercise their rights of common because, for example, of control measures during foot-and-mouth disease - tuberculosis would be another example in the Irish context, if one is speaking about cattle rather than sheep; and persons who graze non-registered unenclosed land, defined within the booklet as eligible land to enter the scheme. I am not aware of much non-registered unenclosed land in my constituency. The issue then is those who have a right to the commonage but who withdraw their land as part of a management agreement and whether they can continue to be considered active graziers. The Minister appeared to indicate that they cannot. I would urge that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine consider the Welsh model in that it would appear that under this model, which appears to have been expressly approved by the European Union, such people are still considered to be active graziers. That is not to say that the people who withdraw their stock under a management agreement-----</p>

          <p eId="para_248">For the purposes of a single farm payment, one must be an active farmer. I am not saying that non-active farmers should be able to claim in respect of a commonage. However, the great majority of farmers who farm commonages, certainly in my constituency in Clare and I believe across most of Ireland, also farm lands that are not commonages and which they own entirely. Even if it is not on a particular commonage, once they are active farmers and engage in best farming practice on the commonage, they can avail of it. As Deputies Kyne and Ó Cuív outlined and as is common sense, if there are 100 farmers with a part share in a commonage, it would not be best farming practice for all of them to keep five ewes up there. It is possibly best farming practice for three of them to keep a large flock of ewes because it ensures that best farming practice is adhered to in that portion of land and that it does not involve having one ewe from 100 different flocks up there every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> Once somebody is an active farmer somewhere and once best farming practice is adhered to under a grazing agreement, it needs to be examined whether this land is land farmed for the purpose of the single farm payment moreover and whether that could be used to qualify for GLAS or any other scheme the Minister might be minded to introduce in respect of commonages because we must recognise the reality that exists across Ireland. In respect of 100 persons with a share in a commonage, 50 of whom are active farmers, possibly only ten might graze that particular commonage but this does not mean that the 50 active farmers are ensuring that best farming practice is adhered to on that portion of the land in which they have a common share. This must be the central criterion from an agricultural perspective but also from an environmental perspective because part of what the commonages offer is the fact that they are a very important environmental asset in this State. All of our land is not just an asset for those who own and farm it. It is an asset for the broader public and there is an important environmental good to be looked at in making sure that best farming practice is adhered to regardless of whether it is in the Wicklow uplands, Slieve Aughty or the Burren. The Burren is an important tourist resource not because of how it is farmed but rather because of the rare geological conditions that exist there. They are artificial geological conditions brought about by how it is farmed. It is a very delicate balance that must be adhered to. I would be very disappointed to see the Government introducing a plan that might interfere with that or how commonages have been farmed for generations across this country, particularly in the west where commonages are more prevalent.</p>

        <speech by="#AndrewDoyle" eId="spk_82">
          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle<recordedTime time="2014-10-03T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_250">I apologise as I was unavoidably held up this morning and thank Deputy Heydon for moving the motion. I thank all my colleagues on the committee for the preparation of the report. We published this report on 18 July 2013 and had seven meetings. The rationale behind the report was on foot of those draft guidelines published by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. To the credit of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and others, they did not then issue letters at the time. We said it was very important that we drew up some sort of framework on how best to manage commonages.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> First, if one wants to do a commonages plan and if one wants to pay people for doing it, its objectives should be to improve the environmental condition of the commonage beyond what the new CAP has described as good agricultural and environmental conditions. We must draw a distinction between what is first off required under the single farm payments scheme and what it is. In the report, we built in two different levels. Within the rural development programme, there are two different levels which I will address later. </p>
          <p eId="para_252"> We met on seven occasions. The main issues identified were optimum stocking rates tailored for individual commonages, which means that one size does not fit all; the effects of dormancy on preparing a management plan, which is the potential of not having the ability to get enough people to sign up to an agreement that could make a plan effective to achieve its output and aims; and collective arrangements and co-ownership and the possible impact of imposing collective responsibility as opposed to a co-operative approach, an issue that has been worked on hard by Department officials. I attended an information meeting in Glendalough last night attended by some 30 people. The meeting was attended by senior principal officers and seven or eight Department officials. They gave a very full and comprehensive outline and explanation, answered many questions and stayed back until everybody was happy that their concerns were listened to and explanations were given. It was positive. Anyone who was there will say it. People have concerns but they were mainly explained. One issue that was raised many times in respect of Wicklow was burning and the burning rules. A gentleman at the meeting manages some of the grouse areas. They said that they had one last week in the past four years when they could effectively burn within the prescribed period. The Department officials at least seemed very anxious and positive towards extending the burning time period. We need to engage with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to get that achieved. </p>
          <p eId="para_253"> The other issue was output-driven models. I will go through the recommendations of the report. There are a couple of key points and queries that came from the meeting last night. We said that the term "commonage" needs to be defined. Much of my locality in the Wicklow uplands is national parkland. People graze on what is known as old collops and have rights attached but they are not part of their folio. They have rights to graze but there are limits on them so some people can only graze up to a maximum level anyway. It has worked fairly well as long as there were enough people active and therein lies an issue that might need to addressed. It relates to people having a maximum number they graze yet if there are not enough of the other people who are active, they cannot get to the overall minimum numbers required by 2018. </p>
          <p eId="para_254"> In recommendation five, we said that commonages should be managed by the mechanism of output-driven schemes which maximise the specialised knowledge of those who own the commonages. GLAS reflects that particular recommendation in so far as it is an output-driven scheme. The next recommendation is that a one-size-fits-all approach should be avoided and that each scheme should be based on and address the unique characteristics of each individual commonage. From what I gathered from last night, that is exactly what will happen. No maximum is set until the management plan is agreed. The minimum is the minimum of one ewe per 1.5 hectares. After that, there will be each ewe equivalents for each individual farmer who has until the end of 2015 to increase their minimum stocking rate. </p>
          <p eId="para_255"> In respect of Deputy Ó Cuív's comments, I live in an area where many farmers farm with an upland reach. They have a lot of sheep they keep on commonage. They breed them for breeding sale. They keep many more sheep than they would ever use for replacements and store male sheep, which is mainly the other side to it, are secondary in many ways. They are very important but they do not breed animals as terminal to fatten them. More and more farmers do so nowadays.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">It has been a problem since the outbreak of foot and mouth disease when we were not allowed to sell sheep directly into Northern Ireland. We would have had it in the breeding season at this time of year. Blessington, Baltinglass, Carnew and others had them. There were 10,000 sheep in a sale, most of which were breeding stock. There is a special show sale in Blessington tomorrow. The sheep for sale are breeding stock. There will also be store lambs. </p>
          <p eId="para_257"> Buyers from the Cooley Mountains, the midlands and elsewhere come to Wicklow. It is the same in the west. One has to understand that it is not the same as having a lowland flock where breeding replacements are bred in the same way as replacements in a dairy herd, and the rest of the product is for fattening. It is a different type of sheep farming and people who do not know about sheep farming do not understand that. </p>
          <p eId="para_258"> Deputy McNamara referred to Burren life. It is the second level. The locally led environmental schemes are an addition to this and recognise the value of the Burren, in fairness to the Department and Minister, and there is an extension of that initiative. We all hope places will qualify. The bar is set a little bit higher in those sorts of schemes. People in the Burren say species rich grassland is their kilo of beef. The Wicklow Uplands Council has healthy managed vegetation in the uplands. That is the output for which people are paid to achieve. Payment is given to those who own the land and they are allowed to set the plan. That was the key message from the Burren. Locally led environmental schemes will achieve that. They are really welcome. </p>
          <p eId="para_259"> We have discussed GLAS. There is a requirement for 50% of farmers to agree, but if that cannot be achieved the implementation committee can be contacted for a consideration and recommendation. The point was made that if only one farmer remains on commonage and cannot qualify for GLAS because more than one farmer must be involved, he or she can send his or her submission to the implementation committee and, more than likely, it would be approved for the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> We have a particular issue with deer in Wicklow, of which the Minister is well aware. Part of the problem is that the vegetation on the hills has become overgrown, too stemmy and is no longer attractive, and as a result the deer have become cute and lazy. They are moving to lower ground and competing on lowland domestic inside ground for grass and vegetation. People in the National Parks and Wildlife Service need to be absolutely convinced of the problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_262">I have two quick queries. One concerns commonages on national parkland. The National Parks and Wildlife Service tends to lease them on ten month rather than five year leases. There was an agreement of five years under REPS. My second query concerns eligible land which is deemed ineligible, but is recoverable. If one is in a commonage management plan next year, rather than have to stack and lose the benefit of convergence, if one had signed up to a commonage management plan which would see the area recover and become eligible a derogation would be given.</p>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Simon Coveney)<recordedTime time="2014-10-03T12:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_263">I will try to address some of the questions, queries and comments made. On a general point, we are trying to introduce a scheme in the case of GLAS and qualification criteria for a single farm payment that is as flexible as possible and can adapt to different types of farming in different parts of the country. To say that, for whatever reason, such as from where I come, I do not understand commonage farming is not true because I have spoken to a lot of commonage farmers in regard to this. A team of people is putting together these proposals. I do not sit down at my desk and write them. I stand over them because I am the boss, but people from the west, the north west, the south west, the midlands and everywhere else sit around a table. They try to understand and anticipate the problems and pressures affecting farmers and make sure we can bring as many farmers as possible into the schemes, while at the same time being consistent with the rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> I probably should not have interrupted Deputy Ó Cuív as much as I did, but I do not want to be characterised as something I am not. We have compromised and amended proposals because of the public consultation process. We have spoken to people at lengthy meetings to try to understand specific problems and tailor solutions to solve them. We are still trying to do that in public meetings around the country in various places from Wicklow to Donegal, Galway, west Cork, Kerry, Mayo and so on. We will continue that process. I am not in the business of locking anybody out of anything if we can accommodate him or her. </p>
          <p eId="para_265"> There are historical traditions in terms of how commonage areas are farmed and shareholders interact, and they share the burden differently in terms of who does what. That is why we have said there will be flexibility for some farmers who have a lot more stock than others per hectare or commonage. There is, in our view, a requirement that farmers have to be making some agricultural contribution to commonage in order to qualify as a farmer on that piece of land. For a piece of land to be eligible, the person claiming payment on it has to show he or she is participating in an agricultural practice.</p>

          <p eId="para_280">When this is over the Minister should sit down in a quiet corner with Deputy Kyne, who understands this perfectly, and listen carefully to his explanation. He knows, as do I, the reality of the situation. I regret that he did not do that a long time ago. Deputy Kyne is very knowledgeable.</p>

          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney<recordedTime time="2014-10-03T12:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_282">I agree with Deputy Ó Cuív that Deputy Kyne is very knowledgeable on this area. I have sat down with him on multiple occasions to tease through these issues, introduce compromises and changes and discuss the workings of the implementation group and how they may help farmers. I continue to do so on a daily basis. I have been to Deputy Ó Cuív's constituency with Deputy Kyne. We walked across some of the commonage lands. The idea that I do not know the reality of how they are farmed is not true. As is the case in Wicklow, as we heard from Deputy Doyle, there are different types of management systems and hill farming on commonages. The system of hill farming is very different to lowland agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">We are trying to adapt to this and have a non-party political implementation group that is about talking to farmers about the practicalities of getting into GLAS or ensuring they qualify for single farm payments or ANCs - disadvantaged area payments as they know them. We can then move from one CAP to another while ensuring as many farmers as possible benefit. That is what we will continue to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> The 50% participation requirement started out as an 80% requirement for priority access to GLAS. By the way, the joint committee signed up to the principle of having at least 80% of active farmers being part of a scheme, like, for example, the Burren scheme in order to be able to draw down. The principle of collective responsibility is one on which we all agree. We have made it very clear that to be credible with the Commission, at least half the people involved or half the land in the commonage area must be participating or included in a plan. Where land is being farmed in commonage, there is a shared responsibility. If there are practical reasons we cannot get 50% of the land or the people involved, we have an implementation group which will go into that commonage, speak to the shareholders and try to put a solution in place that can work for farmers. We will do this in a way that is inclusive, rather than to try to lock people out because they cannot meet exacting criteria. We are introducing significant flexibilities, responding to farming organisations and individual farmers and, in particular, people like Deputy Seán Kyne, who have been repeatedly raising these issues with me. That is why we have a group going around the country to explain how this will work and the flexibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> I genuinely have an open mind on this issue. If we can put better solutions in place, I have an open mind about changing. I will not dig my heels in because I do not want to backtrack. If there is a solution that works and that we can apply, we will look at it. I have no interest in doing anything that locks out those who should be getting supports and payments because we want to keep them on and interested in the land. At the same time, I have to ensure a finite resource goes to farmers who are actively farming the land when and where possible. If we do not do this, the Commission will come and ensure it will happen. </p>
          <p eId="para_286"> I thank the joint committee for a very useful report which has helped to shape much of the policy we have formulated.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">With the agreement of the House, Deputy Andew Doyle will conclude the debate. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>

          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle<recordedTime time="2014-10-03T12:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_288">I thank my colleague, Deputy Martin Heydon, for stepping in at the beginning of the debate and all Members who spoke for their kind words. Our committee has demonstrated that committees can work in unison and be productive. There is not much point in being here unless one can be genuinely productive. I commend all of the members of the joint committee and thank them for their co-operation through many reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> The report before the House was published in July 2013. The CAP had just been agreed and we had started our work before that. Pillar 2 and the rural development programme had not, however, been agreed at that stage. We did our work against a backdrop of draft guidelines from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht which we believed would not achieve their intended outcome - better commonages in better condition. We set about identifying the reasons and concerns and coming up with a set of solutions by way of recommendations to achieve the intended outcome. Where we have got with what we have so far today is an attempt to do this which is better and more practical.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> The report's recommendations note that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work. We have achieved a solution in so far as each commonage will be dealt with under a commonage management plan. It will be a laborious process, but rather than have a diktat from a central authority, we have a minimal stocking rate for the minimal payment, after which it will be up to each plan and the participants therein to agree matters. It is very important. We recommended that commonages be managed by output driven schemes. GLAS is an output driven scheme and it is being fine-tuned to make it effective and workable for as many people as possible and to be acceptable to the European Commission. It is worth bearing in mind that the submission has not, to the best of my knowledge, been signed off on finally by the Commission, although one hopes it will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> We identified the BurrenLIFE scheme as a model. It shows that one size does not fit all as under the REPS, the requirement to have all stock off the land for the winter - bovines in that case - would have damaged the environment. We became aware of this famously with regard to hazel overgrowth on the Burren. People reacted in that case. There are plenty of other examples around the country and things will take a bit of work. I have seen this myself. Deputy Martin Heydon is interested in doing something on the Curragh, a landscape that is unique in Europe. Certainly, that is worth considering, although I caution the Deputy that a great deal of hard slogging and knocking of heads together is required. Issues such as burning and, in County Wicklow, the deer culling season and how they are managed are important. Practical changes must be made to place commonage in good agricultural and environmental condition and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> I welcome what the Minister said at the end of his contribution to the effect that he is open minded. His intention and that of his officials is that this will be a two-way street. It is certainly the feeling I got last night from the departmental officials who were in Glendalough. They took on board some of the concerns raised. I highlighted two earlier, including terms of leases of national park land and how ineligible land that can be made eligible can be included in year one. This debate has raised further matters for consideration. As a joint committee, we could bring in Mr. Joe Healy from the implementation group following on from this process to outline his position. It would be a good idea to do so. I have met him a couple of times and he is considered to be an objective and fair person. He must be because the microscope will be on him. Certainly, that would be a worthwhile process in which to engage.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> The joint committee has made its recommendations and we can all take some satisfaction from the fact that much of the reflection in the meantime in devising a rural development programme with the commonages aspect to it has taken on board much of what we said. In particular, the idea that one size does not fit all has been acknowledged. We could not have implemented a commonage plan on a national basis. Every commonage is different and has different dynamics and personalities and must be dealt with in a certain way. </p>
          <p eId="para_294"> An issue that came up and which was raised in this debate involved planners. Teagasc has advertised for planners and it will not have enough. Where there are three farmers on a commonage, two with Teagasc and one with a private planner for the AEOS, there must be a coming together. It may be the case that Teagasc will sub-contract out where people can agree and assign planners. That might make matters simpler. It might be a small issue, but it could delay getting plans off the ground. I also note that if 25,000 or 30,000 applications are accepted next year, more than that number will be submitted.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">I am not sure if the Minister has an idea as to a closing date for applications under GLAS, but on a practical level, a mid-year closing date would be difficult. At the same time, getting everything processed and approved by the end of the year to enable some payments to be made by the end of next year will be a challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> There is a good deal of work to do. We need to get sanction first from the Commission, but if there is anything the committee can do with regard to GLAS or the locally led environment schemes, the members will be more than happy to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> I thank the members. We were drawn on this almost a year ago but the sub-committee was on a fact-finding mission the same day. We are delighted that we had the opportunity to present the report.</p>
