This amendment provides that the Higher Education Authority, in preparing the performance framework, should have regard to the strategy for tertiary education, taking account of the diversity, which is important in this sector, of functions, objects and priorities of different higher education providers. For example, the research-intensive aspects of the universities is an example of a point of differentiation from some other institutions. This is another section on which Deputy Conway-Walsh and I engaged with the sector. Deputy Ó Ríordáin and Deputy Conway-Walsh's amendments Nos. 89 and 90 seem to endeavour to address the same matter. I engaged with the sector in bringing forward my amendment. Without in any way seeking to speak for the Deputy, I think we are largely trying to land at the same point. I fully understand the purpose of amendments Nos. 89 and 90 and have brought forward amendment No. 88 to endeavour to address the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_73">Deputy Ó Cathasaigh, in fairness, has done a lot of work on this, but other Deputies have also raised the issue of climate action, sustainability and how we endeavour to strengthen the Bill. I said at the previous session of Committee Stage of the Bill that, under this legislation, the HEA will be able to issue guidelines, codes and policies in respect of climate action. I think we were discussing towards the end of the previous session that it is grand for me to say that but that Deputies want an assurance beyond that.

Again, there must be a level of transparency and if there is non-compliance, it should be explained.</p>

          <from>Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2022-04-27T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_84">It is clear from section 126 that the HEA may issue guidelines, codes and policies concerning any matter referred to in this Act or any other enactment and the implementation of any policy or objective of the Minister or the Government. In effect, this means policies and objectives of the Minister and the Government become legally enforceable without being enacted in the form of legislation. It is proposed that compliance with guidelines, codes and policies should be assessed by reference to the principle of "comply or explain". This approach would serve to restore the balance between autonomy and accountability and is an approach that is proportionate in circumstances. Any policy or objective of the Minister can become the subject of a guideline, code or policy. Non-compliance can lead to direct intervention by the HEA and the imposition of financial penalties under section 42 and determinations for action under section 65. This has the potential to undermine the autonomy of the university governing authorities and it potentially increases risk of third level institutions being regarded as being under public control.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> The "comply or explain" principle operates on the basis that the entities at which the legislation is directed should not favour strict compliance over effective governance and transparency. Instead, the entities at which the legislation is directed are encouraged to consider their individual circumstances carefully and choose what is best for them while ensuring they provide full, clear and meaningful explanations for departures from what is expected of them under the guidelines, codes and policies. This allows entities to develop governance, processes and practices most suitable for their particular circumstances and to report them in a meaningful way rather than declaring strict compliance with the guidelines, codes and policies that result in reporting that lack of substance and information about governance outcomes. The "comply or explain" principle seems particularly appropriate in the current context where the circumstances affecting each designated institution of higher education tend to be quite different.</p>

          <p eId="para_87">I do not want to go back to the amendments but I acknowledged Deputy Ó Cathasaigh's work on the amendments he put forward and my intention to provide additional clarity and assurance with guidelines, and what that might look like, in advance of Report Stage. I also indicated that I will endeavour to come back with greater definitions around sustainability. I will put on the record that I will work closely with Deputy Ó Cathasaigh and others between now and Report Stage on that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> On section 38 more broadly, I flag to the committee that my Department continues to engage with the Central Statistics Office on how borrowing for this sector is treated in terms of money being on and off balance sheet. It is a broader point but it is important to say that while we are on section 38 of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> To be clear, the policy intent of the Bill is not to change in any way, shape or form the existing principle of "comply or explain". That is for the reasons Deputies Ó Ríordáin and Conway-Walsh outlined in terms of the autonomy of institutions and diversity. I genuinely get that. Already, though, with the existing principle of "comply or explain", the HEA must agree the explanation with the designated institution of higher education for a derogation from a guideline, code or policy to apply. If a guideline or code is not complied with, the CEO would view the explanation and a reasonable explanation would be accepted by the HEA.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> I have engaged intensively with the sector on this and I would not like to change the current principle beyond "comply or explain" or accidentally dilute it. I would not like to have a "comply or explain" process and if you do not like the explanation, goodnight and good luck. This would accidentally diminish the process, and that is not what the sector wants to do either. I have looked at this quite extensively but I am satisfied, in regard to the proposed amendments, that the current policy intent is in line with the existing policy of "comply or explain". I have no doubt the Deputies will return to this on Report Stage because it is important for the sector. That is my view.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> This amendment is grouped with amendments Nos. 157 and 169, which are in my name. The purpose of these amendments is to clarify that the obligation of the governing body of a technological university is to have appropriate systems, procedures and practices in place in order to implement and report on compliance with the policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government to the extent that those policies may affect or relate to the function of the university or technological university. The wording has been amended from "enable compliance" with the policies to "implement and report on compliance" to more accurately reflect the policy intent. To be clear, there is no intended change with regard to policy intent in the subsection. Amendments Nos. 158 and 170 are covered by amendments Nos. 157 and 169, if I might put it like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> Amendments Nos. 204 and 208 propose to remove the provision that the Minister may give a direction in writing to the HEA to prepare guidelines, codes or policies, and the HEA shall comply with the direction with a new provision. The proposed new provision provides that the Minister shall provide a draft of a direction to the HEA and the HEA may make submissions to the Minister on the draft direction, and the Minister shall consider any submission received. The new provision also provides, as we previously discussed, that the direction shall be published. I am satisfied with the provisions relating to directions as currently reflected in the Bill. I do not propose to accept other amendments to this section.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_110">In page 37, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following: </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_111">“(b) in the case of a body seeking funding, to establish whether the body complies with national policy, legislation and objectives with regard to climate action,”. </p>
          <p eId="para_112">I am happy to move the amendment. I apologise to the committee for not being present to move the previous amendment. I was monitoring online from another meeting and, unfortunately, it was not being broadcast. I missed those amendments for that reason. </p>
          <p eId="para_113"> That series of amendments, which I discussed with the Minister, as he acknowledged, is about trying to set on a firmer footing the importance and primacy of climate action within this piece of legislation, and in particular that the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 and our obligations under the Paris Agreement are acknowledged explicitly within the text of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> I understand the argument that, of course, this Bill must have cognisance and reference to all of the other pieces of legislation. I feel the case for climate action is such that it deserves a specific reference in and of itself, however. I will not delay the committee any further than that given that I missed my initial opportunity. I am glad to have had the opportunity to retrospectively put the case for those amendment.</p>

As I indicated earlier in the meeting with Deputy Ó Cathasaigh, my response is that we are looking to see how we can, and I think it is the wish of the committee, further strengthen definitions in this important area of climate action. I am also looking to see what can be done in addition to the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> A significance to this legislation that sometimes does not get discussed enough is the Higher Education Authority, HEA, being able to devise and develop codes and guidelines. I think the healthy scepticism at this committee the last time was that this was an enabling provision and about whether there will there be guidelines or codes in these areas in two or three years' time and what assurances I can give the committee. I am working with my officials and the HEA to see if I can perhaps, even in advance of the legislation being passed, indicate in writing that this is an area we wish to see prioritised. I will work with the Deputies and Deputy Ó Cathasaigh in advance of Report Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_130"> This amendment is about structured engagement with students and particularly the training for students on governing boards. I would like the thank the University College Dublin students' union for bringing this to my attention. This is a straightforward amendment to assure that these positive initiatives around training are delivered in all institutes.</p>

          <from>Deputy Simon Harris<recordedTime time="2022-04-27T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_131">I will flag at this stage that based on our very extensive discussions on the Irish language with Deputies Ó Snodaigh, Conway-Walsh, Ó Cathasaigh and Ó Ríordáin at the previous meeting, I am considering bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage in relation to engagement with students who are Irish language speakers. I will also be considering a very similar amendment in section 44 with regard to students who are Irish language speakers. I thank Deputy Conway-Walsh for her amendment and, indeed, her engagement with the UCD students' union on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> I did look at this and I will read my note to be clear on my advice. Amendment No. 113 proposes to provide that a formalised engagement process between students of designated institutions of higher education and those institutions shall - with an emphasis on that word - include training for students participating as members of the governing bodies of those institutions and a mechanism for students to request such training. The amendment is seeking to replace the word "may" with the word "shall". My own view from consulting is that it is not appropriate as some students may have sourced alternative training and may not require that training. I am not being pedantic because I know what the Deputy is endeavouring to do here. On the idea that the training must or shall happen, we believe the word "may" is an enabling provision to provide for good engagement processes. It is also noted that the institution is required to report annually to the HEA on training and engagement processes. If training has been requested and not provided, we will see this annually in the report to the HEA, which I think is important for transparency as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> As the Deputy said, amendments Nos. 114 and 115 request two additional provisions to be included in the annual report to the HEA. I went to check this because it is important. I agree with what the Deputy is endeavouring to do here. My advice is that there is no need for those amendments, however, because they are already included as part of the reporting process to the HEA under subsection (3)(<i>a</i>)(<i>b</i>)(<i>c</i>). There is a nervousness that changing the word "may" to "shall" has an unintended consequence. We believe the reporting mechanism is captured in subsection (3)(<i>a</i>)(<i>b</i>)(<i>c</i>).</p>

I obviously outlined the legal concerns around "partnership" and flagged it in an earlier section. I do believe, however, that "co-operation" accurately reflects the policy intent with regard to student surveys. As I said, it aligns with a similar amendment to section 9(1)(<i>i</i>).</p>

          <p eId="para_161">I agree with this point. As well as being institutions of learning and huge economic drivers, institutions in the third level sector are major employers with tens of thousands of workers. There are several unions that would be a regular part of engagement with higher education institutions, such as the Teachers’ Union of Ireland, TUI, the Irish Federation of University Teachers, SIPTU and Fórsa, and there are probably several more as well. This is vital. Typically, with some exceptions, these institutions are engaging in general terms with these unions but that needs to continue and it needs to be preserved. I believe they should have an equal place with the other stakeholders in that regard.</p>

I wish to bring forward my own amendment to do exactly this on Report Stage and while we need to run things through the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, there is no disagreement here. To be clear, this should be in the Bill. We did engage with the TUI and others and they identified a number of areas where trade unions and staff associations should be in the Bill. The Deputies will remember from the last day that we brought forward quite of lot of amendments where we ensured that trade unions and staff associations were listed in the Bill explicitly rather than implicitly. This was not a section where it was identified in our engagement but, nonetheless, it is an accepted oversight and I will rectify it on the basis of the Deputy’s amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">This is another one of these points that is becoming common because I think Deputy Conway-Walsh and I must talk to the same people on this legislation. In any case, there is amendment No. 122 in my name and No. 125 in the Deputy’s name which intend to do the exact same thing. It is just a question of legal wording on how best to do this. This is basically about making sure that the provision for lifelong and flexible learning provides that the HEA should promote and support the institutions of higher education in the development and provision of lifelong and flexibile learning for learners which meets the requirements of the learners. The amendment I am bringing forward, which captures the Deputy’s view too, adds a specific provision to meet the needs of persons who are competent to speak the Irish language. This amendment is another example of how we are working to strengthen the provisions in regard to the Irish language in the Bill. I move amendment No. 122 and respectfully suggest it encapsulates what amendment No. 125 was seeking to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_196">I move amendment No. 126:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_197">In page 45, line 6, after “data,” to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_198">“including, but not limited to, disaggregated data in relation to public and private funding, funding from foreign sources (including the country to which the source is attributable, date of funding and description of any conditions or restrictions applied), and funding streams from entities outside of the designated higher education institutions that operate substantially for the benefit or under the auspices of the institutions, both inside and outside the State,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">I would accept that amendments Nos. 126 and 127 are very close in their intention and aims and, indeed, in their wording, but I would make an argument that amendment No. 128 is slightly different. Amendments Nos. 126 and 127 are aimed towards transparency in the funding model. As I have said previously, the State makes a significant investment in the third level sector and we should expect that the State's values are mirrored back to it in the investment in third level institutions by having oversight of the types of funding and the funding sources other than State funding that are feeding into the provision of third level education. These two amendments go to the point about transparency and clarity in terms of the funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> The HEA initiated a review of higher education and funding in 2017, the “Review of the Allocation Model for Funding Higher Education Institutions” final report for the independent expert panel of the HEA. I would emphasise the inconsistent and incoherent nature of the administration of funding for data collection and lack of overall transparency in HEA funding. This item references governance and public confidence in the system and I think transparency around private sources of funding will only strengthen people’s confidence in the third level sector. To quote from that report, funding streams from entities outside of the designated higher education institutions that operate substantially for the benefit of or under the auspices of the institutions, both inside and outside the State, are included in some instances. This is the practice of having a separate legal entity that may operate parallel to the actual third level institution. I do not think we have good oversight or good insight as to where the funding sources are coming from in that respect. As a major stakeholder in third level funding, the State should expect to have that level of transparency.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> Amendment No. 128 is slightly different in its focus. It is related to something commonly known as the divestment movement. That is the idea that, with regard to investments made by third level institutions commonly held as, for example, pension pots, we should limit the exposure of those investments, in terms of investment in fossil fuels in particular. There is an issue around reflecting the values of the State, as well as the matter of stranded assets and the destabilising influence that could arise from investments being made in fossil fuels infrastructure or having that as part of a pension portfolio, and that subsequently devaluing. That is what this amendment goes towards.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">I thank the Deputy. I have looked into this matter. In the context of the horrific situation in Ukraine, there has been a need to seek information in relation to transparency around funding. There have been some parliamentary questions tabled to me that required me to go to institutions to seek data I do not have on that situation and the need for Russia to experience significant sanctions and isolation. I have recent experience of the importance of being able to seek data from institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> I have checked that in the existing provisions for data collection specified in the legislation there is a category relating to financial data. I am advised that these amendments appear to be covered by the subsection on financial data. If it is deemed necessary to collect the data, that can be done under the heading of financial data and prescribed by the Minister of the day in consultation with the HEA.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">Section 61 provides for the development of the strategic development plans in our designated institutions of higher education that are not universities, technological universities, institutes of technology or the National College of Art and Design. This amendment proposes to include the Irish-language requirement in their development plans but for what are mainly private and not-for-profit institutions. We generally attach conditions through funding. These institutions may not be receiving any funding from the Exchequer, and some may be receiving competitive funding only, as we discussed the last day. I outlined this in my engagement with Conradh na Gaeilge. While I am considering more amendments in the round on Irish, that is my position on these amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">They are strategic plans. What amendment No. 131 seeks to impose is not onerous. It just proposes that in the strategic plan, an institution consider how it will progressively increase. If it is starting from a low level, a progressive increase can be from a very minimal level. One of the big challenges for society as a whole regarding Irish concerns how we expand its use outside the third level institutions where Irish is pigeonholed as one of the arts subjects or whatever. In this instance, as the Minister correctly said, the institutions in question are private, not-for-profit institutions, but many of them are delivering courses on business, finance and whatnot. It is important that those courses be available through Irish or, at the very least, that there be an understanding, by virtue of the promotion of the Irish language within the institutions, that graduates may end up in areas where Irish is the vernacular and that there is a need to protect and enhance the language.</p>

          <p eId="para_237">I very much appreciate the work the Deputy is doing in respect of equity of access and I agree that through her work and that of my officials we have tried to strengthen equity of access provision throughout the Bill. This section, however, relates to the private colleges. We had a debate on this earlier in terms of private versus public and the likes. The way we pursue access to education is through the publicly funded higher education sector or where we provide specific funding to a private or not-for-profit college for a specific purpose, we attach conditions of funding. That is how we try to highlight priorities, be they access, participation or course completion, considering we do not fund these institutions, I do not have a direct policy lever. For example, I will bring forward a national access plan and the Deputy and I will debate its merits and demerits but it relates to trying to ensure people get through the public education system.

          <p eId="para_239">That is an interesting one. I will have to go back to previous sections, but I am satisfied that in the context of institutions we are funding, the Bill provides an ability for the HEA to attach conditions to funding. That is one of the significant benefits of the Bill. We can consider that and see whether the Deputy is satisfied it is strong enough but, where we do not fund the institutions, we do not have the policy lever. That is my view. I will reflect on what the Deputy has said in respect of publicly funded institutions. It is a fair point.</p>

          <p eId="para_244">What I am trying to outline with this amendment is the nature of "concern". I want to replace the word "concerned" with "serious, significant or material concerns".

          <p eId="para_245">I thank the Deputy. As the Chairman indicated, amendment No. 134 tabled by Deputy Ó Ríordáin and amendment No. 135 that I have brought forward are alternatives in the sense that they are both trying to achieve the same thing. I would argue that my amendment achieves what Deputy Ó Ríordáin is seeking to achieve, which is a legitimate point that I heard from the sector, that is, what is "concern". I am proposing in my amendment to delete the phrase "concerned about", which could be construed to be vague and subjective, and substitute it with, "of opinion that there are significant concerns regarding". The policy intent of this section is that the CEO of the HEA would only request a review and report from a designated institution where there are significant concerns regarding the institution. It is not intended that this provision is used to address minor or trivial issues that can be addressed through normal working arrangements. An amendment is proposed to provide that the word "significant" is now inserted in the section. This amendment will provide that the CEO may request a designated institution to undertake a review if there is a significant concern about the institution's governance, performance or compliance. I do not think anybody is suggesting it, but we need to be careful we do not inadvertently prevent the CEO requesting a report if there are significant concerns. I do take the point in respect of the vagueness of the original language and I contend that amendment No. 135 in my name achieves that balance.</p>

          <p eId="para_251">I move amendment No. 137:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_252">In page 58, line 26, after "may" to insert ", with the approval of the Board,".</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Amendments Nos. 137 and 138 provide that the chief executive of the HEA requires board approval for the publication of a report of a review under section 64. This is important where there is potential reputational risk to an institution. It is the view of the sector and, I suspect, that of the committee that it would be appropriate for the CEO to require the approval of the board of the HEA before the publication of a report of a review. That is the purpose of amendments Nos. 137 and 138.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> Amendment No. 139a in my name removes the provision that the chief executive can make a determination to provide assistance in accordance with section 66 following a review under section 64. The amendment has been tabled because it is proposed to remove section 66 of the Bill, relating to the provision of assistance by an tÚdarás, and, therefore, this provision is no longer necessary. This, too, is something that came from engagement with the sector. It would like to be in a position to request assistance but does not wish to have that assistance forced upon it. That language may be slightly inaccurate. I apologise; some of my language should be tighter. It is just a change of emphasis in terms of assistance. In light of the fact that we will be removing section 66, amendment No. 139a removes a provision that is no longer required.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> On amendment No. 139, I am not proposing to accept the amendment. It proposes to insert a provision that HEA board approval will be needed by the chief executive in order to make a determination to take action following a review. This whole legislation is a question of balance. We are all trying to get the balance right. My amendment proposes that, for reputational reasons and the like, the chief executive cannot go ahead and publish the report of the review without the approval of the board. It is still appropriate for the CEO to be able to take action. In fact, it is empowering and important for the CEO to be able to take the action without the requirement of a board meeting. For that reason, I prefer the amendment I have tabled, so I do not propose to accept amendment No. 139. It is important that when the HEA identifies an issue in a higher education institution, the HEA can react in a timely manner. Of course, all present have great confidence in the sector, but we also have to legislate for times when things go wrong. Being able to act in a timely manner is important. The steps include a request for self-review and a report from the institution by the CEO. I think we have the balance right in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> I do not propose to accept amendment No. 140. It provides that an appeal can be taken in respect of any determination made by the CEO under section 65. The Bill provides that an appeal can only be taken against the imposition of remedial measures. That is important too. If there are remedial measures, one can taken an appeal in respect of one's unhappiness with that, but if there is not a remedial measure, I do not think there is a need for an appeal. As I stated, amendment No. 139 removes the provision that the chief executive officer can make a determination to provide assistance. I have dealt with that. I wish to flag that I am considering introducing an amendment on Report Stage to provide for an appeal in respect of the appointment of a reviewer. I will consider amendment No. 140 again prior to Report Stage. That is basically what I am saying. I think we have the balance right without amendment No. 139, based on the amendment I have brought forward. I will consider the issues relating to amendment No. 140 in advance of Report Stage. </p>

          <p eId="para_277">I thank both Deputies. Amendment No. 142 provides for an appeal of a decision by the CEO to provide assistance to a designated institution of higher education and provides that when an appeal is made, the appeal has the effect of placing a stay on the provision of such assistance until such time as the appeal has been determined. I have proposed to remove section 66 from the Bill to remove that mandatory provision of assistance. A later section of the Bill provides the ability to seek assistance, but we will remove the mandatory provision of assistance through the removal of section 66. Therefore, amendment No. 142 is no longer necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> Amendment No. 146 provides for the right of appeal against a decision of the HEA CEO to appoint a reviewer. This amendment also provides that if an appeal is made against the appointment of a reviewer, it has the effect of placing a stay on the appointment or shall require a cessation of the work of the reviewer pending the determination or discontinuance of the appeal. The appointment of a reviewer is considered to be part of the process of assessing whether there is an issue which needs to be addressed. The reviewer will undertake a review of the institution to establish the facts. The institution will then receive a copy of the draft report and may make representations on the draft report to the reviewer, which the reviewer shall consider prior to finalising the report. I am not in a position to accept the amendment, but I have indicated and now indicate again that I can consider an amendment on Report Stage to provide for an appeal process for the appointment of the reviewer.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_281">In page 61, line 13, to delete “The remedial” and substitute “Subject to subsection (4), the remedial”.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Amendments Nos. 143 and 144 provide that the approval of the board is required before a remedial or other measure referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) or (d) of subsection (3) may be imposed on a designated institution of higher education. As I outlined earlier, the requirement for board approval in these cases takes into account reputational aspects for designated institutions. The measures are the admonishment and censure in writing of the institution, the requirement for members of the governing body or members of staff of the institution to undertake a course of training on matters related to governance, or the review of the strategic development plan of the institution. This adds the requirement for the approval of the HEA board rather than unilateral action of the CEO.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> Amendment No. 145 is in the name of Deputies Ó Ríordáin and Conway-Walsh. It proposes to introduce a provision for the appeal of the imposition of a remedial measure and a stay on the imposition of a remedial measure if the appeal is made pending the determination or discontinuance of the appeal. Section 65(4) of the Bill provides for an appeal of the imposition of the remedial measure. Amendment No. 141 addresses the same issue, of proposing to put a stay on the coming into operation of a remedial measure if an appeal is made, pending the determination. In English, I believe amendment No. 141, which we discussed, has addressed what the Deputies are trying to do in amendment No. 145. Amendments Nos. 143 and 144 are about a greater role for the HEA board, in the interests of recognising the importance of the reputation of the institution.</p>

This amendment was dealt with just a few moments ago under amendments Nos. 140, 142 and 146. An appeals provision is in place to appeal the imposition of remedial measures. We have agreed to remove section 66, so I think we have addressed this through earlier actions.

          <p eId="para_306">Section 70 of the Bill provides for the appointment of the three-person appeals board to be appointed by the Minister. It is to comprise two persons with special interest in higher education and one practising solicitor and barrister. The purpose of the amendment is to recast section 70(a) to provide that one of the three nominees of the appeals board must be a suitably qualified international higher education expert, who may be an academic, depending on the matter under appeal. The revised text also precludes a public servant or any person employed by the institution of higher education from being eligible to be appointed to the appeals board. The use of an appeals board is envisaged by all within the Department and the sector to be an unusual occurrence. In the event that it is required, we believe that an international perspective would be beneficial. It is not an unusual use of international expertise, as there are existing panels of relevant experts to draw from.</p>

          <p eId="para_316">I was about to respond to the amendment. I will move amendment No. 149 shortly. That amendment will make a new provision to preclude serving members of staff of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science from being members of the appeals board. It is an important amendment to clarify and to further embed what is absolutely the intention set out in section 71(12) of the Bill that the appeals board should be independent in the performance of its functions. It is important it is independent and seen to be independent. That is the purpose of that amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> As for amendment No. 148 in the names of Deputies Ó Ríordáin and Conway-Walsh, section 70 of the Bill provides for the three-person appeals boards to be appointed by the Minister. It is to comprise two persons with a special interest in higher education, so that provision is already there, and one practising solicitor or barrister. Members of the HEA board, members of staff of the HEA and solicitors or barristers in full-time service of the State are precluded from membership of the appeals board. To clarify, we are already providing that nobody who works in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science can serve on the board, nobody who is a member of the HEA board can work on the appeals board, nobody who is a member of staff of the HEA can do so and nobody who is a solicitor or barrister in full-time service of the State can do so. That is quite a number of people we are taking out of circulation, and appropriately so, in the context of independence. It is my view that amendment No. 148, in precluding any public servant or employee of an institution of higher education from membership of the appeals board, would significantly risk narrowing the pool of people with expertise. Members may remember that the legislation states that we will comprise the board of two persons with a special interest in higher education. I think it is entirely possible to be a public servant not in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science or in the HEA or a staff member of an institution of higher education that is not in any way involved in this and to serve on the board. The amendment I am bringing forward takes a further step. For that reason I do not want to narrow the pool further.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">I move amendment No. 150:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_326">In page 66, to delete lines 12 to 32.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">I have engaged extensively, as I know the Minister and others on the committee have, with this sector over recent months, and it is clear that the management of every institution accepted the need for the highest standard of transparency and accountability for public finances. That is beyond question. The Government will always have our support for any policy that achieves that. There are, however, many proposals in the Bill that reduce the autonomy of institutes without any clear relationship with transparency or accountability, and I have yet to see or hear a convincing justification for dictating such rigid governance structures such as the mandatory 17-member limit on the governing bodies. The Technological Universities Act 2018 allowed for a governing authority of 22 to 26. The Minister has changed the position since the general scheme was issued, and now the right number on the governing authority is 17. I put it to the Minister, however, that the reason the number keeps changing is that there is no magic number and no one size that fits all. The people best placed to come up with the right size of the governing authority are the institutions themselves. These are unpaid positions, and every governing body has its own unique make-up and tradition. The removal of the broad representation on the governing bodies will be a real loss, I believe.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> It is unfair to say that this legislation will move the sector to a competency-based governance model. Governing bodies are currently made up of members of academic and non-academic bodies, undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students, the alumni, the local authority nominees, trade union representatives, employers' organisations and others. The expertise is vitally important, particularly in the more technical areas such as financial reporting. However, we should not limit the value of the contribution and valuable input from a wide variety of people. The Minister should look again at the rigid, overly prescriptive governance structures and a fair approach that can be applied to everyone without damaging the unique characteristics and differentiated missions of the different institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> The Bill curtails staff representation on the governing bodies and assumes without any actual evidence that having a majority of external members is superior. It takes an upstairs-downstairs attitude to both academic and professional staff, who are not seen as worthy of significant influence in the governance of their own institutions. There are clearly established dangers in shrinking governing bodies so dramatically. The risks in terms of the loss of expertise are significant for organisations as complex as the higher education institutions, particularly the larger ones. Five internal members of staff is a very small number to bring all the competencies required to the table of the governing body. Also, there is no indication that more ministerial nominees will lead to greater diversity. In the past, ministerial or external nominees have had a strong bias towards business and corporate appointments. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions made an excellent submission to the consultation on the Bill and pointed out that the academic institutions with the highest reputations and the most effective track records worldwide are those that enjoy the highest levels of autonomy. It is hardly a coincidence that the two highest ranking universities in the UK, Oxford and Cambridge, are precisely those where governance by academics has not been diluted by external governance influence. Closer to home, Trinity is the highest ranking of the universities in Ireland and in this Bill has been singled out to protect its autonomy.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> During debates on the Universities Act 1997, the then Minister for Education attracted criticism for proposing a minimum of three ministerial nominees on governing bodies that varied between 20 to 30 members. The current Minister is proposing boards of 17 with a majority of external nominees and a minority of staff from each institution, with the exception of Trinity, but here too the proposed changes to the governing body will reduce staff representation and curtail the number of elected staff members to the board of TCD. The governing body's size should be adequate to accommodate all stakeholders, students, staff, alumni, funders, enterprise partners, local communities, government and society. This can be provided for without compromising a feature of governance which has been proven worldwide to be appropriate for institutes of higher education.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> The provision for boards of 17 members is too rigid and I would like the Minister to look at it again.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I am thinking as well about the Atlantic Technological University and the whole scope that covers in the counties that it has to represent. I cannot see how a number of 17 would do that. I will be a bit parochial. We need Mayo and other places to be represented as well. We need a bit more room there. </p>

        <speech by="#SimonHarris" eId="spk_150">
          <from>Deputy Simon Harris<recordedTime time="2022-04-27T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_333">I thank the Deputy. A key tenet of this Bill is to make sure that we protect the autonomy of our institutions. That is really important. To ensure that happens, we need to make sure that we improve internal governance, and this Bill is trying to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> At the outset, and I want to be really clear on this, people who serve on governing authorities are doing so for the public good. They do not get a cent. These are non-remunerated positions. This is the definition of public service. They work hard and they do a good job. None of what I am about to say is in any way a criticism of people who serve on governing authorities. In my time as Minister, I have had the honour and pleasure of appointing many excellent people to governing authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> However, some governing authorities have 40 people on them. I do not believe that is effective for oversight. I definitely do not think that it is effective for the CEO of an organisation to also be chairperson of the board, so that they can ask themselves if they are doing a good job. I do not think that works. I cannot think of a comparable situation, although the HSE used to be like that for a brief period of time, where there is an idea that the chairperson is also the CEO. We are therefore trying to make sure that there external chair. The Deputy is right that there are differences for Trinity College Dublin. We will get to the Trinity section in a minute, if I may call it that. However, there are legal differences around Trinity. We are trying to respond to those differences, while also bringing about the reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> The Deputy is correct to say that there is not one magic number - although I am not sure if she used the word “magic” - and why the figure should be 17, rather than 18 or 15, etc. I do take that point. However, a consistency of approach across the sector is what we are trying to achieve. There is not one magic number and it is an arbitrary decision as to how one lands at a number. That is not incorrect. However, the purpose here is to agree a composition that can work for the sector, that can make sure it has access to the expertise it requires, that makes sure that the staff voice and the student voice are still there and that there is an external majority. I see this as a strength for the institutions. If we take Atlantic Technological University as an example, and the Deputy rightly raised it, involving external voices will strengthen and embed the university more in a region.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> This idea of reforming the governing authorities was not mine. I cannot take credit for it. It has been recommended in the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030. I am not sure that there is an issue that has been consulted on more than this issue. I think even the sector itself would acknowledge it, although I cannot speak for it. I know their representative bodies - such as the university representative bodies, technological universities or institutes of technology - would all accept that there needs to be change and reform in the composition of governing authorities. In meetings I have had with them, that has not been the debating point. They have wanted to get the composition right. I think I am accurate in saying that they all accept there needs to be a change in the composition. Certainly, that was the distinct impression that I got.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> The provisional smaller competency-based governing authorities is a vital part of the overall reform of the Higher Education Authority Act. I accept that the Deputy and I have differences of view on this, but that is why I cannot accept amendments Nos. 150 and 230. </p>

          <p eId="para_341"> Within all of that, I have to congratulate the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, today on elevating the issue to a higher area of responsibility than had been there before.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> In the Bill, there is a provision for two student members. We are simply proposing that it would be increased to three. I think that would be a better balance. By having three within themselves as a body, it is easier for them to have a coherent view on something, rather than having two opposing views. The Minister might see where I am coming from there. We would like the Minister to move from two members to three members to strengthen the student voice. </p>

          <p eId="para_348">What I am trying to do here with the number of 17 is that we have been a long time in arriving at a composition. If I alter one part of the composition, it will have knock-on effects for all the other components. I would say here, to the USI and to the student voice in general, that at the moment they are under the provisions of the Universities Act. There are three to four members of the student body on governing authorities of up to 40 people. Proportionately, while there were three or four out of 40, there will now be two out of 17. Therefore, the weight of influence that the student voice will have on the governing authority has truthfully and factorially increased as a proportion of the overall body.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> However, I do not want to be in any way disingenuous. I know that the USI and others would prefer three members. They have conveyed that view to me. However, the rationale behind two is contained within the overall composition of the Bill. </p>

          <p eId="para_352">The Minister is not for changing. I would like for him to reconsider the number of 17. I do not know whether in his discussions the institutes have told him that they can effectively work within those numbers.</p>

          <p eId="para_353">They have, but the institutions are not my primary and sole constituency here either. I am trying to be able to tell the people of Ireland that I am satisfied that the governance structure works. We have been collaborative on this Bill, so I do not wish to be argumentative. However, if we passed Deputy Conway-Walsh’s amendment No. 150, we would be removing all the reforms to the composition of the governing authority. The challenge that I have faced as Minister, and people would argue as to whether I have gotten this right or wrong, is to come up with a composition. If we passed amendment No. 150, we would just keep the <i>status quo</i>. I do not think that even the sector believes in the <i>status quo</i>. The challenge is to try to get it right.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> I accept that it would be counter-factual to suggest that the figure of 17 is not an arbitrary number. Of course, it is. However, there is a rationale behind it that includes an external chairperson, eight other external members, two students, the chief officer and five internal members. That is how we get there. We are trying to be fair to the constituent parts. </p>
          <p eId="para_355"> We have made a policy decision that there should be an external majority. Some would agree and some would disagree with that decision. However, it is a policy decision and I think it is an important policy decision to protect autonomy. I say this because they will be able to stand over strong internal governance by having an external majority. I think that helps to protect the autonomy. We see this across the Bill, which enables the institutions to have the right modern governance structures in place, as well as being able to get on with their own affairs. It is an important policy intent. It is entirely up to Deputy Conway-Walsh and to the stakeholders to bring forward further proposals on Report Stage. However, my position on this is set. That is my honest answer to her question. </p>

          <p eId="para_439">This is an important series of amendments, and I do not think it is controversial. It will be widely anticipated and welcomed by colleagues. Deputy Conway-Walsh and I have had discussions about this is in the context of the north west. It does two things. First, it seeks to amend the Technological Universities Act to provide that the Minister may, following an application by order, provide that an education institution or part thereof can be incorporated into a technological university. Second, it amends the aforementioned Act to recognise applications for incorporation made on an administrative basis, ahead of the commencement of the provisions I have just outlined. It is expected this will be availed of to facilitate the incorporation of St. Angela's College into Atlantic Technological University. </p>
          <p eId="para_440"> We are trying to support St. Angela's College, Sligo, joining Atlantic Technological University, ATU. That is, in the first instance, a matter for the governing authority of ATU. I believe it will consider it at its board meeting of 9 May and then follow the procedure set out. There was no legal basis for this to happen in advance of the Bill. I am pleased we are doing that. We are also providing an administrative basis, which is important to ensuring there is no delay. We can move ahead on an administrative basis and, while we are at it, we are future-proofing the legislation in case such a situation should arise in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_492">Amendments Nos. 179 and 180 are amendments to the definition of "external member" and "internal member" of the governing body of a technological university. These amendments exclude a member of the academic council of the college from being classified as an external member for the purpose of appointment to the governing authority. The amendments also remove members of the academic council from the definition of an internal member. This means that an internal member is a member of staff of the technological university or is a person who is remunerated under contract with the technological university. These definitions are now accurate. They align with the definitions in the Technological Universities Act 2018. Amendments Nos. 187 and 188 make similar amendments to the definitions of "external member" and "internal member" of the governing body of an institute of technology. Amendments Nos. 180 and 182 provide for consultation by the president of a technological university with trade unions or staff associations of members of staff on the preparation of the strategic development plan and the equality statement of the technological university. Sections 89 and 90 amend the Technological Universities Act to provide for consultation on the preparation of these plans with certain persons and bodies. It is considered - and I know it is a view conveyed today - to include trade unions and staff associations of members of staff in these consultation processes. </p>

I do not mean to be rude, but I think my Opposition colleagues' amendments are probably part of the same argument that we had earlier. I think the same arguments on both sides stand. I will not repeat my argument on that. Amendment No. 183 seeks to provide specific details of the breakdown of the membership of the five internal members, other than the president of the governing body of an institute of technology. These provisions are in accordance with the provisions for internal memberships of the governing body of a college under section 82 of the Technological Universities Act. The reason for amendment No. 183 is to ensure it is in accordance with the election provisions for academic and non-academic staff to the governing body of institute of technology, as set out in section 82 of the Technological Universities Act. I think this was something sought by staff representatives.</p>

          <p eId="para_672">These are largely technical amendments. Amendment No. 189 is a technical amendment to allow for the additional amendment, amendment No. 192.

Amendment No. 192 is a consequential amendment to section 7(6) of the 1992 Act, which is required as a result of the repeal of subsections 4 and 5 of section 7. These subsections are being replaced by paragraph 6 of the Second Schedule, to be inserted by section 103 of the Bill. For clarity, there is a need to reference a committee of the governing body of a college as there are also committees of the academic council of a college. Amendment No. 190 is to clarify that the obligation of the governing authority of an institute of technology is to have appropriate systems, procedures and practices in place in order to implement and report on compliance with the policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government to the extent that these policies may affect or relate to the functions of the institute of technology. As we discussed earlier, the wording has been amended from "enable compliance with the policies" to "implement, and report on compliance with, the policies" to more accurately reflect the policy intent of the subsection.</p>
