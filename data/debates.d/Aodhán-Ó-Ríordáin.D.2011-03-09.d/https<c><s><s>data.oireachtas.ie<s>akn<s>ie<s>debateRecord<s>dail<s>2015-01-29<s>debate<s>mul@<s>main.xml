            <p eId="para_3">I am advised that there was an incident at Tursillagh wind farm in County Kerry in which a blade became detached from a turbine. My Department has contacted the wind farm operator who has advised that the incident is being investigated. The operator has sought a report from the turbine manufacturer and has agreed to keep my officials informed of developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> My Department has also been in contact with the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, the agency with responsibility for workplace safety under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. It should be noted, however, that a place of work as described in that Act would only cover wind turbines during their construction or during any maintenance that might need to be undertaken thereafter. Nevertheless, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, under whose aegis the HSA operates, has advised that the authority is aware of the incident and is also making inquiries with the operator of the wind farm to establish the facts and consider any appropriate action.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> I have asked my officials to monitor this matter closely and to consider what action, if any, may be appropriate after the report of the manufacturer is made available.</p>

            <p eId="para_6">There was also an incident in County Tyrone. Has the Minister sought any information from his counterparts in the North of Ireland on the issue? It is causing widespread concern. There is much concern over wind farms and their development and this is another issue about which communities may have concerns. I acknowledge what the Minister said about the incident in Tralee and I ask him to keep us updated on any issues in that regard. Does the Minister have any information on the incident in County Tyrone in early January? Has he sought information from his counterparts on that incident which is a very serious issue based on the initial reports I have seen on it?</p>

            <p eId="para_7">I was asked about a particular incident in the jurisdiction and I have addressed that. If there is any basis on which my Department or I needed to intervene or take an interest in the incident outside the jurisdiction as mentioned by the Deputy, that could certainly be considered. However, the matter I was asked to address was the one in County Kerry.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> I am aware of a small number - less than a handful - of reported incidents relating to wind farms. While all reported incidents in this jurisdiction should be assessed or investigated to identify the cause and any mitigating actions, given the number of incidents relative to the size of the deployed fleet of wind turbines across the country, it would be reasonable to assert, without displaying any complacency, that the technology is safe.</p>
            <p eId="para_9"> Wind turbines come within the scope of the machinery directive, one of the new approach directives transposed into Irish law through the European Communities (Machinery) Regulations 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">The overall objective of the EU machinery directive is the harmonisation of the essential health and safety requirements across all countries and jurisdictions within the European Union. The aim is to promote the free movement of machinery across the Single Market, while guaranteeing a high level of health and safety protection to workers and citizens.</p>

            <p eId="para_11">The question I tabled was on wind turbines in Ireland and I thought County Tyrone was in Ireland. However, I will make sure I will put down the Republic of Ireland in any future questions. I was looking for information on Tyrone and I would ask the Minister to get as much information on the record on this. There are concerns in communities throughout the country. I have sought information on this. Wind farms are contributing greatly to the renewable targets and so forth, but I think it is vitally important that we have every bit of information possible on it. I think the Minister has answered the question. However, I would appreciate if he would get as much information as possible at a higher level from his counterparts.</p>

            <p eId="para_14">How will the falling price of oil affect renewable energy development, not just in Ireland but throughout Europe, and what impact might this have on our strategy for renewable energy?</p>
          </speech>

            <p eId="para_15">The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers. Security of energy supply is crucial to every society and economy. A well-balanced fuel mix that provides reliable energy, minimises costs and protects against supply disruptions and price volatility is essential to Irish consumers and businesses. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, publication, Energy in Ireland 1990-2013, noted that oil and gas are a critical component of our energy mix, providing 76% of primary energy requirement in 2013. While Ireland has made considerable progress with regard to the use of renewable energy, it is the case that fossil fuels will continue to provide the largest share of the energy mix well into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> The 2009 EU renewable energy directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. To meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of its heat and 10% of its transport from renewable sources. Figures for 2013 show that 20.9% of electricity demand was met from renewables. Oil price fluctuations will not impact on our 2020 renewable electricity commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_17"> Ireland is regarded as a stable and favourable investment environment for renewable energy production supported by a variety of policy initiatives, including the renewable energy feed-in-tariff, REFIT, scheme, the employment investment incentive scheme and an accelerated capital allowance scheme. It is the case that the development of renewable energy in Ireland is lowering our exposure to the volatile fossil fuel imports market in the long run. The existing feed-in tariff reflected in the public service obligation, PSO, levy is a very cost-effective tool to support this development, as outlined in a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> I am continuing to develop policy and options aimed at increasing our security of supply, addressing our dependence on imported fossil fuels and achieving a more secure energy mix, while capitalising on indigenous renewable and conventional energy sources. My Department continues to refine various policy options for my consideration and I intend to publish, as the Deputy knows, a definitive energy policy in September.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Colreavy<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_19">I am heartened to hear that it will not have an impact. The public has an expectation that energy prices are going to reduce. As the Minister knows, some companies have announced a reduction in prices and there probably will be and should be further reductions. However, it should not impact on our strategy for renewable energy. Oil prices will fluctuate. I am heartened to hear that this has been taken into account by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> The Minister mentioned the public service obligation levy. In energy bills, VAT is applied to the public service obligation levy. I do not know if this is within the remit of the Minister or that of the Revenue Commissioners. However, it is the equivalent of having VAT on VAT. It is wholly wrong and should be changed. Will the Minister raise this issue with the Revenue Commissioners?</p>

            <from>Deputy Alex White<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_21">The Deputy said he is heartened by my response and I am heartened by his support for the general direction of policy in respect of the mix of our energy sources which we need to have in this country. The fall in the price of oil on the international markets has been significant, but we know that when we plan our energy policy, we need to take a medium to long-term perspective. We all know that the price of oil on the international markets has varied not just over the months and years but over the decades. It is a dynamic factor. We need to stick to the course we have adopted in terms of ensuring that we have energy security, meet our targets and have a sustainable energy policy. We should not be thrown off that course. The Deputy is right on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> On the application of VAT, this is not a matter for me. It is a policy matter on the application of taxes such as VAT. I take and understand the Deputy's point, but it is not something over which I, as Minister, have any control.</p>

            <p eId="para_24">I am willing to get for the Deputy the rationale for the application of VAT. I will not stray into other people's areas of responsibility but I am not sure that I completely agree with him that it is tantamount to VAT on VAT. However, I understand the point the Deputy is making. I will arrange for him a briefing note on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_25">3. <b>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</b> asked the <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b> his views that we must significantly expand the number of district energy schemes and co-operatives generating renewable energy as a means to developing sustainable energy and creating employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_26">Following on from some of the Minister's earlier comments and the discussions we had during our previous session in this House, and given the concern about the focus on big industrial wind turbine projects, the Minister stated that we needed to explore alternatives and that the Government was keen to do this. What sort of focus is the Government intending to put on smaller-scale district energy projects and co-operatives in terms of trying to develop our renewable energy mix in a more sustainable way and in a way which is more acceptable to the public and to local communities?</p>

          <speech by="#AlexWhite" eId="spk_14" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Alex White<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_27">This is an interesting issue which the Deputy has raised before and I thank him for raising the matter and his interest in it. One of the central themes in the Green Paper on energy policy is citizen empowerment. In 2014, my Department began a public consultation process which included a series of stakeholder seminars on the various priority areas in the Green Paper, covering a number of topics, including empowering energy citizens and putting the energy system on a sustainable pathway. A recurring message coming from both the submissions received and from the feedback from the seminars was the role that community energy could play in our future energy systems. The views submitted will be taken into account in the formation by me of the new energy policy framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> It is important to note the various community level initiatives currently supported by the Government, including the development of community energy through the better energy areas and communities programme which is administered on my behalf by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. The programme allows community and locally based organisations to apply for funding on a competitive basis to support sustainable energy upgrades to existing buildings and facilities. It also promotes the creation and development of locally based entities that can engage and mobilise community resources to lower energy bills and boost local employment. A number of district energy schemes and community co-operative projects have been supported, including district heating schemes in Tralee and Longford as well as the Aran Islands energy co-operative, where the retrofit of homes and buildings on the islands has been funded with the ambition of installing community wind turbines. </p>
            <p eId="para_29"> Additionally, the European Union (Energy Efficiency) Regulations 2014 set out a range of requirements for the promotion of energy efficiency, including a requirement for the SEAI to undertake an assessment of the potential for the application of cost-effective district heating and combined heat and power, CHP, in Ireland. The development of biomass-fuelled CHP and district heating, as well as improving energy efficiency, has the potential to contribute to our renewable energy targets. The comprehensive assessment is expected to be completed during 2015.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_30">Can the Minister be more specific about when be believes this will happen? I was looking over the programme for Government, which was written in 2011. It states: "We will double funding for home energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes..." I have tabled a question on the rolling out of the pay-as-you-save retrofitting scheme. Again, the programme states: "We will work to promote a greater appreciation of the co-operative model as a distinct form of organisation...including in areas such as...energy retrofitting, environmental protection..." and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> The Minister mentioned two or three examples, but that does not seem like a great delivery on those commitments. On the other hand, as we have discussed at length in the House, we have had big industrial wind turbine projects that have faced substantial opposition, some of which are floundering now. There was a commitment in the programme for Government to put a focus on the smaller local renewable energy projects based on co-operatives and so on, but, save for the two or three examples the Minister has cited, there does not seem to be much delivery. It seems to me that we need to move faster and far more extensively on the matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy Alex White<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_32">The Deputy has fairly raised the issue of resources and the extent to which we can find and devote more resources to these projects. It is a fair point. Resources have been scarce all around Government for reasons that are well known in the House. Anyway, I believe matters have improved. We have a budget for the support programmes that I referred to in my reply. I am keen to see us having more resources in due course to devote to these kinds of project and I have taken a generous view when meeting representatives of communities who want to bring forward projects of this nature. In the course of the next period I believe more resources will be available, just as there will be more resources available across Government, to do the things we want to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> The question of where these community projects fit into the broader policy mix is relevant. That is a job for the definitive energy policy statement that I intend to publish in September. We are in a process at the moment in that regard. Many of these issues and ideas were signalled in the Green Paper and we are bringing them forward. I have met many individuals and groups to discuss these matters. I welcome the Deputy's input, but in terms of the overall policy sweep, it is a matter for the White Paper, which I will publish in September.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_34">A total of €335 million per year comes from the public service obligation levy, which is supposed to be focused on developing renewable energy. It would be interesting to see a breakdown and to discover exactly where it is going and the extent to which it is going to local projects or smaller-scale community-based projects, co-operatives and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> I welcome the fact that the Minister has referred to September. At least we have a date. Regardless, I believe the roll-out of these projects is rather slow. Money is available through the strategic investment fund amounting to billions of euro. Sources of funding are available. Many schemes could be self-funding if we put in some of the money up front. They would actually pay for themselves in the medium to long term. Anyway, I do not believe the roll-out, investment or focus on these things has been extensive enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> As part of the energy review I hope the Minister will discuss an option that I have suggested to him, which was suggested to me, in turn, by the Woodland League. This is the issue of 500,000 acres of Coillte lands that are not being used by Coillte but that could be used by local communities and co-operatives to develop these kinds of project.</p>

            <p eId="para_37">I take on board all of those ideas. I assure the Deputy that the more resources I can get for this, the better. I will seek to obtain as much support as possible in respect of these initiatives and I believe the Government has been supportive.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is the body that leads and directs in this area. I encourage Deputy Boyd Barrett to engage with the authority, perhaps through me. The authority is keen to ensure that there are community supports. Many have been put in place, but we can increase the total. This can be done from a substantive point of view in terms of what the local projects can achieve for their localities.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> The broader point that the Deputy makes is fair, and others have made it in this House as well. The development of energy and community buy-in is something all the citizens of the country have a stake in. "Buy-in" is the phrase that is often used. The idea is that we work together as a community to work out what our energy needs are for the future and what the various mix of energy sources should be.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> I do not disagree with the Deputy, save to say that it is not true to suggest that there have been no developments. There have been a number of developments and I am keen to see more, just as he is.</p>

            <p eId="para_43">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. Privacy and data protection issues have been part of the debate on the postcode system, now branded as Eircode, since the establishment of a national postcodes board in 2005 to examine the introduction of postcodes in Ireland. There has been engagement by my Department with the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner on Eircode generally at various points since then. This has been under discussion for ten years, since 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> The main challenge in designing Eircode was to find a design that addressed the fact that 35% of addresses in Ireland were non-unique. An area-based code would not have addressed this problem and would have resulted in a sub-optimal solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has expressed concerns in the past about data protection aspects of the design of Eircode. The design of the code and the concerns that have been expressed have been accorded high priority in the project implementation in order that any privacy issues are comprehensively managed. Holders of personal data are bound by data protection legislation on how they store and use this data, and the introduction of Eircode will not alter this obligation. In addition, the contract with Capita, the Eircode management licence holder, contains a range of safeguards on data protection. Furthermore, commercial organisations selling products based on Eircode will also be subject to stringent data protection requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> To ensure that the public can have absolute confidence in the project, I plan to bring proposals for legislation to Cabinet shortly on data protection in respect of the Eircode project. The proposed legislation will provide clarity on the use of Eircodes and Eircode databases to ensure that data protection issues affecting the project and the general public are fully addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_49">The line used in recent months was that there was no issue in respect of data protection, that all the consultation had taken place in respect of data protection and that the Department and the Government were satisfied with the data protection regulations, in spite of the fact that a raft of people had been raising concerns. However, there must have been a serious issue if the Government has now embarked on the road of putting legislation before the House. Obviously, there must be a major issue in this regard. The advice given to those of us in the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications and in replies to parliamentary questions must have been incorrect. That is what I have been led to believe from this morning's answer.</p>

            <p eId="para_50">I gave the same answer any time I was asked. There has been ongoing contact with the Data Protection Commissioner. It is no secret that the Data Protection Commissioner raised certain concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> The Department undertook a privacy impact assessment at the request of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. The purpose of that privacy impact assessment was to ensure that any potential privacy impact on individuals as a result of the introduction of Eircode would be recognised and addressed. The assessment has concluded that the introduction of Eircode is unlikely to have any significant adverse effect on the right to privacy.</p>
            <p eId="para_52">In addition to the licensing conditions with Capita, some strengthening of the data protection safeguards associated with the postcode operation is recommended. It will be a short Bill. One could describe it as a belt and braces approach. There is no suggestion that the project would not be covered by the Data Protection Acts. Where the storage and use of information collected is covered by the Data Protection Act, it will continue to be the case. However, there is no harm in ensuring, by way of a short Bill, which will be brought before the House once the Government has agreed it, that there will be no concerns whatsoever. There is nothing new in that.</p>

            <p eId="para_58">There was quite an extensive debate about the climate action and low carbon energy Bill in the House this week. The response to that Bill from environmental organisations has been very critical, for two primary reasons. One is that it fails to bring in binding targets and the other relates to concerns about the independence of the advisory council that would advise the Government on developing plans in the area of mitigation, CO2 reductions, adaptation and so on. I just want the Minister's response to this. I believe the Labour Party was pushing for the independence of the advisory committee, but there is great concern that the structure of that committee will not be independent in the way that it should be and that, taken with the lack of binding targets-----</p>

            <p eId="para_59">The question was to ask me my input to this Bill. It is under the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and not mine, but my Department participates fully in the whole of Government approach to addressing the challenges of climate change and the transition to a low carbon energy system and, in this regard, had an input to the climate action and low carbon energy Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> The Bill is to provide for the approval of plans by the Government in relation to climate change for the purpose of pursuing the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by the year 2050. The Bill represents a commitment to existing or future obligations of the State under the law of the European Union and any relevant international agreement. It provides for the making, by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, and submission to the Government for approval, of a national low carbon transition and mitigation plan, and a national climate change adaptation framework. My Department is fully engaged with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and all other relevant Departments and agencies, in progressing this work.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> As the Deputy points out, the Bill also provides for the establishment of a national expert advisory council on climate change, which will consist of a chairperson and between eight and ten ordinary members, four of whom shall be <i>ex officio </i>members comprising the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Teagasc, and the Economic and Social Research Institute. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, as the Deputy is aware, is an agency under the remit of my Department. The members of the council will be appointed by the Government, on the nomination of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. In nominating and appointing the chairperson and ordinary members, other than the <i>ex officio </i>members, regard will be had to the range of qualifications, expertise and experience necessary for the proper and effective performance of the functions of the expert advisory council. The functions of the council will be to advise and make recommendations to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in relation to the national mitigation plan, the national adaptation framework and sectoral adaptation plans.</p>

            <p eId="para_62">The fact that it is under one Department is almost by the by. In this area, more than most, we need joined-up thinking between a number of Departments. Underlying some of the concerns about the failure of the Bill to establish binding targets and concerns about the lack of independence of the advisory body is a belief that there may be a tension between certain interests, possibly within agriculture or industry, and others, who see a significant urgency in meeting CO2 targets and coming up with strategies that can help achieve that. That is what was lacking. The worry is that the lack of independence of this body and the lack of targets indicate a lack of seriousness about meeting these targets, or a lack of detailed sectoral plans, projects, focus and investment in reducing CO2 emissions in a serious way.</p>

            <p eId="para_63">As the Deputy is aware, we have binding 2020 targets, which require us to act. My Department is critically involved with those targets. I have given information to the House before - in fact, earlier in my contribution this morning - on this. They are very exacting targets and they require an enormous amount of work. That work is continuing. It is not a question of there not being targets. There are targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> The Deputy must appreciate that I do not have seisin of this particular piece of legislation; my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, does. I would not assume, as the Deputy appears to, that the national expert advisory council would lack independence. I have given an indication of the intended make-up of the body. I do not see any basis for the Deputy to assume in advance that there would be any difficulty with that council, but in the course of the debate on the legislation, the Deputy will be able to bring forward any concerns he has about that council, because I agree that it should be a fully effective body, which should assist the Minister and the Oireachtas in this critically important area.</p>

            <p eId="para_65">There is concern that the permanent members of this advisory body are all from State agencies - there are no permanent positions for particular environmental interests - but, to cut a long story short, and it has been a theme in many of the questions I have put to the Minister recently, there is also concern that there has been a sort of single focus in terms of producing renewable energy. The focus has been on big, industrialised wind projects. There is another big interest - an important one, do not get me wrong - in the area of agriculture, dairy farming and so on. There is concern that these things dominate the perspective when it comes to dealing with issues, rather than exploring other possibilities, hearing other voices and having other projects and more diversity in developing renewable energy resources and meet CO2 reduction targets. The fear is that the Bill reflects that and that there must be a much greater diversification and focus on alternative energy resources and methods of reducing CO2 emissions.</p>

            <p eId="para_66">Work can be done on the advisory council in the course of the passage of this legislation. I do not think the Deputy intended to do so, but I would not dismiss representatives of State agencies, for example, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Teagasc and the ESRI. These bodies are all involved in energy policy. They have really excellent people who are doing huge work for the State in terms of bringing forward the kind of policies, the Deputy may be surprised to hear, that he is talking about himself. They are very strong agencies and should be on that advisory council. There will be room for other voices, as there should be. I urge the Deputy to ensure, in the course of the passage of the legislation, that he raises the kind of issues that he has raised here, and that he continues to raise them in the context of the broader energy policy area, as I have invited him again in respect of the White Paper.</p>
            <p eId="para_67">We want to have all the inputs. That is why I have not been prepared to exclude anything from our debate on energy policy. That issue comes up again later on in relation to some of the energy sources.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">I thank the Deputy for the question. To assist Government bodies in making informed decisions about future licensing and management of any proposal for the use of hydraulic fracturing as part of an unconventional gas exploration or extraction project, comprehensive knowledge of the potential impacts of this process on the environment and human health is required. On behalf of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, the EPA appointed CDM Smith consultants last year to undertake this programme of scientific research, which is to be carried out over a minimum period of two years. The key questions that this research programme must answer are whether unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects and operations can be carried out in the island of Ireland while also protecting the environment and human health; and what constitutes best environmental practice in relation to such projects and operations. To this end, the scientific research programme is based on a consideration of existing baseline data with respect to ground water, air and seismicity and the potential implications and mitigations that are required to be considered in order to understand the possible environmental impacts of using this technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> While it is not anticipated that any interim reports will be made available before the final report is published, I have sought a progress update report on the research programme from the EPA, which I expect to receive shortly.

            <p eId="para_72">We have been skirting around the subject for a while now and it has come to a certain point. Governments in Ireland and elsewhere will be left with a massive challenge to clean up the mess left by previous governments. The Government discusses doing so in economic terms in respect of the people who were in office before it. On an environmental level, people are waking up to the fact that there are massive challenges which we are not meeting. I will quote briefly from Naomi Klein's book <i>This Changes Everything</i> on climate issues, which is a must-read for everybody:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_73">In virtually most countries, the political class accepts the premise that it is not the place of government to tell large corporations what they can and cannot do, even when public health and welfare are clearly at stake.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">We need to be a great deal more firm on the point that fracking will not be good for Ireland and the Irish people. It is simply too easy to damage the water table. A simple septic tank can damage the water table and it is frightening what fracking can do. The Government should be stronger on the issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_75">I agree with the Deputy's sentiments and am at one with him on his concern, having met with a number of groups, including during the summer with Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn and Senator Michael Comiskey. I note that Deputy Michael Colreavy has a very strong interest in the area also. There are concerns. In fact, more than 1,000 submissions came from the community during the consultation period prior to the EPA report. That was not just in relation to the environment, but predominantly on health and health impacts. That is why we have built a very strong health pillar into the EPA report. It is also why there is a representative from the health sector on this particular body.</p>
            <p eId="para_76"> I was very concerned that the EPA would do a two-year report and let someone deal with it then. I sought and built in, not necessarily a mid-term review, but an appraisal of where matters stand at this juncture. The process only commenced last August, but the appraisal will happen shortly. We must look at a mechanism to distribute the resulting information. If there are ideas from the other side of the House, I will move that forward. I am certainly open to them.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">The concept of the effect on health should be paramount but we cannot just pay lip-service to it. We must be proactive and tackle some of the problems that could arise to damage our health. The Minister, Deputy Alex White, spoke to Deputy Boyd Barrett during the last question about the 2020 programme targets. It was worrying to hear the Taoiseach refer last Tuesday week to Ireland being in a position to negotiate with the EU on the targets we have. The only thing we should be negotiating is the possibility of achieving better targets in faster times. People are really concerned and there is a bit of a wakening up on the challenges of climate change and the attaching health issues. As a small country, it would be great for Ireland to be stronger and to act as a leading light in this area. It was great to see Scotland put a stop to fracking recently.</p>

            <p eId="para_78">I thank Deputy Wallace for putting down this important question. The starting point must be that none of us has a monopoly on wisdom in relation to hydraulic fracturing. Many of us are absolutely clear that it should not be allowed anywhere on the island of Ireland. It is very welcome that the Minister of State has sought an interim report. I ask that the report be made public and presented before the Oireachtas committee to allow its members to look at the whole scope of it. There continues to be serious public concern in relation to potential gaps in the scope of the research being carried out.</p>

            <p eId="para_79">I will relay the Deputy's concerns. We will look at a mechanism to disseminate that information. On Deputy Wallace's concerns on health, I note that there is a licensing round in the Atlantic margins currently. If one looks at the acreage available to Ireland in that context, Ireland is the fourth largest country in Europe in geographical terms. There is a momentum offshore and within the industry on the potential within the new round of licensing in the Atlantic margin. I am on record regarding my personal opinion as to whether there is enough acreage out there to focus on that sector and oil and gas drilling offshore. I think there is.</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> Is Ireland too small a country with so unique an architectural and archaeological heritage to have fracking here? Without pre-empting any of the information in the report to which I have no access, I note that I have my own reservations given the size of Ireland and the architectural and archaeological uniqueness of the island on going to a stage for hydraulic fracturing. We know of reports in other countries of environmental and health concerns. That is my personal view and I am on record as having said that in the past. I have my concerns. While I am certainly not pre-empting what will come out of the report, I wish to record that again. </p>

            <p eId="para_81">7. <b>Deputy Clare Daly</b> asked the <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b> in view of the fact that the intention of the Scottish Government is that Torness and Hunterson nuclear stations will be closed and replaced by renewables energy generation, whether his view that nuclear power is an option for this country is mistaken in view of the potential for renewable energy off the coast.

            <p eId="para_82">As the Minister is aware, some of the most successful developments in renewable energy have been in countries that have made a decision to end their connection with nuclear power. The question relates in this instance to Scotland, where the decision has been made to shut down nuclear power stations. Scotland has invested heavily and strategically in renewable energy. The two decisions are linked. Thus, the Minister's comments about leaving open the possibility that this country, which has up to now been nuclear-free, may turn in that direction are completely against international best practice. He might like to explain his comments.</p>

            <p eId="para_83">The May 2014 Green Paper on energy policy in Ireland covers a broad range of energy issues, including an exploration of all possible fuel options for securing a balanced, sustainable and secure energy mix. It is in this context that any current discussions on nuclear energy policy are taking place.</p>
            <p eId="para_84"> It is important to note that there are currently no plans to introduce nuclear power in Ireland. In fact, the use of nuclear fission for the generation of nuclear power is statutorily prohibited by the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, which prohibits the authorisation of development consisting of an installation for the generation of electricity by nuclear fission. The Electricity Regulation Act 1999 also makes similar provision in respect of regulatory authorisations. </p>
            <p eId="para_85"> The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers. The 2009 EU renewable energy directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020, to be achieved through 40% renewable generation in electricity, 12% in heat and 10% in transport. To date, onshore wind energy has been the most cost-effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target.</p>
            <p eId="para_86"> However, there is also the potential to diversify our renewable electricity generation portfolio in the period to 2020 and beyond. To that end, the offshore renewable energy development plan, published in February last year, identifies the sustainable economic opportunity for Ireland, in the period to 2030, of realising the potential of our indigenous offshore wind, wave and tidal energy resources. Furthermore, the draft bioenergy plan published in October last acknowledges the role that the bioenergy sector can play in the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_87">Nuclear energy is dirty power and is on the way out in other areas, and I, like most citizens, would be happy if it never saw the light of day here. We are not focusing on where our potential might lie by even entertaining it or putting it on the list. Renewable energy creates massively more jobs per unit of energy than fossil fuels. We have examples, as I said, in Germany and in Scotland. Scotland has very similar geographic conditions to Ireland and a similar population. In 2013 there were 12,000 people employed in renewable energy there. I do not know what the figure is in Ireland, but it is roughly a couple of hundred in wind and wave, maybe 1,000 or 2,000 nationally. We could be really developing our offshore wave potential. Small businesses and big businesses are not capable of delivering. The Minister's Department would fund a broad range of small developments in wave power. At the technical readiness level, they are all scoring one, two or maybe three on a nine-point scale. Small operators cannot take it to the stage at which this type of protocol could be developed, even though the potential may be there. We need to do something a lot bigger than we may have considered before.</p>

            <p eId="para_88">That is the point of the consultation process in which we are engaged. That is the point of our having debate and discussions in this House and elsewhere on what we need to do in terms of addressing these huge challenges for the future. I do not disagree with much of what has been said regarding the huge potential of renewable energy production. The Deputy is absolutely right in that regard, but it would not be true to say that we are way behind the pack. In fact, we have made considerable strides. I will be in Scotland quite soon to have a look at what they are doing and to discuss aspects of this area with my colleagues there.</p>
            <p eId="para_89"> Deputies can disagree with me if they wish, but I have a view that if we are having a serious debate about energy, where we give ourselves a few months to look at this in the round, with all the issues raised by the Deputies on the table, as it were, and have a really clear-headed debate, we cannot start by excluding one source and saying it is out of the equation. That is the basis upon which I said we should have a comprehensive debate and assessment, make our decisions in the summer and publish in September, and I hold to that view.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">The point is that we have an advantage, coming a little bit late, in that we can start by adopting what is already international best practice. In Germany, 25% of energy comes from renewable sources, locally controlled in many instances. There are hundreds of thousands of jobs connected with it. We in Ireland are probably unique in a global sense in terms of our wave energy potential. There are about ten firms that various Government Departments are funding in this area. They need to be brought under Government control. The Government should buy them out, buy the intellectual property rights, and employ the people to develop the ideas to the next stage on the model. This development requires millions of euro. That is why even big companies such as Pelamis, Wavebob, Oceanlink, and Aquamarine have gone into receivership. Private industry is not capable of developing this potential. It needs to be brought in under the ESB, perhaps, or another area, to look at how we can harness what could be one of the most exciting international developments in renewable energy off our coast.</p>

The amount of money that is required - and I ask the Deputy to take this from me on trust - in terms of the investment base needed for these offshore projects is not in the millions; it is in the billions. I do not disagree with what the Deputy says at all in terms of her view of the future and her positive approach to it, but the idea that the State has the resources to develop these projects, even at the level of research, is a bit fanciful.</p>

            <p eId="para_95">Grid25 comprises more than 100 projects, ranging from large projects such as Grid West, Grid Link and the North-South interconnector to smaller projects such as station works or upgrades of existing transmission lines around Ireland. EirGrid reviews all projects at regular intervals and is currently undertaking such a review. The overall Grid25 strategy was forecast to cost up to €4 billion at the time of its launch in 2007. In 2010, the identification and use of new technologies, together with the re-optimisation of the Grid25 programme, enabled EirGrid to reduce the estimated cost of the programme from €4 billion to €3.2 billion. The outcome of the current review referred to by the Deputy is expected over the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_96"> Regarding two of the larger projects, Grid West and Grid Link, an independent panel of experts, chaired by Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness, was established in January 2014 to examine these projects. The panel met on several occasions last year to consider and approve the terms of reference for comprehensive route-specific studies and reports on fully undergrounded and overhead options for each of the Grid West and Grid Link projects. The studies and reports are required to include assessments of potential environmental impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors. The terms of reference for the work to be carried out were published in May 2014 and are available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_97"> EirGrid is undertaking or commissioning the necessary work in accordance with those terms of reference set by the panel. In due course, the panel will provide an opinion to me on the completeness, objectivity and comparability of the studies and reports and will oversee the publication by EirGrid of the two studies and reports prior to public consultation on the two projects by EirGrid.</p>
            <p eId="para_98"> The panel was also asked to provide an opinion on the compatibility of the methodologies to be employed on the Grid West and Grid Link projects with what has already been done on the North-South project.</p>

            <p eId="para_103">That is what the report will tell us. It involves a needs analysis. The question of what capacity needs to be developed has arisen many times during the discussions on and controversies surrounding the grid. As the Deputy is aware, the level outlined in the 2007 analysis was reduced in 2010. EirGrid is projecting future need in the context of 2015. The Deputy is right in that as soon as I have that information, it should be in the public domain and there should be a discussion in the House. I am in favour of the maximum amount of information and technical expertise being available to the public and Deputies as we debate these questions.</p>

            <p eId="para_106">The national broadband plan will deal conclusively with rural connectivity issues so that current and future generations will have guaranteed access to high-quality, high-speed broadband. The network we wish to see built will, therefore, have to be scalable and capable of meeting future anticipated traffic growth. Whatever the technology used, it must ensure that users have a minimum service of 30 Mbps.</p>
            <p eId="para_107"> In line with EU competition rules, we must observe a policy of technology neutrality in any State intervention in a competitive market. However, the scale of the Government's ambition regarding the level of service we wish to see available in rural areas, the step change in broadband quality demanded by the European Commission's state aid guidelines, the exponential growth in demand from consumers, the ongoing significant improvement in services that are now available to many urban dwellers and businesses through commercial investment, and the current fibre deficit in much of rural Ireland all point to a major role for fibre in resolving this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_108"> In line with the provisions of the state aid guidelines, we are likely to adopt an approach that will see fibre networks as close as possible to end users. Through a variety of technology platforms, retail telecommunications providers would then be able to use this wholesale network to offer services to the final customer. Last April, the then Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, announced that as a first step it was clear that at least 1,100 villages, 78 of which were in Donegal, would require fibre backhaul connectivity. Since then, Eircom has announced that two of these villages, Carrick and Gweedore, will be covered under its eFibre roll-out. The remainder of the villages in Donegal remain firmly part of the programme. There are 2,644 townlands in Donegal and 52,004 premises, of which 52% will be covered by State-led intervention and 48% will have received high-speed broadband from the commercial sector by the end of 2016.</p>

            <p eId="para_109">I thank the Minister for his reply, but he did not outline a timeline for the roll-out. People outside the main cities are increasingly frustrated because broadband is not being delivered and there is not a realistic timeline for its delivery. As the Minister stated, 52% of households in Donegal will require State intervention in order to have a sufficient level of broadband connectivity, but they do not see any light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_110"> Broadband should be bringing traditionally peripheral counties such as Donegal more towards the centre in terms of their connectivity with the world. If one has proper broadband facilities, one can work from anywhere, yet we are actually falling further behind as the broadband era develops because we are not achieving connectivity. I will cite an example. In recent months, Moville town has experienced regular outages of a couple of days at a time in its limited broadband. This is the environment in which we expect growth and business development. If the Government does not ensure delivery-----</p>

            <p eId="para_113">I did not quite pick up the Deputy's last comment. Be it in Donegal or any other county, broadband has been and is provided by the private sector, not the State. However, the State will intervene to fill the gap in those areas that the commercial sector will not service. This is an important role for the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_114"> Regarding the timeline, we launched a mapping consultation process in November. It allows all citizens and businesses to determine where they will feature in the likely future availability of broadband. The private sector will handle the so-called blue areas and the State will have to handle the rest. Some 52% of Donegal will have to be, and will be, handled by the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_115"> The overall programme is the equivalent of building a road network of 100,000 km. We must get state aid approval this year. That will take a number of months. We will have addressed a list of questions by the summer. Once we have state aid approval, there will be a competitive tendering process and a contractor or contractors will be in place in 2016. Even then, it will take three years to build the 100,000 km, but we will get on with it.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">The best-case scenario is that it will be 2016 or 2017 before anything starts to be delivered. As such, it will be 2020 or beyond before many regions get proper fibre broadband. This is an unfortunate story to have to tell them while the rest of the country is moving ahead. Little can happen in those areas in terms of developing business or enjoying the types of service for which broadband is essential.</p>
            <p eId="para_117"> We are nearly four years into the Government's term, but it is only now doing a mapping exercise. Matters have moved exceptionally slowly and there will be little further movement over the next year. For a long time, it has been clear that broadband will not be delivered in many parts of the country without State intervention. There were plenty of places, such as urban centres, where it was debatable as to whether the private sector would become involved and the Government was to see what happened. It is important that broadband be provided without delay, as areas are falling further behind without it.</p>

In fairness, I must say that it has not been delivered in the past. This comprehensive plan to deal conclusively with connectivity issues in rural Ireland will be delivered by this Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_121"> I can understand, and agree with, the frustrations of people who are experiencing delays. They can see the digital divide between rural and urban Ireland but our job is to fix that, which is what we are doing.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">In December 2013, a ten year contract was signed with Capita Business Support Services Ireland Limited to develop, roll-out and operate the national postcode system, following a public procurement process.</p>
            <p eId="para_125"> The design for the national postcode system was approved by Government in April 2014. The Eircode brand was launched for the national postcode system on 28 April 2014. The project is currently in the implementation phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_126"> The public awareness campaign began in April 2014 with the launch of the website <i>www.eircode.ie</i>. This website has information on Eircodes for both residents and businesses. The postcode management licence holder has briefed businesses in the interim through a series of seminars.</p>
            <p eId="para_127"> In order to support dissemination of Eircodes, the databases of large public sector bodies will be Eircode enabled, which means that public sector bodies with large customer-facing databases will be in a position to use immediately the codes on launch. The work on preparation of these public service databases to receive Eircodes concluded last month.</p>
            <p eId="para_128"> A comprehensive national information campaign will commence shortly to inform the public about Eircodes and promote their usage. The campaign will include outreach activities to ensure the residents and businesses nationwide, and especially the vulnerable and hard to reach, will receive information on Eircodes in a timely manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_129"> The dissemination phase will then commence to deliver by post a unique postcode to every address in Ireland. It is expected that the national postcode system will be live by the summer of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_130">I thank the Minister for his response. What discussions has the Minister or his Department had with those who have concerns about the roll-out of this system and the fact that random address postcodes will be generated? The fire and emergency services association has raised genuine concerns that fatalities may occur due to an erroneous system being set up. What measures have been taken by the Department to enter into an ongoing dialogue with all those who have reservations about the proposed system? Will the amount of money to be spent on consultants' fees be capped? That is a huge bone of contention of which, no doubt, the Minister is aware. The public is genuinely concerned about this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_131">Just in case there is any doubt arising from what the Deputy said in respect of emergency services - we can also talk about other services and interested groups - my Department has briefed all the emergency services on this project. The code will be available to all emergency services at whatever stage their systems are ready to exploit it.</p>
            <p eId="para_132"> The national ambulance service is already constructing a new computer-aided dispatch system to use Eircodes. This will be deployed in its new state-of-the-art national call centre this year. The national ambulance service has welcomed the introduction of Eircodes as they will facilitate the speedier deployment of their services.</p>
            <p eId="para_133"> There has been extensive consultation across the board concerning Eircodes. The inputs that people had an opportunity to give were very much taken on board. In an earlier question, which we can certainly revisit, I dealt with the issue of data protection and the interest that the Data Protection Commissioner has taken in this matter. Those concerns have been addressed comprehensively. There will be a short Bill before the Houses prior to the implementation of Eircodes in the summer. </p>

            <p eId="para_134">I thank the Minister again, but there are still concerns from the fire and emergency services association, particularly from first responders. Those concerns therefore need to be fully followed up by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_135"> How long does the Minister expect it will take to roll out these codes nationally, particularly to rural areas? Is there a difficulty in that respect? Is there an overlap with the proposed new system, considering that An Post already has a geo-directory?</p>
            <p eId="para_136"> Overall, I welcome any measures taken to improve postal deliveries so that the public, hopefully, will receive mail in a timely manner. Perhaps the Minister can respond to those points.</p>

            <p eId="para_137">I repeat what I said about the emergency services. The national ambulance service has welcomed the introduction of Eircodes and is fully geared up to use them. I am not sure what the issue was concerning a cross-over that the Deputy raised. However, if he wishes to raise it with me after this morning's session I will be happy to address it for him.</p>
            <p eId="para_138"> This will be a huge advance for the country, including businesses and the community generally. The particular brand or type of Eircode we chose followed a consultation process and a period of deliberation. It will provide a unique code to every postal address in the country, including individual apartments. </p>
            <p eId="para_139"> As the Deputy knows, the Eircode will be a seven-character code in the format A65B2CD. The first three characters relate to a general area or routing key in which the address is located. Some 35% of addresses in this country are non-unique, which was a critical factor in the choice we made in respect of the particular design we have.</p>

            <p eId="para_143">I thank the Deputy for tabling this question. Policy on the development of the aquaculture sector is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>
            <p eId="para_144"> The consistent position of Ministers and Ministers of State in my Department and Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, the State agency with responsibility for the inland fisheries resource, has been to support aquaculture development which is environmentally sustainable and which meets the obligations of domestic, EU and international legislation, particularly the EU habitats directive and other environmental requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_145"> I understand that a significant number of land-based salmon farms have been introduced in Norway and Denmark. Land-based salmon farming is also being developed in North America and in Europe with plans to initiate Europe’s largest such installation in Scotland. I am advised, however, that the development of closed containment systems in fish production internationally is at a relatively early stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_146"> I am also advised that analysis of land-based salmon farming demonstrates advantages of closed containment system land-based salmon aquaculture. From the perspective of IFI’s statutory responsibilities for the conservation and protection of wild salmonids, that is salmon and trout, the use of these systems would mean that segregation of farmed fish from wild species is assured and longstanding issues concerned with interaction are less likely to arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_147"> Other advantages identified include controls on water quality and temperature. In addition, bio-security, diseases, parasites and the delivery of daily husbandry are much easier to manage in closed systems. The elimination of threats of escapes of farmed fish into the wild environment is also cited. All of these expected benefits would be of assistance in protecting wild stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_148"> As I indicated at the outset, policy on the development of aquaculture is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The State’s seafood development body, an Bord Iascaigh Mhara, may be in a position to advise on other aspects of developments and trials of closed containment aquaculture systems in Ireland and internationally.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Kyne<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_149">I thank the Minister of State for his reply, and I appreciate that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is primarily responsible for aquaculture. Concerns have been raised about the evolution of fish farming over the years, including salmon cages and particularly large-scale ones. There have also been concerns about escapes, lice and the effect on native stocks. Anglers are concerned about the deterioration of numbers of salmon smolts returning to our rivers. From an angling tourism viewpoint this area is hugely important.</p>
            <p eId="para_150"> The Minister of State listed a number of advantages of these systems and I appreciate that they are at an early stage internationally. However, there are advantages in terms of control of light, temperature and effluent, as well as the collection of nutrients from salmon.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">They also provide protection from predators and losses resulting from bad weather. In addition, there is no need for pesticides or antibiotics. I accept that there are also obvious disadvantages in the context of extra costs relating to heating, pumping and lighting. However, consideration should be given to utilising these systems. Will the Minister of State and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine examine the possibility of supporting any projects relating to land-based systems which might be forthcoming?</p>

            <p eId="para_152">We must always be vigilant. Any opportunity for my officials and those of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, to collaborate on an interdepartmental level is welcome. The experience in Canada and Scotland in respect of closed containment systems indicates that major upfront capital investment is required. This approach is at the development stage. Opportunities relating to it will obviously present themselves in the future as both the science and the technology move forward. It should be noted that closed containment systems are not necessarily located in coastal areas. Such systems merely need to be situated close to a readily-available freshwater supply. The Deputy suggested that we continue to engage in dialogue. If any collaborative opportunities arise for my Department and that of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, in the context of developing sustainable aquaculture, which is central to my portfolio, while ensuring environmental sustainability in the first instance, then we will consider them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_153">The Minister has helpfully reminded us that over 10,000 women spent time in Magdalen laundries since the founding of the State. Approximately half of them served more than three years, not always but often following referral by State agencies – from industrial and reform schools, health and social services, county homes and psychiatric hospitals to the criminal justice system, including the courts and An Garda Síochána. She has reminded us that some of these Magdalen women were sent to the laundries because they were unmarried mothers. Others were sent because they had physical or mental disabilities or psychiatric illnesses or were elderly. Still others were sent as a means of discipline or punishment, often for minor or imagined infractions, following family disputes or as a result of abuse or neglect in their own homes. I have met a survivor who was sent to a laundry for stealing an apple when she was hungry. These are the women who, in these institutions and with State collusion, were subjected to arbitrary deprivation of liberty, forced labour, and inhuman and degrading treatment, including physical, mental and sexual abuse. Those are all very serious human rights abuses for which the State, in its failure to protect, is ultimately responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> It is in this context that I made my opening remarks prior to the debate being adjourned. It is in this same context that I now state most emphatically that, whatever their merits, neither this Bill nor the broader previously introduced scheme of <i>ex gratia</i> lump sum payments and pensions to which it relates, represent adequate redress for those women who were resident in certain institutions - that is to say, the victims and survivors of the Magdalen laundries. In view of the fact that last night the Government yet again refused to expressly include the laundries in the list of institutions to be investigated by its proposed new commission under the leadership of Judge Yvonne Murphy, the legislation before the House should, therefore, have been used to establish a dedicated independent statutory and judicial inquiry process in recognition of the fundamental inadequacy of the McAleese process that led to Mr. Justice Quirke’s recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> As the Minister is well aware, this inadequacy has been recognised at international level and criticised by no less a figure than Professor Nigel Rodley of the UN Human Rights Committee. However, despite the Minister’s awareness, the Magdalen women continue to be treated as second-class citizens and, moreover, second-class victims by both the State and this Government. I appeal to the Minister, who I believe is genuinely and entirely sensitive to the injustice of the situation, to face down her Cabinet colleagues, including the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, and take care of the unfinished business relating to the Magdalen issue left to her by her predecessors in the Department of Justice and Equality. If she does so, she will have the strong support not only of those in Sinn Féin, but also, I am sure, from other Deputies on all sides of the Chamber. More importantly, she will receive such support from the victims and survivors who would see her as their long-awaited champion.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> The Minister has indicated that she is fully aware of the criticisms of this legislation that have been levelled by Justice for Magdalenes Research, the National Women’s Council, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Amnesty International. Those organisations have described this Bill as "unacceptable, unfair and full of broken promises to survivors". This is because they genuinely believe that it does not honour the promise made by the Government in June 2013 to the effect that it accepted and would, therefore, implement in full all of Mr. Justice Quirke’s recommendations for a Magdalen restorative justice scheme. It is not just these advocacy and representative groups that believe this. In the past three days I have received no less than 85 e-mails and letters from survivors and others who share this view. Even if, as the Minister asserts, their interpretation of the Bill is mistaken, they deserve, at a minimum, absolute clarity and absolute certainty. We are talking here about a very vulnerable cohort of women. The Minister puts the numbers at 776 applicant women, although we know there are likely still more out there. It is welcome that the Minister has confirmed that the application process remains open. These vulnerable survivors want and deserve straight answers to their straight questions. Official frankness has been in short supply over the years. If, in the Minister’s view, there is a fundamental misunderstanding of what she both intends and has achieved in the legislation, then I suggest that she should meet those concerned directly and discuss it with them in order that they, in turn, might pass on that assurance to others.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> Before I go into the detail of their stated criticisms of this Bill, I wish to emphasise that we are talking about redress in respect of inhuman and degrading treatment, arbitrary deprivation of liberty and forced labour. I further emphasise that we are talking about a scheme designed to persuade these victims to accept less than the full effective remedy to which they would be otherwise entitled under law in the interests of saving the State the potential expense to which it would be exposed should each individual victim take her case to court. That is what an <i>ex gratia</i> scheme involves, by definition, namely, reduced remedy in exchange for comparative speed and certainty of outcome. The women who have received their lump sum compensation and pensions under the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme have agreed not to sue the State in exchange for the full redress package recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke. This legislation must clearly meet these women’s legitimate expectations. Anything less would put those waivers on shaky legal ground and, as a breach of good faith, on even shakier moral ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> The first criticisms that have been levelled relate to sections 2 and 3 of the Bill, which provide for supplementary health care to the victims, many of whom suffer additional illnesses or infirmities as a result of their ordeal in the laundries and-or whose economic disadvantage consequent on their years of forced and uncompensated labour prevents them from obtaining the necessary care within their own means. Mr. Justice Quirke did not recommend that those who signed up to the Magdalen scheme should be entitled to ordinary medical cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">He went much further than that. This is in no small part due to his finding that over 90% of these women survivors already have a medical card or GP visit card. Mr. Justice Quirke's actual recommendation, made on page 7 of his report, was that Magdalen women should have access to the full range of services currently enjoyed by holders of the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 card, also known as the HAA card. He said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_160">As an integral part of the ex gratia Scheme a card entitling its holder to health services equivalent to those provided to the holder of a HAA card should be given to each of the women who were admitted to and worked in a designated Magdalen laundry.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_161">Details of the range, extent and diversity of the community services to be provided to the Magdalen women are described within Appendix G.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_162">Primary legislation similar to the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 or a statutory amendment to that Act is required in order to implement this recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">Mr. Justice Quirke even helpfully provided draft heads of such a Bill at appendix E, in order that there could be no mistaking his meaning in this very clear recommendation. Notwithstanding the Bill's provision at section 3, which amends the relevant provision of section 53C of the Health Act 1970, the form of Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendation is the reason the survivors expected to see legislation in that particular form, and it explains why they are alarmed that is not what the Minister has produced. After what they have been through, this mistrust is entirely understandable.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> Moreover, it is the survivors' view that the full list of services available to HAA cardholders is not provided for in the Bill. The HAA card, and therefore Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendation, includes private GP services. It includes "any and all" prescribed drugs, including high-tech drugs, medicines, aids and appliances. It should, therefore, not be restricted to the reimbursement list in the 2013 Act, as the Bill provides for at section 2(b). It includes "any and all" chiropody or podiatry services from any qualified chiropodist or podiatrist, including private practitioners, without the need for a GP or RN referral. It includes complementary therapies, including massage, reflexology, acupuncture, aromatherapy or hydrotherapy, once one is referred by a GP. Can I correct the Minister on the point that massage therapy and acupuncture are medically impugned practices – far from it? The entire Chinese medical system is reliant on acupuncture. It is not quackery; it is a scientifically proven and accepted practice. It includes counselling, including psychological and psychotherapy services, from any professionally accredited counsellor, to be made available to both the woman and her immediate relatives without restriction on the number of sessions attended and without the need for GP referral. It includes comprehensive dental care, including access to private dentists not within the dental treatment services scheme under the ordinary medical card provisions. It includes audiology services from private practitioners where services are not available within the public health service. It includes dedicated liaison officers to help obtain optimum home nursing and home support services. It includes enhanced ophthalmic services, beyond those restricted services available to ordinary medical cardholders, and it also includes private physiotherapy services. As I understand it – I reviewed the list and the Bill's provisions again in light of the Minister's assertions to the contrary – all the services I mentioned are promised services that are not provided for under the terms of this Bill. With regard to the Minister's suggestion that a physical RWRCI card could be issued to the women by the HSE, I welcome this and suggest that the Minister get agreement from her colleague, the Minister for Health, and make clear and definite provision for this to avoid doubt. I remind her that the survivors had every legitimate expectation that they would be issued with a physical card similar to the HAA card on which the Quirke health care redress model is supposed to be based.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> If anyone were to ask me why these women deserve so much more than the average medical cardholder or pensioner, and the grounds on which they should expect such superior health care provision, particularly as I am such a strong advocate of equal access to health care based on need alone, regardless of circumstances, I would argue for it. The provisions in this Bill are intended in lieu of full financial compensation, which these women are owed by the State and by the religious orders which for decades either profited from or made substantial public savings on the back of the women's forced and uncompensated labour. The survivors gave up their rights to take the Government to court and possibly obtain greater compensation in exchange for this. That is why nothing less will do, and why anything less is not only miserly but legally questionable and morally repugnant. If the Minister can unequivocally reassure and persuade me in her reply that I am mistaken and that the services I have listed are in fact included, I will be more than happy to withdraw this criticism and offer my full and unconditional support for this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> The next set of concerns expressed relates to the Bill's failure, despite the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke at paragraph 2.13 on page 14 of his report, which the Government promised that this Bill would implement in law, to make any provision whatsoever for the appointment of care representatives under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. This was needed in order that applications may be made to the redress scheme on behalf of those survivors lacking full capacity to ensure that their payments would be secured, protected and used exclusively for their benefit in a regulated manner with judicial oversight. This recommendation is crucial as there are allegations that some of these women may have had their lack of capacity exploited in order that their institutional carers or others would realise a financial benefit from their compensation packages and pension payments. I do not know whether there is substance to these allegations, which I have raised previously with the Minister for Justice and Equality, but legislative provisions providing protections against this very possible outcome should have been in place long before now, as a significant number of the survivors lack full capacity and many are to this day institutionalised in nursing homes or hostels run by the religious orders responsible for the Magdalen laundries in the first place. This is why in Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendations he acknowledged that "a significant minority will face difficulties managing their affairs".</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> I am asking the Minister to put on record whether appropriate assessments have been carried out to determine which survivors have sufficient capacity to manage their affairs and which do not. Can she put on record in her reply whether her officials have accepted any application from a religious order and made a payment in respect of a woman who lacks full capacity but who is not already a ward of the court or the subject of enduring power of attorney? We need this to be rectified urgently in order that such victims cannot be further exploited and the compensation package they have settled for is not rendered meaningless. The State must not fail yet again to protect this most vulnerable subset of the Magdalen survivors at this juncture. They have a right to independent advocacy. I have heard the Minister's contention that this will all be provided for in the forthcoming Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, but I am saying that the survivors expected specific and dedicated provisions in this legislation, for the avoidance of doubt. That is what should happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> The final area of concern is with respect to pension provision and the fact that this Bill utterly fails to implement in full, as promised, Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendation on the State contributory pension. The current scheme provides the women with the State contributory pension backdated to August 2013 only.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">However, Mr. Justice Quirke recommended at page 40 of his report that the survivors should, as a consequence of redress scheme measures, find themselves "in the position that they would have occupied had they acquired sufficient stamps to qualify for the State Contributory Pension". This would require the back-dating of pension payments to each woman's retirement age. Anything less amounts to what I regard as theft from these victims. This would further compound the injustice of their already effectively having had proceeds of their labour stolen in the course of their incarcerations in the first instance. It would not be acceptable and I want an answer from the Minister on this. I ask the Minister to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage in acknowledgment that this was, indeed, stipulated by Mr. Justice Quirke. I ask the Minister to do so, as no Opposition Member will be permitted to make any amendment to this Bill that imposes a charge on the State, as surely any amendment to make provision for retrospective pension payments or additional health care and advocacy provisions would amount to.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> I emphasise that the prohibition on Opposition amendments amounting to a charge on the Exchequer will prevent me from making the necessary amendments to the Bill. This puts me and others in an invidious position. I certainly do not want to be responsible for preventing any survivor from accessing any redress that is due to her but, equally, I cannot be responsible for allowing the Bill, as published, pass through the various Stages and the two Houses unchallenged as it is so far from what is necessary, what was expected and, indeed, what was promised. In its current form, the Bill represents a rip-off, and unless the Minister can give myself and the other Members her voluntary assurance that she will nevertheless in good faith consider our arguments for amendment once Committee and Report Stages are reached, I would hesitate to add my name to those supporting the Bill proceeding any further. In truth, I would rather the Minister redraw and revise the Bill, and I urge her to do so. Despite my strong reservations, I do not intend to attempt blocking the Bill proceeding to Committee Stage, but it is worth putting the Minister on notice that if she does not bring the appropriate amendments on Committee and Report Stages, my party will not be in a position to support the Bill any further. I say that regretfully and I hope that will not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> In conclusion, I emphasise that even if the Bill, when amended, entirely fulfils the terms of the Quirke recommendations to the letter, as promised to these women in 2013, it still will never be enough to ensure that justice is done and effective remedy is achieved. The redress scheme Mr. Justice Quirke recommended was, by definition, limited to the mandate imposed upon him by Government, and related to the inherent limitations and flaws of the McAleese interdepartmental inquiry, which was in no way a sufficient, much less comprehensive, investigation of the relevant human rights abuses. As such, and without casting any aspersions on Mr. Justice Quirke, it represents but a pale shadow of justice, providing only minimal recognition for the abuses suffered by the survivors of the Magdalen institutions. What is needed, in addition to this scheme, is a thorough independent investigation of the experiences of the victims of the Magdalen laundries, either by way of a dedicated statutory commission or as an express component of the new commission of investigation into the mother and baby homes and related institutions that we debated yesterday.</p>

          <p eId="para_173">It is almost two years since the Taoiseach stood here and apologised to the women of the Magdalen laundries. There are many of us who remember that day - the hope evident and the good spirits of the women in the Gallery, knowing and understanding that it was not a case that the wrong that had been carried out against them would be righted but at least there had been an acknowledgement by the State that it should not have happened and from then on, respect and dignity that they deserved would be delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Some of the points made by the Minister yesterday, about such matters as access to the scheme and getting the lump sums so that it is provided smoothly enough, are broadly true. It has gone some way to make redress, but is that not really the point? It has only gone some way. It is the absolute bare minimum - the State has been dragged out - to these women. It is not even human rights compliant and even that bare minimum is not being delivered. That is an insult to those women and to people all over this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> I take issue with the fact the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is not here. I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, but these are the opening slots on a vital issue and the Minister has not dignified the Chamber with her presence for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> I also take issue with the tone and content of some of her remarks yesterday, which were not accurate. They were a little lopsided. They attempted to, maybe, give a sanitised version of what happened and, in doing so, were derogatory to the victims and survivors of these institutions. The Minister listed a broad range of circumstances in which women ended up in the Magdalen laundries. Of course, she was accurate in that regard, referring to women who had nowhere else to go, women who were involved in family disputes, disabled women, and that they were not all unmarried mothers or anything like that, all of which was true.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> The Minister tried to say that we should not judge these institutions by today's standards. I have a huge problem with that because it is like stating that it went on, those were different times and they did not know any better. They did know better. A lot of people knew what was going on there and it is not good enough to state that everybody knew and that if everybody knew and those were different times, then nobody is responsible. People must be held responsible for what went on. It is not only me saying that. The United Nations Human Rights Committee forcefully made those points as well. The fundamental mistake the Minister made yesterday was to rely on the McAleese report and put that out there as the historical version of what went on when everybody knows that the McAleese report is a limited report that only looked into the State's involvement in the Magdalen laundries. It did not investigate any allegations of abuse and therefore no perpetrators could be brought to account or anything like that. It is a lopsided version of events. I remind the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who was in attendance at the UN Human Rights Committee, of what that committee had to say about Ireland in this regard. On the institutional abuse of women and children it said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_178">The Committee expresses concern at the lack of prompt, independent, thorough and effective investigations into all allegations of abuse, mistreatment or neglect of women and children in the Magdalene Laundries, children's institutions, and mother and baby homes. It regrets the failure to identify all perpetrators of the violations that occurred, the low number of prosecutions, and the failure to provide full and effective remedies to victims...</p>
          <p eId="para_179">It cited that as a breach of Articles 2, 6 and 7 of the convention. The committee then went on, in bold, to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_180">The State party should conduct prompt, independent and thorough investigation into all allegations of abuse in Magdalene Laundries, children's institutions and mother and baby homes, prosecute and punish the perpetrators with penalties commensurate with the gravity of the offence, and ensure that all victims obtain an effective remedy, including appropriate compensation, restitution, rehabilitation and measures of satisfaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Here we are today with an incredibly pale shadow of what the UN Human Rights Committee asked Ireland to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">I accept the Bill only deals with an aspect of the issues but it is the Government's lack of attention to the other aspects that is causing concern. Yesterday, the Minister made a point about an advocacy group. She did not name the group but I assume she meant Justice for Magdalenes. She said the group was somehow operating under a misimpression and banging a drum needlessly, and that the Bill was giving them everything to which Mr. Justice Quirke said they were entitled in terms of medical provision. As Deputy McDonald said, it is quite clear that significant issues arise that show that is not the case. It is true the card that is envisaged in this context is better than a normal medical card and that access is provided to services, but it is the nature of that access that is hugely different in this scheme from it was with the HAA card. People with the HAA card could get access to any service they liked anywhere, without restriction while all of the provisions in this context seem to have barriers. It is not just the Justice for Magdalenes who have made the point. Other who have said it include the National Women’s Council, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Amnesty International. They are all on record in that regard. All such groups have legal experts working with them and they are capable of reading legislation. They are not known for making exaggerated claims and, therefore, one would have to take their concerns with grave seriousness in this regard. I certainly do.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> The point that has been made is that these women effectively signed a waiver that they would not take action against the State in return for the full package, and that will be absolutely undermined now because the full package would not appear to have been delivered in the scheme. I echo the point made about full pension rights being given to these women. They should be treated as if they had full pension contributions. Some of the women were basically engaged in slave labour, earning substantial amounts of money for the laundries and the State was a huge beneficiary as well. They are entitled to the fruits of that labour, yet the State has not agreed to backdate those payments as they should. The points made about the nursing homes support scheme and the need for liaison officers in particular are valid and well made. It is not just that it is the right thing to do, but it is also the legal requirement in order for us to be compliant with our human rights obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> Mark Kelly from the ICCL made the point that Article 14 of the United Nations convention against torture requires people to be able to obtain redress and benefit from an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation. That has not been provided and it must be provided. In fairness, Colm O’Gorman spelled it out even better when he said that the women and girls in these institutions experienced a range of human rights abuses, including inhuman and degrading treatment, arbitrary deprivation of liberty and forced labour. He called on the Government to live up to its obligations under the Quirke scheme. That is not a lot to ask for regarding what was done to these women. Frankly, I am shocked that we even have to be here. I am particularly shocked that it appears a game is being played where the Minister is saying one thing and giving the illusion that what Mr. Justice Quirke outlined is being delivered, but the reality seems to be quite different. That is far from what we should be doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> In the final minute remaining to me, I wish to read an e-mail I received from a woman who was not in a Magdalen laundry but in a mother and baby home. She summed up very well what the country had done to people like her. It is a reminder to the Minister and the Government as to why the scheme is on the table in the first place. The subject of her e-mail was “Unmarried, unwanted, unheard”. She spoke about being a survivor of the culture, the shame, the fear and the grief. She said it was an insidious control in this State that was designed to bring the women to heel. She said that because they were female, men were allowed to rape and run, and worse, if they stood by you, you could pay for the rest of your life in servitude. She went on to talk about her own experiences and how she got on with her own life. There are people at the back of this. It is not good enough that we would give them any added misery by dragging our heels on their entitlements, not even the bare minimum we are looking for. I echo the points made and appeal to the Minister to revise the scheme as it stands.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_79">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_186">In my contribution I wish to echo many of the points that have been made already. The women who were here two years ago believed what the Taoiseach said. He is probably the second highest in command in this country. He said the State and the Irish people apologised profusely for what happened to these women and that they would be compensated in any way possible to make their lives easier and more livable in their latter years, and to show them more compassion and humanity. We cannot give these women back their young lives but we could certainly make their lives better in their older age. The contribution by the Minister yesterday was not firm enough in saying that this is in recognition of what happened and of the apology and it was to implement Mr. Justice Quirke’s recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> I do not know how a Bill, which is primary legislation, can include in it a reference in section 2 to provision of a counselling service “following a referral made in that regard by a registered medical practitioner”. Likewise, chiropody services will be provided “following a referral made in that regard by a registered medical practitioner or registered nurse”. Physiotherapy services also can be provided “following a referral made in that regard by a registered medical practitioner”. The Minister said the Bill is based on the Health (Amendment) Act 1996, but it is not. I will outline what was provided to people who had hepatitis C. It is clear that the medical service and the card were of a very different type.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_188">Once you are awarded the HAA card, you will also be assigned a Hepatitis C Liaison Officer within the HSE area where you live. Their role is to ensure you can access all of the health services to which you are entitled to and also to provide you with information, advice and assistance in relation to service providers. For example your Liaison Officer can assist you in locating a dentist, physiotherapist or chiropodist in your area and will make arrangements for them to be paid for providing you with care. If you wish to have your entitlements administered by a Hepatitis C Liaison Officer outside of the area where you live, that can be arranged for you. Likewise, if you prefer for us not to correspond with you or have information sent to an alternative postal address, we would be very happy to facilitate this.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The liaison officer provided a crucial service in terms of facilitating the use of the HAA card for people affected by hepatitis C. Why, in this legislation, can we not refer the women who were in Magdalen laundries to liaison officers? We are talking about approximately 700 to 800 people in the State and I do not know how many are living outside the State. Liaison officers have considerable experience in dealing with patients with particular needs in regard to hepatitis C.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> I will continue to outline what was provided by the HAA card:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_191">GP services, all prescribed drugs, medications, aids and appliances. Dental services, optical and aural services, physiotherapy, counselling, chiropody, home support, home nursing and complementary therapies. You will need to produce your card when accessing services in some cases, particularly if you have not attended the service before, however, the best advice is to keep your card with you at all times in case you are asked to produce it.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The information was provided by the Irish Haemophilia Society Limited to explain to people about their entitlements:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_193">All prescribed drugs and medications once on a prescription are provided to you free of charge. Again the pharmacist claims reimbursement from the HSE. We do not wish for any HAA cardholder to be prevented from receiving any prescribed drugs and medications which they are entitled to receive and we certainly do not wish for a HAA cardholder to be placed in a situation where they are explaining their entitlements to any service provider so what we are advising all HAA cardholders to do....</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_194">Chiropody services are provided free of charge, you do not need a referral and can attend whenever you need to do so. Your Hepatitis C Liaison Officer can provide you with details on Chiropodists in your area or alternatively you can attend a chiropodist of your choice once you have given us copies of their qualifications as they need to be accredited to one of the accrediting bodies for Chiropodists. Further details can be found in the guide to services.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">The Irish Haemophilia Society further advises:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_196">Counselling services are provided without charge to all HAA cardholders and also their immediate relatives. The Hepatitis C Liaison Officer in your area will provide you with details of counsellors in your area or alternatively you can attend a counsellor of your choice. We do require the counsellor of your choice to be accredited to certain professional bodies and further details on this can be found in the guide to services or by speaking to your Liaison Officer. [No referral is required under the HAA card]... All routine and emergency dental treatments are covered without charge with the HAA card and we try to encourage cardholders to attend dentists already on contract to the HSE via the DTSS (Dental Treatment Services Scheme) however, if you have been attending a dentist not on contract to the HSE and wish to continue doing so, you should talk to your Liaison Officer who will be happy to assist you in continuing care with your dentist. Physiotherapy services provided by chartered physiotherapists are covered by the HAA card, your Liaison Officer will give you details of physiotherapists in your area and further details on physiotherapy services are outlined in the guide to services book... Complementary therapies currently covered under the HAA card are reflexology, aromatherapy, massage, acupuncture and hydrotherapy. HAA cardholders need to be referred by their GP/Consultant in order to avail of this service and the Hepatitis C Liaison Officer will either arrange to pay the therapist directly on your behalf or else will re­imburse you on production of receipts etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">This is important because it is not included in this legislation. The Minister in her contribution yesterday stated that Deputies will be aware of recent investigations into spending on alternative therapies by the support group for hepatitis C which has been subject to public criticism in recent weeks. In my view it is wrong to put that out there in that it refers to the Positive Action group and these services were not part of their entitlement under the HAA card although the card covers complementary therapy such as aromatherapy and massage, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> The Irish Haemophilia Society further advises:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_199">Optical services are provided to all HAA cardholders and cover any optical services - [these are entitlements] - which are clinically necessary, including the cost of your eye examination and whatever lenses you are prescribed. Access to home support service is available to all HAA cardholders who require assistance in carrying out their normal household duties and this can mean many different things depending on the needs of each individual person. HAA cardholders should not have to wait more than two weeks for an appointment with their liver specialist and also for the first referral to another specialty, this is generally referred to as the two-week rule. [This is specific to hepatitis C but I presume the Magdalen women have other health needs which would require referral].</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> The provisions in this legislation are different from those in the HAA card. I ask the Minister and the people involved in drafting this legislation to look at the HAA card and at the primary legislation which is the Health (Amendment) Act 1996, and to consider making some minor changes to allow for the women in the Magdalen laundries. We will support any such changes if it is brought back to the House. There is too much ambiguity and this poses a problem for the survivors.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> It is very important to deal with the issues relating to capacity. I ask the Minister to explain how this will be linked into any legislation. With regard to the pensions issue the scheme provides that women with a State contributory pension will be backdated to 18 August 2013 only. However, Mr. Justice Quirke recommended that the women should be put in a position that they would have occupied had they acquired sufficient stamps to qualify for the State contributory pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> In my opinion, if not in the opinion of others, these were labour camps. The women were used specifically as free or cheap labour for these institutions. I remember listening to an interview with a woman in England who had been in a home in Donegal. They were all young women and kids. They were making wedding dresses, christening dresses and communion dresses. Their nimble fingers were very important because they were able to work with fine material and produce fine dresses. That woman said the reason that home closed was because that work no longer made money. Cheaper dresses were being made elsewhere. These children were used as slave labour and they ought to be recognised. The State should make every effort to make it as simple as possible for these women to be able to access their basic medical needs without restriction. The Minister should come back to the House with revised legislation. We will support Second Stage and I hope the Minister will at least meet with these women and explain to them what the Government intends to do with regard to this legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_80">
          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_203">I will begin by acknowledging the progress to date to address the longstanding issues and concerns relating to those ladies who spent time in the Magdalen laundries. It is very heart-warming to meet those who have had settlements made and to see the difference this has made in their lives. Some of them live in Ireland while others are living abroad. They have waited a very long time but it has made a considerable difference for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> There is no doubt that regardless of the time a lady spent in the laundry, whether a few months, one or two years or much longer, or, for some of them, their whole lives, every one of them was affected by what happened in those laundries. We are all agreed that what is needed is a fair, transparent and efficient restorative justice process. I wish to recognise the work of Justice for Magdalenes, with whom I have been very involved. Those women have been relentless in trying to bring that about. This should be the common denominator between all of us, that the process is fair, transparent, efficient and that it is restorative justice. My own life experience would convince me also that a collaborative effort will bring about the best results.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> I was struck by the group e-mails which are titled, "Don't break your promises to the Magdalen women". This is the crux and we must ensure that promises are not broken. I refer to the Taoiseach's apology which was so well received by the ladies. It was probably one of those moments in the House that anyone who was present will always remember. The Magdalen women acknowledge that it was heartfelt. What struck them was the way in which the Taoiseach made the point that they were completely blameless. He apologised unreservedly for the hurt that had been done to them. He said they deserved more than the formal apology. He said that he wanted to put in place a process to determine how best to help and support the women in their remaining years. This was the expectation and this is what the Bill must fulfil.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> Part of the concern about promises being broken comes from the shortcomings of the McAleese report and the disappointment felt by the women that it did not give a true representation of their lives, their pain and their suffering. Part of the reason was the narrow remit of the McAleese report which meant that it could not find whether there had been a violation of human rights. Almost 800 pages of testimony from the ladies had been submitted by the Justice for Magdalenes group but they were not mentioned in the report. Yet there were stories of young girls and women in prison - because that is what the homes were - working very long hours for no wages. In many cases they did not know why they were in the homes. Some of the saddest stories concern girls who were waiting to be collected because their families had given them the impression that they would only be in there for a short while and that the family would return to collect them. Some of them managed to escape but they were returned.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> The length of stay is a problem in some cases. According to the McAleese report, a total of 61% of known entries spent less than one year in an institution but this is disputed by other research and by the electoral registers which show some women spent a minimum of eight and nine years. The UN Committee Against Torture criticised the report as being incomplete and not up to the standard of a thorough investigation. Other issues not addressed were the deaths in the laundries and the issue of the unmarked graves.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> It is good that applicants do not have to prove that they suffered abuse or danger; all they need to establish is that they were admitted to one of these institutions. The payments vary, depending on the length of stay and there have been problems in this regard. Because of the shortcomings of the McAleese report and because of all the connections between the Magdalen laundries, mother and baby homes, industrial schools and county homes, there were hopes that the commission would be a more comprehensive and inclusive process. I suppose I am living in hope that the commission will go where the story leads it.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> On the question of length of stay, I refer to the differences between what the ladies say and the lack of adequate records. The interdepartmental committee acknowledged that records were incomplete or non-existent for some women. The implementation team must make every effort to give time and space to those women who have a difficulty with regard to the length of stay.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The burden of finding proof is falling on them, which is much too stressful for some of them and is causing a lot of anxiety. For some it has become too much, to the point that they have accepted whatever proof is on record, which is for less time than they spent in the institution. Some, because of their age or illness, are not able to pursue the matter through the Ombudsman but others are going in that direction. The Department should give detailed written reasons, at the initial offer stage and at the appeal, setting out why the applicant's evidence was or was not preferred over other available evidence. I know the team is working very hard, and I must ask whether it has enough resources to do the work. We know that 86% of applicants have had decisions made. When there is an insufficient written record and the Department or the team meet the women, they should treat as a matter of urgency those women of advancing years and those for whom it is urgent that the matters be addressed as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> The three pivotal areas of the Bill are health care, capacity and pension entitlement. We know the first recommendation for Mr. Justice Quirke was for a Health (Amendment) Act, HAA, card to cover the full range of services. Yesterday on Leaders' Questions, the Taoiseach confirmed the HAA card and the Minister has also said it. However, there are grey areas and there is ambiguity. It must be cleared up that the full range of services will be available to the women. The Minister must come to the House and specify this in more detail. There are debates about angel healing and homoeopathy, but we know reflexology, aromatherapy, acupuncture and massage all contribute to a person's sense of well-being. It does not make sense for them not to be included. It must be clarified that the full range is available. We know some of the women signed legal waivers not to sue the State on the understanding they would have the full range of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> Regarding capacity, do I understand we must wait for the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill? What will happen in the meantime, particularly for those with an average age of 70? We know there are ladies in institutional settings and nursing homes, some with mental health issues, and Mr. Justice Quirke found a significant minority would face difficulties. Something must be done in the meantime if we must wait for the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill. Perhaps the work of the National Advocacy Service for People with Disabilities could be brought on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> There are also issues relating to the State contributory pension, which have been mentioned. The question is simply whether the Bill will implement fully Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendations on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> I have discussed with the Minister the issues relating to An Grianán. We know girls in An Grianán worked in the laundry but this institution is not included. Some of those who were in An Grianán did not get redress through the other board, and there were valid reasons in some cases. This is where the issue of a finite time presents problems. Their experience in the laundries has been so horrific for some people that they may not have been able to deal with it through the redress board at the time. Therefore there must be some leeway on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> I acknowledge the Minister's commitment on this. More has been started and progressed in recent years than ever before in the history of the State. We have many dark moments in our history, from the Famine to all of these issues on institutional care to what happened in the North during the Troubles. We must be responsible, adult and mature enough to take all of these on board and face the past and those dark moments. We must face them in a way in which we acknowledge accountability and responsibility. We are told the truth will set us free.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> Dreadful things happened to women. Dreadful things happened in the institutions, and the religious congregations have much to answer for, but so do families and communities. It is disturbing to read of people and meet the women who were brought to institutions by their families. The story of one particular woman will always stay with me. Her mother died, her father remarried and her stepmother did not want her, her sister or her brother, so they were brought to a laundry and left there. She is a feisty lady who has made great strides in her life and has benefited from what has come out. These are the real stories . Sometimes we get caught up in the figures and we do not see the real people behind them. If the Bill is to be progressive, we must see the people behind the statistics.</p>

          <p eId="para_217">I listened to the contributions of the Minister and Opposition spokespersons, and very little seems to separate both sides. Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendations were taken on board by the Government last June. The issues being raised in the debate are about the level of benefit-in-kind, and whether there is a difference between what is available under the HAA card and what is being proposed now. Yesterday the Minister stated very little separates what is available under the HAA card and what is being proposed. All she mentioned yesterday were homoeopathy, aromatherapy and angel healing. These are minor cost constraints, I imagine.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> A total of €18 million has been paid out and 80% of the 776 applications have been processed. Mr. Justice Quirke stated that more than 91% of the women affected already had a medical card or a GP visit card. With regard to the issues at stake and what will not be provided under the card which may be forthcoming under the scheme compared with the HAA card, the difference is very small with regard to the actual services. From the Government's perspective it may be important for clarity to state the same services as are available under the HAA card will be available under the scheme. Yesterday the Minister stated every service available under section 2 of the Health (Amendment) Act will be available under this scheme. Whatever card we come up with should include all of the services provided under the HAA scheme in order that there is no bone of contention between the organisations, including Justice for Magdalenes Research, Amnesty International and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. It is not a major issue or bone of contention and could be addressed with the new card.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> Another issue raised is with regard to whether people who do not have the capacity to make an application are affected. Yesterday the Minister stated she envisages the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill will be enacted in the first half of the year. If this is dealt with as a matter of urgency and is enacted shortly, it would alleviate the other concerns which have been raised in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> I very much welcome the Bill and the Minister's approach to dealing with the issue, which has been very rapid and included seeking advice from the Department of Health. The issues being raised are minor in nature and can be dealt with very quickly to the benefit of everybody, including the women affected, which is what this has been about from day one. I commend the Minister on her speedy action. These minor issues can be dealt with very swiftly if the Government is minded to do so, and I recommend it does.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Costello<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T11:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_221">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, to the House. I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this extremely important legislation. Yesterday we addressed a further aspect of the institutionalisation of many women and children in this country over decades, namely, the establishment of the mother and baby homes commission. We still have quite a long way to go in the work that must be done to redress the wrongs done.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> I wish to ask the Minister of State about the Title of the Bill, which in English is the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Bill and in Irish is An Bille um Shásamh do Mhná a raibh Cónaí Orthu i bhForais Áirithe. Is "sásamh" the most sensitive translation of the word "redress"? It seems to me a more appropriate word might have been chosen. The Minister of State is a well-known Gaeilgeoir and he will know whether it is the most appropriate word. To me, it seems a little questionable.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> I spent many years in the 1980s living right beside a Magdalen home in Sean MacDermott Street. There I saw the older women who were institutionalised and the younger women who were very vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">It certainly was not a pretty sight. It was difficult for the nuns but it was extremely difficult for all the women and children who had been there. That particular Magdalen laundry did laundry for Mountjoy Prison. It was one of the more recent laundries to close and it has now been purchased by Dublin City Council. </p>
          <p eId="para_225"> I recall that shortly after I was elected to Dublin City Council, in 1993, I tabled a motion condemning the Magdalen laundries and seeking that a redress process be put in place. The only person who spoke in favour of that motion on that occasion was the then Lord Mayor, the late Tomás Mac Giolla. That was the degree of support I got for that motion at Dublin City Council. That is not that long ago - only 21 years ago. It shows the change that has taken place in our attitude to many people who were in institutions during the past few decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> I am delighted that when this Government came into office one of the measures taken was the setting up of the McAleese inquiry, in June 2011. It reported in 2013. That was followed by the Quirke inquiry, and now we have the implementation of the findings of that report. It is all just an ongoing process. Part of that is the institutionalisation which was so pervasive in the history of this country. It was almost the Victorianisation of Irish society for a long period. Any problems were dealt with through institutional means. We relied on that very much over the decades. We have only been operating the redress process since 2002, when the indemnification scheme was established and the religious orders were supposed to put together a fund of €108 million. As of now, approximately €42 million has been provided, so they are less than halfway towards providing the fund in respect of the indemnification and redress scheme dealing with reformatory and industrial schools. There are many issues in that respect that have to be dealt with as well. </p>
          <p eId="para_227"> I am delighted that we are putting through this redress legislation, but I am also delighted that so much progress has taken place already. Some 86% of the 776 applicants who have come forward have been dealt with by providing <i>ex gratia</i> payments ranging from €11,500 to €100,000, and €18 million has been paid out so far. There have also been pension payments, including a top-up pension payment of €100 for those up to the age of 66 and €230 for those aged over 66. Before the scheme came into place, 91% of the women involved already had medical cards. Therefore, much activity has taken place already in this respect. </p>
          <p eId="para_228"> Of the 10,000 women who were in those institutions over the years, 27% were referrals by the State. All of this happened since the foundation of the State in 1922. Clearly, we have a responsibility from the perspective of the State. Some women were referred from other sources as well, very much on an informal, <i>ad hoc </i>basis with no proper justification. This was a problem, and often the way it was dealt with was by applying the phrase "out of sight, out of mind". However, that does not in any way mean that we do not have a responsibility to give as thorough a redress as possible in this respect. At last this legislation is seeking to do that in a comprehensive fashion. </p>
          <p eId="para_229"> I read the statement of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, last night in which she rebutted the statements made by some non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and some advocacy groups that this legislation was not thorough enough to cover the main areas they had sought to have covered. For example, with regard to health serves, they said that an enhanced medical card under the Health Amendment Act, known as a HAA card, was not provided, but the Minister said that had been covered. With regard to people living abroad, she said they were being catered for, that there would be a liaison person in the Health Service Executive dealing with that. With regard to women who lack the capacity to engage with the system personally - there are many in that particular position - the Minister said that the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Bill, which would be completed shortly in the House, would deal with that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> In view of the amount of communication we have received, particularly from contact.ie, about ensuring this legislation is watertight, I was very much reassured by the Minister's statement last night that this was the case. I hope the Minister of State, when replying to the Second Stage debate, will be able to reassure us in the same vein and that the advocacy groups, the non-governmental organisations, and the concerns of representatives of the women abroad and the women themselves have been fully catered for in this legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">The Taoiseach's historic, heartfelt and emotional apology to the women who suffered in the Magdalen laundries was one of the most moving experiences I, or those who have been long before me, have ever experienced in the Dáil. I welcome the progress made to date. What has been described in terms of what happened to these women was a national shame for every county and parish throughout Ireland where these women were sent, but 19 February 2013 is a very important day for former residents of the Magdalen laundries. It was the day the Government of this country believed those women. It was the day when the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, on behalf of the Government and the State, acknowledged their hurt and apologised for the suffering they experienced after being admitted to, and working in, a Magdalen laundry, and the stigma that followed them throughout their lives. The State, at long last, acknowledged the extent to which the time spent in the laundries tragically blighted the lives of so many women.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> The State has finally opened up its heart and accepted its moral duty to those who felt abandoned and lost and who believed they had no future. Dr. McAleese, although concentrating on the State's involvement, stated in the introduction to his report that for many years the chronicle of the Magdalen laundries had been characterised by secrecy, silence and shame. I want to express my deep gratitude again on the record of this House to the women of the Magdalen laundries who began a journey a long time ago to have the truth of what happened told and acknowledged. There must have been times on the journey when they wondered if it was ever going to end - if indifference and evasion were the only responses they would receive. With courage and tenacity, they persisted. Due to their efforts, the veil of secrecy surrounding the laundries has at last been lifted and it can never be replaced. We must ensure that these women get what is rightly theirs in regard to pensions and access to health care and that the Quirke report is fully implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> I welcome the Government's decision to assist surviving women in the matter of payments and other supports, including medical cards and psychological and counselling services. This address and access must not be obstructed in any way. The Quirke report simply must be fully implemented. </p>
          <p eId="para_235"> I have a long and embarrassing list of how women have been disregarded by this State. It includes the hepatitis C scandal, the mother and baby homes, the Magdalen laundries, the Savita Halappanavar case, the X case and the symphysiotomies - women treated differently and indifferently by the State simply because of their biology. I am proud to be part of a Government that seeks to address these wrongs. We have a historic opportunity to make things right for these women who were so badly treated by every county and parish that we represent in this House. </p>
          <p eId="para_236"> I also support the statement by the then Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, that there is a role for the religious orders which ran the laundries to make a fair contribution along with the taxpayer. I agree with him that these laundries were private businesses run by those orders which benefitted from the unpaid labour of women committed to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">What contribution are the religious orders making to this process?</p>

          <from>Deputy Barry Cowen<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T12:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_240">Yesterday, I received information under a freedom of information, FOI, request from the Department of Social Protection, as did RTE. It was very revealing by virtue of the fact that it was written by a civil servant. It was sent by the Secretary General of that Department to the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It did not contain much of the Government spin that we have become used to. The first two paragraphs are redacted and we can assume they refer to the Government U-turn on the planned water charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> The letter refers to the revised approach by Government and how it will impose an additional burden on the Department of Social Protection. It outlines the need for a project team, extra staff and how resourcing and processing the payment of the conservation grant applications in 2015 and beyond cannot be accommodated from within existing resources and the administration budget allocation it had received.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> The letter also outlines what the Department of Social Protection needs to ensure that this grant processing process is delivered. It refers to consultancy costs, as if we have not had enough of them, and it mentions external service provision, including legal and procurement costs. It outlines the postal costs, as each household will have to be written to, the advertising charges and the administration team and staff required to support the application process. As the letter points out, these are the basic requirements, but if it needs to go beyond that, the costs and administration supports will escalate severely.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> In addition to the millions of euro spent on consultants by Irish Water, we now have what appears to be, unless the Tánaiste can say otherwise, runaway costs in the Department of Social Protection to service this grant. There was no mention of these significant extra costs, as they are described, when the Government revised the charges, nor were they debated by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or the Minister, Deputy Kelly, in this House. This letter was written five days after the Government's announcement. It is a far cry from the certainty and clarity that was to be brought to bear, as the Taoiseach said, in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> It appears that information continues to be hidden by the Government, as it knows every decision it made on Irish Water last year and the charges associated with it has completely backfired. The more that is revealed, the less confidence there is in the entire debacle. The EUROSTAT test results will be released in March. From FOI and statements made by the Department in the media today, we know that it is still assessing the new initiatives, even though the Government made its decision last November.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> Was the Tánaiste aware that this letter was sent? If she was, was it discussed with her beforehand? I have asked questions, as has Deputy Martin, and submitted parliamentary questions on this issue. We have asked the Minister questions, but have received no details. Other Opposition spokespersons have asked the same question. What steps has the Tánaiste taken to address the concerns outlined in the letter? Can she confirm, at this late stage, what the extra cost to the Exchequer will be as a result of the water conservation grants? What are the costs of consultancy, administration and other supports, such as staffing? Is EUROSTAT aware of these extra costs? Yesterday, the Minister said it had merely consulted the CSO on the rules, but not the content, pertaining to any such submission to EUROSTAT. Is EUROSTAT aware of the sorry saga regarding the water conservation grant and the costs associated with it because we, the representatives of the people, are not aware of it?</p>

          <p eId="para_248">There was an earlier proposal to have a direct payment to people in receipt of the fuel allowance and the household benefits package. The Government decided that, because quite a few households would be excluded from that, every household which signed up to Irish Water and paid its water bills, as well as houses on group schemes or using private wells or septic tanks, would also receive it. That was a very positive announcement in the budget and it has been very widely welcomed by people, because it reduces the water charge to €60 net for a single individual and to €160 net for a household of two or more adults. The fundamental changes in the water charging structure means it is now affordable. The purpose of the water conservation grant is to assist households with conservation measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> The Department of Social Protection administers about 85 million payments a year. It has been my practice as Minister, since the Government came into office, to seek to find very significant savings and efficiencies in the Department through reform of the Department system. A critical part of that is constant engagement, advice and discussion between the Department of Social Protection and other relevant Departments. In this case, the two relevant Departments would be the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Public Expenditure and Reform. This system probably did not exist when Fianna Fáil was last in government.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> We completely revamped the system of dealing with applications for domiciliary care allowance, something many Deputies in the House will remember. We revised the platforms and services, and the times in which services are delivered have significantly improved. In setting up the water conservation payment system, we did the logical thing of setting out a plan and discussing the need for any additional resources with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. That has been the model followed by the Department not just for this new initiative, but for all of the reforms the Department has introduced in regard to its IT platforms. </p>
          <p eId="para_251"> That is the proper way to do business. I would expect the Deputy to commend the civil servants in the Department on having management structures which operate in the same way as a private firm. In other words, we make plans when we have to introduce changes and provide the time and space to work out those plans. The Department of Social Protection, as the Deputy knows, makes more than 85 million payments a year to people like pensioners and other people who receive services and income from the Department. It works to ensure they receive them in the correct manner, on time and at the appropriate location. That is what we want to do with this payment. It is no different from our standard policy.</p>

          <p eId="para_318">The difficulty arising from the questions put by Deputy Cowen is that everybody can see that the Government's handling of this unfair water tax has been shambolic. It also emphasised again the fact that the Government has been less than fully frank with people or with Members of the Dáil when dealing with these issues. Before Christmas, the Tánaiste's colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, led us to believe that the cost of administering this sweetener, conservation grant or bribe - however it could be described - would be €130 million. The Tánaiste's colleague went to some lengths to create the impression that this was the total cost and that all loose ends had been tied up. We now discover this is not the case. I commend the Tánaiste on her preparation of business development plans-----</p>

We all await the water services Bill 2015 with bated breath. In reply to a question from my colleague, Deputy Brian Stanley, the Minister has indicated that this Bill will, in the main, make provision for addressing any unpaid water bills relating to domestic property, including privately owned and occupied property, private rented accommodation and local authority rented accommodation. It is another loose end. Will the Tánaiste inform us of the Government's thinking or what is in store for those who do not - or, more correctly, cannot - make these payments? Will the Tánaiste please attempt to answer those two questions?</p>

          <p eId="para_338">I thank the Deputy for having the sense to recognise that even if a person is planning a household budget for a week, he or she would have to sit down and do a bit of preparation. If a Department is planning a new system for a significant payment to most households in the country, of course there must be a project team and an implementation plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">That is just good business management and political management. I do not write letters for the Secretary General of my Department. Ministers and senior civil servants are separate in their functions. Have I discussed it with the senior officials in my Department, including the Secretary General? As I said to Deputy Cowen, I have discussed it repeatedly. It is a major project, among other projects. For instance, we have major projects under way, by and large, on the efficiency with which people get their payments and on the need to develop and improve the Department's IT system, which was designed in the 1980s and the early 1990s. This is a fantastic opportunity for the Department and for the Civil Service to develop a modern IT system for a national payment to households which will be delivered on time and efficiently. Of course, it must be set out in detail. I do not have to tell the Deputy that even if one installs a new iPad or some other IT facility in one's home or in one's office, one has to sit down and work out how the new system will work. That is what the Department is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> We deliver 87 million payments and this will be an additional 1 million payments - a new unique payment to all households. Inevitably, it must bring together a great deal of work by specialists at different levels. We have very dedicated staff in the Department of Social Protection, many of whom work in regional areas, including Sligo, and who are top class at what they do in delivering services. This project will be like all the other projects. Through these kinds of reforms, the Department has been saving huge amounts of money for taxpayers and I am confident in the ability of our public servants to deliver the new system on time and at the minimum cost.</p>

          <p eId="para_341">It is, of course, entirely reasonable that the Tánaiste would have a plan, a project team and so forth. Nobody is disputing that, but it is equally reasonable that when one is proposing a scheme such as this and when one is giving figures to the Dáil and to the public, one gives the right figures, inclusive of everything, including all expenses and all outlays envisaged. The Tánaiste did not do that. I do not know whether that was because she was not in a position to give that information or whether she chose not to do so. Does the Minister, Deputy Kelly, know the answer to these questions? Does he know what the full and final cost will be for this scheme? Can the Tánaiste tell us that? Presumably, she has discussed these matters with him. To repeat, that Minister went to considerable lengths to emphasise that €130 million was the full and final figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> Although I have lost any real expectation that the Tánaiste will hear what I am about to say to her again - I apologise to her backbenchers if I sound repetitious and if that hurts their feelings-----</p>

          <p eId="para_343">The Tánaiste talks about making savings for the taxpayers and of the benevolence of her Government, but the fact remains that there are tens of thousands of individuals and families who cannot pay this charge and this will be demonstrated on the streets across the State on Saturday when people come out again to say that to her and her colleagues. That is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> Will the Tánaiste tell me what the water services Bill 2015 will have in store for those who simply cannot pay? The Minister, Deputy Kelly, informs us that this legislation will contain provisions to address unpaid bills relating to domestic property, privately owned property, occupied property, private rented accommodation and local authority rented accommodation. All of those people, who cannot pay, want to know what he is cooking up for them.</p>

          <p eId="para_345">I would like to say, in particular for the benefit of people who may be listening to this debate, that my Department will put in all of the required resources to ensure the successful delivery of the water conservation grant of €100. I accept what the Deputy said that many people are concerned about this. They are concerned about having proper clean water in this country for themselves, for industry, for commercial and industrial development and for tourism, which will create the jobs of the future for our young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> The Minister, Deputy Kelly, has produced a revised payment structure, which is now very affordable. The water conservation grant is to give people and households an assistance of €100. In regard to the Deputy's detailed question on the water services Bill, that legislation is due to be published shortly, at which point the details of the legislation will published. I am sure there will be a very full and detailed debate-----</p>

          <p eId="para_351">The recently published European health index, which is a consumer index for 2014, gives a very poor impression of our health service. We are ranked 21 but in 2013, we were ranked 14. We have dramatically fallen back seven places in those 12 months. This index is compiled from combination of statistics, including patient polls and a general survey carried out across European countries. We must take cognisance of this survey, which is certainly a wake-up call. Appropriate action must be taken to halt this downward slide and to ensure we come back up to our former rating in 2013. That is something we must achieve over the coming months. We must rectify this matter before the next poll is carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> The report also pointed out that our waiting list data were lacking credibility. This research is based on data from patient organisations because the data were found to be much more credible and accurate.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> Health care inequity is also very evident. Public patients are often on never-ending waiting lists to be seen by consultants. Their cases are often deemed to be routine, although according to their GPs, they might be deemed otherwise. In most cases, a more urgent referral is required. Eventually when they are seen by a consultant, it is only then that they are placed on a waiting list as such. This is certainly very unfair treatment and it is unacceptable for our vulnerable population and those who cannot afford to access the health services directly. The fact is that when people eventually get a hospital bed, they are treated very well.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> According to recently disclosed figures from the HSE, 382,000 people were on waiting lists at the end of the year while 55,733 of those were on waiting lists for more than 12 months. What appropriate action is the Tánaiste along with the Minister for Health and the Cabinet taking?</p>

          <p eId="para_355">The most important development for 2015, and for 2014, was the allocation of significant additional resources for the Health Service Executive. I understand people would like it to have even more resources, as would I, but we were able to devote very significant additional resources last year in Supplementary Estimates, and for this year as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> As the Deputy stated, the survey shows that for certain outcomes Ireland is performing well compared with other countries. For example, we score very well on patients' access to medications and to prevention services such as vaccinations and smoking cessation programmes. We also perform well on patient outcomes such as cancer survival and reducing deaths from strokes and heart attacks. Our infant mortality rate, thankfully, is one of the lowest of all the countries in the survey. However, the Deputy is correct that we have fallen from 14th to 22nd out of 37 countries this year, and it is a very concerning matter. The main reason given in the report for that is waiting times, health insurance status and Ireland's legal position on abortion because much of the report is compiled from a combination of statistics, patient polls, including of people who use the health services, and independent research. It is carried out by a private company, Health Consumer Powerhouse Ltd. The authors of the report acknowledge that this fall in ranking is mainly due to their decision to exclude any published official waiting list data in the analysis. They base their conclusions only on the result of their commissioned surveys of patient organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> I would expect to hear from the patient organisations that, in terms of experience and all the issues we have discussed in this House, waiting times are a major issue and concern. That is why in the HSE plan the Minister for Health has committed to addressing waiting lists-----</p>

          <p eId="para_363">I certainly believe in the credibility of this report because it is like for like across the board with other countries in Europe. We have to take it seriously and as far as I am concerned, it is factual and credible.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> With regard to the staffing and resourcing of our hospitals, it was very worrying to hear this morning that the representative of the consultants and doctors group has denied the report from the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, that there has been an agreement on recruitment and salary scales. That issue must be addressed in the coming days and I ask the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to get stuck into it because it is clear that we are not prioritising the appointment of medical staff. Our nurses are under severe pressure as a result of an exodus of very well-qualified people who have left this country to seek work abroad because of various anomalies. Recruitment of nurses is a priority. </p>
          <p eId="para_365"> We must also build up our community care systems. It is clear in the report that community care across Europe is top class and accessible to the public. We are falling down in that area. There were aspirations to build up our community services but we have not reached our targets and are falling far short in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> The necessary funding should be made available for the fair deal scheme. It costs €700,000 a day to keep our patients in hospital beds who need to be discharged to nursing homes. That is a waste of money. We must make the appropriate money available for that scheme, and we must also make available the necessary home care packages. I ask that this matter be taken seriously in the coming weeks.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_190" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_367">Before Christmas, I co-launched with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, the dementia strategy for Ireland based on funding both from the HSE and from Atlantic Philanthropies, which would be centred on the precise points the Deputy is making to assist older people in particular to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. The Deputy will see that around the country there has been a significant capital investment in community care facilities, particularly the locally based community services, which in a reformed service will mean that where people previously had to go to hospitals for many services, and even remain in hospital, much more of those could be provided at local level. That is a trend not just in Ireland, but across the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> The Deputy referenced the issue of a shortage of consultants. I understand agreement has been reached with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, about the new pay scales for new consultants coming into the system. Hopefully, that will be successful because as we know, many people who graduate from our medical schools go abroad, as they have always done, particularly to the United Kingdom and the United States, for further experience but we would like to see as many of those people as possible coming home to build their careers in Ireland. It is hoped that the new consultants pay deal which has been agreed will address those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> Above all else, across the health system, partly because of the numbers of people returning to work and the additional buoyancy in income tax and other tax revenue, we have been able to devote additional financial resources to the health service but it is critical that we do that in a well-managed way that gets the best value and the best attention. I agree with the Deputy that once people get past the waiting list problem in most Irish hospital institutions, their experience is very good simply because of the sheer quality, dedication and hard work of all the people who work in the hospitals - the nurses, the doctors and the other staff.</p>

          <p eId="para_373">It is not agreed. I do not intend to force a physical vote on this. I just want to highlight my grave reservations about the import and impact of this Bill, the implications of which have not been widely circulated. I have been informed by my party Whip that the Whips were informed at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that significant limitations are to be imposed on what the Central Bank can disclose to the banking inquiry committee. I understand that up to 60% of the documentation may not be fully accessible by the banking inquiry. I stand to be corrected in that regard. It seems that the documentation will be stored in a central location. While the members of the banking inquiry committee will have access to that documentation, they will not get copies of it and it will not be available for public scrutiny. I am informed that some of this relates to EU directives. My party and I have not received any real written presentation on the degree to which the Central Bank can provide this documentation to the banking inquiry. How much documentation is there? What use can be made of that documentation? I understand it will not be made public when it goes to the banking inquiry committee. I understand that no individual or corporate can be named. It is possible that when the members of the inquiry are questioning Central Bank officials, they will not be able to ask questions about specific banks, corporates or individuals. This should have been flagged well in advance of the establishment of the banking inquiry. Were the limitations with regard to a key player and institution in the entire banking collapse understood?</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> The new Standing Order that will have to be introduced next week is significant because it provides that members of the banking inquiry committee may be sanctioned for "failure to comply with professional secrecy provisions in respect of confidential information provided under the Central Bank Act 1942". The proposed Standing Order states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_375">(1) Where confidential information has been provided pursuant to section 33AK(5) of the Central Bank Act 1942 a member shall not make an utterance during the course of proceedings which constitutes a failure to comply with the provisions of professional secrecy referred to in sections 33AK(6) and (6A) of the aforementioned Act. Where a member makes such an utterance during the course of proceedings it may <i>prima facie </i>be an abuse of privilege, subject to the provisions of this Standing Order.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_376">(2) If, during the course of proceedings, it appears to the Ceann Comhairle that a member has made an utterance as described in paragraph (1), he or she shall refer the matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges: Provided always that the Ceann Comhairle may also at any time thereafter, on his or her own volition, refer any such matter to the Committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">It goes on to say that a submission can be made within two weeks in these circumstances. We were given notice of this motion in tandem with the legislation, all Stages of which are to be put through today. We have got very preliminary legal advice of our own.</p>

          <p eId="para_394">It seems that any Member of either House of the Oireachtas to whom confidential information is provided and who fails to comply with the provisions of professional secrecy in respect of that information may be subject to the sanction of the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with the rules set down in Standing Orders. The actual implications of this are quite serious. The members of the banking inquiry committee will have to ensure they do not breach the duty of professional secrecy that they owe arising from the receipt of confidential information from the Central Bank. It will be very difficult for the members of the inquiry committee to conduct the work of that committee in a thorough and competent way if they are precluded from referring to and questioning witnesses on documentation they have received from the Central Bank. That is the key point.</p>

          <p eId="para_418">I will repeat the point I was making before I was interrupted. It will be very difficult for members of the inquiry team to conduct their work in a thorough and competent way if they are precluded from referring to and questioning witnesses about documentation they have received from the Central Bank. I would appreciate it if the legal advice to the Oireachtas and to the inquiry could be made public and presented to Deputies who have to debate the Bill today. My understanding is that when the documents go before the banking inquiry, they will not be published. A substantial number of them might not be accessible at all. The subsequent questioning by the members of the banking inquiry committee that will follow the reading of those documents that are accessible will be limited in so far as it will not be possible to name or identify individuals or corporates. I should quickly add that my understanding of the matter is based on what was communicated to me by my party Whip after he was briefed verbally on it at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I would respectfully suggest it is no way to conduct a debate in the House on such an important matter. That is why I stood up to oppose this. I am speaking on the basis of the quick legal advice we have received with regard to this important issue.</p>

As the Deputy and I know from the public reports of the banking inquiry, there is very serious legal advice about how the members of that inquiry have to conduct themselves for the inquiry to proceed successfully. They are under heavy advice about how to conduct themselves. My understanding this morning was that this matter had been agreed among the Whips. It had also been before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and had been agreed there as well. I understand the Deputy has just learned about issues that have been raised very recently.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">I just hope that Members in all parties understand what happened yesterday. Standing Order 57 was invoked in an unprecedented manner that silenced the House in its capacity to debate serious legislation establishing a commission of investigation into matters of fundamental concern pertaining to the administration of justice. Standing Order 57 was originally brought into being to prevent the very occurrence that happened yesterday. Back in the 1980s, there was an attempt by writ to suppress debate. The response to that attempt was this Standing Order. It was known at the time as the "gagging writ" because there was an attempt made to issue a writ preventing Dáil debate. The Dáil correctly decided that could not happen, so it introduced this Standing Order to prevent attempts to gag the House. It is extraordinary that the purpose of the Standing Order has been turned around 180° to do just that, namely, silence the House. It is a serious issue on which I would ask the Tánaiste and other members of the Government to reflect. I have no doubt that all Members on the Opposition side are as one, in that this cannot happen again.</p>

          <p eId="para_446">The action concerned is not before a jury. How does a debate often start? The Ceann Comhairle or Leas-Cheann Comhairle states "notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders". That could have happened yesterday. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle or the Acting Chairman could have squared off the issue pertaining to Deputy Shatter's legal representations by warning Members not to say anything that might impinge on the courts and by putting the onus of responsibility on the Members. That has happened on countless occasions in this House, but it did not happen yesterday. The Ceann Comhairle had made his ruling.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> It is without question that the ruling was totally disproportionate. Not only that, but it was against the spirit of why the Standing Order was introduced on day one. In my understanding, there was a particular reason dating back to the 1980s, namely, to ensure that the House could never be gagged again. Ultimately, the House is master of its own procedures. The idea that a parliamentary assembly could be silenced by a judicial review or a writ taken by a Member of the House is the very antithesis of parliamentary democracy as we know it. If all of us cherish what this Parliament is about, we should urgently seek a review of the ruling on yesterday's absence of a debate pertaining to the establishment of the commission of investigation. We should all be united in having self-respect and self-esteem in our role as parliamentarians and ensure that this never happens again.</p>

          <p eId="para_451">I concur entirely with all of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Martin. In addition to concerns regarding open and free democratic debate in this Chamber and the interpretation of Standing Orders, it seems a perverse interpretation of Standing Order 57. This is the worst imaginable start for the commission of investigation. The job set out in the terms of reference is to investigate serious allegations of Garda malpractice in Cavan and Monaghan. To insist that those terms of reference would go through the Oireachtas mar dhea without the opportunity for democratic scrutiny, debate or amendment, if needs be, was extraordinary. It was quite something to see the Taoiseach yesterday insisting that this matter be forced through even though there clearly were basic and fundamental difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> We know that there was correspondence between the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, and the Ceann Comhairle and the Taoiseach's Department. We assume that the Ceann Comhairle sought legal advice on foot of that. I am making the assumption that that advice was sought from the Attorney General.</p>

          <p eId="para_454">In the first instance, we need to be provided with that correspondence and legal advice. All of these matters need to be reviewed. We cannot tolerate a situation in which the work of the Oireachtas, be it on the floor of the Dáil or in the committees, can be brought to a halt because someone runs to the courts pre-emptively or otherwise, lawyers up and sends legal letters. People know that we enjoy privilege, but equally there are constraints on us. That is as it should be. However, yesterday was utterly farcical. It is not unprecedented for the Opposition benches to clear in that manner. It happened on the water legislation. The passage of time proved it to be the correct judgment on the part of Deputies on this side of the House. Equally, our decision yesterday underscored the seriousness of this situation. I am sure that the Tánaiste, other Labour Party Members and perhaps even Fine Gael Members also recognise its seriousness.</p>

          <p eId="para_455">Before I call the Tánaiste to respond, I have a note from the Ceann Comhairle. Members will be aware that the Ceann Comhairle is required to examine in a fair and impartial manner all Bills, parliamentary questions and motions to ensure that they comply with Standing Orders. On 22 January 2015, the Ceann Comhairle received a notice of motion from the Minister for Justice and Equality seeking the approval of Dáil Éireann to a draft order establishing a commission of investigation into certain matters relative to the Cavan-Monaghan division of the Garda Síochána. The recommendation to establish the commission of investigation was made in the report prepared by Mr. Seán Guerin, SC, for the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> Having regard to the fact that High Court proceedings had been initiated against Mr. Guerin in connection with certain conclusions contained in this report, the Ceann Comhairle was obliged to consider carefully all relevant matters in the context of Standing Order 57, which sets out the rules for debating matters that are <i>sub judice</i>. The Ceann Comhairle formed the view that, while the motion could be moved in the House, it was not in order for debate because of the risk of encroachment by the Dáil on proceedings before the High Court. In reaching that view, the Ceann Comhairle had particular regard to Standing Order 57(3), which reads: "a matter shall not be raised in such an overt manner so that it appears to be an attempt by the Dáil to encroach on the functions of the Courts or a Judicial Tribunal".</p>

In reaching his decision, it is important to put on the record the fact that the Ceann Comhairle was required to implement the relevant Standing Order. His decision was reached in a fair, impartial and objective manner, having regard to all of the facts before him. Any suggestion or characterisation to the contrary is incorrect.</p>

          <p eId="para_459">I appreciate that this issue is of importance to Deputies on all sides of the House. Frankly, both parties in government would have welcomed a debate on this issue. That is why, in ordering the business of the House for the week, we provided for such a debate. As the statement read by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle indicates, however, the Ceann Comhairle had a legal contact from the former Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The Ceann Comhairle did what he is required to do in terms of his job. Whether or not the Deputy, or anybody else here, agrees with the Ceann Comhairle's decision, he was upholding his functions as Ceann Comhairle of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> I read some of the record of yesterday's proceedings. The Opposition focused on Standing Order 57(2) whereas the Ceann Comhairle in his statement, which was read out by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, referred to Standing Order 57(3). I think that may be where the distinction lies, between Standing Orders 57(2) and 57(3), having read the comments yesterday.</p>

          <p eId="para_464"> There was evidence of Standing Order 57(2), but the Ceann Comhairle has made it clear in that statement that his legal advice was guidance in respect of Standing Order 57(3), stating: "A matter shall not be raised in such an overt manner so that it appears to be an attempt by the Dáil to encroach on the functions of the court or a judicial tribunal."</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> As everybody here is aware, the Ceann Comhairle is responsible for applying standing orders, and he got legal advice. He would have welcomed a debate, which is standard on all commissions of inquiry. We made time in the Dáil schedule in good faith. The former Minister for Justice and Equality made contact with the Ceann Comhairle. The Ceann Comhairle obtained legal advice and that advice guided the decision that he had to make concerning the application of standing orders, having particular reference to Standing Order 57(3). </p>
          <p eId="para_466"> I suggest that one way of addressing this would be for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to meet in the context of the standing orders. However, the Ceann Comhairle has made his ruling. We would have preferred a debate, I will be honest about that. That is the reason we tabled it.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> The House has to see the bigger picture, which is that Mr. Guerin's report, and the debate and discussion that preceded his being appointed by the Government to scope and examine the issues, raised the most serious issues about the administration of the Garda Síochána and the administration of justice in the State. The Government accepted Mr. Guerin's report and recommendations, and they are reflected in the terms of reference. As we know, other people had different views about some of the terms of reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> However, the bigger picture is to get on with the work of the commission under the independent judge. Separately, through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, we can look at the operation or content of Standing Order 57, if that is what the CPP wishes to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_470">We all get the big picture but yesterday was a silent movie because nobody could speak. I want to make a point to the Tánaiste who appears to be condoning the silencing of Parliament yesterday. There have been many tribunals of inquiry established in this House. I set up quite a number of them myself. When I set up the inquiry into physical and sexual abuse in industrial schools, at the same time we removed the Statute of Limitations. We did so to facilitate the capacity of survivors of those schools to take legal action in the courts. That did not stop us from debating the terms of reference of that inquiry in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> The same thing happened when we established an inquiry into the Diocese of Ferns. It did not stop any debate here, even though there could have been court cases. In addition, the banking inquiry was established even though criminal cases are due in respect of some of the institutions that come under that inquiry's remit. How come there was no issue with having a debate on the banking inquiry? By the way, I welcome a debate on the banking inquiry. I have no difficulty with that but I am talking about the lack of consistency.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> If one takes any tribunal of inquiry, there are many court cases related to quite a number of them, be they on planning or whatever. Numerous inquiries have been established here and there has never been a restriction on debate in the House on the terms of reference of those inquiries or the rationale behind them. Members of the House were, of course, invited to contribute to such debates. The current situation is quite unprecedented.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> Standing Order 57 - the gagging writ, as it is called - was originally brought in to prevent what happened yesterday, because back then there was an attempt to do just what happened yesterday. It is now open to anybody to move a writ to prevent debate about particular items in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_486">I want to support the Bill which, in essence, will provide free health services for women who were residents of the Magdalen laundries and similar laundries that were operated such as St. Mary's Training Centre, Stanhope Street, Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> The Bill also provides that such women will not be required to pay the statutory charge for public acute hospital inpatient services and that the <i>ex gratia</i> payments will not be included in the financial assessment of means under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> However, I am concerned that the Magdalen laundries have been excluded from the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes which the Government is establishing this week. The mother and baby homes and Magdalen laundries were both parts of Ireland's architecture of containment of so-called "problem" women and, as such, should be investigated under the commission of investigation. Their exclusion from the commission's remit is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> As regards the contents of the Bill, the proposals as outlined do not fully reflect the recommendations outlined by Mr. Justice Quirke. The Quirke scheme's proposals for those affected included full pension rights and the granting of a medical card similar to that given to State-infected hepatitis C survivors under the HAA card scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> A report by Martin McAleese was initiated in June 2011 to investigate the Magdalen laundries. This report charts the grim details of the experiences of at least 10,000 women. However, up to 12,000 women had been resident in the ten Magdalen laundries operated by four religious orders in the reference period from 1922 to 1996. The inhumane conditions of work, the <i>de facto</i> slave labour status of the women involved and the gross unfairness of their indefinite incarceration in the laundries represented a grave breach of their human rights. The evidence definitely reveals that the Irish State colluded in the operation of the laundries. The justice system essentially sent women to the laundries, the services of which were then availed of by State agencies such as hospitals. The courts sent women to the laundries, with some 26% of entries via the State system, while gardaí returned runaways to them. The process was evidently not voluntary in nature. The State failed the women involved by not implementing effective supervision of the laundries, upholding its own health and safety standards or making provision in respect of the women's educational and social welfare rights. Approximately 1,000 survivors of the Magdalen laundries are still alive. The United Nations Committee Against Torture accused the State of grievously breaching the human rights of these women and its report led the Government to initiate the McAleese inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> Justice for Magdalenes Research, the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Amnesty International have called on the Government to honour the promise it made to the survivors in June 2013 to implement all of Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendations in respect of a Magdalen restorative justice scheme. Criticising the Bill before the House, Maeve O'Rourke of Justice for Magdalenes Research stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_492">This draft legislation does not meet Judge Quirke’s recommendation on healthcare for Magdalene women. It is an obvious and unacceptable paring back of what the Government promised as part of the women’s redress package. Judge Quirke could not have been clearer in recommending that each woman should receive a card entitling her to the full range of health services provided to state-infected Hepatitis-C survivors under the HAA card scheme. Instead, the Bill promises little more than the regular medical card, which most of the women already have.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Dr. Katherine O'Donnell of the same organisation stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_494">The women who have received their lump sum compensation and pensions have promised not to sue the State in exchange for the full redress package recommended by Judge Quirke. However, this legislation is in clear breach of the women’s legitimate expectations [and of the promise made to them in 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Claire McGettrick, also of the same organisation, added:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_496">Without explanation, the Government has also ignored Judge Quirke’s recommendation to extend the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 to Magdalene women who lack full capacity so that applications to the Magdalene scheme can be made on their behalf and their assets can be managed by a court-appointed representative in their best interests. It is imperative that legislation is introduced immediately to protect women in institutionalised settings, to provide independent advocates and ensure that their interests are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Finally, Orla O'Connor of the National Women's Council of Ireland stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_498">The Bill as currently proposed is a further denial of the rights of women survivors of the Magdalene Laundries. It undermines the Scheme as proposed by Judge Quirke, which provided only minimal recognition for the abuse women suffered. A particular area of concern is the denial of full pension entitlements for the women. Judge Quirke clearly recommended that the women should be treated as if they had made full pension contributions ... The women urgently require this compensation so as to provide a decent standard of living in their older years.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> These criticisms come almost exactly 23 months after Taoiseach's apology to Magdalen laundry survivors on 19 February 2013. The Taoiseach received much praise for that apology and rightfully so. It was an apology that was long overdue from the State to these women. However, the Bill before us is a betrayal of the women to whom the Taoiseach apologised. The satisfaction felt by the women who were present in the Visitors' Gallery to receive that apology is turning to dust because the actions of the Taoiseach and his Government are failing to honour the recommendations set out in the Quirke report. Of course, the Taoiseach has won plaudits for standing up to the church in terms of the way he dealt with the Cloyne report and in the context of his apology in respect of the Magdalen laundries. The Taoiseach is one of the longest-serving Members of the House. In that context, the fact that he waited almost three decades before he found the courage to offer an apology should have been a pointer with regard to his real commitment on these issues. It took him 30 years to become man enough to apologise to the women involved. During his first 20 years as a Deputy, these laundries were in existence and their activities were well known within society. However, it was only after 30 years that the Taoiseach saw fit to apologise. He expects us to engage in a whitewash in respect of the Quirke report by ignoring the recommendations it contains. By refusing to engage on this issue for such a long period, the Taoiseach did a great disservice to both the House and to himself, as a Member of it. That is appalling.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> It is incumbent on the Taoiseach to issue another apology to the women affected. There can be no fake apology on this occasion. He must avoid remaining silent on this issue and explain the rationale for not ensuring that the survivors of the laundries will live out their lives in the best possible circumstances. In issuing a second apology, the Taoiseach owes it to the women to behave in the way he did in the House three years ago when he found himself in a very demanding situation. I ask the Labour Party to ensure that the women involved obtain justice. At the very least, the minimum they require is that which is set out in the Quirke report. It would be appalling if those in the Labour Party allowed the Taoiseach to somersault down the steps opposite before making another empty apology. Following through on the recommendations contained in the Quirke report is the correct way to honour the victims of what was a very dark period in our history. I ask the Labour Party to ensure that the Taoiseach honours the survivors of the laundries.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamonn Maloney<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_501">Any discussion on the Magdalen laundries, either inside or outside the House, conjures up images of a dark period in the history of our country. Such images are of women who were slaves in the institutions in question - which were run by religious orders - and who were treated in a terrible fashion. These women were either not paid or paid very little for what they did. One of the difficulties I have with the McAleese report is the exclusion of any reference to the money the churches made from the operation of these institutions. The churches made lots of money from them but the report fails to mention that fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">That is history at this stage. We will not be able to turn that around but it does not stop legislators asking what the church has done, apart from apologising, to ensure the welfare of these slaves given how they were treated.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> When the McAleese report was presented, there was commentary to the effect that the legacy of the problem dates from when we were occupied by our neighbours. This is true but the record shows that when we took over the establishment from the British, both the churches and politicians buried their heads in respect of the treatment the women were receiving. This Dáil, the 31st, is the first Parliament in our history to have addressed this issue. I am not suggesting that, as a consequence, we should be very proud and slap ourselves on the backs but we have at least reached a stage where the women who are still alive - many have passed on - will be treated courteously and where their suffering will be acknowledged. A question arises as to how to make the rest of their lives as palatable as possible. That is what we are trying to do in this legislation. What occurred is part of the hidden history of Ireland. All these matters should be brought out into the open. What happened is a shameful part of our past but we should not ignore it.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> Deputy Keaveney made reference to the politics of the matter. I can say with some pride that he and I fought an election campaign for the only political party that referred in its manifesto to the Magdalen laundries. Subsequently, Deputy Keaveney deserted my party and went elsewhere. There are aspects of manifestoes of which I may not be terribly proud but I am proud that my party's one is the only one that referred to the Magdalen laundries. Both Deputy Keaveney and I appreciate that, and quite rightly so.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> Other Members, including Deputy Keaveney, mentioned the HAA card. If we are to resolve this matter fully to the satisfaction of the remaining women who were victims of terrible treatment in the institutions, as we should, we should make its entitlements available. Irrespective of how the women were treated in the past, Members should end this matter once and for all by treating the women properly at the end of their lives. We should not repeat what happened.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_506">I refer to an article in this week's <i>Irish Examiner</i> that made reference to Magdalen campaigners and human rights groups addressing the Government's legislation on the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institution Bill 2014. They called the Bill "unacceptable, unfair and full of broken promises". Sinn Féin is in full accord with the assessment of these groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> Last month, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, presented the Bill as the Government's solution to outstanding issues in the promised health care support package for Magdalen survivors. At a joint press conference in Dublin, Justice for Magdalenes Research, the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Amnesty International all said the Government package fell well short of what was recommended by Mr. Justice John Quirke.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> Lawyer and Justice for Magdalenes Research member Maeve O'Rourke called the legislation "an obvious and unacceptable paring back of what the Government promised as part of the women's redress package". Mr. Justice Quirke recommended that each woman receive a card entitling her to the full range of health services provided to State-infected hepatitis C survivors under the Health (Amendment) Act card scheme. Instead, the Bill promises little more than the regular medical card. The Quirke report stated 91% of Magdalen survivors already have a medical card or GP visit card. Therefore, what and where are the additional services promised? The women had a legitimate expectation of receiving other services, which were omitted from the Bill and which are available to HAA cardholders. They range from private GP services, access to high-tech drugs and complementary therapies, including massage, reflexology, acupuncture, aromatherapy and hydrotherapy, to counselling from any professionally accredited counsellor, comprehensive dental care, audiology services from private practitioners where services are not available within the public health service and private physiotherapy services. None of these is included in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> It is essential to note that, on page 35 of his report, Mr. Justice Quirke states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_510">In addition to the HAA card, each of the HSE areas provides a person, described as a hepatitis C liaison officer, whose role it is to ensure that persons who are entitled to the HAA card receive the services to which they are entitled under the legislation. The liaison officer fulfils an important role and is responsible for coordinating and assisting the card holder to access primary care services...</p>
          <p eId="para_511">This is yet one more critical element absent from the Government's proposed Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> In the critical area of mental capacity, the group said Mr. Justice Quirke's report recommended that the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 be extended to Magdalen women who lack full capacity. This measure is necessary in order that applications to the redress scheme can be made on their behalf and their assets can be managed by a court-appointed representative in their best interest. However, as with the heath care deficiencies, this is just one more critical recommendation that has been ignored within the context of the Bill, without explanation of any kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> The Government needs to explain why it is not providing for the appointment of care representatives. Have appropriate assessments been carried out to determine which women have sufficient capacity to manage their affairs and which women do not? Has the Department of Justice and Equality accepted any application from a religious order and made a payment in respect of a woman who lacks full capacity but who is not already a ward of court or the subject of an enduring power of attorney? This is just one more critical recommendation that has been ignored within the context of the Bill, without explanation of any kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> The Magdalen women’s supporters and human rights advocates who were present at the meeting addressing the Bill claimed the Government was refusing to back-date pension entitlements, despite Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendation that survivors be treated as if they had made full pension contributions. Mr. Colm O'Gorman of Amnesty International Ireland said it was "shocking" that the Government continued to claim that the McAleese inquiry was a comprehensive investigation. He stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_515">We remind the Government that women and girls in these institutions experienced a range of human rights abuses including inhuman and degrading treatment, arbitrary deprivation of liberty and forced labour. We call on the Government to live up to its obligations in the Quirke Scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">Dr. Katherine O'Donnell of Justice for Magdalenes Research claimed the waivers the women signed promising not to sue the State in return for redress are on "shaky ground" as the legislation is "in clear breach of the women's legitimate expectations".</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> The Government agreed in public and on the Dáil record to implement Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendations in full. Justice for Magdalenes Research believes that if the Government reneges on its promise to implement those recommendations in full, the women's waivers will be rendered legally unenforceable. Justice for the survivors of the Magdalen laundries must be seen to be done. The proposed Government Bill, as now constituted, fails to do that.</p>

        <speech by="#RuthCoppinger" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Deputy Ruth Coppinger<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_518">I was not in this Chamber two years ago but I watched on my television as the current Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, made a very moving and impassioned speech to the Magdalen women.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">In fact, during the course of the speech, the Taoiseach was even moved to tears. However, when we look at what is on offer for those women today we would have to conclude they were crocodile tears, not real tears. I printed out his speech. It states, "As a society ... we failed you. We forgot you ... This is a national shame", and he promised them a "new dawn for all those who feared that the dark midnight might never end." He even quoted from the song, "Whispering Hope". It is clear that all of the women's groups that have come together that have been cited by previous TDs on the Oppositions benches here are hardly doing it for fun. The Government is back-tracking on what it promised these women and their health and pension entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> By the way, the Government has not conducted investigations into these situations at any time. The McAleese report was a whitewash. It never should have been conducted by somebody who was a devout Catholic, a well-known pillar of the establishment and well-known for his religious views, and hardly likely to produce the most independent report.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> These are women who signed up for a minimal redress and yet they put their faith in the Government. They believed the tears that the Taoiseach shed, but now we find that the Government is back-tracking on the most basic health care. For many of these women, some of whom I have met who have lung cancer, who have a limited time to live and who in many cases are in the twilight of their years, the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke, as has been stated, were for a full HAA card exactly like what applies to the women who were the victims of the tragedy of the hepatitis C scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> There are seven deficits in what was recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke and given today by the Government. First, hepatitis C victims are facilitated within two weeks to see many doctors. All of the women have medical cards in general, but a medical card, as the Minister should know well, does not mean one gets swift treatment, and one could be sitting on a waiting list for years. These women were treated like slaves. The least we can offer them is that they will get swift treatment. They should be in the Blackrock Clinic, not sitting on public health waiting lists. The second recommendation was access to necessary medicines, high-tech drugs, aids and appliances that one cannot get on the medical card. The third one related to counselling. The fourth one was what the Minister disingenuously yesterday called "alternative therapies", which are actually called "complementary therapies" - those words were not accidental. We are not talking about Angel Healing, which I heard somebody mention. We are talking about obvious benefits to women's health and well-being, such as massage, manipulation-based therapies and hydrotherapy, reflexology and acupuncture. All of those have had benefits for those who have illnesses, such as rheumatism. The women are not getting liaison officers. They themselves will have to battle away in the creaking health services. Another recommendation was independent representation and advocates for those who are in nursing homes or may have more limited capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> The other issue is full pension entitlements. Mr. Justice Quirke recommended that the women should be treated as if they had made full contributions and the Government is now refusing to back-date that. It is incredible that the State, for example, paid compensation of €33 million to a developer for a site worth €3 million, the Harcourt Street Garda station site, just before Christmas without a bother and yet it is penny-pinching today for the women who were victims of the State and church abuse over the years. I am not surprised. It is part of a long pattern in this country where women, in particular poor women and working class women, had their lives and bodies controlled by the State and by the church.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> For the past 90 years, the State, in particular, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, gave inordinate power to religious orders to control the lives of young people and the lives of women. Today, it is being continued. It has not ended. People talk about a dark past. This is not the past. The church in this country has inordinate power, in particular over health and education. This morning on the radio we heard about parents who have to get baptismal certificates to get their children into schools where they live. This is a common practice in my constituency, Dublin West, which is the youngest in Western Europe, where there is a shortage of school places. I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, to answer why a former Labour Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, saw fit to give control of a secondary school that is being established in Tyrrelstown in my area - the most multiethnic place in the country with 51% non-Irish - to a Catholic conglomerate called Le Chéile, which includes the religious order Good Shepherd Sisters - the charity sisters who ran these Magdalen laundries - and the symbol of which is a cross. It is an insult to the Hindus, Muslims, atheists and non-believers in the area. The Government has not ended the church control of education. These orders, by the way, have been noticeable in their lack of apologies and lack of compensation to these women.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> In the area of health, the Government continues to give the church control over maternity services and women's health in an inordinate way. Under the eighth amendment, a crying shame, a woman is equated with a foetus. Over Christmas we saw the disgraceful case of a clinically dead pregnant woman being kept alive.</p>

          <p eId="para_531">My point is it is part of a pattern. It has been continued and it has not ended. Previous speakers who the Ceann Comhairle may not have heard of claimed that this is in our dark past.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> Finally, what is the State dishing up to lone parents and, as they used to be termed, so-called "unmarried mothers"? Austerity is what they are dishing up. Lone parents have been the biggest victims of cuts, in particular from the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton. Apparently, when a lone parent's children are aged seven they should be able to mind themselves and the lone parent should be able to go out and get a job even though there is no affordable child care for parents in this country. The brunt of austerity is being borne largely by women - obviously there are men as well - in these situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> My point, a Cheann Comhairle, is this: it is very relevant. We are meant to be ending a culture where the church controlled people's lives. I am arguing it is continuing. More importantly, the Bill falls a way short of what the Taoiseach promised these women two years ago. The National Women's Council has said it and many of the advocacy groups for the women have said it. I call on the Minister to not carry on this shame and disgrace of penny-pinching. Of course, this is all about money because, for example, these therapies would cost money.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> These women deserve to get privileged treatment in the health service after the treatment that they got from church and State in this country and I am quite surprised to see the Labour Party and others standing over it. One of the Labour members stated he was the only person who mentioned the Magdalen women in his manifesto. I think not. There are many on the left, including in the Anti-Austerity Alliance and People Before Profit, who championed women's rights over the years, and very little thanks to some of the TDs in this Chamber.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_535">For the 10,000 or so women who went through the Magdalen laundries, nothing we can do can undo the trauma and suffering they were put through or can undo the abuse, abandonment, exploitation and cruelty that was visited on them. Many of them are dead and will never see justice, their lives robbed almost entirely from them. The vast majority of those who still survive, most of whom are over 70 and many of whom are over 80, are nearing the end of their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">We should leave no stone unturned in ensuring that we do anything and everything possible to give them what redress, restitution and acknowledgement and justice we can, even though nothing we can do can fully undo the crimes that have been committed against them. At this late stage, when we have finally acknowledged the great injustice that has been done to them, we must make every effort and put no obstacle in the way of giving them everything they need to try in some small way to compensate for the suffering and cruelty that was inflicted on them. All of us in this House and, most important, the surviving women themselves, their supporters and family members and advocates believed that when the Taoiseach made the speech in which he apologised to the women and they applauded from the Gallery that the State finally was going to do everything it could to make up for its shameful betrayal and abandonment of those women. As soon as the issue dropped from the headlines, however, and other issues began to preoccupy the wider body politic, the media and public interest, at least from the point of view of the women themselves, and I take their judgment as definitive, the Government started to row back on the great promises it made to those women following what was deemed an historic day in this Chamber. That is shameful. It is miserable, mean-spirited, petty and frankly quite extraordinary that the Government would do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> In some of the correspondence from the Department it was claimed that certain things that were promised, arising from the Quirke report, were not promised at all. It said there was no promise to provide a similar card to the HAA card which would give access to a full range of health services, as was given to women infected with hepatitis C by the State. The Justice for Magdalenes group had to point out that it was exactly what the Quirke report said. According to the first recommendation of Mr. Justice Quirke: “As an integral part of the ex gratia Scheme a card entitling its holder to health services equivalent to those provided to the holder of a HAA card should be given to each of the women who were admitted to and worked in a designated Magdalen laundry.” That had to be pointed out because Department officials said that was not exactly what was said, when it is exactly what was said. In a miserable, mean-spirited way the Government is rolling back on the commitments and promises made to those women. I appeal to the Government to stop being miserable, disingenuous and hypocritical, given the noble promises, acknowledgements and apologies that were given by it, and just give the women what was promised to them and what they deserve in terms of some sort of restitution and compensation for the suffering that has been inflicted on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> Another point relates to the provision of advocates and representatives for those who cannot advocate and represent themselves for whatever reason – age, infirmity, disability or other reason - and that the Government would give those supports and services to those women and not try to deny those rights and supports to them in the small print, as it were. We can add to that the issue that was raised yesterday in terms of the motion we debated on the investigation into mother and baby homes. We must accede to the demands of the Justice for Magdalenes group that it would be included in the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes, given that its members are clear and categoric in their view that they do not believe the McAleese report was an adequate or sufficiently comprehensive investigation into the experience of the Magdalen women.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> I do not really see how, given the statements made by the Taoiseach and other Government representatives in recent times on this matter, the Government can do anything less. It would be easy, and it would be the honourable and fair thing to do, to live up to those promises and give the commitments to the Magdalen women now rather than the miserable, penny-pinching and disingenuous rolling back in which the Government seems to be engaging.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> I have one final point to make, as all the points have been clearly made by the women’s advocacy groups, the women themselves, other supporting groups and by a number of Deputies. The demands are clear and I hope the Minister will accede to them. It is appropriate that the Minister of State with responsibility for equality is present, because the other important point I wish to make in this House is that when all the apologies were made about the shameful treatment of women and children and some of the most vulnerable sectors of society, their abuse, exploitation and incarceration, and the destruction of childhood involved, one of the points made repeatedly is that we must never ever let this happen again. It is important to say that it is happening, as we speak, to another group of people. I refer to people in the direct provision centres. What they share in common is that, again, it is women and children, this time from immigrant minorities coming into this country, often fleeing persecution, cruelty and abuse in other countries, who are now incarcerated and in many cases have been for years. They have been robbed of their lives. We are again failing to provide equality of treatment and human rights that should be extended to all citizens, especially to women and children. That is after all the apologies and acknowledgements are given.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> That gives the lie to the pious speeches and noble aspirations that were espoused about the Magdalen laundries in this Chamber being genuine when we still allow the situation to persist for another group of people. The question is whether we will be back here in a few years time saying we did it again to another group of people, and having to discuss compensation, redress, justice and restitution for another group of people. It is utterly disgusting that women and children are being locked up in these centres in the same way, with the same cruelty, as was done to 10,000 women in the Magdalen laundries, as was done to people in the mother and baby homes, the Bethany homes and industrial schools as part of the shocking and shameful architecture of oppression and abuse that dominated this State for most of its history. The time has come to draw a line under that and to give full justice, in so far as we can, to those who have been the victims of this shameful history, and to ensure that those who are currently victims of a similar type of regime are immediately released from their incarceration and abuse.</p>

          <p eId="para_544">Most of what needs to be said has already been said at this stage, but there are a few points I would like to make. I will support the Bill. It is long overdue, it is necessary and it is an important step in the right direction. I have some concerns and reservations which I will address.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> The Bill is the first formal recognition of the abuse, pain and suffering that so many women endured over so many years in certain institutions and at the hands of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">It is appropriate that a proper and full scheme be put in place to try to address some of the problems and some of the challenges that face the women concerned. Deputy Boyd Barrett said that nothing could undo the damage that had been done and nothing could take away the fact that so much suffering was endured by these women. They have been extraordinarily brave and resilient in how they have pursued the vindication of their rights over so many years. However, this Bill is an important recognition of their situation, and I hope that some of the measures contained in it will help those women to live out their years with some form of dignity and some degree of relief. </p>
          <p eId="para_547"> The Bill is a direct result or follows on from the Taoiseach's apology in 2013, which was a very important acknowledgement by the State, coming as it did from the Taoiseach as head of the Government, on behalf of all of us - every man and woman in this State. He apologised for the wrongdoing that was carried out and the abuse and terror endured by those women.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> While I acknowledge recent statements, which are to be welcomed, in respect of some of the measures in the Bill, I ask the Minister of State to provide a degree of clarification to the House today. The initial concern was that the full HAA entitlement to a medical card and to all necessary medical services would be provided as recommended in Mr. Justice Quirke's report. It was a key recommendation, and the organisation representing the Magdalen women was extremely disappointed that this did not appear to be clearly enunciated in the Bill. The Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, yesterday outlined to the House the Government's intention to ensure that all access to required services which was promised and recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke would now be made available. However, I still think some degree of clarification is required. The organisation Justice for Magdalenes has asked why the wording of the Bill limits the number of services in the way it does. For example, they are limited in a way that the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 does not limit them. Another and related issue of significant concern is the fact that ultimate discretion lies with the HSE, which will be the final arbiter or determinant with regard to the format and details of the scheme. That is a genuine cause for concern, which I share. I refer to the very recent and negative experience of how the HSE has dealt with medical cards, with discretionary medical cards and with the requirements of people with certain illnesses. The HSE has fallen short in these instances. I would have a much greater degree of comfort if all of the services available to the beneficiaries of this scheme were to be enunciated clearly in this legislation. There is an opportunity to amend the Bill on Committee and Report Stages and I hope the Government will consider doing so or, at least, give a fair hearing to the Opposition as we try to do so. The survivors are entitled to have a comprehensive list of entitlements rather than a vague aspirational wording. There should be provided a genuinely comprehensive list of entitlements so that they know exactly where they stand as to entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> A number of women, including a number in my constituency, are still living in institutions and they lack sufficient capacity to operate in an independent environment. It is important that they are legally protected and that they are afforded full legal representation. This is a lacuna in the Bill which I hope the Government will address. The number of women in this situation is very small and they deserve the full protection of the State. The Bill should provide that fully backdated pension payments will be made to the women who will benefit from this scheme. </p>
          <p eId="para_550"> On a more general point, society must repent and make amends, in so far as is humanly possible, for the inhumane treatment of these young girls and young women, as they were, and the extraordinary abuse and marginalisation they suffered. We are all collectively responsible as a society. It is very easy to simply single out religious orders. I would add my voice to the long list of people who criticise the religious orders for the way in which they dealt with and treated these young girls and the failure to provide protection and a dignified place in which to live, work and feel safe. Equally, the Government failed, and this has been acknowledged in the Taoiseach's apology and through the publication of this legislation. However, the families of those girls also are responsible. We hear very little about the families, who in many cases - not in every case - turned these young women out and left them, literally, in the care of these religious orders, to be turned into effective slaves. We all need to reflect on the fact that the culture at the time was horrific. These young women were deemed to be a stain on their families and a stain on their communities, and the convenient and easy solution was to simply give the problem to someone else to deal with. It enrages me to think that is how Irish society dealt with those women, and I hope those days are long behind us.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> I echo what Deputy Boyd Barrett said about the conditions in direct provision for asylum seekers, which is an absolute national disgrace, but we are here today to talk about the Magdalen women.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> I wish to record how moved I was when listening to Deputy Anne Ferris's contribution yesterday evening. I do not need to repeat the points she made, nor do I think it appropriate to cherry-pick the abuses for which we choose to offer redress. All abuse is wrong, and all women who suffered abuse in institutions and residences deserve to be respected and treated equally. It is unacceptable that certain women in certain homes and women in certain Protestant institutions are excluded from the scheme as proposed. They all deserve recognition and they all deserve restitution, and it is our responsibility as policy-makers and legislators to provide that recognition and restitution. There is no hierarchy of survivors; they have all been dehumanised and victimised and they all deserve our respect, and fair and equal treatment.</p>

          <p eId="para_553">I wish to make a brief contribution to this debate, discussion and conversation. It is time for us to have this national conversation on a person-to-person basis. I was deeply touched and moved by Deputy Anne Ferris's contribution last night, coming as it did from a colleague of ours who expressed her feelings.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">Equally, I was touched by Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett, who spoke so honestly and in such a profound way, as a man and Member of the Dáil, to awaken in us the understanding that here was a very bad architecture of our Irish psyche. It was not just institutions, convents and laundries, as families also abandoned their flesh and blood. It was something strange. It is a reminder for me, when we are in these places of discourse such as the Dáil or committee rooms, that we are all part of the human family. Our hearts, minds and feelings are all integrated like the texture of a cloth or fabric. It was a very dark stain on the fabric of our Irish nation, people and family.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> As Deputy Creighton and other Deputies have stated, we cannot just do something about it in a particular list of areas. We should make every effort to have full outreach to include everybody. Deputies Robert Dowds and Jack Wall described elderly men and women who, after 20 years of enclosed silence in their very beings, just want the truth of the expression of their experience. We must hold the hands of these fellow Irish men and women, some of whom are younger or older. Some of them are still very hurt and damaged. We must let our senses try to reach out to feel their pain and have compassion.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> We must practically and pragmatically help them where they need it. It may be financial or emotional, but whatever their needs I appeal to all of us to go the extra mile, improve the arrangement in whatever way we can in committee and be generous. There is no point in being tight-pursed, tight-hearted or tight-minded about this. It is bigger than that. It would be a good example for younger people, who may not have had direct experience, insights or exposure of this darker side of Irish history, to see that we are really concerned in our hearts and minds and give time, resources, money and whatever is needed to make restitution, compensation or a gesture of kindness to the people who have been hurt.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> This travels through the generations, which is why Deputy Ferris's story was so touching. It does not just affect the people who were in the institutions; it travels beyond through their families. We have the chance to try to make up the ground, and all I will say is let us do our very best with no pointscoring. Let us throw in all we can, by way of help and kindness, to make up as much as we can to the women and their children, men and women, who had this awful experience. I ask the Minister of State to take on board that we should do all we can.</p>

          <p eId="para_559">I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Bill. One of the frustrations about it is that it should include other issues, on which people are generally supportive, but it does not. These gaps will be the problem. For many of the women, a small number of whom I know, there is a sense of frustration about one particular aspect, which is being believed. I made this point when we were discussing the mother and baby homes. The problem is the women had no control over how the records were kept. In some cases it is very difficult to prove where they were and this is a serious problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> In some cases meeting the requirements of the redress scheme will mean proving the time spent in the institution, and piecing this together can be difficult. Some particular orders are forthcoming but others, particularly the Sisters of Charity, are most unforthcoming with their information and their records. They are letting down those affected by this issue and themselves by not being forthcoming because we cannot keep dragging out this matter and this will continue to be a glaring inadequacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> One of the women with whom I have been in contact for a considerable time - I have known her for several decades - gave me a copy of a tape she made in the 1970s. She wanted to ensure she had a record of what she remembered. She needed to piece it together to put her life back together and have some closure. This was not about money for her; it was about something bigger than that, which would allow her live her life with some degree of dignity. She has a very good family around her and she had children, but she comes to me almost every week and we speak about this because she does not have closure. She has been denied the dignity of acknowledgement of where she was. I am sure there are others with fairly similar stories.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> The compellability, which is part of the mother and baby homes scheme, is not part of this, whereby one would be sure the records would be obtained. I know this would be a huge undertaking. It is part of the reason I believe the Magdalen laundries should be included, even for this reason alone. The UN Committee against Torture has openly criticised four religious orders and the Vatican for their hesitance to produce the necessary evidence and records and to contribute substantially to the redress scheme. Justice for the Magdalenes has also made criticisms that not all of the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke's report, in particular recommendations surrounding health care, are being implemented. We know it is not just about having a medical card but the benefits that go with it. Everything is not being included with regard to the recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> It is important that survivors of the Magdalen institutions are advised that full recourse to the courts is available to them if they so choose. These are all important points.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">We have all received correspondence from constituents and non-constituents who were not in the Magdalen laundries but who have expressed their support for the women who were in them. They want this issue to be dealt with in a comprehensive way. The incident in Tuam horrified us all and it made world news, and why would it not? There is a notion that we have a certain reputation when it comes to financial matters, but what impression would people get about this island if we keep showing a nature that is not the true nature of the Irish people? </p>
          <p eId="para_565"> Deputy Boyd Barrett make a point about the direct provision system, which will be a legacy issue in the future. I know it is an issue about which the Minister of State feels strongly and about which he is determined to do something. The following is the test we must apply to ourselves. If a member of our family left this country because they feared for their life, or for economic reasons, and ended up in a centre such as a direct provision centre, would we find that acceptable? If we would answer "No" to that question, then it is not acceptable here. I know the Minister of State and I would agree on this, but it is not enough to agree on it; collectively, we must act to end that system. Otherwise, we will have people in the Visitors Gallery at some future date, in the same way as we had the women from the Magdalen laundries, and somebody will be in the seat that the Minister of State is in now making an apology. We must take responsibility for these matters. I am not saying there should not be an immigration policy and strategy, and a humane one at that, but it must be done in an efficient and fair way, and this cannot be part of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> I have received dozens upon dozens of e-mails, as I am sure other Members have, from people who were not in institutions. That shows the attention being paid to the issue of the Magdalen laundries. It involves a very small number of women, but people want it dealt with comprehensively. I hope amendments to the Bill will be accepted to improve it and make sure it deals with the matter in the way people expect, and have a right to expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> Regarding complementary therapies, if one has lived or existed in a very stressful environment, often one has to manage the stress later in life. Sometimes therapies can be helpful in managing stress and keeping people well. By excluding their provision, we may not be giving people the tools that would eliminate the type of stress that could become a health care problem for them. There must be an open mind on this, or a different definition for it, but such provision should not be excluded.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_306">
          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_568">Two years ago the Taoiseach made an apology here. He spoke of national shame, referring to the incredible, horrific abuse, incarceration and exploitation of over 10,000 women, in which the church and State were both complicit and guilty. His speech was supposed to represent a significant turning point, putting that in the past, as something never to be repeated. It was a recognition, and obviously an apology, to those women and their families. The Taoiseach apologised unreservedly to all those women for the hurt that was done to them and for any stigma they suffered, but he also said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_569"> In reflecting on this report, I have come to the view that these women deserve more than this formal apology, important though it is. I also want to put in place a process by which we can determine how best to help and support the women in their remaining year. ... That is why the Government has today asked the President of the Law Reform Commission, Judge John Quirke, to undertake a three month review and to make recommendations as to the criteria that should be applied in assessing the help that the Government can provide in the areas of payments and other supports, including medical cards, psychological and counselling services and other welfare needs. </p>
          <p eId="para_570"> Mr. Justice Quirke then reported in quite a simple and straightforward fashion, one that was minimal from the point of the women. However, the first recommendation was very clear: "Magdalen women should have access to the full range of services currently enjoyed by holders of the Health (Amendment) Act 1996 Card (“the HAA card”)." There was a very good reason for him to make that recommendation in a situation where the average age of the survivors is 70, where 66% of the survivors have serious health problems and where an estimated 91% of the women currently have a medical card or general practitioner, GP, card. Therefore, they already have that level of access rights. That is why Mr. Justice Quirke recommended it: in a situation in which people have gone through great trauma which cannot be undone, no matter what is provided, surely the very least that could have been done was to give them what they need and what they believe is appropriate for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> In this discussion, there has been an implication that the services that are not offered under the version of an enhanced medical card included in the Bill consist of alternative therapies such as angel healing. This is to try to diminish what has been left out. However, legally speaking, the difference between what is being offered and what was recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke, which I believe would be appropriate, is very significant. These are services that the women need in order to be able to deal with all the problems they face as a result - let us not forget - of actions by this State and by the church supported by the State. They include private GP services, a list of prescribed drugs and a range of complementary therapies. As Deputy Coppinger said earlier, they are services such as massage, reflexology, acupuncture, counselling and dental care. It includes a list of services that the women need. The Government can say "Don't worry; we will take care of that," but it will be in the hands of the HSE. It must be given a legislative basis through amendments to this Bill to ensure that these services are prescribed in law - that they have a right to them. It is not just a moral obligation. There is arguably an international human rights legal obligation under the UN Convention against Torture, which requires that people who have been tortured have a right to redress and benefit from as full a rehabilitation as possible. That means being able to access all the services they believe are necessary. If the Government is not willing to give a legislative basis to this and ensure that this minimal recommendation in the report is carried out, it is a new shame on the nation. What indication would that give to everybody who has gone through these circumstances, and society as a whole, if the Taoiseach's promises are broken by not implementing those minimal recommendations?</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> The point raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett about direct provision centres is a fair one in terms of the similarities that exist and the fact that there is ongoing national shame, and the message sent on this issue is also sent on others, including those in direct provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> I hope the Government will feel the pressure on this issue and will be open to agreeing an appropriate amendment to include the first recommendation of the Quirke report.</p>

          <p eId="para_575">On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who is unavoidably committed to ministerial obligations in Riga, I thank the Deputies for their comments on the Bill. I remind the House of the commitment given by the Taoiseach to the Magdalen women in this House in February 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">On that day the Taoiseach apologised on behalf of the State, the Government and our citizens to all those women for the hurt that was done to them and for any stigma they suffered as a result of the time they spent in Magdalen laundries. The Taoiseach informed this House that the Government had agreed to appoint Mr. Justice Quirke to make recommendations as to the criteria that should be applied in assessing the help that the Government can provide in the areas of payments and other supports, including medical cards, psychological and counselling services and other welfare needs. The purpose of this Bill is to implement the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke in regard to the medical card and health service provisions for these women.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> If Deputies compare the wording of the Bill and the wording of Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendations, they will find that this Bill provides fully and comprehensively for the health services recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke. These include general practitioner, medical and surgical services; drugs, medicines and surgical appliances; nursing services; home help services; dental, ophthalmic and aural services; counselling services; chiropody services; and physiotherapy services. As was stated yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, some NGOs have issued quite incorrect statements that the Bill does not provide for these services. As she stated, the only service not included in the Bill relates to alternative therapies with no proven medical benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> The Bill also provides these women with exemption from charges for acute inpatient services, as recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke. Furthermore, the Bill provides that payments made to these women arising from the scheme of <i>ex gratia</i> payments will not be included in any financial assessment of means under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. Again, this is fully in accordance with the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> A number of issues were raised. The first refers to top-up pension-type payments. Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendation on that is being fully implemented. He did not, as has been suggested, recommend that these payments be backdated to the women's 65th birthday. This recommendation proposes that eligible women should, in addition and without regard to lump sum payments, receive weekly payments of €100 if aged under 66 years and the equivalent of the State contributory pension, €230.30, that is, if aged over 66 years for the remainder of their lives. These payments are to be calculated net of other State benefits. The Department of Social Protection has set up a separate scheme to facilitate the recommendation with regard to the top-up pension-type payments. It is continuing to process payments on a phased basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> The Government decided that the commencement date for the scheme was 1 August 2013. Therefore, regardless of when an applicant makes an application, if eligible for the scheme, she will have appropriate payments backdated to 1 August 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> A question was asked about women who do not have capacity to act on their own behalf. They are already covered by section 21 of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act 2009, which deals with the appointment of a care representative. Mr. Justice Quirke recommended provision for a mechanism whereby a person can be appointed to act in the best interests of a woman who lacks capacity and who receives an <i>ex gratia</i> payment under the scheme. This is being done through the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill currently awaiting Committee Stage in the Dáil. This Government is fully implementing the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke and there should be no question or doubt about that fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> I agree with some of the sentiments expressed across the House about the nature of Irish society in the past and, as I described, our love affair with institutionalising people in mental institutions, mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries or industrial schools. The Department of Justice and Equality and the Reception and Integration Agency do not like the comparison with direct provision centres, but in many respects it is apt. We should not live in a country with high walls where people wonder what goes on behind them, and continue that type of institutionalisation in this country. While we will do what we will do, in terms of implementing the recommendations in the report of Mr. Justice Quirke, we have to learn lessons from what happened in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> Direct provision has been mentioned as a comparison, but it is the value system that we have that underpins our democracy, Republic and legislation that has to teach all of us in the House and Irish society the lessons of the Magdalen laundries. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_587">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> The Bill before the House today was debated in the Seanad last week. That debate was very constructive and there was cross-party support and acknowledgement that the Government was bringing forward this Bill solely for the purpose of facilitating the work of the banking inquiry. In that respect, Deputies will have seen the very positive statement from the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis last Thursday. He welcomed the tabling of the Bill which he said would enable the committee to have access to certain confidential banking information held by the Central Bank of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> The Chairman of the committee also emphasised that the purpose of the Bill was not to compel the Central Bank to co-operate with the inquiry but rather to remove a statutory prohibition in order that the Central Bank, which is willing to disclose information, is not statutorily barred from doing so. In fact, the Chairman of the joint committee went on to acknowledge the highly co-operative and constructive engagement the committee had to date with the Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> The Bill has two distinct provisions. First, it amends section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942 to allow the Central Bank to disclose confidential information to the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis under certain circumstances. The information will be disclosed on condition that it remains confidential. As things stand, Central Bank officials are subject to professional secrecy requirements and could face criminal sanctions for sharing confidential information in this way. Second, the Bill provides for the Houses of the Oireachtas to make Standing Orders setting out the sanctions to apply to Members of the Houses for any failure to comply with these professional secrecy requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> On 14 May 2014, a joint committee of inquiry into the banking crisis, chaired by Deputy Ciarán Lynch, was established by orders of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The committee was tasked with the development of a relevant proposal for an inquiry into certain aspects of the banking crisis. The purpose of the inquiry is to seek to establish the reasons Ireland experienced a systemic banking crisis. On 26 September 2014, the committee submitted its relevant proposal to the Committees on Procedure and Privileges of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann for the conduct of an inquiry in accordance with the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013 into certain aspects of Ireland's banking crisis. On 26 November 2014, the committee was formally empowered to conduct an inquiry under Part 2 of the 2013 Act. The scope of the inquiry as outlined in its terms of reference is broad and enabling. It is broken down into two phases, the context phase and the nexus phase. The context phase is for the purpose of information gathering. As Deputies are aware, the joint committee of inquiry has already begun this work. This will inform the nexus phase, which will focus on three broad elements: banking systems and practices; regulatory and supervisory systems and practices; and crisis management systems and policy responses.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> I will refer to the interaction between the Department of Finance and the banking inquiry. The Department of Finance is fully committed to supporting the work of the committee of inquiry into the banking crisis, and this has been stated clearly by the Secretary General to the committee Chairman in a number of letters. The Department is currently in the process of sourcing, examining and formatting the substantial number of records requested by the inquiry. To this effect, a full-time central co-ordination unit has been established in the Department consisting of seven full-time staff. I should add that 11 staff from other areas within the Department have been reassigned to process the records in the format required by the committee. In addition, ten temporary clerical officers have been recruited to assist in the processing of records for the inquiry, which gives a total of 28 staff working full-time exclusively on banking inquiry matters. Furthermore, a significant number of Department staff are actively sourcing and examining records relevant to the inquiry's direction in addition to their normal duties. Moreover, the Department's Secretary General has communicated directly with the banking inquiry Chairman to ensure its direction to the Department is being met effectively. The Department is, therefore, clearly doing everything in its power to assist the banking inquiry in its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> I will now explain the origin of the Bill being debated today. Section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942 contains an express prohibition under the Rome Treaty, the European system of central banks statute and the supervisory EU legal Acts on disclosure of confidential information. This is a long-standing prohibition, dating back to section 16 of the Central Bank Act 1989, which was ultimately replaced by section 33AK. All current and former employees of the Central Bank, including the Governor and members of the Central Bank commission, are affected by this prohibition. In its relevant proposal, the joint committee stated that section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942 would prohibit listed categories of persons within the Central Bank from disclosing certain confidential information. The joint committee felt this provision may therefore prove problematic for the banking inquiry when it seeks this information, which may in many cases be vital to the progression of the inquiry. Having taken legal advice on this point, the committee was of the view that it would be necessary to amend section 33AK to overcome this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> The prohibition on the disclosure of confidential information by the Central Bank is derived from the supervisory EU legal Acts and the statute of the European system of central banks. These EU instruments provide that where the Central Bank acquires confidential information in the course of its functions as a supervisory authority, it has an obligation not to disclose that information unless a gateway is provided under one of the supervisory EU legal Acts. The relevant supervisory EU legal Act in this case is the capital requirements directive and the gateway identified is the one allowing the disclosure of information to parliamentary inquiry committees. However, the obligation on the Central Bank not to disclose confidential information applies to all the Central Bank's duties and not just those imposed by the capital requirements directive. There is no definition of confidential information in the supervisory EU legal Acts, which instead refer to the concept of professional secrecy. It is entirely a matter for the joint committee to make the decision on the types of information which it requires from the Central Bank and for the Central Bank to decide on whether it can comply with the joint committee's request within the legal framework that applies.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> In its relevant proposal, the joint committee further stated that ancillary amendments to the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann would also be required to put in place a process for how the Houses of the Oireachtas deal with confidential information and provide sanctions for Members who disclose such information without authorisation. The reason for Standing Orders to be amended is to accommodate the constitutional position of the privilege of Members of the Oireachtas, which restricts the extent to which criminal sanctions could be applied. In its consideration of the relevant proposal, the Committees on Procedure and Privileges considered that the preparation of the necessary amendments to section 33AK should be expedited by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> As Members are aware, this banking inquiry will inquire into the reasons Ireland experienced a systemic banking crisis. It will consider at the political, economic, social, cultural, financial and behavioural factors and policies which impacted on or contributed to the crisis. In doing so, the joint committee may inquire into the findings and recommendations of previous reports into the crisis. Previous reports include the Honohan report, the Regling and Watson report and the Nyberg report. These reports identified that poor supervision, poor assessment of risks and a lack of follow-through on enforcement all played a part in the financial crisis. Acting on the recommendations contained in these reports, a number of significant reforms have been introduced to build a strengthened regulatory framework. These include the creation of a single fully integrated Central Bank of Ireland with a unitary board, the Central Bank commission; a regime to ensure the fitness and probity of key officeholders within financial service providers; a resolution mechanism to enable the Central Bank to intervene where a credit institution gets into serious difficulty and is in danger of becoming destabilised or otherwise failing; and strengthened powers for the Central Bank to impose and supervise compliance with regulatory requirements and to undertake timely prudential interventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> A comprehensive overhaul of the regulatory framework in the financial sector has also been pursued at EU level since the financial crisis. Through the introduction of various initiatives, the stability and resilience of the financial sector has been strengthened. Ireland has played a key role in driving these reforms at European level, including the single supervisory mechanism and the bank recovery and resolution directive. The wide-ranging and comprehensive reform in the financial services sector at both domestic and EU level in recent years is to be welcomed. We must never return to the failed policies which led to the banking crisis. Lessons must be learned and, in that regard, this banking inquiry is essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> Under the EU treaties, Ireland is required to consult formally with the European Central Bank on any new legislative provisions relating to the Central Bank. The opinion which was received from the president of the ECB was largely positive but the ECB made the point that the scope of section 33AK(6) of the Central Bank Act 1942 should be broadened to comply with Article 37.2 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks. There is a duty of secrecy under the statute and that is why an amendment was brought forward on Committee Stage in the Seanad to broaden the scope of section 33AK(6) to provide for such obligations of professional secrecy. That amendment, which was approved by the Seanad, has the effect of removing any ambiguity over the scope of professional secrecy requirements pertaining to persons who would receive information disclosed by the Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> The banking inquiry will be examining the reasons Ireland experienced a systemic banking crisis which resulted in great upheaval for the Irish economy and the Irish people. Thankfully, we are starting to emerge from those difficult times. The macroeconomic and fiscal outlook is much more favourable than it has been for a number of years, exports are growing and consumer spending and investment are on an upward trajectory and the number of people at work has increased by over 100,000 since the low point. However, the Irish people have sacrificed much and the crisis has impacted heavily on their lives. They are entitled to understand the origins of the crisis and, importantly, the actions that have been taken to ensure the same mistakes do not happen again. That is why there is cross-party support for the banking inquiry and this Bill, which is designed to facilitate the work of the inquiry in getting access to information which otherwise would have been statutorily barred from disclosure.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> I already mentioned the constructive debate in the Seanad and the cross-party support for the Bill. There was widespread consensus on a related matter also - that the costs of the inquiry should be strictly managed and that legal costs should be kept to a minimum. That is something we can all echo in this House. I thank the House for agreeing to take all Stages of this Bill today and I look forward to a constructive debate. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_312">
          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_601">I apologise in advance as I will be unable to wait for the full debate because of a previous commitment. Fianna Fáil will support the Bill, which is necessary for the orderly and speedy completion of the Oireachtas banking inquiry. It is important that the inquiry would have access to as much information as possible for its deliberations, and the risks that certain material pertaining to the Central Bank could have been excluded from the inquiry was identified by the committee itself as a potential significant limit on its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> As the Minister has indicated, the Bill is largely technical in nature and the gateway that opens the limits is strictly in the provision of information for the purposes of the inquiry. My party officials thank officials from the Department of Finance who provided a briefing on the Bill yesterday, which helped clarify a number of implications of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Again, we would like to acknowledge that the impetus for this Bill came from the banking inquiry committee and it is correct that this House would fully endorse the work under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> The debate raises the wider question of the manner in which our Central Bank and the European Central Bank would account for the stewardship of the financial services sector in general. Unlike in other businesses, bank traders have, as we know, inflicted widespread economic damage on our country and on other countries. This explains, if it needs to be explained, why we need robust licensing and regulation. However, robust licensing and regulation have clearly failed and it is time the consequences of, and the reasons for, that are examined here, in the EU and, in particular, in the eurozone.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> While the provision of documentation to the banking inquiry is one issue, more significant is the oral evidence that will be provided by those officials who are still in office or who were in office during the time of this regulation failure. Their oral evidence and their willingness to be challenged on that evidence will provide some of the crucial information we need for this inquiry to get to the source of this. As the Minister of State said, previous reports have indicated that there were serious failures in regulation and supervision. However, it is noteworthy in that context that the 2007 general election was not dominated by calls for more banking regulation. There were no major policy debates or statements about banking regulation during that campaign. The inquiry needs to be in a position to give the unvarnished account of the history of regulation and of why regulation changed so much during the early part of the past decade and why it then failed the citizens of this country so spectacularly.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> It is important also that the committee examines the extent to which the Central Bank used the powers available to it, both soft and hard powers, and why the Central Bank's and the regulator's actions were insufficient to prevent the crisis from developing. We all wish the committee well in its endeavours and we want to ensure this legislation is signed into law as soon as possible in order that the inquiry team can use its provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> Co-operation with the Central Bank is one thing, and the Minister of State laid out the significant investment on the part of his Department in terms of staff and personnel. However, the issue of ECB participation in the inquiry is still unresolved. Its refusal to participate fully and to respect the democratic mandate of this House is an affront to this Parliament and to those of us who serve as representatives of the people. The terms of reference of the banking inquiry specifically provide for an examination of the role of the ECB and, therefore, I cannot understand why we still have not resolved the full extent of its participation or why it does not seem to appreciate its need to be here to answer questions from elected parliamentarians of a national parliament on its dereliction of duty. Its argument is that it is only responsible to the European Parliament. However, in this case and on its watch, significant and horrific damage was caused to the people of this country and it needs to account for its role in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> The notion that former ECB President, Mr. Trichet, would agree to a meeting with a representative group of MEPs is a completely inadequate response. Our MEPs are an important part of the Parliament but we have established an inquiry team and have put significant resources into the banking inquiry, and Mr. Trichet should deal directly with the directly elected members of that inquiry team.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> As a party, we do not agree there is a legal prohibition on Jean-Claude Trichet or on any current or former ECB officials appearing before our banking inquiry. It is imperative that all members of the inquiry have a full opportunity to examine all of the key issues, and that includes direct questions and direct interactions with Mr. Trichet and any officials who were or are still involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> Members of the inquiry can only consider evidence presented to them directly when they come to writing the report. Therefore, information put through third parties or intermediaries, whether MEPs or otherwise, is devalued. Its admissibility as evidence and the ability to test the evidence, which is essential for any inquiry, would also clearly be flawed. The notion that Mr. Trichet or any official of the ECB, including President Draghi, would appear before a representative group of MEPs is basically a smokescreen. The Government should not accept it and should demand that the ECB respond directly to the directly elected Members of the Oireachtas who, in turn, must respond to the people who are suffering the consequences of banking collapse.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> The notion that the efforts of two successive Governments in 2010 and 2011 to impose losses on senior bondholders were rebuffed by the ECB is well accepted. The insistence of the ECB that all bondholders be repaid in full has cost this State many billions of euro. At the end of the original bank guarantee in September 2010, a total of €20 billion of unsecured senior bank bonds came out of guarantee, including almost €5 billion in respect of the former Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society. They were repaid in full because the ECB demanded that and now it wishes to avoid being held responsible for the reasons it inflicted that loss on the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> I welcome the measures in this Bill but this inquiry will not have the strength to get to where it needs to get while there continues to be dodging on the part of the ECB. I ask again that the Government flex its muscles and rather than accept half-participation, which will be flawed and where the evidence would surely be contested, that it stands up for this inquiry into which it has put so much and demand that the ECB appears in Leinster House before people directly elected in this State. If we are to have a good inquiry and if, as we all agree, we are to learn the lessons, then nobody can avoid their responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> I refer to the issue of professional secrecy. Will the Minister of State clarify that there is nothing in that amendment that would block anybody from actually being called before the inquiry and that there is nothing in that clause which would allow former staff of the Central Bank and former ECB people to escape from appearing before the inquiry and that they will be allowed under this Bill to answer for all of their actions as officeholders in any of these institutions? Will he clarify whether there is anything, inadvertently or otherwise, contained within the provisions of the amendment that will be used to avoid answering for specific actions which may, in the view of the inquiry, have contributed to the banking issue? I would appreciate those clarifications.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jonathan O'Brien<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_614">We also welcome the Bill and will facilitate its passage through the House today. We recognise that the Government has introduced the legislation in response to a request from the Chairman of the committee, and has done so pretty quickly. As the Minister of State outlined, it was debated in the Seanad last week and is in this Chamber today. I think all Stages are being taken today, which is important. The Bill will assist the banking inquiry in its efforts to get to the heart of what happened in terms of the guarantee, which is important. It will also help to speed up the process of collecting the information and evidence - a process which is already under pressure due to the delay in establishing the banking inquiry. The Minister of State would probably disagree but should the Government fall in the morning or next week, then the banking inquiry will also collapse, so time is of the essence here and that is why we welcome the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> The Minister of State pointed out that the banking inquiry will examine the reasons Ireland experienced a banking crisis that resulted in great upheaval for the Irish people. That is important because not only will the banking inquiry look at what happened, but it will also ask why it happened. That is important because it is not as straightforward as sometimes the narrative portrays. For a start, we seem to be in a situation where why it happened is assumed and is almost obvious. On the face of it, the question of why the bank guarantee was given appears to be one of liquidity but when one examines it more closely, it is a case of solvency. We all know the consequences of the guarantee. As a result of the guarantee, the Irish people are liable for the losses in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society. The explanation goes that it was a desperate mistake to have made, a fatal blow to the health of the nation, but the apologists would ask what could we do for the decision was taken with no malice intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The situation was compounded by the actions of the European Central Bank which, after September 2008, issued billions of euro to the Irish banking system via the purchase of Irish bank bonds, the creditworthiness of which was underwritten by the State guarantee.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> In November 2010, the ECB, along with other members of the troika, effectively moved into and took over the Department of Finance so as to ensure that no bondholder, including themselves, was left behind. In the words of the apologists, it was all down to a desperate mistake. They tell us there was nothing that could have been done, that that is just the way it was and that we need to move on and get on with it. The narrative, ultimately, is that decent people made desperate decisions in dire circumstances and that there was no other way out of it. In that regard, one of the jobs of the committee is to establish the "why".</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> It is important to stress that the guarantee decision cannot be waved away as a case of political naivety on the part of the previous Government. It is possible to say that with some confidence because of the questions asked to date at the banking inquiry, including those by my own colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, and because of some of the answers given by the witnesses who have appeared before the inquiry. We know that from at least September 2007, with the Northern Rock crisis, the authorities and the Government parties were discussing financial crisis management tactics. That means that for a full year before the bank guarantee was approved by the Cabinet there had been conversations at the highest level within Government about what to do if or when an Irish bank was threatened with illiquidity or insolvency issues. </p>
          <p eId="para_619"> We also know from evidence given by Professor Ed Kane of Boston College that when we talk about a bank being too big to fail, what we are really talking about is a bank too powerful to fail. In his opening statement to the inquiry Professor Kane said that a government's willingness to rescue a certain institution lies in the links between that institution and the political elites. That is important because it goes to the heart of the matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_620"> When we consider what happened in terms of Ireland and the bank guarantee, the one element missing from the official report so far, and the one that has been down-played by the previous Government and this Government, is the links between finance and politics within the State. The other element is property speculation, in particular, commercial property speculation, in terms of the bad loans that made up the bulk of the debt transferred from the banks on to the Irish public via the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA. That is where the "why" becomes relevant once again. Once we start to examine the bank guarantee in the context of the relationships between property, finance and the State, the "why" of the bank guarantee takes on a different colour from that of the asleep at the wheel narrative that is so often put forward by the previous Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> We know from evidence given to the Committee of Public Accounts by Brendan McDonagh of NAMA that 90 borrowers taken on board by the agency had collective debts of €62 billion. In terms of the Anglo Irish Bank loan book, just 20 borrowers accounted for over half of its value, and the value of loans to the top 25 customers of Irish Nationwide represented 51% of that institution's commercial book.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> We know where the power lies within this State. It is within the nexus of finance, property and political influence. It is to the credit of the banking inquiry committee that this nexus is at the core of the operation of the inquiry. For that reason we welcome this Bill and will assist its passage through the House today because the task of the committee is of great public importance. People have a right to know what happened because they continue to suffer as a result of the bank guarantee, with that onerous debt being placed on their shoulders. Not only should we know what happened, but why it happened.</p>

          <p eId="para_624">On the face of it, this Bill is straightforward and it should be supported. I thank the Department of Finance officials for briefing myself and Deputy Donnelly the other day. The Bill appears to be uncontroversial. As I understand it, it is a Bill to ensure that the banking inquiry can gain access to all the information it might wish to access in the context of that inquiry from Central Bank officials who might otherwise be prohibited from giving it out. In the normal course of events, if those officials gave out information to people they should not give it to, they could be subject to criminal sanction but if Deputies disclosed that information and breached the secrecy and confidentiality clause, they would not be subject to certain penalties because of the privilege they enjoy. There should be some penalty regime, therefore, or we should be subject to the Standing Orders of this Dáil regarding sanction. I have not seen the details of those Standing Orders but I understand that, for example, a Deputy could be put out of the Dáil for eight days, which is not the most punitive sanction I could imagine. There are times when I wish I was put out for eight days.</p>

          <p eId="para_626">That will probably not act as a great inhibitor for disclosing information that might otherwise be protected by a confidentiality clause but, critically, it is legally necessary for the banking inquiry to be able to access all the information it might want to access to get to the bottom of the banking crisis in terms of why it happened, who was at fault, the systems failures and so on. For those reasons, one would support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> The only issues worth discussing in the context of this Bill are those that arise from it, which I find interesting, and that occurred to me in the context of the departmental briefing, that is, why are some categories of information within the Central Bank subject to a confidentiality clause and, in some cases, criminal sanction if that information gets out? That is an interesting question against the background of a banking crisis which was caused by a nexus of relationships involving developers, banks, politicians, the Central Bank and regulators both at a national and a European level. All those people had some involvement in the nexus of relationships, or what some of us might call the golden circle or the elite. They decided what happened and they oversaw the banking and policy regimes that produced this catastrophic economic crisis that has had such devastating consequences for millions of our citizens, who are still paying for the mistakes, and possibly the wrongdoing, that produced that crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> That begs the interesting question about transparency and why we need confidentiality when it comes to information that can have such devastating consequences for citizens who will never be able to access that information but who are the victims of decisions that were made behind those confidential barriers. One manifestation of all of that is the refusal of representatives of the European Central Bank to come before the banking inquiry. They say they are not allowed to do that and that they are only accountable to certain people. It is because of the European Central Bank that we are subject to certain confidentiality clauses in the first place in terms of information we can access from our own Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">Why is any of this information confidential at all? I appreciate that there might be categories of information held by the Central Bank that should be confidential. For example, I do not see any particular reason the deposits of ordinary deposit holders should be public information that can just be thrown out willy-nilly. I agree that private and personal information on loans that are given to ordinary bank customers of banks for house extensions, cars or holidays should be subject to confidentiality. The customers of the banks should expect such confidentiality. However, the banking inquiry will be looking at some very different categories of loans, including the reckless commercial loans that were given to a relatively small number of big developers. The activities of such people, who were driven by the profit motive, commercial interests and the desire to accumulate personal wealth, bankrupted the country and cost us so dearly. I suggest not only that the banking inquiry should have access to such information, but also that everybody should be able to access it.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> I would like to know a little bit more in this regard. I do not know the extent to which the Minister of State can illuminate these areas for us. What categories of information will be covered by this measure? When I was discussing with the departmental officials the sorts of categories with which there might be problems, they gave a good example. It might be interesting to know the top ten, top 50 or top 100 big commercial property exposures of the big banks that wrecked the economy and went bad. Frankly, I think we are entitled to know that information. I am not sure whether we are being given such an entitlement, however. Could people be subject to a penalty if they disclose this sort of information in the Dáil? I would like to know about the hundreds of millions in loans that were given out to a golden circle. It is clear that normal prudential lending practices, such as proper risk assessment, were not adhered to. On what basis were these loans given out? Who was giving them out? Did people give loans to massive developers over and over again on a nod and a wink basis because they were mates, were part of the same golf clubs or had the same political connections? The public is entitled to ask for such information. I wonder about the confidentiality and secrecy rules that might prevent information we have every right to know from getting into the public domain.</p>

          <p eId="para_631">Like every speaker, I share the desire for the banking inquiry to go wherever it feels the need to go and the appetite for frank answers to an unlimited number of questions. Just as we have been told it does, this Bill addresses the problem encountered by the banking inquiry when it has hit a brick wall while seeking certain information. I think the Bill should be supported in that sense. If the banking inquiry were to hit a brick wall when looking for information that is vital to its conclusions, then the doors that need to be opened to allow the inquiry to access such information would have to be opened. I was very suspicious when I found that some sort of conspiracy will ensure this information will go no further than the banking inquiry. The people who will be allowed to access this information will not be able to share it with us or with the general public. They will have to keep it to themselves. We need to consider how that will affect their ultimate conclusions. How can we reassure the public that the banking inquiry has credibility - there are many question marks in this regard at the moment - and is coming to conclusions which are equally credible if we do not know the basis on which these conclusions have been reached? Perhaps the Minister of State can enlighten me on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> It seems to me that the banking inquiry is going to ask some very pertinent questions - we do not yet know who will be asked those questions - and is going to get answers to those questions behind closed doors before reaching conclusions as a result of those questions. I presume they will share those conclusions, but I know they will not share the evidence with us. If we do not see the evidence on which those conclusions are based, they will have absolutely no credibility whatsoever. I cannot say I would trust anybody - I do not mean this in a disrespectful way - to reach conclusions of such import as this inquiry is going to reach if they are not going to show me the evidence on which those conclusions are based. The idea that the banking inquiry will somehow operate in an important way in secret means that some of the pillars of credibility it has been given by some of its activities and some of its proponents will be removed. While I accept the introduction of this legislation in order to let the information out into the public, I thought we would all be able to share it. I think the idea that we are going to compromise the Deputies involved by asking them to keep this information a secret discredits it as well. I may well be wrong - only time will tell - but it makes it look like there is some sort of conspiracy to protect certain people from information coming out about them.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> I echo what Deputy Boyd Barrett had to say. I do not think there is any reason to allow information about the current or deposit account activities of small depositors to be released. I cannot see where there would be any need for that. I doubt if that is the information the committee will be looking for. I may be wrong, but it seems to me that the information it will be looking for will relate to the big players in this crisis, from which we have suffered for so many years.</p>

          <p eId="para_637">The public is entitled to know what the bankers, developers and other big players were up to in that period. It is material. If the information being sought from the Central Bank in particular is not revealed, it will look like those people are being protected under the 1942 Act for some reason. An additional question arises in this context. Is it really correct that politicians should be carrying out this inquiry? Given that politicians are answerable to the public, should they be compromised by being asked to keep secrets? Our job and the job of those who are part of the banking inquiry is to expose what happened to the public in the most open possible way. If politicians are asked to be part of that conspiracy, that will do a disfavour to the body politic as well. I suppose everybody in this House knows that politicians are not the most discreet with confidential information.</p>

          <p eId="para_642">The imposition of fines, penalties or absences from the House for that is irrelevant and absurd. The information that we are trying or pretending to try to keep confidential is undoubtedly going to leak out to the press sooner or later. I will give a recent example. We were all told that a highly sensitive document that had come to the Committee of Public Accounts, of which the Minister of State and I were both members at one time, should not appear anywhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">I am referring to the Ansbacher case in which people were wrongly named. That document had only been released for approximately 30 minutes before it was all over the media and the Internet and was in the newspapers the next day. Politicians do not keep secrets. To impose a cosmetic penalty on them, which will apparently be the case under this Bill, will not be effective. It is only a fig leaf. It would be better were the information readily available in its raw form instead of in a spun way, as it undoubtedly will be, that would probably affect the inquiry more adversely than were it to be released initially.</p>

          <p eId="para_645">I broadly welcome the Central Bank's common sense and fair approach to the issue of mortgage deposits, particularly those required by first-time buyers, as part of a responsible approach to mortgage lending now and in the future. I have often been asked why the Central Bank was introducing these measures. The result of the new regulations will not only be to increase the resilience of the banking and household sectors to the property market, but also to reduce the risk of bank credit and house price spirals from developing in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> It should be noted that the Central Bank is independent of the Government and the Oireachtas. In recent months, I have had a great deal of contact with my constituents in Dundalk and its surrounding areas, including Ardee, Dunleer and Cooley, regarding the issue of mortgage deposits. First-time buyers were concerned that they might be prevented from getting on the property ladder. They had read reports that, among other stipulations, they would be required to have deposits of 20%. This caused them great stress.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> The Central Bank's announcement that a 10% deposit would apply to first-time buyers was welcome, especially given the fact that most such buyers in County Louth, Dundalk and Ardee in particular, would fall under the proposed €220,000 limit for 10% deposits. I have examined how these proposals would impact first-time buyers purchasing a property valued at €220,000. The new regulations will allow a maximum loan-to-value figure of 90%. In practical terms, this means that a first-time buyer purchasing a property valued at €165,000 would require a deposit of €16,500, with a maximum mortgage of €148,500. For properties valued at more than €220,000, the maximum loan-to-value mortgage will be 90% of the first €220,000 and 80% of the balance. For example, the maximum loan granted to a first-time buyer purchasing a property valued at €250,000 would be €222,000 and the deposit required would be €38,000. These new regulations are equitable and fair and will protect all first-time buyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> Like the rest of the country, we in Dundalk, Ardee and Dunleer were badly affected by the property crash, with house values on average falling by more than 60%. Sadly, some families that purchased at the height of the property bubble, many with 100% mortgages, will be in negative equity for the foreseeable future. We all agree that this situation must never recur. The measures being taken by the Central Bank will go a long way towards ensuring this and will prevent us from returning to the unsustainable lending practices of the Celtic tiger era, when 100% mortgages were regularly given to first-time buyers. In many cases, mortgages of more than 100% were given. Despite the low interest rates of the time, this was never going to be sustainable. Unfortunately, many of our citizens are now paying a heavy price.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> The new measures will bring stability to house prices and prevent a rapid increase. At the height of the bubble, Dundalk saw prices increase unsustainably quickly. For example, a standard three-bedroom semi-detached house would have cost more than €200,000 in 2007 compared with approximately €45,000 in 1997. Had the new controls and regulations been in place ten years ago, Ireland would not have endured the worst economic crash in our history.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Creed<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_650">I welcome the legislation and the opportunity to contribute on it. I thank the Minister of State for his informative remarks. On the face of it, the Bill is straightforward legislation that facilitates the working of the banking inquiry so that it might have access to all information relevant to the banking crisis that engulfed the nation. Fortunately, we are beginning to emerge from that carnage.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> As an aside, while the cost of the banking crisis to the taxpayer was considerable, I am often struck by how we do not have an inquiry into the general state of our economic collapse, for example, the collapse in employment and the cost to the taxpayer and society at large, which was much more significant in financial terms than was the cost of the banking collapse.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> I wish the members of the banking inquiry all the best in their endeavours to get to the bottom of the crisis. They do the public some service in the task they have undertaken. It is onerous not just in terms of the minutes and days spent in committee meetings, but in the preparation, reading and interpretation of what I suspect are often turgid documents that are required.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> In terms of making as much information as possible available to the inquiry, the amendment to section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942 is welcome, but something that is not before the Dáil today is the question of how the House proposes to deal with sanctions on Members with access to that information. It is high time that the House had a debate on parliamentary privilege. It is not an absolute privilege, although it is taken by many to be so. We must be cognisant of third party rights. A Deputy referred to one of the most recent breaches, in which third party rights were disgracefully trespassed upon in the Chamber using information that was laid before a committee alleging that certain people held offshore bank accounts. It transpired that these allegations were bogus in most, if not all, respects.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> Under the current sanctions regime or any strengthening of same that might be countenanced, what is to stop someone involved in the banking inquiry who gets access to sensitive information from repeating it chapter and verse in the Chamber and dressing it up as a great public service? We are building an edifice on an understanding of parliamentary privilege that appears to be based on foundations of sand. I appreciate that, to many people, this is an academic observation. While it is important that this House never be gagged, it is also important to realise that our privilege of free speech is not an absolute one. I suspect it does not need to be legislated for, as that would give a role to the courts in matters that, under the separation of powers principle, are parliamentary in their nature, but the House needs more teeth to deal with Members who abuse privilege.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> Deputies Ross and Boyd Barrett were at a loss as to what information the Central Bank might have that could not be put in the public domain. I am not a banking expert, but I suspect that there is a significant volume of sensitive information that, if it were to be put into the public domain, would not be in the public interest. For example, a critical piece of information at the time would have been on the flight of capital out of banks. Deputy Ross was a cheerleader who eulogised one of the country's leading bankers and espoused the Anglo Irish Bank model as one that the State should have embraced wholeheartedly. At one stage, Deputy Ross advocated one of the principal players in Anglo Irish Bank for promotion, if not to Governor of the Central Bank, then to governor of Bank of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">God help the taxpayers and society at large if Deputy Ross's contributions in those days on the back pages of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> had been acted upon by any government. I know that Deputy Ross would like to present himself today as the Messiah in waiting, with an alliance of others, to save the nation. However, I do not think his track record bears much scrutiny in respect of probity in financial matters or how the State should have proceeded.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> It is abundantly clear that many Members of the House could not hold water in terms of sensitive information and would be in a rush to put it in the public domain. We need to seriously examine privilege in this House and how it is used and abused. In addition, we need to look at how we can have real teeth and sanctions for Members who abuse that and, in so doing, abuse the public interest.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jim Daly<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_658">I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly again on this timely Bill. Society is now moving into a phase in which many questions are arising from the trauma of the past. As people start to get to grips with our past and face the future with more confidence, those questions need to be answered.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> While I welcome the emphasis on the banking inquiry and the good work that will no doubt be done by that committee, a number of issues arise therein and we must look at the bigger picture. Many more questions remain to be asked about the overall impact of decisions and attitudes that evolved and developed during that time. The reality is that while the banks' collapse has been an enormous cost to us, it still represents only about 20% of our national debt. Therefore, around 80% of our national debt - the same debt that has crippled us financially for many years - also has the potential to cripple future generations when it must be paid back in full. I hope we will not lose sight of that by focusing all our energy on the banking inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> I fear that a lot of time, energy, focus and effort will go into the banking inquiry at the expense of some deeper questions that need to be asked. One reason for this is the role the media will play in this regard. They will ensure it is popular to beat up the banks. In the past 24 hours, I heard someone in the media referring to paying back the bondholders €8 billion to €9 billion a year for bank debt. I presume the person was referring to the cost of interest on our borrowings, but 80% of those borrowings have nothing to do with the banks' collapse. </p>
          <p eId="para_661"> We should examine the role and function of all partners and players across society, including in politics and the media, in the run-up to this crash, especially as we see it being replicated today. RTE's "Morning Ireland" radio programme sets the agenda for the day. It always strikes me as peculiar how Leaders' Questions are effectively written by the producer of "Morning Ireland" every day. Parliament meets to discuss what is to be done but instead of being proactive, courageous, visionary and showing leadership, we are all caught up - led by the Opposition - with the questions of the day that appear on newspaper front pages or on "Morning Ireland", which admits to setting the agenda for the day. That is not as helpful as it could be. </p>
          <p eId="para_662"> The relevant committee is conducting the banking inquiry, which is timely, but as a Parliament we need to reassess and evaluate how we can better enhance our future role, while learning from the past and looking to the future. We should also look at the political decisions that were taken at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> In my constituency, a new initiative was set up at Christmas in the village of Leap in County Cork, called Leapland. I was talking to the proprietor recently, who said he had a great run at Christmas time. He had a huge influx of people and a lot of turnover, so he took on part-time staff. Under the previous government we set up our own little Leapland, but instead we took on everybody for a full year, never realising that takings would drop as soon as the Christmas season was over. In that case, the equivalent of Christmas was the silly season of a building bonanza, yet we have been left to carry the cost of that fatally flawed mistake. That has had an impact on 80% of our national debt, which is the gift we will keep on giving to future generations - our children and their children. </p>
          <p eId="para_664"> Perhaps we therefore need to widen the scope somewhat and allow the inquiry to examine not just the banking collapse but also the role of this Parliament's Members - individually and collectively - so that we can learn from the past. We should ask what we are doing to ensure that we do not make the same mistakes again.</p>

          <p eId="para_665">I thank Deputies on all sides for their contributions today. This is a short Bill but we are all agreed that it is an important one. The joint committee of inquiry has identified these amendments as being necessary to enable it to do its work. It is important for all sides of this House to respond to that in a timely manner, as Deputy O'Brien said. When a request is made to enable an all-party inquiry to do its work, the Houses of the Oireachtas must act efficiently to assess that request and help where possible. That is what we are doing today and what the Seanad has already done.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> The Chairman of the joint committee has stated that, once enacted, the legislation will provide access to Central Bank information for the committee's inquiry team. The joint committee will use this information to review and question the causes of the crisis, the crisis itself, and post-crisis actions. This is the first time that such access has been granted. </p>
          <p eId="para_667"> We have had a debate about confidential action, but this Bill is not making anything confidential or changing the status of matters that have been deemed as confidential by the Central Bank. We do not have the ability here to undo an EU legal framework on confidentiality and the Central Bank's structures. We do have the ability, however, to provide gateways enabling the committee to receive information that it otherwise could not access. That is the importance of this Bill. I have faith that the committee, as its Chairman has already outlined, will treat the information with the highest levels of confidentiality. Processes have been put in place, including a risk assessment, by the committee on how best to deal with that information.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> I would like to respond to some of the issues that have arisen during the debate, one of which concerns the ECB. I understand there is still a possibility that the ECB will be able to contribute to the inquiry in some context. I have clearly heard the views of Members on this point. I am informed that the Chairman of the joint committee has written to the Governor of the Central Bank proposing a meeting to discuss the options available.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> The most important element of the banking inquiry is its ability to obtain relevant information and documentation to support the inquiry process. It is quite important that we respect the independence of the inquiry in terms of how it wishes to go about its work. The Chairman has put in train a series of measures, including meeting the Governor of the Central Bank to explore opportunities concerning the participation of the ECB. I wish that process well.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> Deputy Calleary asked if the Bill provided a basis for non-co-operation. It absolutely does not. The Bill opens a gateway and allows for the sharing of confidential information by current and former Central Bank officials. It enables, rather than inhibits, co-operation. The amendments before the House today remove an obstacle which had been identified by the banking inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> I agree with a lot of what Deputy O'Brien said, including the fact that "What next?" is as important a question as "Why?" It will be a matter for the banking inquiry, but I am pleased to note that this is the route being taken. He talked about the link between finance and politics, which is an important point. I contend that we have taken a number of steps in the lifetime of this Government, to date, to try to break that link. They include reforms regarding corporate donations, State board appointments, and the new Lobbying (Registration) Bill. They are all important elements that we either have debated or can debate in this House on breaking that link.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> Deputy Boyd Barrett asked why this information was confidential in the first place. I respectfully suggest that some of the questions Deputy Boyd Barrett asked would be better directed to the banking inquiry. It falls within that inquiry's remit to provide answers concerning the Central Bank and other State agencies' interaction with each other during the crisis and in the lead-up to it. From a factual and legal viewpoint, however, it is important to state that under the EU supervisory Acts the information collected by the Central Bank is subject to confidentiality. We are not in a position to alter that today because this country is bound by an EU legal framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">What we are in a position to do today is put in place these gateways in order to allow the committee access to information. I reiterate what I said during my initial contribution to the effect that the Central Bank is co-operating with the committee, and the latter has acknowledged that fact. The legislation is designed to allow the bank to co-operate further.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> Deputy Ross argued that there is no credibility if everyone cannot see the evidence. Perhaps it is the journalist in him, but that is simply not true. I do not believe people would dismiss the Honohan report as being anything other than a substantive item of work. Professor Honohan and those who compiled other reports made the point that supervisory problems existed. They did not need to say that whether supervisor A expressed concerns about bank B. We can have trust and faith in the process and in the fact that those elected by the people of this country who are serving on this inquiry on our behalf can assess information and present findings from which we in the Oireachtas can learn.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> Deputies Creed and Jim Daly made a very fair point in respect of the broader economic collapse. The banking crisis was a massive factor in the context of the economic difficulties experienced by this country. However, it was not the only factor. Fiscal and economic policies pursued over a sustained period were also to blame. The introduction of a spring statement by the Government will provide the House with another opportunity, in advance of the budget, to examine the current economic circumstances of the country. It will also provide an opportunity for structured debate in respect of spending plans going forward. In that sense, it is welcome. I join the Deputies in wishing the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis well.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> I thank Deputies and the Members of the Seanad for facilitating the speedy consideration of the legislation in both Houses. I again commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_677">There is one issue that I did not have an opportunity to deal with which replying to Second Stage, that of sanctions. It is not the role of the Department of Finance or any other Department to interfere with the operations of this House. In that context, it is the responsibility of both Houses of the Oireachtas to decide their own Standing Orders. However, the Bill places an obligation on the Dáil to pass Standing Orders which provide sanctions for Members who breach the rules with regard to the disclosure of information. The approval of the Standing Orders is obviously separate to the passing of the Bill. As I have outlined, Standing Orders are for the Houses to adopt. The Department of Finance was not involved in the preparation of the Standing Orders, nor would it be appropriate for it to be involved. Under the Constitution, it is entirely a matter for the Houses to decide on the sanctions that would apply and not the legislation. The changes to the Standing Orders were proposed by the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis in its relevant proposal to the Committee on Procedures and Privileges, which recommended that the necessary changes be made to section 33AK of the 1942 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> Deputies inquired as to whether the sanctions in question would prove sufficient. Again, it is a matter for the House to decide its Standing Orders, but there is obviously a legal reality to the effect that Members are protected by privilege. The comments of Deputy Creed and - oddly enough - Deputy Ross on privilege and how it is used were interesting. I say this as a Member of the House rather than as Minister of State at the Department of Finance, but that matter could make for an intriguing debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> I again thank Deputies for their very constructive engagement in respect of the Bill. I hope it will enable the banking inquiry to continue with its work. I am sure we all wish those involved with the inquiry well.</p>

My reason for not being here is that I was obliged to attend a private meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis. I hope the Bill will assist the inquiry in its work by enabling information crucial to its investigations to be provided by the Central Bank. The latter is fundamentally important. Essentially, what we are doing here is enabling documentation and information to be provided, in so far as is possible, by the Central Bank to the joint committee. In that context, we are dealing with restrictions which have their origins in EU law. The Bill is important in the context of the work of the inquiry and I welcome its passage. I look forward to fully participating in the deliberations of the inquiry in the coming weeks and months.</p>

            <p eId="para_686">The Minister, Deputy White, will be aware of the issue I wish to raise. I read his statement concerning his discussions with the oil companies and petrol suppliers. I raise this issue because the wholesale price of oil has, I am thankful to say, been dropping. In the past 13 months it has dropped by almost 40%, but the decrease has not been passed on to the consumer in the retail sector. The Minister has, quite rightly, raised this with the various companies just this week. I thank him for and commend him on it. What is regrettable is that the motorist has lost out substantially because the decrease has not been passed on to him at the pumps. There is almost a cartel operating among the companies. They have managed for a very long period to get away without passing on any proportion of the decrease in the wholesale price of oil. It is the consumer or motorist who is losing out.</p>
            <p eId="para_687"> The Minister mentioned regulation previously. In the absence of any regulator, it is a fact that the oil companies are the main benefactors. They are holding back the decrease and making a lot of money. The motorist is losing out. As regards the petrol and diesel industries, self-regulation is not working. Prices of petrol and diesel vary from place to place. In some parts of this city, the motorist is being absolutely fleeced. There is an onus on us to rein in the oil companies. It is only fair that the decrease be passed on to motorists.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlexWhite" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_341">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Alex White)<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_688">We all want to see the benefits of international oil price reductions translated into cheaper prices for Irish consumers. Our transport sector is almost completely reliant on oil, which is the most prominent heating method for Irish homes. All our oil is currently imported, and this dependency makes Ireland particularly vulnerable to global price volatility. Ensuring a balanced and secure energy mix is therefore one of the priorities set out in the energy Green Paper published by the former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, last May. My Department is currently considering the significant issues emerging from the public consultation that followed the publication of the Green Paper, and I will be publishing a new energy policy framework later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_689"> Brent crude oil prices are currently at a six-year low of approximately $48 a barrel. Irish consumers are benefitting from falling oil prices at the pump. The European Commission's Statistics and Market Observatory, which produces weekly statistics on consumer prices of petroleum products for the EU, shows that the price of petrol in Ireland was €1.25 per litre, including taxes and duties, at the beginning of this week. The price of diesel was €1.19. This is a significant fall by comparison with the price in the same period last year, when petrol was €1.53 per litre and diesel was €1.47.</p>
            <p eId="para_690"> As the Deputy will be aware, having touched on it in his contribution, the Irish oil industry is fully liberalised, with free entry to the market. While it is Government policy to encourage price competition and consumer choice, neither the Commission for Energy Regulation nor I as Minister have any statutory function in setting oil prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_691"> Research previously conducted by the National Consumer Agency indicates that the price paid by consumers at the pump is determined by a number of factors. These include the internationally traded price of crude oil, the consequent price at which the refined product is traded in Europe, tax levels and, importantly, the level of competition in the retail market. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, which was created by a merger of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, has a role in monitoring competition in the oil market to ensure the market is functioning correctly and that consumers are not being disadvantaged. This amalgamated body falls under the remit of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_692"> The Deputy implied that consumers, residents and businesses have a reasonable expectation that when the price of oil decreases internationally, as has been the case, this decrease will find its way through to retail prices. In the past week, I have not been meeting oil companies but energy suppliers, namely, the suppliers of electricity and gas to businesses and homes. I sought to meet them to understand their perspective on this issue. The reasonable expectation of the Deputy and citizens, which I share, is that when the input cost decreases, the retail price paid by consumers, and residents in particular, will also go down. I have had very good conversations with pretty much all the energy suppliers in the residential market in the past week. I was happy to welcome the announcement by a number of those companies of reductions in the prices of gas and electricity. Those reductions, while arguably quite modest, are going in the right direction. I do not have a role in setting oil prices. It is not open to me to intervene in this regard, but I have an interest, as do the Deputy and all others, in ensuring that when the input cost decreases, the price of electricity and gas paid by the consumer goes down also.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamonn Maloney<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_693">I thank the Minister. I am not saying there has been no decrease in the price. What I am arguing, as the Minister has acknowledged, is that there is no correlation between the wholesale price and the retail price that he and I, as consumers, pay for gas and electricity. In commending the Minister on his discussions with energy companies, I note that the companies did not make any serious public statement until they were hauled in by him this week or last week.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">Up until then, they managed to hide the entire matter from consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_695"> In the absence of a regulator one does not expect these energy companies to voluntarily decrease their prices, but two companies with which the Minister held discussions announced within a day of meeting him that they are decreasing their retail prices or considering doing so. I note that in the case of the first one of which I read, the reduction does not kick in until April. That is regrettable. As I stated at the outset, energy prices have been on the decrease for the past 13 months. We are still in winter. I say this because for many families, particularly those with hardship issues, energy is a big cost. It is regrettable that these companies could not follow the example of E.ON in the United Kingdom, which announced an immediate decrease in energy prices. That company is the first to do so in the UK and I hope, for the sake of consumers there, that other energy companies will do likewise. The Minister would probably agree, on the basis that energy companies here have benefitted for almost 13 months, that any decreases they have announced because of his intervention should kick in immediately.</p>

            <p eId="para_696">I emphasise that I as Minister have no role whatever in the setting of prices, the determination of prices, or instructing or otherwise requiring companies to change their prices. We all have our views about the legal framework that has been put in place, but this is a fully liberalised market in which the energy companies to which Deputy Maloney referred are in competition with one another. Often consumers are sceptical when they hear Ministers state that people should shop around, but there is a real benefit to be gained from looking at one's energy consumption and considering a switch from one energy company to another, and consumers have made very real gains. I would encourage consumers to consider switching. In other words, people should put this argument to the test, even if they are sceptical about this notion of switching and the competitive environment. They should put it to the test, because there are real gains to be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_697"> The question I was asked to deal with related to motor fuels and the price at the pump. I do not object to migrating to the other issue, but what I came prepared to talk to the House about was motor fuels. I indicated to the House that there have been substantial reductions in the price of petrol and diesel at the pump. That is factually so. However, we all would like to see the lowest possible prices. I share that view with Deputy Maloney.</p>

            <p eId="para_699">I appreciate the opportunity to raise this important topic. I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, is here to respond.</p>
            <p eId="para_700"> This time last week, the 140 workers at the Bose plant in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, got the devastating news that the manufacturing plant would cease operations in April of this year. Sadly, the method of communication with the workers was desperate. Some of the workers, whom I spoke to over the weekend and on Monday night, had worked in that plant since 1978-79, while others had 20 to 30 years' service, and all of them spoke in glowing terms of the great employer Bose has been. The method of communicating the devastating news to them was through a video link of four minutes and 40 seconds outlining the plans for the new year for Bose Corporation. The final part of the message was that two plants, including the manufacturing plant in Carrickmacross, would close.</p>
            <p eId="para_701"> On several occasions on Thursday evening and Thursday night, as well as subsequently, Councillor P. J. O'Hanlon, who is one of the Fianna Fáil councillors in south Monaghan, spoke to me passionately about the devastation that had just been inflicted on the workforce and the community in Carrickmacross and much further afield. On Friday I listened on local radio, Northern Sound, to some of the long-serving workers outline that Bose was their life. They entered good employment there after leaving school. They improved their skills. They ensured that they are a very skilled workforce. That message of four minutes and 40 seconds was, unfortunately, seen by many of those people as the end of their working careers. On Monday night, at a public meeting organised by SIPTU, many of the workers outlined with great clarity their commitment to Bose over the years, stating that Bose was a very good employer and that over the years they had adopted new practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_702"> Deputy Nash will be aware from his departmental officials and from Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland that the Bose manufacturing facility in Carrickmacross has been a model in implementing the lean manufacturing process. It increased productivity and reduced costs. The workers have done everything right to remain as competitive as possible over the years.</p>
            <p eId="para_703"> The announcement of the transfer of the operations to Malaysia and Mexico was news that came as a shock, out of the blue, to a wide area of south Monaghan and parts of east Cavan as well. Along with my Oireachtas colleagues from Cavan-Monaghan, I had the opportunity, which I appreciated, to meet the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, on Tuesday last. We outlined to him what we had heard from the public representatives in the immediate Carrickmacross area and what we had learned from the workers and their union representatives at the public meeting on Tuesday last. The message that we gave to Deputy Bruton was to engage as vigorously, positively and strongly as possible with the senior management of Bose to see if they would consider reversing this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_704"> We must take into account in our deliberations on this topic that Carrickmacross is the only manufacturing facility of Bose Corporation in the European Union. It has been there for almost four decades. It was established in 1978 and has a proud record of good governance and good practice over the years.</p>
            <p eId="para_705"> I repeat to the Minister of State, Deputy Nash - and I hope he will convey this both in his own work and to Deputy Bruton - that we want the strongest possible interaction from a Government point of view directly with the senior management of Bose. I understand that a senior executive of Bose Corporation is in Ireland today and tomorrow, or some of these days. On behalf of the workforce and the community in Carrickmacross, I ask that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, or whoever else, meet directly with that senior management official and give the strong message that we are anxious for the company to consider reversing its decision. They have a highly skilled and committed workforce in Carrickmacross who produce product of the highest quality, and it is that international corporation's only manufacturing facility in the European Union.</p>

          <speech by="#GeraldNash" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation" eId="spk_346">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Gerald Nash)<recordedTime time="2015-01-29T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_706">I thank Deputy Smith for raising this issue. I am concerned about this closure announcement for Carrickmacross. Not only is it confirming a large number of job losses, but it was totally unexpected, and the manner in which the news was broken to long-serving staff was a poor reflection on the company. The way in which this devastating news was given to Bose staff was uncaring, cold and unacceptable. As a Minister from the Border region, I am taking a close personal interest in the matter and I am acutely aware of the impact this announcement is having on workers, their families and the wider community in Monaghan, Cavan and Louth.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">We must be mindful of the plight of the workers at Bose and their families as they face into an extremely difficult time following the announcement. As Deputy Smith outlined, many of the workers have very long service with the company and have shown considerable flexibility and adaptability on work practices over the years. The staff have been very responsive to the needs of their employer and the business. It is upsetting to learn at very short notice that production is being transferred to Malaysia and Mexico. I understand that another Bose facility in North Carolina is also due to close.</p>
            <p eId="para_708"> An inter-agency group, led by Enterprise Ireland, has now been established to address the job losses at Bose. Its membership includes representatives of all the relevant State players - that is, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Department of Social Protection, SOLAS, the Cavan and Monaghan Education and Training Board, the local enterprise office, LEO, and Monaghan County Council. The group is providing a co-ordinated approach to the needs of the affected staff. In addition, my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has spoken directly with company management in the United States. He expressed the Government's regret at the way in which this announcement was handled, and particularly the lack of notice given to workers and to the enterprise agencies, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland. I understand he also asked the company if it would reconsider its decision or extend the period of notice that has been given to workers. Unfortunately, the company is insistent that the closure will happen. As Deputy Smith also outlined, the Minister is also arranging a meeting with a senior Bose executive who is travelling to Ireland from the USA to discuss the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_709"> I myself have been in contact with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland at the highest levels and have asked them to redouble their efforts to secure new projects for County Monaghan and the broader region, to explore all opportunities to replace the jobs being lost in Carrickmacross and, thereby, to find a replacement industry for the site. We must focus on the skill sets of the employees to pursue new job opportunities for those workers. The IDA has already contacted its network of offices worldwide in an effort to find replacement investment. It is worth remembering that the IDA has been particularly successful in attracting major employers to the north east region in recent years and will seek to build on that success in highlighting the clear advantages of Monaghan, with which I am only too familiar.</p>
            <p eId="para_710"> Enterprise Ireland, whose companies in the region have been very successful in increasing job numbers in recent years, will pursue all possibilities among its client companies to seek to identify a potential replacement for the town. The agency will continue to develop expansion projects by Irish companies in the area, as it has done in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_711"> I reassure Deputy Smith that I and my Department are working closely with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to get certain projects across the line in the Cavan and Monaghan area which will deliver investment and jobs. Everything that can be done will be done in this case. Deputy Smith has my personal assurance of that.</p>

            <p eId="para_712">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, for his reply. I note that he issued a statement very quickly on the matter last Thursday night, and I appreciate that. I am pleased to hear the Minister of State confirm that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is arranging to meet a senior Bose executive who is travelling to Ireland from the USA to discuss the situation. That proposal was put to the public meeting in Carrickmacross last Monday night by Councillor P. J. O’Hanlon. It was endorsed by all of the public representatives present, including Oireachtas Members and other councillors, and by all present. In the meantime, individual members of the workforce have been in contact and no effort is spared to ensure the meeting with the senior manager takes place this week if at all possible. I hope the Minister of State will convey to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, the anxiety I convey to him on behalf of the local community and the workers in Bose that the meeting take place.</p>
            <p eId="para_713"> From what the Minister of State has outlined, I am aware that the company has indicated it is not open to reversing the decision. That is regrettable. We hope the Minister will make some progress in that respect without ever trying to raise expectations. It would be irresponsible for any of us to do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_714"> The Minister of State mentioned the closure of the plant in North Carolina. The timeframe for the closure there is next September, whereas the proposed closure date for the Carrickmacross manufacturing facility is April. The closure of the plant is devastating news but the very short timeframe in which it is proposed to cease operations there is further crippling news.</p>
            <p eId="para_715"> I thank the Minister, Deputy Bruton, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland for meeting Oireachtas Members, including me, last Tuesday. Local authority members for south Monaghan, along with senior council officials, also met with Oireachtas Members in the meantime. They conveyed to us the understandable concerns of the local community. Monaghan County Council is a proactive, progressive council that will do anything within its remit to try to help out in the situation. I am sure the Minister of State is aware of that himself from his geographical location as a neighbouring public representative. We hope every effort will be made by the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and all the relevant officials in the Department and the agencies to try to impart the strong message to Bose that it has had a very successful manufacturing operation in Carrickmacross since 1978 and that it has a very skilled and committed workforce. Currently there are 140 employees, but traditionally, an additional 60 to 80 seasonal employees were also taken on. We are talking about a workforce of 200 in a relatively small town, which is of huge importance.</p>
            <p eId="para_716"> Over the years the workforce in question adopted and adapted to new work practices. The IDA confirmed to us the other day that this was one of the manufacturing facilities that had been in the lead in rolling out a lean manufacturing process, which has reduced costs for companies and increased productivity. Given all that, everything must be done to try to assist the workers who unfortunately received the devastating news this time last week.</p>

            <p eId="para_717">It was devastating news indeed. I am in the happy position of knowing quite a number of Bose workers from my constituency of Louth, especially people in the Ardee and Dundalk areas. They enjoyed their experiences and were very committed to the company. Like me, they were very disappointed at the sudden turn of events. The IDA and Enterprise Ireland are extremely annoyed at the turn of events and the completely unacceptable manner in which the devastating news was imparted to the employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_718"> As I stated, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, will meet Bose executives at the earliest opportunity. He will raise all of the issues Deputy Smith has expressed in the Chamber today on behalf of the people of Carrickmacross and all who are currently employed at Bose. I am very conscious of the difficulties in attracting new industry to regional centres. For that reason, we have initiated the development of new regional strategies to be rolled out this year as part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, which was launched today. I am hopeful that the initiative and its momentum will help to reinvigorate the industrial base of areas of the country that are away from the main urban centres, areas such as Carrickmacross, and other areas across the Border region. As Deputy Smith is aware, the IDA has had considerable success in attracting new industry to County Louth, for example, in recent years. The Carrickmacross area is not too far from Louth. It is just across the border, and the two areas have much in common in terms of the skilled and dedicated workforce and the good infrastructure in the area, with the N2, which is very close to main urban centres in both Northern Ireland and the South.</p>
            <p eId="para_719"> In addition, Enterprise Ireland has made significant strides in job creation among client companies in the indigenous sector, with 8,476 net new jobs being created in 2014. Monaghan has enjoyed some success in that regard also. The numbers employed in Enterprise Ireland’s agency companies in Monaghan have risen from 3,638 in 2009 to 4,170 last year. That is a significant achievement and a major jump in a short period.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">Eighteen thousand more people are at work in the Border region in the past couple of years since the action plan for jobs was initiated in 2012. That is not to say that there are no challenges. The problems experienced in Carrickmacross as a result of this devastating announcement illustrate one of the major challenges we have as a country to ensure balanced regional development right across the country, not just in the major towns and cities but in the Border region and everywhere else. An area like County Monaghan needs investment and can attract investment because of its location and workforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_721"> I thank Deputy Smith for raising this matter and I will communicate his concerns to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, as I know he takes this matter extremely seriously. </p>
