          <from> Ms Brenda McVeigh<recordedTime time="2013-10-02T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_21">I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting to discuss the legislative proposals from the European Commission for a Financial Transactions Tax, which I will call FTT hereafter. I am joined by colleagues from the Department of Finance and from the Revenue Commissioners so we can provide optimal assistance to the committee today.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> At the time of our last meeting with this committee, in May of this year, the first read through of the European Commission’s Proposal for a Council Directive, implementing enhanced co-operation in the area of financial transaction tax, had reached Article 2.1, subparagraph(8)(e). Since then, one further meeting of the working party on tax questions took place under the Irish Presidency of the EU. We had planned to hold a further meeting in June but had to cancel this as a result of industrial action in the Council. While we held the Presidency, we aimed to progress this dossier as transparently and inclusively as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> On 1 July, the EU Presidency passed to Lithuania. Two further working party meetings have been held to date under its Presidency and the first read through of the proposal has now been completed. As members will be aware, we have a voice in those meetings, but ultimately, it is for the 11 participating member states to decide what they want to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> Some of the issues which were raised by both participating and non-participating member states since our previous appearance before the joint committee, but also during the past year, are: whether pension funds should be included within the scope of the tax; use of the issuance and establishment principles as a basis of assessment; collection mechanisms and the role of non-participating member states in collecting the tax; and double taxation. Issues previously raised, such as the potential impact on the trading of sovereign debt in secondary bond markets and how inter-bank lending might be affected by the proposal, especially in the repo market, were reiterated. During the first read-through of the proposal, it became apparent that final agreement has not been reached between the 11 participating member states in respect of the type of tax they would like to introduce. It has been acknowledged that adoption of the proposal by the original target date cannot now be achieved because a new compromise text needs to be drafted, considered and agreed before its adoption. The Commission has, therefore, acknowledged that the January 2014 implementation date will not be achieved and it now proposes implementation by mid-2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Ireland's position is that a financial transactions tax, FTT, would be best applied on a wide international basis to include the major financial centres. If it cannot be introduced on a global basis, it would be better if it were introduced on at least an EU-wide basis to prevent any distortion of activity within the Union. This is in line with the Commission's desire that the tax should be applied on a global basis. Such an approach would avoid the danger of activities gravitating to jurisdictions where taxes are not levied on financial transactions. The FTT that is currently being discussed at EU level is not an EU-wide tax. Some 11 member states are considering adopting an FTT by way of enhanced co-operation but 17 others are not doing so. As a result, our position has not changed. The Minister has also previously indicated Ireland's principled opposition to dealing with tax measures under enhanced co-operation. If Ireland were to participate in the FTT, it would be required to abolish its current tax on financial transactions which takes the form of a stamp duty on transfers of shares in Irish incorporated companies. This is currently charged at 1% of the value of transactions.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> An FTT could impact upon the financial services industry, particularly the IFSC, and lead to some activities moving abroad, especially if it was not introduced on an EU-wide basis. The Irish funds industry is currently performing very well. It has over €2.5 trillion in assets under administration and €1.25 trillion in Irish domiciled funds. This is a significant increase on the figures for 2012. Numbers employed throughout the entire financial services industry have remained stable despite the reduction in staff at Irish banks. The IFSC employs 33,000 people and contributes over €1 billion to the Exchequer annually through corporation tax and employment taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> An FTT could also affect transactions in Irish Government bonds, including in the secondary market, and might also affect the ECB's ability to give effect to its own monetary policy via the repo market. A significant number of countries have also raised this point in respect of their own sovereign debt management. The NTMA has advised that an FTT could cause a potential negative impact and cost for primary issuance-access from reduced secondary market liquidity and potential systemic damage to the bilateral repo market, a key product for borrowing and lending cash between counter-parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> Members of the Economic and Financial Committee Sub-Committee on EU Sovereign Debt Markets recently stated that the introduction of an FTT would have a significantly negative effect on sovereign debt markets and might impair the good functioning of secondary markets for sovereign debt, resulting in reduced liquidity, reduced investor demand and therefore higher financing costs for states. The European Investment Bank, EIB, has also expressed concerns and suggested that serious consideration be given to the general exemption from the scope of an FTT, of all transactions on sovereign bonds, EIB bonds and bonds issued by multilateral development banks. We are also concerned by the fact that the Commission's own projections indicate that an FTT could reduce EU growth and raise the cost incurred by ordinary, non-financial companies in respect of their use of financial products. Both these aspects would be harmful to EU recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> One of the Commission's aims in introducing an FTT was to ensure that the financial sector makes a fair contribution to the cost of the crisis. Ireland is committed to the principle that the banks will contribute to the cost of State support. The banks have been charged for the Government's guarantee of their liabilities and the National Asset Management Agency Act provides for a surcharge on the banks should NAMA result in a loss for the taxpayer. The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 provides for the introduction of such a levy on authorised credit institutions, to be paid into a bank resolution fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Banks operating in Ireland continue to reduce their level of borrowing from the ECB. During August, total utilisation of ECB facilities by banks in Ireland declined marginally in the region of €300 million. This equates to a decline of 1% to approximately €43.3 billion, the lowest level since September 2008. Drawings from the ECB by covered banks declined by approximately €400 million, or 1.2%, during August. The continued decline in ECB borrowings reflects a reduction in the balance sheet funding requirement within the covered banks in recent months. Year on year, borrowing from the ECB is down by approximately €27.3 billion, or 45%, and stood at approximately €33.5 billion at the end of August. The steady decline in reliance on ECB funding reflects the continued strengthening of the banking system and has been achieved through managed deleveraging, deposit gathering and the return of AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB to international funding markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> We are mindful of any destabilising effects the introduction of an FTT would have at this point, especially when there is such uncertainty regarding the potential impacts of such a tax and the form it might take. As we face into budget 2014, we need to place our public finances on a more resilient and sustainable footing. Most importantly, we must continue to roll out focused measures that will support private industry to create the jobs that the economy needs to recover. The Government is wholly committed to securing economic stability, job creation and a more prosperous future for our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> As the EU-IMF programme of financial support is coming to an end, the Government's focus has now firmly turned to exiting from it. The Government intends to achieve a successful and durable exit from our programme and a full and sustainable return to the financial markets. We need stable and liquid markets to be in place for this. Significant work on the return to markets has already been accomplished and is evidenced by the benchmark long-term Irish bond yield, which has fallen by approximately ten percentage points in the past two years. This has allowed the NTMA to re-engage with the debt markets, including in selling this year's new ten-year benchmark bond, the first such sale since our entry into the EU-IMF programme in November 2010. We are opposed to anything which may have a negative impact on those markets. Post-programme we must ensure that Ireland's return to a long-term, sustainable growth path continues and that the recent momentum we have seen in the jobs market will be sustained over the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> The committee may be aware that France and Italy have recently introduced FTTs. The French FTT was introduced in July 2012. Instead of the €1.5 billion yield projected, the tax take has been €700 million. The latter is less than 50% of the expected intake. The Italian FTT was imposed on shares in March 2013 and on derivatives in July 2013. Although there have been reports of a reduction in trading activity since its introduction - as was the case in France - no yield figures are available to date. Legislation to introduce an FTT has been produced in Spain and Portugal. Variations of FTTs are already in place in Belgium, Finland and Greece. The UK has a stamp duty reserve tax, which is similar to our stamp duty on shares, although the tax rate in the UK is 0.5% whereas ours is 1%. Elections recently took place in Germany. The Christian Democratic Party secured over 41% of the vote, while its coalition partners, the Free Democratic Party, secured less than 5% and is no longer in the Bundestag. A coalition government involving the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats, who have publicly stated their support for an FTT, is a possibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> The UK has raised a legal challenge to the decision authorising the enhanced co-operation procedure for the FTT. We understand that the challenge is based on legal advice received by the UK authorities which indicates that the rules governing legal challenges in respect of enhanced co-operation have not yet been definitively tested in the European Court of Justice and that there is a material risk that the court could decide that any challenge lodged against the final directive, when this is agreed, could be rejected as being too late. This is the first time the enhanced co-operation procedure has been used in a matter of major economic significance. The only other precedents in this regard relate to patent and divorce law. The UK, with the support of the Czech Republic, Luxembourg and others, believes that the FTT, as proposed, runs counter to the agreed EU objective of encouraging economic growth, particularly at a time of economic fragility. The UK and its allies also believe that the proposal would have significant negative impacts which will be damaging to economic growth and which will lead to job losses. It would also potentially increase the costs to consumers. For example, the FTT, as proposed, would increase costs to pension funds and, therefore, savers and manufacturing industries. This would damage EU competitiveness in the global marketplace. It would also increase costs to governments in managing sovereign debt, which is a significant issue for many member states. Naturally, we share this concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> The UK legal challenge is based around three issues, the first of which revolves around the impact that the tax would have on non-participating member states. In the UK's view, if the FTT directive were adopted in its current draft form, the tax would infringe upon the rights and competences of non-participating member states and depart from accepted international tax norms. We have considerable sympathy with this. The second issue relates to the UK's specific concerns regarding the proposed deemed establishment rule under which financial institutions in non-participating EU member states would be deemed to be established in the FTT area - and, therefore, liable for the tax - when dealing with counter-parties based in the FTT area. The UK considers that this is likely to breach Article 327 TFEU and would be in conflict with international tax law and customary international law.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">Again, there is a sound basis for this position.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> The tax in the form proposed by the EU Commission could oblige UK tax authorities to collect the FTT under existing EU agreements on mutual assistance. However, the UK believes this raises fundamental concerns, as Article 332 TFEU provides that expenditure resulting from implementation of enhanced co-operation shall be borne by the participating member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> The UK has indicated that it will continue to contribute to Council discussions on the FTT and remains hopeful that these discussions can lead to changes to the design of the tax which address its main concerns and reduce the potential economic damage from the tax. If the negotiations in Council result in a final design which addresses its concerns, it will reconsider the legal challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> On 6 September, the European Council legal services issued an opinion that Article 4(l)(f) of the draft directive is not compatible with Article 327 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, as it infringes on the taxing competencies of non-participating member states and is discriminatory and likely to lead to the distortion of competition and also exceeds the jurisdiction of member states. The article in question provides that a financial institution located in a non-participating member state can be deemed to be established in a participating member state for the purposes of the tax. The Commission has stated it does not agree with the opinion of the Council legal services. The opinion was discussed briefly at the last working party on tax questions meeting in September and the Presidency indicated it would be discussed more fully at a future meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> The Department of Finance has asked the Office of the Attorney General to examine the Council legal services opinion and has asked the Lithuanian Presidency to request the Commission for an outline of its views on the Council opinion. Ireland is not participating in the FTT and will await the advice of the Attorney General regarding the Council opinion. Any issues or concerns expressed in that advice will be raised at the EU Council working party that is charged with discussing the proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> We are now awaiting a compromise text but have not received any indication as to when this will be available. As of today, the next working party meeting has not been scheduled. Although Ireland is not a participating member state, we intend to fully participate in future working party meetings to ensure that our issues and concerns are brought to the attention of the other member states but we can advise the committee that it is clear from our attendance to date, that many of our concerns are shared not only with the non-participating 17 member states but also with the 11 participating states. We will be happy to take any questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">We indicated to the committee the last time that it is impossible to cost it when there are so many unknowns in it. At the moment, they have not even determined the level of tax to be applied. There are indications of 1% and 0.1% on different types of products but there is no decision on the tax itself. There is no decision even on the products and the institutions that are in and out. We see the advantage as being a very plain one. Where there are so many unknowns, it would be foolish, especially when as I said the markets are stabilising and we are re-entering the markets, to do anything that would impact on those markets. Our view is that the 11 should possibly not even go ahead with it as it is. Certainly, at the moment, they are not and it is not being progressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">Quite a bit of analysis has been done by the National Treasury Management Agency. Also, a report was published last year by the Central Bank of Ireland and the ESRI which did an analysis of the FTT, as then designed. There were amendments to the FTT following that. We have had considerable discussions with those two agencies. We have also had discussions with the funds industry and, naturally, with the IFSC, which were quite extensive. We have engaged in bilateral meetings with other member states. There has been a lot of analysis. Certainly, at the working party meetings, there is a lot of cohesion among the non-participating states as to why we should not participate. My view is that many of the 11 are sharing the views we are expressing in regard to specific matters.</p>

On the basis of the various bilateral meetings we have had with other member states and on the basis of our own analysis and the analysis we have had done by the National Treasury Management Agency and the Central Bank of Ireland, etc., we anticipate there would be a loss of jobs and institutions from Ireland.

If that goes, that will have a very fundamental impact. It would possibly soften it a little bit for us but at the moment, it is still there and the Commission is saying it will stay there. In the world of unknowns around the FTT, we would anticipate flight of institutions, flight of jobs and, therefore, lower tax yield for us if the FTT proceeds as it is.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">If one was to look at a map of the world, the Irish Financial Services Centre should not have taken off in Dublin. A global leader in financial services - London - is less than one hour's flight away but we are uniquely different from London and financial services have worked for that reason as well as others. The predominant reason is that this is an English speaking country which is in the eurozone. If the 11 member states go with the FTT, could we not see inward flight to this country by financial houses because they would remain in the eurozone, would stay outside the FTT and would be in a country with a globally spoken language?</p>

          <p eId="para_71">If two countries in the FTT system are communicating with one another and transactions are taking place between a German and a French bank, or perhaps a German bank and its own French set-up, a communication takes places in which the French are drawing down a revenue - the use of that revenue is one matter - and the German institution or the German revenue is drawing down money, which can be used for something else.

The directive is silent on the method of collection, but the intimation is that if it goes through a clearing system, there will be some kind of withholding tax. There is a possibility that if it is paid from one to the other, it will operate on a withholding tax basis, so the bank that is actually inside the FTT may end up paying it twice. In other words, they will deduct it from their payment to the Irish bank. However, there is nothing definite about that.</p>

If every major western country introduced the FTT, then I could accept it, but I must say that the Government approach on this - it is a political matter and not for the witnesses - seems to be very lackadaisical. The British seem to be very concerned about the impact this would have on the City of London. We have a smaller but similar job situation here, but we seem to be standing back and hoping for the best with other countries' court actions or with the Council's legal advice.</p>

          <p eId="para_120">Luxembourg also has a major financial centre and it stayed out of the legal challenge. Luxembourg and the Czech Republic have been very vocal in their support of the United Kingdom. At the time we could not be because we held the Presidency and we agreed to stay neutral on everything, as all member states do in that position. However, there is nothing stopping us challenging the final text. The United Kingdom took the challenge now because it had legal advice, although not everyone would necessarily agree with it. The advice was that if it did not challenge now, it might be precluded from challenging texts later because it was a non-participating member state. I am unsure whether we agree with that position. As far as I am aware and as far as our understanding goes we are always able to challenge it in the final analysis and, in a way, there was no need for us to do so now. Of the 27 member states, the United Kingdom was the only one that took the view that it had to open that challenge now. It is more of a technical challenge as opposed to a challenge on the substantive part of directive.</p>

Perhaps it needs to be examined more carefully. Many jobs are at stake in respect of this issue in this country.

          <p eId="para_127">I welcome Ms McVeigh and her colleagues. I have a couple of points. What is the possibility that this will never come to pass? Given all the deliberations that take place in Europe, the fact that within the 11 countries there does not appear to be agreement, the various legal challenges and the fact that the discussions are still ongoing, what are the chances this may not come to pass? There is a view that this has come about because of the financial sector and it should make a fair contribution to the cost of the crisis. I understood that the bank resolution mechanism at European level was the mechanism under which the banks were supposed to make a contribution to the crisis. Is this measure not already being catered for under the European project to address banks and the resolution mechanism? Will Ms McVeigh deal with that point?</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> I note that France and Italy have gone ahead of the pack. What rates are they charging at the moment for financial transaction taxes? It appears that the empirical evidence or research to which Ms McVeigh referred has not really been carried out in Europe yet. Could Ms McVeigh give an indication of which countries make up the group of 11? I know the headline countries but could she give us a complete list of the 11 which make up the enhanced co-operation countries?</p>

          <p eId="para_129">We will get to the list of 11 presently. Deputy O'Donnell asked about taking a bet on whether it is going forward. I am not overly keen on doing that at this point. I am unsure whether the committee is aware of it, but Commissioner Šemeta stated this morning that as far as he is concerned it will go ahead. He believes that a compromise text is necessary because he acknowledges the legal challenge, although he maintains that the Commission does not agree with it - I am referring to the legal opinion not the legal challenge. He maintains it will go forward. If we listen to Commissioner Šemeta's remarks we have to accept that it will not go forward in its current format. Therefore, it would be difficult to take a bet on what will go forward. We can say definitively that it is not going forward as it is. How or if it will go forward is a different question and that will really depend on the compromise text, which we have not seen yet. I presume at this point it has not been drafted. All member states have a right to see it and to determine whether they are interested in joining. We are assuming it simply has not been produced yet.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">Ms McVeigh's analysis and the Government position are all heading in the same direction - that is, that we should not do it. In my view, this is a mistaken view. It is disappointing that in putting forward this analysis, it is clear that the Department has not considered empirical evidence. No empirical study has been done and the Department has not listened to anyone who thinks it might be a good idea. I put it to Ms McVeigh that the Department's views and the Government's views are totally ill-informed as they are based entirely on a short-term notion of national self-interest which is not even based on any kind of empirical analysis. Given the financial crash suffered by this country as a result of global speculation I ask if the Department has a duty to look at what the costs of speculation were for this economy as a whole and to look at least at the possible merits of a financial transaction tax in order to prevent the catastrophic sort of collapse we have seen in our economy as a result of the activities of the speculators. In Ms McVeigh's view, should the Government and the Department not prejudge this but rather give serious consideration to the arguments on the other side? I suggest they listen to the people putting forward the argument and look at costs. Ms McVeigh talked about costs or potential costs to the State. I will suggest a very obvious cost which she has not even mentioned - that is, the cost to our economy, which is now suffering. This is the significant cost of massive unemployment, a huge debt, an economy crippled. There is a very good argument for saying that this derives precisely from letting these financial vultures, as I call them, off the leash over the past 25 years, with devastating consequences for the global economy. This should be quantified, in my view. There should be an empirical analysis. It might be the case that there could be a short-term cost, but there is a question of long-term cost if this is not done.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> What about the funds that could be raised? For example, Oxfam supports the financial transaction tax because in its view the moneys from the financial transaction tax are vital to financing serious action on climate change. The financial transaction tax is supposed to provide a back-up fund in case of further financial failure. The proponents of the financial transaction tax are saying the moneys raised could be key for financing major public investment to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. I suggest there should be a cost-benefit analysis of one argument as against the other. None of this has been done. We are getting a policy based on nothing. We are getting an opinion based on absolutely nothing. I do not expect Ms McVeigh to agree with me, but if we are going to have a serious debate we need to look at the reason the tax is being proposed, at the pro and con arguments. We need to have empirical analysis of what the effects might be at every level, positive and negative, so that we can have a serious debate. I ask if this is not a reasonable request from a member of the finance committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_164">Yes, it is. There is a fundamental aspect to this discussion. Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to democracy; he argued that one must look at the pros and cons of any proposal, and I agree with him. However, there are 17 countries out of 28 that are saying this directive is not working. I have attended working party meetings and if it was working effectively the 11 countries would have adopted it by now, because the adoption date was September 2013. It is agreed among 28 member states that something in this directive is not working. All we are saying is that it is not working in its current format; we are not saying we will always stay out of the financial transaction tax. We have said we are staying out of this draft of it, as are most of the countries in Europe. We are obviously sharing a viewpoint with most other member states and, I suggest, probably with all states at this point. The view is that there is something wrong with this measure and we should not jump into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> On the point about the moneys that could be raised, equally, one must consider the other side of that argument and the damage this could do to the markets. If it wipes out the repo or repurchase agreement markets we will have problems. Liquidity is gone and we have real problems in that area. We also have problems with our sovereign trading. That is another aspect of this measure. I accept that a simplistic view - I am not suggesting the Deputy's view is such - would be that it is raising all this money. However, the damage it is doing on the other side is what we must take into account. We cannot ignore possibilities for the sake of the big-----</p>

          <p eId="para_166">I agree it must be looked at. However, Ms McVeigh has pretty much admitted that there is no empirical evidence whatsoever for some of the assertions about the possible dangers. I will put one scenario to Ms McVeigh. We have a low corporate tax rate. When a corporation decides whether it will invest here, it does not just look at the financial transaction tax or the corporation tax in isolation; it considers the package and decides whether it would be better off in Ireland than somewhere else. Given that there is a pretty significant gap between effective corporate tax rates in Britain and effective corporate tax rates here, the idea that an extra tax of one tenth of 1% on financial transactions in the IFSC is going to lead to a flood of companies moving out of the IFSC and into London is bordering on the preposterous.</p>

          <p eId="para_167">There is a cascade effect with a repo transaction. It will not be 0.1%; it might be 0.1% times 50, for the number of times that transaction takes place in relation to that product. It is actually 0.1% in the end. That is part of the problem. The European Commission has been asked to consider such issues, but it is not coming back to us with anything. When we go to the Commission with issues of double taxation because we have a stamp duty, we are told that is our problem to fix. This is against the spirit of the treaties. We should not have to fix a problem of double taxation. As I say again to the Deputy, there is nothing to prevent us from eventually coming into the FTT in a reasonable agreed format if that is what we want. At the moment most are staying out of it because of problems such as this.</p>

I would like to hear the views of other types of organisations, so we have a chance of a balanced debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> On the question of how much a financial transaction tax might raise, Ms McVeigh indicated there would be costs and so on. The Central Bank's quarterly bulletin for this year shows there has been a massive increase in investment funds, up to a net worth of €1.1 trillion. Does this not suggest that the potential take from an FTT might well be considerably larger than the ESRI estimate of somewhere between €400 million and €700 million? Ms McVeigh has put forward a sort of qualification even on the ESRI estimate, pointing out that we would have to give some €300 million of those moneys back to the EU budget. Is it not the case, however, that the €300 million would be subtracted from our total contributions to the EU budget and there would, in effect, be a net benefit to the State?</p>

However, taking the €180 million we are getting in stamp duty from, say, €700 million - as I said, that figure might even be larger given the high level of investment funds - we could still be looking at a potential net gain of something in the region of €500 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_179">The point I am trying to make is that Ireland will not be drafting the text of the FTT arrangements. We are not the ones saying this is what it should or should not be. We have a stamp duty in place and are happy to continue with it. In fact, it attracts a higher rate than what is envisaged under the FTT proposals. It is for the Commission to decide on a compromise text on which we can all agree. I come back to the point that there is no agreement among member states at this time, including the 11 which already have an FTT in place, and implementation dates have been missed because there is a general awareness that this does not work on a technical level.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> When the Deputy talks about potential yield, he is doing so in the absence of any agreement on what level of tax will be applied, which transactions it will be applicable to or which institutions will be covered by the tax. The report produced by the ESRI in conjunction with the Confederation of British Industry, CBI, was done on the basis of the first draft of the FTT, but the situation has moved on since then. In fairness, the report itself makes clear that its projections were based on a series of unknowns. The authors sought to estimate potential outcomes and effects as best they could while fully acknowledging that they were operating in the unknown. Ultimately, the Commission will have the final say on the details.</p>

          <p eId="para_184">The Commission has issued a questionnaire to all member states asking them for details of the types of transactions and institutions operating in their jurisdiction and the current situation in regard to taxes and so on. That questionnaire is vast and very complex and, as such, will be difficult to complete and will take time. We have issued it to our authorities asking them to complete it, and the same is being done in all member states. Everybody has acknowledged that it is an extremely complicated document, but it will be done and the information will be compiled by the Commission. The latter should, in my view, have gathered this information at the beginning of the process.</p>

A financial transaction tax or Tobin tax is something everybody instinctively supports and considers a good idea. However, when one examines the potential ramifications in terms of costs to customers, job losses at the IFSC and so on, it becomes a little more complicated. Is the Department's position essentially that Ireland will stay out of a financial transaction tax arrangement so long as the United Kingdom does the same?</p>

          <p eId="para_192">I would like some clarity on what seems to be the evolving opinion or consensus on this issue. The Governor of the Central Bank made a speech some 18 months ago in which he was very critical of the proposal for a financial transaction tax. He placed heavy emphasis in that speech on potential jobs losses and the disproportionate impact on the Irish financial sector. However, when he attended a meeting of this committee more recently - not last week but on the occasion prior to that - and I asked him his current view on an FTT, it seemed his position had softened somewhat. I do not have the transcript of that meeting to hand, but his position certainly seemed to have shifted. Is Ms McVeigh aware of that shift in the Governor's view? Is there regular liaison between the Department and the Central Bank on this issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_197">I cannot comment on that. I sound like a broken record but I have to keep coming back to the fact that in the unknown, it is difficult to quantify any of these issues. We have put forward what we see as issues of concern, our position being that while they remain a concern, we should not do anything to ramp them up. We have been advised that there certainly is potential for job losses. I assume the Government would not do anything - from what we are hearing in the Department, it seems clear the Government will not do anything - which would jeopardise jobs if we do not have to do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_198">I am sure Ms McVeigh understands that we are concerned here with trying to weigh up the rationale for the introduction of a financial transaction tax. We would like to be able to quantify the number of jobs that could potentially be at risk versus the potential gains. Every move one makes in any budgetary situation has pros and cons. It is a question of weighing them up and making a value judgment.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">I agree. However, when one does not know how something will operate in practice or even what type of institution will be impacted, it is very difficult to quantify specific potential effects. All we can say is that there are issues of concern and it is then for the Government to decide whether the concern is sufficient for it to make sense that we opt out. It is useful to consider the situation in countries which have already introduced an FTT. In France, where the tax was introduced last year, the yield seems to be 50% less than envisaged. Instead of an expected intake of €1.5 billion, the actual intake is €700 million, together with a drop in the volume of transactions. As we know, a decrease in the volume of transactions means a decrease in the volume of the work. There are indications that the Italians have also suffered a drop in yield and volume of transactions following the introduction of an FTT in that country earlier this year. One would have to assume the same scenario would play out in Ireland were we to introduce an FTT.</p>

I stand open to correction but I am of the view that the financial transactions tax has its genesis in a particular reaction to the financial meltdown which occurred across Europe and elsewhere and the financial vulnerability that exists in areas such as banking, shadow banking and insurance in respect of trust documentation as distinct from the physical delivery and production of goods and services. This is the voodoo land of intelligent, white collar individuals. Only in the past month, J.P. Morgan has been emerging from a $6 billion loss in London. The city of London may have all the players present but those players continue to be involved in highly unregulated financial transactions.</p>

Are our guests aware that rehypothecation is happening four, five and six times and that the institutions dealing with these financial assets do not have a clue with regard to their liabilities? There are multiples of hundreds of billions involved here. This matter is not discussed and that gives rise to concern. Would it be possible for the Department to take the lead on this and inquire as to what we are trying to do? Is it the case that we are trying to raise revenues across Europe by imposing a tax on financial transactions or are we trying to get a handle on the design and framework of all these markets that are more and less transparent and more and less risky? Are we trying to build up insurance funds? I am of the view that the impetus behind the FTT was to try to develop a mechanism similar to the depository insurance fund which obtains in the United States. The balance sheets of the European banks continue to be unmeasured, weak and vulnerable.</p>

There is no point in ignoring the fact that only the 11 member states involved have a say in what they are finally going to achieve.
