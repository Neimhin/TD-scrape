          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_1">Tá uair na cinniúna buailte linn, an deis a bhí le teacht i gcónaí dá mbeimis sách foighneach.  Tá deis iontach ann anois breith ar an mbreac.  The eurozone countries are struggling to reach agreement prior to the EU summit.  It has been reported that Greek debt bondholders are likely to lose up to 50% of their money and that widespread recapitalisation of European banks will follow.  This will deal with the roadblocks we have consistently faced in terms of burning bank bondholders.  The problem with acting unilaterally was that the sources of money to pay health, education and social welfare services would have dried up immediately.  We now have an opportunity to act on a structured basis across the eurozone.  Has this matter been put on the agenda for the summit and will the Government insist on Ireland having parity in whatever arrangement is put in place for Greece?  Will the Government veto any arrangement which does not provide us with the same treatment as Greece?  The burden should be shared between those who lent money recklessly to the banks of Europe and those who received it.  Where do we stand on this issue?  It is vital that we do not miss this unique opportunity which, as I noted in Irish, is bound to come our way if we are patient enough.</p>

          <p eId="para_3">As Deputy Ó Cuív noted, a meeting of Heads of State and Government will be held next Sunday and various technical and high level official meetings are being held beforehand, including a meeting of eurozone finance Ministers on Friday and a meeting of the EU 27 group of finance Ministers on Saturday.  Considerable work is being done to prepare proposals for consideration at Sunday's meeting.  The President of the European Commission, Mr. Barroso, has stated we must consider a number of issues together to develop a comprehensive plan.  The elements of the so-called five point plan are: a decisive response to the Greek situation; constructing firewalls to prevent contagion; addressing the issue of adequate capital and funding for European banks; pursuing sound economic and fiscal policies; and the framework for economic governance.  In advance of the meeting, it is too early to speak about how the Government will respond to the proposals as they are still being developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">We have said on a number of occasions that Ireland is not Greece and, therefore, different circumstances apply to us.  Consider, for example, the range of measures Greece is required to implement.  The Government has a good track record in this regard.  It succeeded in achieving a significant reduction in the interest rate applying to our loans, even though that had not been agreed to at the first meeting which took place in March.  We have to work to seek a resolution of the difficulties facing the euro, including the issues that have arisen affecting Greece.  The approach the Government will take will be in the best interests of the people.</p>

          <p eId="para_5">I agree that Ireland is not Greece, but it is important to ensure we are not penalised for taking the right steps.  The Labour Party campaigned for a mandate to ensure bondholders would share the burden of the losses incurred in the banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_12">The approach the Government is taking on this issue is aimed at minimising the cost to the taxpayer of bank restructuring and recapitalisation.  We have already included a significant degree of burden sharing with bondholders in respect of what has been done in the case of Irish banks.  The total cost of recapitalising them, arising from the decisions we made in March, was originally estimated at €24 billion but is now in the order of €17 billion, largely as a result of burden sharing.  These decisions have also resulted in increased private sector interest in Irish banks.  All of this is to our advantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">The Government will take the approach that is in the best interests of the people, but when one considers the situation in Greece, one must also bear in mind the measures that country is required to implement.  They are not measures we would want to contemplate here.</p>

          <p eId="para_16">Yesterday, the Taoiseach ducked and dived as he tried to explain away the Government's inaction in respect of the 950 job losses at Aviva.  Following yesterday's briefing, workers at Aviva are still in the dark and fearful for their jobs.  It is not clear whether the redundancies will be voluntary or compulsory.  The Government has done a great deal of talking about jobs but the only action we have seen is the closure of one company after another.  Some 250 jobs at Pocket Kings and 175 jobs at Allied Logistics have been lost in Dublin.  Some 700 jobs are under threat at MBNA in County Leitrim.  Some 139 jobs were cut at Vodafone in Dundalk.  Of course, 575 jobs at TalkTalk in Waterford are gone.  We now have the situation with Aviva in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  We did not get far with the Taoiseach yesterday.</p>

The Minister has met the company's European chief executive officer, Mr. Mayer, and its global chief executive officer, Mr. Moss.  He has remained in regular contact with them throughout the process.  At the direction of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, IDA Ireland has also engaged with the company to explore the potential for additional jobs growth over the coming period.  The Government is engaging with Aviva with a view to minimising the number of job losses and exploring how extra jobs can be created.  The affected workers have and will continue to have the support of the Government and the State agencies.  Deputy McDonald's assertion that the Government is doing nothing about jobs is inaccurate.  There is nothing the Government is doing more about than jobs.</p>

I want to ask the Tánaiste his reaction to the "Pension Shock" programme which was produced and presented by George Lee on Monday night, and which painted a picture of a few people pillaging the pension funds of this country but also now being joined by the Government in that pillaging.  The Taoiseach in response to a question on Tuesday admitted that the enormous amounts being taken out of those funds by the industry could well fund the 0.6% pension levy which the Government has imposed on these members.  The Taoiseach stated: "the administration charges imposed by pension funds can absorb the vast majority of the temporary pension levy".  Why are we not doing it?  Why are we not moving in and saying to the pension fund managers, the industry and the people who are milking this industry, and it is an industry which is——-</p>

          <p eId="para_109">When the Government came into office earlier this year, we inherited a pensions system that was in crisis.  This was reflected in the programme earlier this week.  There is approximately a €10 billion to €15 billion hole in certain private sector defined benefit pension schemes.  We know some of the demographic reasons that this is the case and some of the trends that are in the system.  There is no doubt that the performance of pension funds has been affected by poor investment decisions that were made by pension fund managers who invested very heavily in equities and it has also been affected by pension fund administration charges, to which the Taoiseach referred earlier this week.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, last weekend announced that her Department was initiating a study with the Pensions Board and the Central Bank on the level of pension charges and expenses associated with different forms of private pension arrangements.  She is determined that employers and members of pension schemes should get value for money.  The Government launched that study because of the concerns about the level of charges that are applied to schemes and the lack of transparency around some of those charges.  The study will look at the charges in defined benefit pension arrangements, given some 220,000 people are in such schemes, and also at the charges in defined contribution schemes, given some 260,000 people are in those schemes.  It will also examine retirement annuity contracts and personal retirements savings accounts, and will include a survey of the providers and the consumers of pension services.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">It is important that people in schemes know the charges that are being paid and what they are getting for those charges.  The study will provide comprehensive information on the categories of charges applying across the range of schemes.  We expect that initial results from that study should be available by about December and the results will then inform the decisions that Government will take in respect of the action that will be taken on the pension schemes, including the issue of administration charges.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">I thank the Tánaiste for the reply.  However, we do not need a study to tell us what is going on in that industry.  Our pension fund managers are among the worst performers in the world, they have made about the worst investment decisions in the world and they are among the highest chargers in the world.  As a result, a large number of pension funds are in deficit and people's pensions are very badly affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">I do not have faith in the Government telling me there will be a study by various people who are presumably representative of and involved in the industry.  What we need are decisions.  We do not need to wait for another study or for events to overtake us as they did with the banks.  What we need is for the Government to give us a pledge — I ask the Tánaiste for this now — that it will move immediately to ensure the Irish pensions industry is not an industry which continues to make managers rich and to make pensioners poorer.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">The Deputy may take it that the Government will move to ensure we have a pensions regime in this country that does not make managers rich and pensioners poor.  We want to ensure that consumers get value for every euro they put into their pension schemes.  We cannot tolerate a situation where the pensions industry takes too big a share out of the consumer's pension, especially when the State is providing tax breaks to support pension provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">The Government is determined to get public and private sector pensions on a more sustainable footing.  We want to ensure the money the State spends, including the tax reliefs that are provided for pensions, are more fairly distributed.  The Government will take decisions on this and those decisions will be informed decisions.  That is why the study is being conducted.  It is not being conducted as some kind of academic exercise; it is being conducted to inform well-grounded decisions which Government will make on this matter.  If there are legislative implications arising from those decisions, those legislative implications will be brought before the House.</p>

I understand the troika has had access to it, but Members will be asked to debate the Government's spending proposals for the next four years without having sight of it.  Does the Government intend to publish the spending review, about which it has spoken for so long and which it has put back from month to month?

        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach" eId="spk_179">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Paul Kehoe)</from>
          <p eId="para_191">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important report the Government commissioned some time ago.  As Members are aware, a large number of people are in serious trouble because of mortgage arrears.  The Government cannot help everybody who is in trouble but something will have to be done to help the people who are hard pressed.  I am sure Members opposite and throughout the House are very much aware of the many people who approach us asking for representations to be made to banks, building societies and other lending institutions to see if something can be done to help them with their mortgage arrears.  When one looks at their personal circumstances and the size of mortgage they got in years gone by, it is clear that there was no way it could last.  Some people received 100% mortgages and are now in serious financial trouble with repayments.  The Government is very much aware of what has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">This was a cause of the property bubble, where properties were selling for huge amounts of money and people were put under severe pressure to get on the ladder to own their own homes.  Last week in my constituency some unfinished houses in ghost estates were demolished.  It is very difficult to comprehend some very fine houses being knocked down and people being unable to repay their mortgages.  Many of these were properties that were marketed as dream places to live four or five years ago.  It has left many scars for individuals throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">To prevent further nightmares the Taoiseach has outlined on numerous occasions that the most important thing is that people be allowed to remain in their homes.  The Government is very committed to helping families keep their homes.  I have witnessed some families' personal situations, including people who have lost their jobs.  The most important thing for them is to keep their houses and pay their mortgages.  It is important that they are dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  I am very aware of people expecting that the Government will come to their aid.  Some people who can afford to pay have stopped their mortgage repayments because they believe the Government will come to their aid and relieve them of their financial difficulties.  However, not everybody can be helped — the country cannot afford to help everyone.  It would cost millions of euros to bail everybody out.  The Government is looking at the matter with a view to being in a position to help families to remain in their homes and to doing it in a fair and equitable way.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">The Keane report made many proposals and everyone in the House has been willing to debate them.  There are proposals such as blanket debt forgiveness and mortgage-to-rent.  Whatever the proposal, the Government will consider it.  That is why we gave everybody in the House the opportunity to give their views on what can be done to help people.  I assure Members opposite and hard-pressed mortgage holders, who are unable to meet their repayments, that the Government is willing to tackle this.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">I have referred some of my constituents to different organisations.  I compliment MABS on the trojan work it is carrying out in helping get people with mortgage arrears on the road to recovery.  There is no easy solution to this problem.  At the end of the day it is down to money and as everybody is aware money and financial aid is very scarce for the Government.  It is only possible to spread so far what is available, and helping everybody will be very difficult.  The Government is taking this report seriously and will try to help as many mortgage holders as possible.  There cannot be and I would not be in favour of blanket debt forgiveness; it would be wrong for the Government to go down that road.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcConalogue" eId="spk_180">
          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</from>
          <p eId="para_196">I commend the Government on ensuring the Keane report will be debated in the Dáil and properly addressed.  It is important to gather the views of people on all sides of the House on this key issue — in many ways it is the most important issue for the country now.  We need to ensure that those who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments and may be in negative equity can move on and see light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">We face a stark situation regarding mortgage arrears.  The latest figures published by the Central Bank on 29 August indicated that at the end of June there were 777,000 private residential mortgages valued at €115 billion, which contextualises the total size of mortgages here.  Of these, 55,000 representing 7.2% of the total were in arrears of more than 90 days.  This compares with the 6.3% that were in arrears of more than 90 days at the end of March.  Banks recently increasing their variable interest rates has piled the pressure on many people already struggling to meet their mortgage repayments.  For people who have lost jobs, the increased pressure of repayments is leading to more accounts falling into such levels of arrears.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">The Keane report tries to address the matter in some way, but it does not go far enough and a greater response is needed to address the issue.  Unfortunately it relies too much on the banks to try to address the situation.  It is unfair for customers to have to rely on banks, which unfortunately recklessly lent in many of these instances in the first place.  The customers now have to deal with those and there is insufficient oversight in the proposals from the Keane report to ensure the customer gets a fair crack of the whip.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">Last night my party introduced the Debt Settlement and Mortgage Resolution Office Bill 2011.  I know the Government accepted it, but something like this will be required to offer a fair structure to address the situation.  Under this Bill, it will be possible for people finding themselves in mortgage difficulty to approach the debt settlement and mortgage resolution office and to have their financial situation assessed.  In such a scenario, it will be possible for that office to issue a debt relief order in the case of personal debt, and a mortgage resolution order in the case of mortgage relief.  This is designed in a way that would offer an outcome to the home owner that would allow him or her to continue to live at home while paying the mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">This office will deal with people on a case-by-case basis and that will not be a painless process.  It is important the message goes out that a pain-free blanket debt write down is not something that can be considered.  That said, we must understand people's needs and give relief to those who are in trouble.  The debt settlement and mortgage resolution office could fulfil that task very well.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">There are many people whose properties may have devalued by up to 50%, but who are in a position to pay and who are continuing to do so.  The future for these people is still bleak.  We also have to look at how we deal with them, because they did not buy houses or take on mortgages through greed or through a desire to make money.  They really were unfortunate in their timing and they were just people who wanted to start families and set down roots.  Between 2003 and 2007, they made a decision to take out mortgages and buy property.  They did so at a time when the banks were plugging money to them and at a time when economic commentators were saying that property was steady, would continue to rise in price and that we would see a slowdown rather than a fall.  The political parties were complicit in this as well.  The establishment across the board, from banks to economists to commentators and the political system did not foresee what would happen, although some did.  The scenario in which people made the decision to purchase was one where they were assured that everything would be fine if they went ahead with it.  Many of these people bought houses for around €400,000 and they now find themselves in a situation where these are worth €200,000.  They may be still in jobs and paying the mortgages, but it is crippling them and they see no future in terms of how they can address that.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">Our first priority is ensure we address distressed mortgages and try to give those who are currently unable to pay some assistance that can put them on a viable pathway.  However, as the European and worldwide economic crisis is evolving over time and we try to find new resolutions as we go along, we also have to keep an eye on how we deal with those people who are paying but for whom their mortgages are taking up an unacceptable level of their incomes.  We have to find a mechanism that is not pain free, but releases those people from a future that looks like a financial jail.  They see no light and see themselves continuing to pay massive mortgages with no sign of relief.  It cannot be pain free, but there has to be a solution that is fair to them.  If our economy is to move on, it will need that segment of the population to be dealt with fairly and to be in a position where they can participate in the economy, build a life for themselves and have a financial future similar to those who did not suffer their bad timing.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">I urge the Government to address this matter quickly.  It has been in office for eight or nine months and it is now turning its attention to some of these reports.  It is absolutely critical that all the parties work together, because people need the issue resolved.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Brian Hayes)</from>
          <p eId="para_204">Like every Deputy here, I am acutely aware of the enormous pressures that face our people.  My constituency of Dublin South-West is no different to other constituencies in the profile and mix of housing type.  Those who currently face the twin problems of negative equity and distressed mortgages demand that their Government and this Dáil respond with effective solutions to the nightmare they face.  Our response to this problem will define how an entire generation views politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">The Keane report is a good starting point, but it is only that.  What is now needed, as the Minister for Finance has acknowledged, is a clear plan across the Government to implement those ideas that can work and provide relief for people in this appalling situation.  That is what we will get; an implementation strategy which starts to deliver real solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">We are not bound by this report.  I very much disagree with the report's conclusions on providing support through the tax code for those who bought at the peak of the boom.  Helping people through enhanced mortgage interest tax relief, particularly those caught in negative equity and who are meeting their repayments in full, is both prudent and a sensible use of the taxation code.  This issue is under active consideration and is a matter for the Minister and the Government in their deliberations on framing this year's budget.  At this stage we should rule nothing in or out.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">Let us be absolutely clear about what has happened.  The banks cannot slither away from their responsibility for creating this mess.  They were on steroids during the boom in property prices.  It was the banks that pumped money into the market, introduced 100% and higher mortgages, and introduced 35 and 40-year mortgages.  They cannot now behave like Pontius Pilate, wash their hands and walk away from the situation.  The covered institutions have a particular responsibility in this regard.  They have been provided with the public capital to allow debt write down for people who have unsustainable mortgages.  Their failure to date in providing for this represents more of the same denial that was such a feature of the years leading up to the crash.  The public has done the heavy lifting on behalf of banks.  It is now time for banks to step up to the plate.  They need to get on with the job.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">This debate is crucial, both here in the Chamber and at the various committees that are working on this problem.  The Government does not have all the answers.  I appeal to all Members to work with us in coming to an agreement where that is possible and setting out a common approach to this problem.  I have to stress, however, that these solutions must be both realistic and applicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Like others in this debate, I am especially concerned about that group of young people who bought during the peak of the boom and now find themselves in substantial negative equity.  Many of them were seduced into taking out a mortgage by the aggressive marketing and promotional tactics of the banks.  In many cases the banks failed adequately to stress test the borrowers.  There is now a social and moral imperative on banks to help people who are in difficulty with their mortgages.  Mortgage holders are customers; they are not there to be squeezed for the last drop.  The family, social and economic consequences of not taking action are too high.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The report under consideration today should be taken in conjunction with the strong remarks made by the Governor of the Central Bank and particularly the extensive speech given by the deputy governor, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, in Cork last Friday.  The Governor of the Central Bank has made it clear to the covered institutions that they have been provided with sufficient capital to deal with future losses on their mortgage books.  The Central Bank and the Government are at one.  It is high time the banks got on with the job in hand.  Where mortgages are manifestly unsustainable, it is time that they were written down.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">In his speech in Cork, Mr. Elderfield set out in clear terms the vigorous approach the Central Bank will now be taking in forcing lending institutions to act more decisively and more fairly.  He was especially severe in his criticism of the sharp practice of banks which are raising interest charges on standard variable mortgages in an attempt to compensate for their losses on tracker mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Of course, no single solution will work in all cases.  The residential mortgage sector is multi-layered and complex.  The stresses in the mortgage sector are a consequence of falling prices, falling incomes, rising unemployment and exceptionally low levels of activity in the housing market.  According to the latest Central Bank report, the total number of mortgages is in the order of 777,000.  The total value of these mortgages is just over €115 billion.  We are talking about a large number of mortgages and a large amount of capital.  Within that number there is a wide variety of mortgages in type, size and duration.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Analysts have estimated, for instance, that 25% of the residential mortgage market is buy-to-let mortgages.  Third parties guarantee many mortgages.  This has been particularly the case in mortgages taken out by younger people at the height of the property boom when parents were asked to act as guarantors for their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">The Government's position is clear and we have three priorities: we want to keep people in their homes where that is the clear wish of the mortgage holder; we want to reduce the burden on home owners facing mortgage servicing difficulties; and we want to redress the power balance between lending agencies and mortgage holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Steps have been taken to date but much more needs to be done.  I have been critical of the implementation strategy by the banks when it comes to the modest proposals of the Cooney group, which reported late last year.  It is simply unacceptable that it has taken the banks more than eight months to implement a sensible idea that up to one third of mortgage interest could be set aside for two years for people who find themselves in this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">The Central Bank has published, and is strongly enforcing, a code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  The Central Bank has recently updated that code and has published a useful guide for mortgage holders who are in difficulty or may be about to go into difficulty.  Much more needs to be done in explaining the rights that people have in this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">Earlier this year, a mortgage arrears resolution process was put in place, which outlines the procedures that should be followed by lenders and borrowers.  To date, more than 69,000 mortgages have been restructured.  It is disturbing to note, however, that 30,000 of these restructured mortgages have already gone into arrears.  Quite clearly the banks are not being realistic in their restructuring proposals.  A restructuring proposal should have the capacity to last for a reasonable period of time.  In any restructuring plan, the ability to pay and having a reasonable disposable income are essential ingredients.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">The Keane report outlines a series of measures which will help some mortgage holders who are in difficulty.  These include a mortgage-to-rent scheme, a mortgage leasing scheme, a split mortgage scheme and a trade-down scheme.  The Government is moving rapidly to implement some of these suggestions on a pilot basis.  Other measures, such as debt-for-equity and shared ownership options, may benefit some people and these will also be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">The report also proposes a new independent mortgage advisory agency, which will act as an advocate on behalf of mortgage holders during discussions and negotiations with lenders.  Such an agency would help redress the power imbalance which currently exists between lender and borrower.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Early in the new year the Government will also be bringing forward major reform proposals in the area of personal bankruptcy and insolvency.  This legislation will be of enormous benefit to those who have unsustainable debts, including unsustainable mortgage debt.  In drafting this legislation, careful consideration will need to be given to the danger of providing perverse incentives either to borrowers or lenders.  In the meantime, the prospect of such legislation may be an incentive to lenders to move with more urgency in resolving mortgage arrears.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">The interdepartmental group rightly points out that there are three factors influencing mortgage arrears.  These are affordability, negative equity and future prospects.  Affordability is obviously the key matrix in any discussion of mortgage arrears.  Changes in people's ability to pay their monthly mortgage obligations will be strongly influenced by changes in their employment status, salary and tax levels.  There are people in difficulties now whose future prospects will change for the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">As the Keane report states, determining how incomes, interest costs and house values will change in the future is by no means an exact science.  As the economy stabilises and growth returns once again, job prospects and salary levels will get better.  Improved mortgage affordability will be a consequence of a stronger economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">The other factor which is key to changing the outlook is a fully functioning residential property market.  In 2010, the number of new mortgages was equivalent to the same number given out in 1971.  This is a clear sign that the market is now dysfunctional.  No one wants a return to a boom and bust cycle in residential property.  It is in the clear interest of mortgage holders and the wider economy, however, that we have a property market functioning at sensible levels of activity.  Confidence is critical.  I believe confidence will return when a clear resolution is found to the sovereign debt crisis and the associated banking crisis in Europe.  Confidence will also be boosted when people see that the Government is showing the capacity and determination to deal with the difficult economic situation facing us.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">The Government will also have to look carefully at lenders' capacity or willingness to provide new mortgage finance.  Without adequate levels of mortgage finance, the residential property market will remain severely constrained.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The Keane report is not the last word on residential mortgages.  The Government is open to new ideas from other parties and Deputies, and welcomes suggestions from interested groups outside this House.  In discussions surrounding the budget we will be examining what further actions might be taken.  I want to repeat what I said at the beginning: the Government is fully aware of the scale and depth of the problem with residential mortgages.  Comprehensive data on arrears are now being provided quarterly.  We will work through the issues presented in this debate in a sensible, determined and fair manner.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianStanley" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Deputy Brian Stanley</from>
          <p eId="para_226">I wish to address the statement by a previous speaker concerning the political system and establishment.  The Deputy said that political parties <i>en bloc</i> went along with the reckless lending and said nothing about it.  Any examination of the record, however, will show that on a number of occasions Sinn Féin did raise concerns about reckless lending by banks.  Other parties may not have done so, but my party did raise concerns on many occasions.  However, it did not get much of a hearing thereon, either in the House or the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">The Keane report, as it stands, will do nothing to solve the problem.  It is deeply disappointing to the almost 100,000 families experiencing mortgage arrears and mortgage distress.  It does not provide anything close to a comprehensive solution to the issue of mortgage distress, but that is what we need to solve the crisis.  The main proposal made in the document is that those in mortgage distress should be left at the mercy of the banks and saddled with decades of unsustainable debt which they will probably never be able to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">In recent weeks I met a couple who borrowed €180,000 three years ago from Start Mortgages.  At the time the man was 59 years old and working on a community employment scheme, while the woman was 47 with a health problem.  Their income was €23,000.  The man is now 62 years old, while the woman is 50 with serious health problems.  Their income is approximately €320 per week and they have a debt of €180,000.  I am highlighting this problem to demonstrate the crazy circumstances that obtained.  Somebody from Start Mortgages should be standing before the High Court for granting such a loan.  One could say the couple was foolish to take out the loan, but agents for mortgage companies were showing up on doorsteps with glossy brochures and shiny briefcases enticing people to take out loans.  These are the circumstances we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">People waited to see whether the Government would provide them with the solutions it stated it would provide; however, they have been given nothing but a tokenistic, minimalist response that will not do anything to relieve their mortgage distress, as set out in the report.  It is astonishing that although three reports have been produced in two years, their main conclusions recommend leaving the fixing of the problem to the banks, despite all that has occurred in the country.  The Government parties, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, are clearly happy to pick up where Fianna Fáil left off.  The report has explicitly ruled out a number of Fine Gael and Labour Party commitments in the programme for Government such as increasing the mortgage interest supplement, extending mortgage interest relief and transforming MABS into a personal debt management agency with strong legal powers.  There are no proposals to insulate mortgage holders from ECB interest rate increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">We must have a solution.  We believe there is a better way.  Sinn Féin has long argued for a strengthened distressed mortgage resolution process with a stronger code of conduct for mortgage lenders.  This process must be backed up by an independent distressed mortgage resolution board to ensure decisions taken by lenders represent an appropriate response to the problem of mortgage distress.  Where such a response is found to be wanting, the board should have legal powers to ensure the right solutions and penalise the lenders for failing to act and engage with clients in an appropriate manner.  Mortgage lenders must absorb a significant proportion of the losses to the value of the mortgages, particularly those outlined.  We do not believe the taxpayer should foot the bill for the mortgage crisis, nor do we believe it is necessary for the taxpayer to compensate the banks further for the loss in value of their residential mortgage loan books.  There is sufficient capital in the banks to absorb a significant proportion of these losses.  The taxpayer has dug deep in his or her pocket to ensure this.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">The priority of the Government should be to keep people in their family homes.  I heard the Minister of State say this.  Other priorities should be to provide appropriate alternatives, ensuring debt sustainability and a sharing of the burden fairly, because these would provide the basis for a solution to removing the causes of the mortgage crisis that was both fair and sustainable for borrowers, lenders and the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">I asked the Minister of State to address the issue of loans taken out from local authorities.  I highlighted this issue in the Chamber a number of weeks ago.  I hope the Government will take this issue on board because there is a considerable problem backing up.  This is not just because of repossessions of local authority homes but also because local authority balance sheets will be seriously impaired.  The money is borrowed from the Housing Finance Agency and if the lenders are unable to repay the money to the local authorities, the latter carry the loss on their balance sheets.  As we all know, local authorities are seriously stressed owing to the difficulty associated with the collection of rates.  The current state of the public finances presents another problem.  I cannot overstate the extent of the problem for those caught in the trap I describe.  It is not just a financial problem; it is also affecting people's physical and mental health and relationships.  I am sure all Deputies are hearing this in their clinics.  The problem is having serious repercussions and manifesting itself in a cost to the health service; there is both a human cost and a financial cost.  I appeal to the Government to take this on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Some 25% of the clients of one local authority are in serious arrears.  Some 33% of those who took out shared ownership loans have serious problems.  Their debt is mounting on a monthly basis and there is no way out.  The local authorities are trying to work with householders to keep them in their houses, but this is proving very difficult.  While we all can complain about what is happening, I appeal to the Government to address it.  Shared ownership loans are loans over which the Government and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have direct control.  The rent element of these loans is increasing by 4% year on year, which is compounding the problem.  The Government should first stop these increases and determine whether it can adjust the ratios such that the rental fraction could be increased from 50% to 75%, 80%, or 100%, if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">When a house is repossessed, it is boarded up for months or years on end, with a consequent effect on neighbours.  Oireachtas Members, the Garda and local authority members receive calls about this issue.  A repossessed house loses value and by the time it is sold the local authority has taken a big hit owing to the loss of equity.  This affects it financially.  The family removed from the repossessed house must be given a rent allowance, placed in local authority housing or on the ever growing waiting list therefor.  This is in nobody's interests.  The taxpayer is picking up the bill for rent allowance, which is absolutely ludicrous.  I appeal to the Minister of State to take this massive problem on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The Minister of State made some strong statements, but I appeal to him and the Government to move beyond the Keane report.  He says it is just a start, but it is totally inadequate.  The Government should try to get on top of the overall problem.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaranLynch" eId="spk_183">
          <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_236">I very much welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  Members might recall that in November 2009 the Labour Party tabled a Private Members' motion on increasing mortgage arrears.  We did so because the crisis was developing and every examination of the problem was showing it would get worse.  We warned of an impending crisis and argued for the creation of a mediation service based on a legislative framework.  Having read the debate on the motion in recent days, I note a wait and see approach was adopted which has featured ever since.  The recommendations from the Cooney report, many of which are commendable, were not debated here.  The preliminary findings of the Cooney report were published in July last year on the same day the Dáil went into recess.  It was targeted deliberately so that the report could not be published and debated here.  The finalised reports were published in November last year.  Once again the Fianna Fáil Government refused to let the report be debated in the House.  It is ironic, if not disingenuous, to listen to Fianna Fáil Members who, in recent weeks, have spoken to the urgency of this issue and the need for it to be debated in the Dáil when, on two specific occasions, that party refused to facilitate the House upon the publication of the two stages of the Cooney report.  The number of people who are 180 days in arrears has doubled since the Labour Party brought this motion before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">I have listened to the debates and discussions on the Keane report in recent days.  While there may be some fair criticisms of the Keane report, the main driver of criticism is the issue of blanket debt forgiveness and those who argue in favour of it.  Without a doubt this group is in conflict with the Keane report because the Keane report is clear where it stands on the matter of blanket debt forgiveness: it will not happen and difficulties faced by people in arrears will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  Clearly, there is an agenda which proposes and promotes blanket debt forgiveness.  It is in the interest of those promoting it to undermine the key recommendations and the robustness of the Keane report.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The Keane report is not a finalised response, nor is it an overly prescriptive document and this is as it should be.  The Keane report lays out the structures by which solutions can be arrived at.  In terms of the way the processes are laid out, it allows other parties into the debate to add to and complement what the Keane report has recommended.  People who have argued that MABS, New Beginning and others were not included in the process have the cart before the horse.  The position is now clearer.  Yesterday, several groups appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  Perhaps it is simply the old style of binary politics but there seems to be acceptance that people are prepared to take as untested or unchallenged reports or documents presented before the committee without question.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Those in New Beginning have some interesting things to say.  However, when asked to lay out specifically and in tabled detail the content of their report yesterday, they said they had no wish to get bogged down in detail, despite that they were before the finance committee.  Some estimates of the New Beginning proposal suggest it could cost the Exchequer €75,000 per mortgage because it involves off-loading the debt to the bank and, since the State ultimately owns the banks, the €75,000 will be picked up by the Exchequer if the New Beginning proposal, as some have interpreted it, were to be implemented.  I understand they will bring the tables before the committee and we can test it later on.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The Keane report should be considered in the context of the key principles which underpin it.  The first principle of the Keane report is that people who are making an honest endeavour to meet their financial obligations in stretched situations will not be put out of their homes; they will continue to remain in their homes.  That was a key principle of the Labour Party leading up to the general election, it is a key principle of the programme for Government and it is a key recommendation and outcome of the publication of the Keane report.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">The Keane report makes it clear that the problem is affordability, not negative equity.  This means it is not the size of the debt which matters but one's ability to pay it back.  The Keane report sets this out clearly.  Criticisms of the Keane report from Members and others outside the House must be challenged.  Sometimes these criticisms are rather disingenuous because they relate to a blanket debt forgiveness agenda or it is simply a case of old-style binary politics, that is to say, no matter what the Government proposes, Opposition Members will oppose it.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">We have been criticised for certain issues and I am keen to know where the Opposition stands on these issues.  The Keane report has ruled out the concept of enhanced mortgage interest relief, which would cost at least €120 million per year to implement.  It is not targeted in any strategic way.  The relief would go in a blanket fashion towards those who have taken out mortgages between 2006 and 2008.  Those who can afford to pay their mortgages would receive this relief and those in distressed situations would also get it.  The Opposition may criticise us for not including it as part of the Keane report.  However, where does the Opposition stand on this?  Is the Opposition for enhanced relief or against it?  Those in the Opposition should not criticise the Keane report for not containing such proposals unless they have a position on the matter themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">Another issue relates to the creation of an independent mortgage service.  The report clearly describes why such a service is required.  It is in the report because the examination of MABS revealed the lack of continuity and uniformity of approach throughout the country and that skill levels vary from area to area.  The Keane report proposes to enhance the work MABS is doing and it is proposed that specialised people would work hand-in-hand with MABS agencies throughout the country.  In some situations these people would be located in MABS offices.  This would yield an enhanced MABS service where the relationship between borrower and lender is re-balanced.  It is a clear and honest proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I wish to explore another aspect of mortgage interest relief and I believe the Keane report should examine mortgage interest relief in greater detail.  The relief was set up at the outset to deal with short-term problems.  It was established in an economy in which house prices were increasing and in which people were unemployed on a temporary basis.  This has changed completely.  House prices will continue to drop for at least another 18 months or two years and long-term unemployment is with us.  We must redefine mortgage interest supplement in this context.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Other matters must be considered in the context of the Keane report.  This is not the only action the Government is taking.  There is a series of actions under way around the Keane report.  They include the decision tree which provides five options for people who are being assessed by the personal debt management agency.  There are other issues such as the three-tiered approach whereby there will be a review of the judicial processes, non-judicial debt settlements will be taken into account and debt relief orders will also be required.  Why is this?  It is because existing legislation in this area is antiquated and it was never designed for the dilemmas we face at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">We must create normalisation measures, not only crisis measures.  One of two measures rolled out this week which will lead to normalisation in the sector is the creation of a house price database, which is on Committee Stage in the Dáil at the moment.  This is critical to putting in place clear information with regard to the housing market.  Second, the new lending practices published by the Central Bank this week will change borrowing levels to an appropriate ratio of people's incomes rather than the madness which was facilitated by the previous Administration.  This must be done because Irish society will continue to be a home purchasing society.  We must ensure the measures which were absent for many years are now put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">The key principle of managing the resolution of debt is the issue of long-term affordability to service that debt.  In addition, it is critical that people are assessed on an ongoing basis with regard to their debt difficulties.  This is why the agency is required.  Otherwise, we could create a situation whereby people under stress at the moment may arrive at an unsustainable situation and, because we cannot extract them from these situations, their situation will become worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">It is critical that a number of comprehensive measures are rolled out, which is what the Government is doing.  I ask Deputies, especially those on the Opposition benches, to add their ideas to the template set out in the Keane report and, in so doing, assist the Government in implementing what is a very robust and long overdue proposal.  The report should have come before the House a long time ago but the Government deserves credit for reaching this point within six months of coming to power.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_184">
          <from>Deputy John Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_249">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the subject under discussion.  I will not be excessively critical of the Keane report because any report before the House which makes recommendations on mortgage resolution is to be welcomed.  My only fear is that we may end up with many reports and little action.  It is important, therefore, that action is taken urgently to address the problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">Deputies are aware that tens of thousands of families are experiencing serious difficulties making their mortgage repayments.  In August last, the Central Bank published the latest data on mortgage arrears and repossession.  The figures were stark and showed that 7.2% of private residential mortgage accounts had been in arrears for more than 90 days at the end of June.  Of more than 750,000 private residential mortgage accounts held in the Republic of Ireland and valued at €115 billion, approximately 60,000 had been in arrears for more than 90 days.  The comparative figure in March 2011 was 49,000, which indicates a dramatic increase in the number of people falling into mortgage arrears in a three month period.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Deputies are being contacted weekly in their clinics by people experiencing serious debt and mortgage problems.  Many of the individuals in question have lost their jobs.  Five or six years ago, when they took out mortgages, they were in employment and believed they would be able to continue to meet the requirements of their mortgages.  As a result of the downturn, especially in the construction sector, a large number of individuals with young families have lost their jobs and are no longer in a position to meet their mortgage repayments.  This issue must be addressed as it is causing major social problems, including marriage break-up and suicides.  People are tearing out their hair wondering how they will meet their mortgage repayments.  If a couple with two children are in receipt of social welfare payments, they will clearly not be in a position to meet monthly repayments of €1,000, €1,200 or €1,400.  We must make decisions on what measures we will take to assist people in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">Rent supplement and mortgage interest relief payments are provided by community welfare officers.  The problem is that people are finding it difficult to obtain these supports because they must jump through hoops to prove their inability to pay or demonstrate that they did not increase their mortgage when they should not have done so.  If it is shown that they increased their mortgage when they could not afford to do so, they will not qualify for rent supplement or mortgage interest supplement payments.  This is causing severe problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service is doing tremendous work assisting people in difficulty.  However, it can only provide a certain amount of support and assistance.  It can, for instance, make representations on behalf of its clients to banks and building societies to try to reach some form of repayment arrangement, for instance, interest-only facilities or payment holidays for a period of perhaps six months to allow the person time to find a job or alternative sources of funding.  These arrangements merely postpone the day of reckoning.  In the past month, I have noticed that banks are taking a tougher line with people in mortgage arrears.  While they generally show a reasonable degree of understanding for the first year or 18 months of arrears, they adopt a much tougher approach thereafter.  In some cases, they are demanding the return of properties.  I am aware of families in County Wexford who have returned their homes to the lending institution and moved into rented accommodation.  This does not make sense, particularly if the families in question are now in receipt of rent supplement.  Many families who have accumulated significant arrears prefer to return the property to the lender and enter rented accommodation for which they may only pay €400 or €500 per months.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">Local authorities could assist people by playing an advisory role.  Every local authority has a housing and loan section, all of which are under-utilised at present because councils are not in a position to build or allocate houses.  Local authorities have expertise in housing and loans and should work in conjunction with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service to assist, advise and support families in mortgage arrears.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">While the Keane report makes some good recommendations, it is, to some extent, a holding exercise in the sense that it will not be possible to implement some of the recommendations owing to the inaction of the Government and its slowness in introducing some of the legislation required.  The potential six month delay in introducing bankruptcy legislation, which will not come before the House until the first quarter of 2012, will cause serious problems for the implementation of the report.  The report states, for example, that the reform of the bankruptcy and personal insolvency law is fundamental and notes that the advisory group did not envisage the mortgage problem being resolved without such laws.  It is important, therefore, that the Minister enact the relevant legislation as quickly as possible.  I understand he indicated yesterday that this will not be done until the first or second quarter of 2012.  This will create problems for the implementation of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">This week, the Fianna Fáil Party published a Bill to establish a debt settlement and mortgage resolution office and provide an independent, non-judicial debt settlement system for persons struggling with personal debt and those experiencing difficulties with their mortgages.  The legislation, which was debated in the House on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, is based on the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission report on personal debt and debt enforcement published in December 2010 and the associated draft personal insolvency Bill.  We decided to extend the scope of the insolvency Bill to include the growing problem of mortgage debt.  Under the Fianna Fáil Party Bill, a person struggling to cope with personal debt could apply to the proposed new office for a debt settlement arrangement.  Following a comprehensive assessment of the person's financial affairs, a personal insolvency trustee would make a proposal to the person's creditors.  This is good legislation and while it may not provide all the answers, taken alongside the Keane report and other reports published recently, it could form the basis for a proper resolution to debt problems caused by mortgage arrears.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">We must all recognise that families are experiencing serious problems in this regard and in many cases there is not a hope in hell that they will be able to meet the repayments demanded of them by their bank or building society.  It is incumbent on all parties in the House to offer solutions to the difficulties facing people in order that they are able to rest easy at night in the knowledge that they have made some form of arrangement with their bank or lending institution in an effort to solve their problems.  I ask the Minister to take on board some of the suggestions that came from this side of the House as well as the recommendations in the Fianna Fáil Bill.  It is important that we work together to resolve this difficulty.  It is not one to play politics with but is for working together across the political divide to ensure we solve the problems of people with enormous mortgage debts who are looking to us to come up with solutions.</p>

          <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
          <p eId="para_258">There has been a dramatic rise in the level of mortgage arrears in the past two years and the trend continues.  Some 45,000 households are more than 90 days behind with their mortgage payments and another 56,000 households have already been forced to restructure their loans due to difficulties in making repayments.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">This is the legacy of the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government, which failed to rein in the reckless lending of our banks.  I have visited several Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, offices and have also met representatives from the Free Legal Aid Centres, FLAC, and have listened to many other debt advisers.  I pay tribute to all those people, in particular those working in the Citizens Information Board, MABS and in organisations such as FLAC, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, community law centres such as those in Ballymun and Coolock and organisations like Threshold and Focus Point which have been dealing with this issue.  I include people involved in New Beginning and others in the legal professions who have been closely involved in trying to help and advise people.  I very much welcome the statement published yesterday by a group of those organisations.  This concerned debt settlement rather than debt forgiveness and was very positive.  I hope to meet collectively with organisations interested in this area during the coming weeks to hear their views in greater detail.  I have met many on an individual basis, both formally and informally.  They understand the problem on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">There are many people in difficulty with their mortgages who could never have foreseen the scale of the economic downturn that has left them unemployed or living on reduced income and consequently unable to meet their mortgage repayments.  This is the core of the problem.  Many of these people tell me they were sold financial products that were totally unsuitable for their needs.  There are pensioners, for example, who redeemed debt for their children and are now themselves left with debt.  There are ramifications of this in every facet of society.  All families in the country are affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">There were various measures that kicked the can down the road but muddling along in the hope that things will get better is no longer acceptable.  The socials costs are potentially enormous as families and communities risk disintegrating under the weight of financial pressure and the uncertainty of what the future will bring.  That is why the Government set up the interdepartmental mortgage arrears working group, which is chaired by the accountant, Mr. Declan Keane.  I thank Mr. Keane, and the people who worked with him in committee, for producing a report which marks a further stepping stone on the long path to resolving the Irish mortgage and debt crisis.  Mr. Keane has recognised that the mortgage arrears problem is complex and requires a complex set of solutions.  The groups that came together yesterday produced a very good nine-point summary and acknowledged the complexity of the solutions required.  This is not a one size fits all solution — that would not be possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Mr. Keane's report came up with a range of possible solutions including mortgage-to-rent schemes, trade-down mortgages, split mortgages and sale by agreement, all of which have received considerable attention.  The key recommendation in the report, in my view, is the early introduction of new judicial and non-judicial bankruptcy options.  I agree with Mr. Keane that without effective bankruptcy legislation the mortgage arrears problem will not be solved.  I say that as one who worked as an accountant a long time ago and has some experience in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">The International Monetary Fund has insisted that personal insolvency legislation be introduced in this country by the end of the first quarter of 2012.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, is currently preparing the outline of legislation on personal insolvency as a matter of priority and I thank him for that.  My Department welcomes the proposed introduction of the Minister's personal insolvency Bill.  We see the early reform of personal insolvency legislation as key to resolving the mortgage arrears and personal debt problem.  It is important to understand that the proposed personal insolvency provisions would represent a fundamental departure from existing law, essentially permitting debtors to rid themselves of all liability, including mortgage debt, in a relatively short period, namely, three years.  This would not be painless for the mortgage debtor who may lose his or her home and credit rating but it would be a less harsh option than the traditional position in which the debtor remains bankrupt for 12 years.  Crucially, the existence of the new personal insolvency options would force banks to the negotiating table, allowing both sides to reach a settlement.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Let me be very clear.  The Government plans to drag the banks to the negotiating table by giving the borrower the power, with appropriate advice, to threaten the banks that he or she will declare bankruptcy and walk away from the debt unless the banks play ball.  That is what it comes to.  Once the banks know the borrower can walk away they will be forced to engage with him or her in a meaningful manner.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, also proposes debt resolution arrangements.  I understand there may be some resistance from banks to the idea of including mortgage debt in the negotiation of debt settlement arrangements but I have news for the banks.  They caused what is probably the worst banking crisis on record and have been more than adequately capitalised at enormous expense to Irish taxpayers and citizens, to every man, woman and child in this country.  We intend to force the banks to the table to negotiate with the people to whom they lent so recklessly and without any due regard other than for profit and for bonuses.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The Government is putting these very important tools in the hands of people in mortgage arrears as there is sufficient and significant anecdotal evidence that financial institutions are often slow to respond to contact from debtors, are inflexible and, for the most part, are refusing to contemplate reasonable proposals.  There are also complications with secondary debt.  Many people with mortgage debts have credit union loans, car loans and debt on credit cards and store cards.  I have heard the most amazing stories of people with multiple store cards.  That is what the Celtic tiger period did — it sold debt to people who were vulnerable, not only in terms of houses but in a range of other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I welcome the proposal in the Keane report to establish a new mortgage support and advice function and the suggestion to appoint approximately 100 advisers with financial, accounting and legal expertise to help borrowers in mortgage arrears in discussions and negotiations with their banks.  The idea is that the service will operate on similar lines to MABS, which is funded by my Department.  However, the new service will be funded — properly — by the banks.  The new MABS+ service would advise customers in their dealings with mortgage lenders and help to bring trust in the debt resolution process, as MABS already does with thousands of individuals.  My Department already funds the Citizens Information Board, the parent body to which MABS reports.  I recently appointed Mr. Eugene McErlean, the former group internal auditor of Allied Irish Banks to the Citizens Information Board.  As Deputies may know, Mr. McErlean was scapegoated by AIB when he brought the bank's overcharging to the attention of the AIB board several years ago.  I will look to honest bankers like Mr. McErlean to advise the Citizens Information Board on setting up a system that will enable our citizens to work out deals with the banks that caused so much damage to our society.  He and others like him will be in a strong position to advise the Government on how best to operate a service that will help our citizens and the banks resolve the mortgage debt problem in a fair and reasonable manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">I remind the House that a large portion of the social protection budget is currently being used to deal with the fall-out from the banking crisis.  My Department is spending €77 million on mortgage interest supplement, which in effect is a support that goes to the banks.  It is also spending approximately €18 million on the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and a considerable additional sum on the Citizens Information Board.  The Department spends more than €500 million on rent supplement and, on behalf of some 95,000 people and families, is the largest purchaser of the services of private landlords in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I would much prefer a situation where the banks used some of the billions of euro in capital with which they have already been provided to write off the bad debts borrowers cannot afford to repay rather than having the Government continue to support them through the provision of even more taxpayers' money out of the social protection budget.  I thank all the NGOs — especially the Citizens Information Board and MABS — for offering a helping hand and a lifeline to many distressed individuals and families.  Members may be aware that there are 52 separate MABS companies in operation in areas from west Cork to west Dublin and further afield and they offer a lifeline to people in these very troubled times.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">We can overcome our difficulties if we work together.  Yesterday's submission from the organisations to which I alluded earlier refers to settlement rather than forgiveness.  That is the nub of the issue.  There is no possibility — despite what many of us would wish — that this problem is going to evaporate.  We must work it through, get our families and citizens to the other side, get people back to work and get businesses back on track.  As former US President, Mr. Bill Clinton, stated at the global economic forum a couple of weeks ago, this is critical in the context of getting Ireland back on the road to economic recovery and also of recovering our economic sovereignty.</p>

          <p eId="para_272">When the report of the interdepartmental working group on mortgage arrears was published, people across the board greeted it with a sense of huge disappointment.  The report clearly finds in favour of the banks and puts forward solutions which benefit the lending authorities.  This is hardly surprising, particularly when one considers the membership of the working group, namely, 16 civil servants, five bankers and one accountant.  These individuals came together and supposedly studied the problem.  The solutions at which they arrived only favour the banks and are designed to ensure the latter will recover the vast bulk of the debts they accrued as a result of reckless lending.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">I was amazed to hear the Minister refer to dragging the banks to the table, kicking and screaming, and obliging them to negotiate with people who are in debt.  We own the banks and we can tell them that they must deal with people.  It is not a question of dragging them anywhere.  We have invested €74 billion in them in the past couple of years but the Minister stated that we were going to try to drag them to the table and oblige them to talk to people.  We should not drag them; we should inform them what they have to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Various Members on the Government benches stated that they were seeking proposals in respect of this matter.  The Technical Group tabled a Private Members' motion on this issue in March and signalled that the problem of mortgage arrears would be the single biggest crisis the country would be obliged to face.  I put proposals to the Minister for Finance following the debate on that motion but I still do not know whether he gave them his full consideration.  The proposals to which I refer would not have cost the taxpayer any money but they would have dealt with the level of negative equity that exists.  Following a number of months, I received a letter from the Department of Finance which did not address any of the proposals I had put to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Groups such as New Beginning and others also put forward proposals.  These groups were not even consulted when the interdepartmental working group was drafting its report.  How could it be possible to produce a proper report which seeks to deal with the issues and provide solutions that can be of benefit to everyone when those responsible for its compilation did not even consult widely with the groups which are already working on behalf of people who are in distress and who have mortgage arrears?  It would have been quite easy for the working group to have considered and evaluated the many proposals that have been put forward by various interested individuals and groups and to have accommodated them within the report.  If what I am suggesting had been done, the report would have been much more satisfying in nature and would have been a great deal more relevant to people whose mortgages are in arrears and who were conned during the Celtic tiger years into taking on massive mortgages they could ill afford.  The banks certainly knew that the people to whom I refer could not have afforded to have repaid the mortgages they took out.  As everyone is aware, the banks facilitated people by boosting the figures relating to their incomes and showing various transactions passing through their accounts in order that they might qualify for larger mortgages.  They then provided them with mortgages which they could not afford to repay.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">The report refers to the reform of the bankruptcy laws.  Since the first day on which I entered the Dáil those on the Government side have been referring to the reform of those laws.  We are now informed that it will be spring of next year before legislation in this regard will be forthcoming.  This probably means it will be this time next year before the legislation is enacted and put into operation.  That will be way too late for most of the people who are being pursued by the banks in respect of massive arrears they have run up and who are seeking a way out.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The report also refers to mortgage-to-rent or mortgage leasing arrangements.  Again, these favour the banks and give rise to State involvement.  In addition, they will only be available to those who qualify for the housing list.  A number of months ago, the Government changed the rules in respect of qualification for social housing and stipulated that the incomes of those who qualify cannot exceed €28,000 per year.  How many people who are earning decent wages but who are struggling to meet their mortgage repayments and building up arrears as a result will qualify for placement on the social housing list and avail of the leasing arrangements to which I refer?  I imagine it will probably be very few.  Although it will probably not be fully acceptable to most members of the Technical Group, the report does offer a potential solution.  This involves people applying to their local councils in order for placement on the social housing list.  What will happen when they are informed that they do not qualify and that there are no other options open to them?  They will be left to wait for the bankruptcy legislation to be enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">There is a need to consider the possibility of writing down debt.  We know there is a cost involved.  That cost is estimated in the Keane report as being less than one sixth of what the banks have cost us to date.  There is no moral hazard involved.  The greater moral hazard lies in doing nothing.  This matter requires urgent attention and the sense of urgency attaching to it is only going to become greater.  Unfortunately, the solutions offered in the report will not bring about relief quickly enough.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_189">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_279">I am a member of the Defend Our Homes League which was established in July in response to the crisis people are facing in respect of repossessions and evictions.  The membership of the league comprises, among others, New Beginning, Irish Homeowners Unite and many of the Independent Members.  The league was formed as a result of the fact that everyone was aware a crisis was developing in respect of mortgage arrears and because people are under massive financial pressure.  That pressure includes the cost of trying to get one's children to school, put food on the table, and so on.  These issues were the subject of much discussion on the doorsteps during, and even prior to, the recent general election campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The steering group of the Defend Our Homes League met on Tuesday night last and its members were absolutely appalled by the report.  I use the term "report" but it has actually become a discussion document.  This is similar to what happened when the jobs budget became the jobs initiative.  The Government has not dealt with this matter in a proper way.  The discussion document before the House should never have been published without the people who are affected by the problem of mortgage arrears first being consulted.  MABS and FLAC, which have come out strongly against this discussion document, should also have been consulted.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">The discussion document before the House has been warmly welcomed by the banks.  Indeed, it could have been drafted by them.  It does not call on them to do anything more than they are doing at present.  In many instances, they are not even doing what is required of them.  The so-called recommendations contained in this document are mere guidelines.  The two main issues relating to the matter of mortgage arrears are keeping people in their homes and negative equity.  Neither of these is properly dealt with in the discussion document, which is completely dismissive in the context of negative equity and states that the write-down would be too expensive.  I challenge that opinion and ask in whose interest it is too expensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The first point I made was related to keeping people in their homes.  The report disgracefully accepts that repossessions will happen and that after a bank has taken possession of a person's home, it may be possible for that person to rent the property from it, with the debt remaining as a heavy weight on his or her shoulders.  That is an outrageous idea.  The Government should ensure that if a debtor engages with a lender and is prepared to pay a reasonable amount of net income — this should be decided not by the banks but by an independent agency — there should be no question of a person losing his or her home.  People could make interest-only payments or park the mortgage in order that interest does not accrue while there is a chance to pay down some of the principal.  A person in the Defend Our Homes group has paid up to €100,000 in interest alone on his home because he cannot pay his mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">We have all heard the proposal from New Beginning, which is very sensible.  It proposes that 35% of net income could be used to pay down debt and that in the early years the principal would be paid down, with the interest being parked.  This is a practical proposal.  If a family cannot sustain a mortgage, there should be an option for it to be housed by the local authority, although the debt would have to be written off and the bank would have to buy the property.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">There is a figure from the Department of Finance of €14 billion to reduce mortgages in line with actual value, but this is nothing compared to the cost of NAMA and the bank bailout.  Independent economists question this figure.  If the write-down was restricted to the average family home or apartments and buy-to-let examples and trophy homes were excluded, the figure could be reduced to €7 billion or €8 billion.  Some of this has already been built into the recapitalisation of the banks against potential mortgage default.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I will make a point about bankruptcy and personal insolvency laws which should be introduced before Christmas.  There should be a Government grouping urgently considering this with a view to introducing legislation before Christmas.  There is nothing in the report dealing with sub-prime lenders which do not even need a licence to operate in this country.  They work under no regulation and are here to make a quick buck before they pull out.  Many are facing eviction because these companies just want to sell a house and get money whatever way they can.  They show no concern for families with mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">The debt write-down must form part of the mortgage process.  Society must move on.  However, we cannot kick the can down the road all the time while playing games with people.  This is the biggest issue on doorsteps in the by-election campaign in Dublin West and it is being raised every time.  People find themselves in a position where they want the monkey off their backs and although they want to pay off their mortgages, they cannot do so currently.  I, therefore, urge the Government to reconsider its position.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_287">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute on this issue.  I thank all those within the constituency who contacted me in the past week with their own proposals and suggestions.  I thank them for what were often heart-felt contributions via e-mail, letter or the telephone to outline their predicament and the problems they face on a daily basis.  Rather than it being a daily or weekly problem, this is a daily nightmare for many who are in negative equity and, as the previous speaker mentioned, have a monkey on their backs.  They feel that there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  Therefore, we have an enormous task in that regard.  The Minister for Finance is under no illusions about the enormity of that task, but the objective of the Government must continue to be keeping people in their homes, reducing the burden and redressing the power balance between banks and mortgage holders.  Ultimately, we are representatives of the people and our constituents; although there are rules and guidelines, we must take cognisance of the fact that this is not a question of moral hazard alone but also of morale hazard.  People's long-term expectations only focus on negativity and they are not planning for the future in the way they should be because they do not know what will happen in six months, 12 months or five years time.  We must take this on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I have received different suggestions and submissions in the past week.  There is an underlying theme of responsibility in that people want to face up to the problem.  They want a solution and are not willing to walk away.  There is an argument that some cannot pay, while others are not willing to pay, but that is a red herring.  All the people with whom I have been in contact offered a solution and nobody is proposing a blanket write-off or arguing that he or she is willing to walk away.  They want a solution, which could be as simple as handing back the keys to the bank and moving to rental accommodation.  That suggestion is made because people feel trapped and the banks have been using a form of entrapment, of which we must be conscious.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">I have heard various suggestions regarding next generation mortgages, while certain groups have proposed a 35% of income threshold.  It has also been said people should pay what they can and park certain segments of the mortgage repayments for ten years or longer.  We could consider what happened in Japan and Germany where there are mortgages of up to 100 years.  People are looking for solutions because they face a serious predicament and are in negative equity.  They are aware that at current market values they will never recover the initial purchase price.  We are talking about people who bought their houses for the purpose of making them their homes.  We are not talking about people who speculated and took a risk in buying second and third properties, rather we are talking about people who are living in their primary residence and we owe it to them to find some pathway to help them to get out of their predicament.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">There are aspects of the Keane report that are positive.  However, I would be the first to admit that there are also aspects that are not so positive.  It identifies the causes of the problem — the lack of affordability, negative equity and future prospects.  With prices down 43% since 2007, the lack of affordability is the key problem as people's incomes are also down.  They are not in a position to pay back what they owe and are trying to negotiate with credit card companies.  It is not just a question of mortgage repayments; it seems as if people are trapped by a burden of debt on a day-to-day basis.  They are sacrificing the purchase of proper food in order to meet their mortgage repayments.  These are the decisions and choices they are faced with on a daily basis and on which we need to engage with them.  The banks must do this on a one-to-one basis.  In some instances, they are trying to meet people but come up with a short, medium or long-term plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">One must ask whether in reality we are kicking the problem down the road.  It is possible we are doing this if we do not get to the core of the problem of negative equity.  We must be honest and admit that some people with mortgages know in their heart and soul that they will never be able to pay them back.  That is the reality and what is being said to me.  Many people find themselves in this predicament.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">In its most recent report the Central Bank notes 777,000 mortgages to a value of €115 billion on the books at present.  With all the realignments, readjustments and deleveraging that is going on in terms of the Minister's direct and conscientious role he has undertaken so soon after the recent election, one must ask whether banks have prepared for the rainy day in terms of commercial loans and NAMA properties on their balance sheets.  Where does the private citizen come into the equation?  That is something of which we must be conscious as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">We must look at all the options in terms of writing down debt.  We must consider parking up part of the mortgage for a period and other solutions.  We must give people hope.  At the moment they do not have hope.  Not all people want to throw back the keys and leave this country.  People still want to participate in this country's activities.  They are confident that we are trying to get our house in order from a fiscal and budgetary point of view.  They can see that.  It might seem a contradiction given that we find ourselves in this predicament that there is a lot of positivity as well as negativity.  There is a lot of positivity around what the Government is attempting to do in acknowledging that we have a mess on our hands.  We have a complete and utter disaster in terms of over-expenditure.  Historically, the tradition and mindset has been to throw money at problems.  As well as learning the hard lessons we must look at other countries.  The Canadian Minister for Finance was in this country during the week.  He talked about the Canadian experience and the fact that they always had tight budgetary mechanisms and fiscal control and that is why they did not end up in the same mess in which we and other countries found ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">I reiterate my point about morale hazard.  I accept there is a moral hazard.  That argument is made by people who do not find themselves in this difficulty.  That is a legitimate argument.  However, there is a morale hazard also.  According to John Maynard Keynes's theory of expectations, people base their current expenditure on their long-term expectations.  Currently, long-term expectations are blinkered.  Many people do not believe they are going to get out of the current monkey-on-their-back scenario.  We must be conscious of that.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is open to suggestions from the other side of the House.  He engaged with Opposition Members on the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) Bill and he is willing to engage on this matter.  I am confident we will work towards a solution to this mammoth problem.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_295">I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate on the report of the interdepartmental working group on mortgage arrears.  I welcome the report as an input to the general debate.  It is in no way a definitive report.  It is not intended to be such and it was not set up with that purpose.  It was set up with narrow terms of reference to deal with specific issues.  I never saw such specific terms of reference.  They prescribe the report.  The person who wrote the terms of reference could have saved the 22 public servants from meeting during the summer because he or she knew the outcome that was required and could easily have written the report.  Nevertheless, the report has been published, regardless of who its authors are and it will make a useful input into dealing with mortgage debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">The report ignores personal debt and from that perspective it does not deal with the gamut of the problem that exists.  I cannot envisage anyone who has a major mortgage debt that does not also have a car loan debt, for example, or other loans such as for education or credit cards.  I have yet to meet a person who has all bills up to date including the ESB and telephone and where he or she only has one debt, namely, a mortgage.  From that point of view the report is focused on an imaginary situation that does not exist.  That said, the report contains useful information and the research carried out provides a useful input into the overall position.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">I compliment Mr. Declan Keane, the chairperson of the group, for his work.  The only good thing about the report is that it accurately titles itself an interdepartmental group.  That is one of the problems.  There is nobody outside the public service involved in this particular report and from that point of view it was written from the perspective of people who are in employment.  Public servants have suffered pay cuts and are affected by the universal social charge and pension levies but I suspect that everyone involved in the report is in good, permanent State employment.  The group was composed of 22 members.  They were from the Department of Finance, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and the Department of Social Protection.  There were three public servants from the Central Bank of Ireland, and also staff from Allied Irish Banks, which is a 99% State-owned company.  In my view everyone who works for AIB is a public servant.  One member was from the former EBS Building Society which is part of AIB which also makes that person a public servant.  It is a public service report written by people, none of whom has lost his or her job or understands the difficulties people face.  From that point of view I consider that like any project on the ground this is a desktop report from people at their desks rather than going out and finding out the particular issues on the ground.  That said, the report contains useful information.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">The scale of the problem is well known and it was well predicted.  In January and February 2009 when the worst stages of the recession hit, 30,000 people lost their jobs in each of those months.  They were probably the worst two months in the history of the State in terms of job losses.  I spoke to people in the banking sector around St. Patrick's Day of that year when 60,000 people had lost their jobs and the live register had increased by that amount who predicted we would have a mortgage crisis by 2011.  Thankfully, we have not had that level of increase before or since.  It has never happened anywhere in the world that a significant increase in unemployment was not followed, with a two-year time lag, by a mortgage crisis.  It was predictable and therefore it is possible that some of this work could have been done earlier to have systems in place to deal with the problem.  The timescale was predictable given that it has happened in every other country.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">When people lose their jobs they have reserves built up and redundancy money which will help them to keep their mortgages on track for a year.  Then they may start to fall behind with other bills while trying to keep the mortgages paid but after a few more months things inevitably start to go wrong.  That is why we have the scale of numbers currently.  Approximately 50,000 households are in arrears for more than 90 days.  That is an issue we have to deal with.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">I give credit to the group for the important notice on the first or second page of the report which outlines that the group was established to consider 15 specific matters, as approved by the Government's economic management council.  However, as is the case with such a review the group has extended beyond the specific approved areas to a certain extent.  The 15 matters are set out in appendix 1.  The group draws the reader's attention to the significant limitations on its procedures as a result of the specific nature of the terms of reference.  The Government drew up a list of 15 questions to which it wanted answers and indicated that it did not wish anything else to be considered.  That was disappointing because those people could have produced a better report had it been sought.  I compliment the chairman and those who worked on the report because they had restricted terms of reference.  The chairman goes out of his way to say that.  I compliment him on having the courage to put the important notice to that effect on the first page of the report.  Perhaps if he had said that to the Minister he would have been invited to do more detailed work.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">The first of the 15 terms of reference is to determine the extent to which the deferred interest scheme is being implemented.  That has nothing to do with the future.  It relates to the existing deferred interest scheme under the voluntary code.  The second of the terms of reference relates to an assessment of the deferred interest scheme criteria.  Again, that relates to something that is already in place.  The fifth of the terms of reference refers to developing further the concept of trade-down mortgages with the Central Bank and the banks.  It was already putting it into people's heads that they want people to consider trading down and getting out of the houses in which they live.  The group was asked to review what progress has been made on the introduction of insolvency legislation.  Reference is also made to dealing with those who have a problem without dealing with those who do not.  It was somewhat insensitive of the Minister when he announced this report last week to claim it was intended to help people who have difficulties rather than those who will not pay their mortgages.  Everybody has difficulty paying their mortgages but he was almost implying that a large number of people are feigning problems.  I recognise that the qualification to which he referred was part of the working group's terms of reference and is embedded in its work.  However, the terms of reference also provided for research to be conducted into intergenerational mortgages, such as the Japanese experience of 70 year mortgages.  If we are thinking about that route, we have lost the plot.  It is bad enough that people have lost their jobs and cannot repay their debts without demanding that their children and grandchildren inherit the debt.  The idea used to be that one inherited money, not debt.  If the Government introduces intergenerational mortgages, everybody will flee after the funeral in case the will gives them a 35-year mortgage.  It was wrong to prescribe that as a specific term of reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The working group came back with the idea of a split mortgage, which is like the shared ownership scheme which local authorities have rightly abandoned.  The shared ownership scheme allowed people to take a mortgage for 60% of a house and pay rent on the balance.  In 30 years time, when the mortgage is cleared, the remaining 40% would be dealt with.  That was in effect an intergenerational mortgage unless somebody found a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and managed to clear the balance of the debt.  I have yet to see that happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">The report discusses increases in mortgage interest relief but, unfortunately, it does not refer to expenditure on rent supplement.  We cannot estimate the level of Government support for people in housing or accommodation without considering the wider question of how much is being spent on the mortgage interest supplement and rent supplement.  I understand that the Department of Social Protection is providing money for housing and, given that 70,000 people are on rent supplement compared to 18,000 on mortgage interest supplement, it is wrong to speak about one while ignoring the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">The terms of reference were very narrow but, despite the constraints under which the committee operated, it made a useful contribution to the debate.  I understand that the Minister for Finance will take questions and answers on the issue.  I commend the Government on accepting our Private Members' Bill, the Debt Settlement and Mortgage Resolution Office Bill 2011.  As we agreed last night, mortgages cannot be isolated from personal debt.  I look forward to debating these issues further during the course of the afternoon.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Fergus O’Dowd)</from>
          <p eId="para_305">Nobody has a monopoly on wisdom and this debate is a constructive engagement by a democratic Parliament to bring the best ideas to the fore and resolve this issue without excluding any view.  Tens of thousands of young people who bought their homes during the boom have since lost their jobs and are saddled with mortgages they cannot repay.  The interdepartmental working group was established in an effort to address that issue.  I acknowledge Deputy Sean Fleming's point about private debt and  mortgage debt but mortgages represent a heavier burden than other forms of debt.  If we can deal with the mortgage issue, people will then be able to start dealing with personal debts.  At the end of the process it is hoped that the economy will start to recover and when the money is coming in through increased employment people will be in a better position to repay their mortgages.  The Government's economic strategy aims to bring growth back to our economy.  Thankfully, it is predicted that we will experience growth this year, leading to increased wealth and job creation.  At the end of the day, that is the only solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Several Deputies have spoken about people with distressed mortgages who have gone to bed hungry in order to service their debts.  I have met others who are relying on their parents for assistance in meeting their daily needs.  The problem affects not only young couples but their parents, grandparents and extended families, who are being asked for financial support.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Having regard for the increasing problem of mortgage arrears, the economic management council requested the working group to consider further necessary actions to address mortgage difficulties.  The two objectives it set were to assist those who faced real difficulties in remaining in their homes, where appropriate, and distinguish between those who could not afford to pay their mortgages and those who chose not to do so.  The working group, which comprised representatives from a number of Departments and bodies, finalised its report at the end of September.  The report concluded that those who could pay their mortgages should do so and that blanket negative equity debt forgiveness was not appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">The dominant response to the problem to date has been extended forbearance measures.  This is a helpful response in many cases but the adoption of long-term forbearance will not be sufficient in all cases and it must be recognised that some mortgages are currently unsustainable.  I have dealt with several cases in which people have left their homes because they knew they could not repay their debts.  The surrender of a house can cause significant trauma for people.  Where a person's future prospects are such that he or she is unlikely to be in a position to build up reasonable equity in a property, more sustainable solutions will have to be advanced by banks and the State.  The report sets out a range of possible solutions, as well as a decision tree approach to aid assessment of individual cases.  However, these solutions are not intended to be exhaustive or prescriptive and they will need to be developed over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">One of the possible solutions set out in the report is a trade down mortgage.  This could be suitable where owners of high value or large properties trade down to a more affordable mortgage.  Split mortgages might be suitable where a household is not in a position to meet the commitments of a full mortgage but could pay a reduced amount and perhaps repay the remainder over time from income or capital increases.  Where an alternative solution cannot be reached, the borrower and lender could agree to sell the property and resolve the shortfall in the mortgage in an appropriate and reasonable manner, considering the borrower's circumstances.  The State also has a significant role to play in circumstances where a person with a distressed mortgage qualifies for social housing support.  The group proposes two new mortgage-to-rent schemes which would be administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  These schemes would utilise approved housing bodies or leases to local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">In each case, the key criterion to qualify is that the person with the distressed mortgage and the person's house must qualify for social housing.  In line with previous reports, the group was of the view that the unlimited duration of the Department of Social Protection's mortgage interest supplement scheme was inappropriate.  The scheme is an important support for people in short-term or medium-term difficulties, but it is not sustainable for the State to support private home ownership indefinitely.  In long-term situations, mortgage-to-rent type solutions represent a more appropriate and sustainable social housing solution.  Accordingly, the group reiterated the recommendation in previous reports that the mortgage interest supplement scheme should be time limited.  The group also considered that a more specialised mortgage advice service will be needed to advise and assist mortgage holders to make decisions in their best interests and to act as a consumer advocate in this area.  This service could be linked to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, which does a fantastic job.  All of my colleagues in this House are familiar with scores of people who go to MABS to get professional, good and helpful advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">The need to reform and update our bankruptcy and personal insolvency law underlies all the approaches to problem mortgages that are set out in the report.  The report points out that the mortgage arrears problem will not be resolved in the absence of effective bankruptcy legislation.  A number of key elements of the report have already been implemented.  The Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, will shortly launch two mortgage-to-rent schemes in line with a recommendation in the report.  The schemes will operate on a pilot basis initially.  They will be subject to prompt review before they are more widely rolled out.  Under each scheme, people in extreme mortgage distress who are eligible for social housing will be able to remain in the homes as social housing tenants.  Either the lending institution or a housing association will take ownership of the property.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">The Minister, Deputy Shatter, has done extensive work on the heads of a personal insolvency Bill, as set out in the report.  This will be published shortly.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has instructed the banking division of the Department of Finance to begin discussions with the banks to ensure the measures set out in the report are implemented speedily.  The Government obviously arranged for this debate to take place in the House.  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform will also consider the report.  The key point is that the Government wants to hear the views of all parties on this important issue.  The strong views we all have comprise the collective wisdom of this Parliament.  No effort should not be made and no stone should be left unturned as we try to help those who are facing these serious difficulties.  At the end of the day, the key point is that we need to restore our economy to growth so that people can get jobs and return to repaying their mortgages.  Notwithstanding the terrible recession we are experiencing, people need to be able to continue with their lives.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan</from>
          <p eId="para_313">While I welcome the opportunity to speak on this crucial issue, I would have preferred if we had a little more to talk about.  I welcome the Minister of State's comment that we must work on this collectively and leave no stone unturned.  Anyone who has paid attention to the pressures facing ordinary people across the State as a result of the devastating impact of the mismanagement of our economy and the gross excess, speculation, gambling and crookedness knows that the problems caused by negative equity and distressed mortgages are rife.  Hundreds of thousands of individuals and tens of thousands of couples and families are under immense pressure to pay their bills as the cost of living increases.  Utility bills are on the rise and professional fees show no sign of abating.  It is incredible to think that many families in this day and age have to choose between food and heat or between rent and school lunches.  This House has a lot to answer for.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">Our thoughts are with the Aviva workers who received the terrible news of massive job losses yesterday.  Many of them will join the 450,000 people on the dole queues, with no real option for future gainful employment in the current climate.  The chief executive officer of Aviva has said there is a culture of entitlement in this State.  In this Chamber yesterday, the Taoiseach as much as agreed with him.  According to the Taoiseach, the issue is one of competitiveness and the cost base.  For me, for Sinn Féin and, I am sure, for most of the Aviva workers, it is a clear case of a big multinational jumping ship to increase already handsome profits, with a shameful lack of consideration and respect for its dedicated workforce to boot.  It is impossible to ignore the real possibility that many of the workers are facing into the harsh reality of bill prioritisation and corner cutting.  Many of their counterparts are already experiencing this reality.  The stories we hear in this regard are numerous and varied, but similar in manyways.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">We should recognise that the issue of mortgage distress is in many respects a generation game, as David McWilliams might say.  The people who are worst affected by mortgage distress are those who were most vulnerable in the first place.  When many people in their late 20s and early 30s reached the stage in life where they were in gainful employment, getting married, starting families and looking for and purchasing homes, it happened to be around the peak of the market.  We remember the push to get on the property ladder and the famous suggestion that there would never be a better time to buy.  It was suggested that those who thought this was some sort of crazy bubble should consider taking their own lives.  That is what the leaders of this State and its industry and business champions led people to believe.  The same demands were made by the Government of the day and most of the Opposition.  Where are they now when lives are being devastated, families are being torn apart, hundreds of thousands of people are on the dole and almost as many are emigrating?  I am sure every Deputy in this House has experience through representing constituents, if not personal experience, of the real human cost of this crisis.  This Government promised solutions for the worst affected people.  Unfortunately, we have yet to see them.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The report of the interdepartmental working group on mortgage arrears is simply that — a report.  It has no real bearing on the lives of ordinary people.  More importantly, it does not provide any real solution.  Incredibly, it suggests that much of the management of the mortgage crisis should be decided on by the banks.  This should not be surprising, given that the analysis was drawn up by 17 civil servants and five bankers.  Elements of the report could be part of a meaningful solution to this increasing problem.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, has outlined our position in this regard.  We will continue to play a constructive role in the process of dealing with this crisis.  Sinn Féin's position is grounded in fairness and sustainability for the lender, the borrower and the taxpayer.  It is focused on maintaining the family home, providing appropriate alternatives, ensuring debt sustainability and sharing the burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">Like many Deputies, I feel that if my constituents gave me a mandate for anything in February, it was to address this crisis.  It must be acknowledged that it is not just a crisis of jobs or unemployment, although these hugely significant contributing factors need to be addressed too.  It is also a problem of a failed housing strategy.  It is a legacy problem.  Sixty miles up the road from here, there is a mature infrastructure to deal with personal and corporate bankruptcy and indebtedness.  The system in this State is so inefficient, ineffective and insufficient that it has stopped.  It is a problem of decreasing wages and increasing living costs.  The simple maths of income and expenditure on a household-by-household basis mean intervention is essential.  It is a problem of personal debt.  As MABS pointed out yesterday, many people have expensive credit card and other loans to repay as well as mortgages.  The numbers do not add up.  There is only so much people can give.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">That the powers that be in the troika gave us a clean bill of health today says a lot about the criteria they use.  It is obvious they have no understanding of the human cost of the memorandum of understanding.  While we direct funds away from people and into banks to keep the troika happy, rather than in any attempt to fix the real economy, ordinary people are caught in the cross-fire.  In many cases, the proposition is untenable.  I am familiar with people who cannot meet their monthly repayments and are in negative equity of anything up to €250,000.  I am sure there are probably cases where it is more.  I know parents of young children who have lost their jobs, or at the very least have taken a substantial pay cut.  They have no flexibility.  They cannot get work because there is none.  They cannot move because they have a millstone around their necks, and to what end?</p>
          <p eId="para_319">I would like to highlight the case of the recently unemployed young parents of a small child, who are in debt to the tune of €200,000.  The banks might as well be looking for €200 million off this couple as they do not have it.  They could take absolutely everything they have for the next 40 years and they still would not be able to repay the money.  They will destroy them as active contributors to the real economy and their lives in the process.  To what end?  We have seen an increase in the number of suicides, in the incidence of alcoholism, domestic violence and mental illnesses due to stress as people struggle to cope with the effects of this crisis.  Every one is crying out for our help and they want us to provide solutions.  They do not care for political point-scoring or one-upmanship.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">The Fine Gael-Labour Party programme for Government promises solutions, but efforts to date have resulted in very little.  It is time for prompt action, as words and reports are not enough.  This report from the interdepartmental working group on mortgage arrears is way off the mark in dealing with the crisis.  Some of the recommendations made may form part of a comprehensive strategy to deal with the problem of mortgage distress but work to see such a strategy implemented needs to begin immediately.  It needs to consider the ideas of others and deliver real and meaningful solutions for ordinary people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dominic Hannigan</from>
          <p eId="para_323">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak about the Keane report.  We are all aware of the difficulties many of our constituents are facing in trying to make ends meet.  This is particularly the case for those who bought their own homes and have seen a reduction in their incomes and, hence, their ability to repay their mortgages.  It is estimated that there are at least 70,000 families in mortgage arrears and many thousands of other families are just about able to pay their bills.  Further reductions in income such as through deductions in the number of hours worked or increases in taxation would mean many of them would be forced into arrears or face significant difficulties in paying their bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">It is for this reason that the Keane report is timely and, undoubtedly, it is a step forward.  It provides much for us to discuss and I hope discussions such as this will help to shape the package of solutions arising from the report.  It is necessary to listen to what other organisations outside the House are saying about the report.  I welcome the comments of organisations such as FLAC, MABS, Threshold, New Beginnings and others.  Their views can help to shape the overall solutions we offer to those who need help.  These solutions are needed as soon as possible, as there are many who are hurting now and want to see action.  There are also many who want to see the proposals go further — for example, I know some want to see the issue of negative equity addressed.  However, let us be clear.  The Keane report and this debate are not about negative equity but about those in arrears who are finding it increasingly difficult to pay their bills.  Some of them are in negative equity but some may also be in positive equity.  Up to now, very few concrete proposals have been put on the table.  The debate about potential solutions has suffered because we have not been told the quantum of cases involved or how much money is involved.  There has been a lack of data, to which FLAC referred in its presentation to the finance committee yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">For the next step, before potential solutions are introduced, we need to find answers.  For example, how many are in a distressed state?  How many face short-term or medium-term problems and how many are in a situation where something is non-viable?  Of those in arrears, how many are in positive equity?  We also need to know what the costs are of removing somebody from his or her home, forcing him or her to give up his or her mortgage and then rehousing him or her.  It may be cheaper to leave him or her <i> in situ</i>.  We also need to talk about the issue of who is responsible for unpayable debt — in short, who pays?  We must address questions such as whether somebody in arrears but in positive equity should be treated differently from a person in arrears and in negative equity.  In the discussions to date there has been much talk about the parking of debt and providing mortgage holidays.  If we were to do this, who would pay the interests on the loans?  Should it be society, via the banks, or the home owner or a mixture of both?  If we take over a property in respect of which there is a non-viable mortgage, who will be responsible for loan shortfall?  Should they remain with the original home owner, or should they pass to the bank or should it be a mixture of both?</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The Keane report provides us with high level solutions.  The next step will be to flesh out these solutions and put meat on the bones of the proposals made.  A range of solutions will be needed.  While I believe there are solutions, we need a debate to achieve buy-in across society as soon as possible.  This is because the solutions to the problem may involve a cost to the general purse, although such costs might be less than the alternative of not intervening.  It is important that we get this right, that we act fast and that legislation, if necessary, is brought forward.  I see the Keane report as being a significant step forward, but we need to move quickly and listen to other groups.  We need to undertake a hard analysis and turn the proposals made in the Keane report and elsewhere into practical solutions.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnLyonsLab" eId="spk_197">
          <from>Deputy John Lyons</from>
          <p eId="para_327">I welcome the opportunity to speak about the issue referred to.  There has been much comment on the Keane report since its release and no more than other Members, I have been contacted by many constituents with queries about it.  It is a vital issue, one that has great social and economic consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">I remind Deputies listening to the debate and those in the Chamber — few though they are, which is always disappointing when one makes an effort to speak — that this issue has been developing for a number of years.  The Labour Party while in opposition tabled a Private Members' motion on the issue.  The issues we are facing are not necessarily new, but the attitude and response of the Government are new.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Like Deputy Hannigan, I look at this issue from the point of view of how best to serve those experiencing mortgage arrears.  I welcome the publication of the Keane report as it reflects this approach, namely, its main objective is to keep people in their homes.  Everybody in the House can draw on a consensus that nobody wants a person to lose his or her home.  A "home" does not necessarily mean one he or she owns, as it is a place in which people live, to which they belong and where their families grow up.  It has a wider meaning than simply that of a physical entity of bricks and mortar.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">It is obvious that we have to consider the social impact of a family losing their home.  As we all know, keeping families in their homes and connected with the community is of the utmost importance at this time.  The main message I took from the past week was that people just wanted to be treated fairly and to be given a chance, whether it be, unfortunately, to move to a more suitable property or an affordable home, or to just have somewhere to stay.  Deputy McLellan noted that the crisis mainly affected people of my age, those in their 30s.  Most Members are aware of the circumstances of those in this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">Having spoken to people about the report, it is evident that the range of circumstances in which people find themselves, mostly through bad fortune, has cemented the need for a case-by-case approach focusing on the needs of the individual mortgage holder.  This is one of the points suggested in the Keane report, namely, a case-by-case assessment rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.  It is very easy to propose a one-size-fits-all solution to a crisis of this magnitude, but it is entirely different to implement such a proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">An indicator of the complexity of the issue was given yesterday with reports that the Government was in discussions with the troika and the banks about possible mortgage holidays to enable people to pay off their other debts, that is, personal debts.  As Deputy Hannigan said, this, too, would have consequences.  It is a positive development, but the point is that having to seek approval from the troika in the first place, given that we are dependent on it to finance the State, is an indication of the complexity of the issue.  Those calling for a one-size-fits-all approach are, therefore, mistaken.  This requires a range of measures, of which the Keane report outlines a number, from new mortgage options to independent expert advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">One of the main responses to the issue will be the introduction of personal insolvency legislation.  Many of the recommendations made in the Keane report are based on the implementation of such legislation.  It has been stated by a number of commentators that overall debt levels have to be examined to resolve the issue of an individual's debt.  That is true, as just dealing with mortgage debt in isolation does not recognise a person's ability to pay his or her debts.  Moreover, the penal nature of the legislation is wholly inappropriate in dealing with the debt crisis many now face.  I look forward to the publication of the personal insolvency legislation mentioned by Deputy O'Dowd.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I wish to make a few points on the report.  First, the role of MABS in playing a full part in this process must be identified and supported.  In the Chamber last Tuesday evening the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, detailed figures showing the number of mortgage holders who had approached MABS to seek help.  This demonstrates the developing nature of the problem and that the service's role and expertise in the area must be harnessed to help new independent mortgage advisers.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">As I am running out of time, I will skip to my final point.  Another issue that must be considered is what is expected from banks.  I welcome the recent comments by the Financial Regulator, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, on possible restrictions on banks' ability to raise variable mortgage rates, particularly if such actions were seen to push more people into mortgage arrears.  Given the support the people have given to the banks in recent years, the latter must now play their role in dealing with this issue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_336">The mortgage and negative equity crisis is absolutely massive.  It faces at least 115,000 people who either are in arrears or, as a result of their mortgages being distressed, have had their mortgages restructured.  Moreover, this may only be the beginning of it or, at least, there may be much more to come if the economic situation deteriorates further or if more people get into trouble.  This is an emergency and a potential timebomb unless it is dealt with in a serious, determined, fair and sustainable way.  Most importantly, it is a huge human crisis for those tens of thousands of families racked with anxiety and fear of losing their homes, having debts they simply cannot manage, worrying about their futures and those of their children, as well as about the prospect, if not of losing their homes, of being crippled with debts for years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">This human tragedy is also an economic emergency because unless this problem is sorted out, the economy will be crippled for years to come.  If this number of people and families are in massive debt, crippled and strangled by it and fighting to keep a roof over their heads, it is obvious they will not have money to spend in the economy and the disastrous stagnation of the domestic economy will continue and worsen.  Consequently, there is both a human and an economic imperative to deal with this crisis.  In order to do so in a meaningful and fair way, one must establish first principles.  This is where the Keane report gets it wrong from the outset.  Its guiding principles say it all by stating:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_338">Those who can discharge their mortgage applications must do so.  There is no entitlement to a particular solution and solutions have consequences ... it is inevitable that people will lose their homes ... blanket debt forgiveness ... is not recommended.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">The report also states the challenges are "to keep people in their homes, where appropriate" and "to avoid inappropriate mortgage holder behaviour, thereby compounding the ... problem".  That says it all about the attitude demonstrated within the Keane report.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">This is a bankers' report.  Moreover, it is the report of bankers and a Government and State that are in hock to bankers, the first priority of which is to pay back bankers, bondholders and speculators and for which the human needs of the mortgage holders, that is, of the 115,000 or more families struggling with unsustainable levels of debt, come way down the line.  This is the priority and it is spelled out clearly in the report.  From the outset, it was put together with the wrong priorities in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">Moreover, it says everything about the manner in which the report was put together that those who actually know what the mortgage crisis means and who deal with it on a daily basis were not involved.  Why were organisations such as MABS, the Free Legal Aid Centres, FLAC, New Beginning and Threshold not involved?  These are the organisations which actually are familiar with the plight of mortgage holders.  It reflects everything about the Government's priorities in setting up the Keane group and setting the report's terms of reference that it chose not to include either those whose concern is the actual mortgage holders or representatives of the mortgage holders themselves.  The guiding principles at the beginning of the report set out clearly that the agenda was to do the bidding of the European Union and the IMF yet again.  It was to protect the banks at all costs, squeeze as much money as possible out of ordinary householders to make sure the banks' books balanced, because that is what the IMF and the troika wanted.  They do not give a damn about the human and social consequences, what will happen to the economy or those who may lose their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">Moreover, all the weasel words Members have heard in this debate in the past two days, in which Members have expressed their concern for mortgage holders and commended MABS, FLAC and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, mean absolutely nothing unless one states, in a way the Keane report point blank refused to do, that one's priority is to assist the mortgage holders who are in this distressed state and their families.  Members must set out meaningful first principles that name the problem as it is.  The first principle with which Members must start is that the crisis, this car crash as Deputy Mathews correctly termed it yesterday, was caused by the greed of bankers, developers and the Fianna Fáil Government which facilitated them every step of the way.  Those who simply sought to put a roof over their heads during a bubble created by the greed of a tiny minority are not responsible and should not be held responsible.  They do not have obligations to pay back the banks, as suggested in the Keane report, because the debt they carry was inflicted on them by the reckless greed, sharp practice and imprudential banking of these financial institutions which created a rigged and distorted market.  Those who simply wanted to satisfy the most basic need to put a roof over their heads and who are entitled to so do could only do so in a rigged and distorted market created by the greed of a tiny minority.  Members' first principle must be that they are there to protect and recommendations, proposals or legislation arising from this debate must state these persons are innocent and do not have obligations.  They have an obligation to keep a roof over their heads and unsaddle them from this massive debt burden inflicted on them by bankers and bondholders and which the IMF and EU troika wish to continue to hold over them.  They must confirm that people have a right to a home.  Particularly when there is a massive oversupply running to tens of thousands of empty homes, the idea that anyone might face eviction is obscene.  There should be no evictions and people saddled with unsustainable debt should have that debt taken from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">As for establishing these first principles, at the very least the Government should take on board the recommendations made by the groups such as MABS, New Beginning and so on which appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform yesterday.  These are the first principles that should have informed the report.  Full information must be provided on the extent of distressed mortgages, which still is lacking, and how many more are likely to become distressed.  We need to take all personal debt into account.  People in this situation need representation which should be provided by the State and paid for the banks.  Any arrangement for people in a distressed situation must ensure there is a dignified standard of living for the families in that arrangement and they must retain their dwellings.  Personal insolvency legislation which switches the balance in favour of the borrower and against the bank should be introduced immediately.  Yesterday New Beginning made a suggestion that could be done tomorrow if the Government had the will.  It proposed inserting a clause in existing legislation requiring judges to take into account the personal circumstances of borrowers when dealing with debt situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">If we want to remove the car crash that has been caused by the property bubble and the greed of a minority, there must be debt write-off.  The Government and the Keane report are again disingenuous on the cost of this.  The figure of €14 billion is bandied around, but it was stated that if it was targeted towards people with principal private residences being the criterion, it could be €10 billion and the Central Bank conference on 13 October said the real cost could be €8.3 billion.  We put €70 billion into recapitalising the banks, €24 billion of which was to address distressed mortgages.  We put €35 billion into NAMA and we are paying €200,000 a year to developers who bankrupted this country to manage their assets.  Despite this, the Government is claiming we cannot afford €8 billion or €10 billion to write down the debts of mortgage holders.  Of course we can.  It is a question of which is our priority: to protect bankers and financiers and do what the troika tells us or to protect ordinary householders, who are in a desperate situation through no fault of their own, and allow them keep a roof over their heads.  The choice is the Minister's and he should side with the people.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOReilly" eId="spk_199" as="#Acting_Chairman">
          <from>Deputy Joe O’Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_345">Our hearts go out to people in mortgage distress who are having problems with cash flow who find it impossible to repay their mortgages.  It is a very difficult place to be and it has dreadful consequences for self-image and family welfare.  We must acknowledge that as being the context of what we are discussing.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">An important principle is that we must deal with distressed mortgages case by case because no two are the same.  There are different capacities to pay and different dynamics at work.  I congratulate the Fianna Fáil Members who tabled the Private Members' Bill this week and our party acted properly in accepting the Bill.  I applaud the work done on the Bill, which will give people the opportunity to deal with an agency that will interface with the banks and give professional advice, which will be an important support to people in distress.  Members of this House might underestimate the importance of that for individuals who are not as well equipped to be their own advocates and marshal arguments on their own behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">The Keane report and the subsequent Government response are accurate in affirming that we cannot have blanket forgiveness — it is fantasy to suggest we could.  It would not work on a number of levels.  The taxpayers could not sustain it and in many cases the beneficiaries are also taxpayers.  It is not sustainable on the level of community relations and its administration and application would become a nightmare.  It is not realistic.  A myriad of solutions just short of it are required.  Long-term forbearance and dealing with loans by banks is a prerequisite and will have to be accepted.  For example the Japanese have double the lifespan of mortgage that we have here.  We will need to consider granting much longer-term mortgages in future.  In dealing with distressed mortgages, the long-term solution will be central.  Therein lies a much better holistic solution than suggesting a complete write-down of debts.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The concept of a trade-down to more affordable mortgages might be applicable in many cases.  There is a cultural difficulty with that kind of thing in Ireland and there will be some small community stuff that will make it a bit difficult to administer.  However, it needs to be on the menu of solutions and it is proposed in the Keane report.  There is no way it can be avoided in certain instances.  The idea of splitting the mortgage, making it almost a two-term mortgage and putting payment of part of it back is good and will need to happen in a number of cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">The major plank of the Keane report is the introduction of a mortgage-to-rent scheme, which has considerable merit in instances where people are unable to pay and would become candidates for social housing anyway.  There would be significant long-term costs in supporting them in mortgage subsidy.  In many cases mortgage subsidisation is insufficient to ensure they can continue to repay their mortgages.  The mortgage-to-rent scheme has inherent value and I commend it as a very realistic proposition.  Obviously implicit in that would be a level of debt write-down by the banks, which is made possible by the support the banks have already received from the taxpayers.  The level of rent would also need to be manageable.  There is no reason for that not to be a very private and discreet situation between the householder, the local authority and the lender.  It can be managed at that level and there is no reason for people to have any form of public humiliation.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Over time that system will result in the elimination of mortgage support, which is a reasonable proposition.  While I would consider much of what Deputy Boyd Barrett said unrealistic to the extent that we cannot escape international and domestic financial realities and the sovereign agreement with the EU and IMF, I agree with him on the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS.  MABS should have been more central in the preparation of the Keane report.  MABS will have a very important role to play in complementing the work of the new agency to interface with the banks.  MABS has a key function in budgeting and managing other ancillary debts.  Very few people have distressed mortgages alone and also have credit card debts and so on.  It is mentioned as well in the report that we will need Central Bank control of foreign mortgage lenders where there might be a difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">In certain instances, a level of debt will have to be written off by the banks and mortgage companies, and they will have to accept their responsibility.  I would recommend to the Minister that we take a serious look at the proposition by New Beginning.  There is a logic to the proposition that people would pay no more than 35% of their net disposable income on their mortgage and there is logic to the proposition that they pay less in the beginning until they accustom themselves to the mortgage and deal with their personal circumstances.  These propositions are worth examination and should be incorporated into any solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">We will need a multifaceted solution.  The solution begins with the interaction between the distressed debtor, MABS and the new agency.  It will extend to a number of solutions involving forbearance by the banks and putting off the debt in many instances, scaling it over several years, while in other instances involving a level of write-off.  In instances where it is not possible to pay, the mortgage-to-rent scheme should be used.  It is very difficult to arrive at one solution that will fit all, and every case will need to be dealt with individually.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">This is central to the revival of our economy.  Many excellent steps have been taken to date to put our economy on a sound footing and these are beginning to bear fruit.  Dealing with this issue is a very important part of that mix, because domestic demand would increase immensely if we dealt with distressed mortgages.  It is an important debate and I recommend to the Minister that he look at an holistic solution covering every available option.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_200">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
          <p eId="para_354">I was always taught that when reading a factual book, the first thing I should do is see who wrote it, when he or she wrote it and in some contexts, particularly in history, where he or she came from and his or her background.  When I looked at the Keane report, I was surprised that it came from people who did not have a direct relationship with the problems they addressed.  That was a mistake.  I am not sure if any of them is struggling to pay a mortgage; perhaps they are.  However, I noticed there was no criticism of the banks' behaviour towards the borrower, despite the fact that there is much evidence of bullying, threats and intimidation from the financial institutions in their relationship with borrowers.  It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that it is a pretty uneven contest between the borrower and the lender at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">I recently met a group of national organisations that were also very surprised that they had not been involved in this report.  I accept that the Government may take some of their ideas on board.  Among those present were FLAC, Threshold, Respond, Focus Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and New Beginning.  It was interesting to hear their opinions because they are at the coalface of the problem.  They are dealing with the people who are suffering in a serious way on a daily basis.  It would have been a great idea on the part of the Government to involve these people in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">The Government needs to connect more with civic groups in general, and not just on this issue.  The Government has a responsibility to change the level of disconnection between Leinster House and the world outside.  I am a newcomer to this House.  I have worked all my life on a physical level and on a business level outside in the so-called real world.  I am surprised at the level of disconnection.  I am surprised at the lack of understanding in here at times of what really goes on outside and what is really happening.  We spoke about Priory Hall only this week and I noticed that people do not understand what happens on a building site, but since they were never on a site, that is probably understandable.  They will have to address the lack of regulation in the construction industry.  It has been there for a long time, in spite of recent CIF protestations.  I do not recall the CIF asking for more regulation over the past ten years.  If the Government is to address the problem, its members need to speak to the people who work on building sites and learn from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I wish there was a closer relationship between the Government and the people when it comes to mortgages.  I wish it was as close as the relationship between the Government and the banks.  There is more interaction between the Government and the banks than there is between the Government and the people.  The mortgage crisis is worse at this stage, and that is not surprising because things are becoming difficult for many people.  They are falling further behind with their payments and they have a great deal of other debt.  We still seem to lack a proper way of measuring that debt for some reason.  We do not know what they owe, between credit cards, utility bills and so on.  We probably do not realise just yet how poor many people are.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">The top priority of the Government has to be to keep people in their homes and not to drive them into poverty.  Whether the person is in trouble due to his or her own fault or due to the lender's fault is a different argument.  I am not very happy with the current perception that the borrower is the person who always needs to be forgiven.  A great deal of forgiveness is required for the lender as well and we need to have a serious look at how we think about the way banks relate to their customers.  I do not see much sense of responsibility shown by lenders towards borrowers, but they should accept responsibility.  When a borrower takes money from a lender, there has to be more scrutiny of the agreement and there must be a level of fairness in it.  The notion that any lender can demand payment of all money owed at 24 hours notice is outrageous.  It is completely unrealistic.  Who can come up with it?</p>
          <p eId="para_359">In my predicament last week with ACC, it was hardly surprising that I could not come up with €19 million overnight.  However, let us say a Member in here still owes €200,000 on his or her mortgage, can he or she imagine the banks giving him 24 hours to pay that?  It would be very difficult for anybody to do that, and not just the builders and developers who might be in a difficult place.  We seem to think there is a stigma attached to people who owe money.  We have heard a lot of talk about "can't pay, won't pay".  Of course, we do not want people cheating the system, that is, people who could pay getting away with not paying.  However, there is an unfair stigma developing about the people who are in trouble.  In this regard, I saw two elements in the report.  It stated that those who could meet their mortgage obligations must do so.  It also said mortgage holders are not entitled to any particular mortgage solutions.  There is a sense that borrowers are morally questionable, yet there is not a word about lenders being morally questionable and, God knows, they have not covered themselves in glory.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">A point that is pretty obvious to us all was pointed out by the group New Beginning.  It is that there is unlikely to be a recovery in the economy until we resolve what is now a mortgage crisis.  Until ordinary people can return to economic normality, the real economy will stagnate, which means unemployment, emigration, misery and injustice, too, for a lot of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">A Dublin man, Michael Lamb, wrote to me and other Deputies about his family and his mortgage predicament.  He wrote: "As it stands, we can just about cover the monthly repayments and, as such, do not appear as a statistic in the reports that are currently circulating on people who are experiencing mortgage difficulties.  My family, including my two young children, make many sacrifices to pay the monthly repayments which would not be possible without the help of our parents."  It is so difficult for so many people, and it is a lot worse than we realise.  There will have to be some sort of write-down for some people who really cannot pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">The mortgage-to-rent scheme is dependent on housing organisations that were not going to get access to money themselves and are already seriously overstretched.  I realise it can be difficult to involve a local authority in that situation but it is something the Minister will have to examine.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">Looking to the future, we must surely rethink our whole philosophy on housing.  In the 1940s, 70% of housing was social but since 2000 it has been 6%.  That cannot continue.  The notion that everybody will be able to afford a home is unsustainable.  The State should change its mindset and consider having a serious social housing programme if it wants to take proper care of its citizens.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_201">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_364">I am glad of an opportunity to speak on this report which will lead to legislation.  I have listened with interest to various contributions from both sides of the House and we need to concentrate on a couple of matters at this stage.  First, we should all be conversant with the situation as it affects our constituents.  I am sure each Member of the House has had direct contact with constituents who find themselves to varying degrees in deep debt arising from circumstances outside their control.  The Keane report touches all the right buttons and examines them, but some of the proposals are not feasible and I would definitely advise against some of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">About three years ago, we all recognised that the situation would get worse.  I remember asking Ministers in the previous Government whether they were prepared to introduce legislation to deal with household mortgage debt.  It was mentioned at the time but nothing further happened.  I fully understand that we must take various tentative steps before we can deal with the situation definitively.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">To be fair, some banks are willing to talk to householders and assist them.  Others, however, just go through the motions and say, "If you come to us in time, we'll deal with it and we'll work something out".  They do not always live up to that, however.  We should be aware that some of the latter institutions have been beneficiaries of considerable assistance from the State.  Other lending institutions that have not been beneficiaries of State assistance have been willing, and are currently working out a formula, to help out householders.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">The concept of compound interest must be abolished.  There is no sense whatsoever in attempting to collect compound interest on a €250,000 mortgage from people who are unemployed through no fault of their own.  In any event, compound interest is highly questionable because it only acts as a multiplier to give a book value for accountancy purposes to the lending institution.  It does nothing else.  It drives the situation further down the road so the householder can never recover from debt.  If one follows that to its logical conclusion, what happens eventually is that the house in negative equity is repossessed and sold on the market if the bank can find a buyer.  As a result, the bank, and the Government that has funded the lending institution concerned, will suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Over the past three years, in common with everyone else in this House, I have dealt with countless constituents who have been faced directly with this particular difficulty.  Discounting compound interest should be a prerequisite to everything because nothing will work if the previous attitude is continued.  If one tries to work out a programme for people to get out of their difficulty and they happen to be unemployed, the lending institution will say "That's not sustainable, Deputy".  However, when the mortgage was granted in the first place it was not sustainable either, yet nobody seems to recognise that now.  The sustainability of mortgages that were granted a few years ago must be measured against the current situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Deputy Wallace mentioned some interesting things with which I agree.  According to an old rule, 2.5 times the borrower's annual income dictated the level of mortgage to which one was entitled.  That was deemed to be sustainable.  In the 1980s it was regarded as a bit too restrictive, so we extended it to three times the borrower's income.  It was therefore possible to borrow three times the major earner's income, and repay at the rate of one fifth.  That scheme gave a considerable amount of scope, although most lending agencies criticised it.  The insurance companies and investors were also highly critical of it.  The insurance funds were supposed to be attracted by this scheme but they did not like it because it did not work for them and there was not enough return.  Of course, there was never enough return for investors, which is one of the problems that has left us where we are at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">We need to go back and establish what is sustainable now.  In seeking to resolve any such problem facing us we should determine what is sustainable for people, given their current income.  There is no sense in saying that they have a prospect of getting a job next week because we do not know that.  They may or may not have a job next week.  Over a period of two or three years we must work out an achievable programme that will be within their reach.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The mortgage-to-rent scheme is a good idea. Where there is no hope of recovery, that is the way out.  It is a temporary option, but one must question who will determine the rent to be paid.  On what Deputy Wallace said, many housing units are in the hands of investors and landlords.  The banks or lending institutions will have a strong vested interest in determining the level of rent to be paid.  Will they determine it?  If so, that is bad.  The rent to be paid must be determined by somebody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">I strongly disagree with voluntary agencies taking on a major role.  There are voluntary agencies which have been funded in the order of 100% by the State.  They have been allocated free sites and capital allowances to build houses and, in some cases, receive an ongoing grant from the respective Departments to spend.  In some cases, there is no company; articles of association have not been observed; there is no proper accounting and no annual returns are submitted, yet they are pursuing their tenants in court.  They are pursuing them, despite the fact that they did not exist for a considerable period.  I am deeply concerned, therefore, about handing over any responsibility to voluntary agencies.  While some are good, I can assure the House that there are some serious problems also.  In the next five years these will emerge to a far greater extent than we have witnessed heretofore.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Some 25,000 houses are already in the care of voluntary agencies.  The concept behind voluntary agencies sounds great, but it is very difficult to control the system which was introduced by a former Minister, whom I will not name, as a means of taking responsibility from the local authorities.  The local authorities regarded their not having to take responsibility anymore as a great opt-out, but now they want to regain control of the housing stock because they have none.  That is the point correctly made by Deputy Wallace.  For a period of 15 to 20 years, there was little investment in what is now called "social housing".  It was called "local authority housing" at the time.  Some genius came up with the term "social housing" and immediately responsibility was abdicated by the local authorities.  However, they now want it back and they are right because there is a serious problem associated with considerable dependency on private rented accommodation.  There was not this demand 20 or 25 years ago, or even ten to 15 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">I would love to have at least half an hour to talk about this subject because, unfortunately, I have had to appear in court with some of my constituents on numerous occasions in the past three years.  Thus far, we have not lost much ground, except in very extenuating circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">I noticed in the past couple of days that assessments of a person's ability to repay a loan or mortgage took child benefit into account.  It is not supposed to be taken into account in such assessments.  Doing so is a new phenomenon.  The benefit is payable for children.  It always used to be excluded, but some smart alec introduced it in recent times in the assessment of mortgage eligibility.  From where in God's name did this come?  I could elaborate on this issue and apologise to the Minister for ranting about the subject.  It annoys me intensely.  Unfortunately, we must now all deal with it to a far greater extent than we used to.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Some of the proposals made are reasonable, while some are dangerous.  However, all of them need to come within the control of the statutory authorities for implementation at a later stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_377">There is unquestionably a mortgage crisis and no one can see clearly where or when it will come to an end.  It is certain that if it is not addressed comprehensively, effectively and very soon, many more people will be forced into poverty and homelessness.  We will see more repossessions of homes and more families forced to make the choice between paying the mortgage and buying food or essential medication.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Throughout the country families are looking forward to the festive season, albeit several weeks away, not in anticipation but with trepidation.  I have much evidence of this already.  Tens of thousands of families are in what can only be called mortgage slavery.  Houses and apartments purchased at grossly inflated Celtic tiger prices are now in negative equity and the purchasers are chained to massive mortgages that swallow up their ever decreasing incomes.  The consequences for individuals and families are devastating, while the consequences for the wider economy and society are deeply damaging, as disposable income disappears into the black hole of mortgage debt.  This is a direct result of the deliberate inflation of the property bubble by previous Governments and the free for all unregulated market in land, property development, construction and loans that prevailed in that era of madness — that is what it was — known as the Celtic tiger.  Many were taken in by it, understandably so.  For tens of thousands of young people, the opportunity to get on the so-called property ladder had come and they grabbed it with both hands.  The regulators who should have protected them were negligent in the extreme, asleep on their watch.  Given that background, there is a great moral obligation on the State to move heaven and earth to support those who, through no fault of their own, have been plunged into what I have described as mortgage slavery.  Instead of our witnessing its meeting of this obligation, we find half-hearted milk and water measures or no action being taken at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The Keane report is a bitter disappointment.  Once again, it represents a cringing approach to the banks, a genuflection to the board rooms, yet many of the grossly overpaid culprits are still in positions of power.  The report rules out increasing the mortgage supplement and extending mortgage interest relief.  A legally empowered debt management agency is also ruled out.  There is nothing to protect mortgage holders from ECB interest rate increases.  There is little or nothing to protect them, yet the Fine Gael-Labour Party programme for Government claims that on 25 February 2011 "a democratic revolution took place in Ireland".  It speaks of new hope and states "a new Government, guided by the needs of the many rather than the greed of the few, can make a real, positive difference in your life."  I presume these stirring words were inserted by the Labour Party drafters, but they turn to dust when one sees what precious little hope is offered to those in mortgage slavery.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">It is not that there was a lack of positive and constructive proposals from many quarters to address this crisis.  The new Government invited such proposals but has, sadly, paid scant attention to them.  From the beginning, Sinn Féin has called for thorough and radical measures.  This was reaffirmed at our party's Ard-Fheis last month in Belfast, at which we pointed to the rapidly growing number of mortgage holders in distress and the serious impact of mortgage distress on families, local economies and the financial stability of the national economy.  We called unanimously for the establishment of independent statutory distressed mortgage resolution processes in both jurisdictions on the island of Ireland, the purpose of which would be: to reach a legally binding resolution of mortgage distress on a case-by-case basis; to protect the family home through a variety of measures, including loss sharing, shared equity and transferring tenure type to social renting; to enable those unable to remain in the family home to downsize or transfer to more sustainable mortgage arrangements via short sales or property-mortgage swaps; to protect the taxpayer by ensuring mortgage lenders and inter-bank commercial lenders share a portion of the burden involved in the problem of mortgage distress; and to implement the Law Reform Commission's recommendations on the reform of the bankruptcy laws to enable people to make a fresh start if formal bankruptcy is the only way of addressing their mortgage distress.  These are real, concrete and far-reaching proposals and to introduce and implement them would require an unprecedented level of political resolve and strong, resolute leadership.  Are the Fine Gael and Labour Party Members familiar with these words?  They should be because they are the words used in the construction of the programme for Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_382">The Government need not begin by implementing the Sinn Féin proposals but it should implement what it has committed to in the programme for Government, but we are not getting that.  I remind the Minister that he has made the following commitments: to increase mortgage interest relief to 30% for first-time buyers from 2004 to 2008; to introduce a two-year moratorium on the repossession of modest family homes where a family makes an honest effort to pay the mortgage; to fast-track personal bankruptcy reform; to convert the Money Advice and Budgeting Service to a strengthened personal debt management agency with strong legal powers; and to make greater use of mortgage interest supplement to support families who cannot meet their mortgage payments.  This is not what we are getting, but why has no action been taken to implement any of these commitments, to which the Minister is a signatory?</p>

          <p eId="para_385">The Financial Regulator figures show that 55,763 mortgages were in arrears for more than 90 days at the end of June this year.  Some 69,837 residential mortgages are categorised as restructured, including interest-only payment plans and, of these, 30,442 are also in arrears.  Some 95,158 residential mortgages are in arrears of more than 90 days or have been restructured.  This represents 12% of residential mortgage holders in some form of mortgage distress.  These are serious facts.  Rent supplement claims have increased from 63,658 to 96,809 applications.  Mortgage interest supplement claims have increased from 5,212 to an incredible 18,564.  Almost 100,000 families are on social housing waiting lists, twice the number that were on the lists in 2008, only three years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">This is not simply a mortgage crisis; it is a full-blown housing crisis.  There is no other way to describe it.  I have never stood up and I will not stand up here and use the opportunity to have a go.  Were the Government to introduce effective measures to address this crisis and support families and individuals or simply to hold to the measures to which it has committed, it would have my and my party's wholehearted support and acknowledgement but if it fails to do so we will continue to pursue it until it takes the urgent and extensive action which, clearly, is required.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_387">I wish to share time with Deputy Anne Ferris.  I would have preferred more time to read the report.  Some material in the report is rather technical and it would be good for Deputies and Senators to receive a presentation by the authors of the report at some stage to outline the various measures.  Now that the report is out, anything that is non-contentious and straightforward should be implemented as soon as possible.  A strong awareness programme should be arranged.  It need not be an expensive public relations campaign but it could use press conferences, leafleting or whatever is available to get the message out about the measures and to let people know that a range of measures are available to help.  There is some confusion about whether anything is available to help people in difficulty with their mortgages.  There is also confusion about who might need help.  It is apparent from the "The Frontline" programme that there is a merging of people who may have speculated on property on the one hand and those who are in negative equity on the other.  There should be a strong awareness programme to explain the problems to people and to explain the solutions to address these problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Many of the relevant NGOs are well-intentioned but they are also jockeying for position in terms of who has the monopoly on wisdom on the issue.  No one has a monopoly on wisdom on what should be done to address the problems.  There should be consultation with the groups that have expressed views on the process and which have been critical of the Keane report but none of these groups has a monopoly on wisdom.  A great deal of experience is available, including from public representatives who have worked as councillors and know about the availability of schemes such as the shared ownership scheme and whether they worked.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The Keane report stated that mortgage interest relief was a State subsidy to the banks.  A reply to a parliamentary question asked of the Minister recently stated that some €77.2 million was allocated to mortgage interest supplement in 2011.  That represents one funding stream.  Tax relief also applies on mortgage interest and the cost to date in 2011 for that relief is €400 million.  These subsidies are in place as well as the bank recapitalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Recently, I asked the Minister about the Bank of Ireland's outsourcing of biometric software development to a company in India called HCL Technologies.  The Minister's reply was critical but he suggested there was not much he could do about it and that the banks should be kept at arm's distance from the Government and the Oireachtas.  I do not agree.  There should be independence in the way the banks operate but there is considerable and ongoing State investment in the banks.  If the Bank of Ireland is outsourcing to companies in India, it should be made to invest in companies here in the software development area or to train its staff in software development or, for example, it could get involved in set-up companies in partnership with the universities.  Of all the sectors, Ireland has great potential in software development.  I realise this is somewhat off-topic but the banks should be made to do certain things having received such an amount of State funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">One element missing from the report is any mention of a scheme such as the shared ownership scheme and this surprised me.  We are all aware that there were problems with the shared ownership scheme but something like it could be developed as part of the solution for those who have problems at the moment.  We should return to old-fashioned council housing.  On the one hand we appear to suggest to people that they should not expect to buy houses but on the other hand we appear to move away from traditional social housing in our local authorities.  This has been a bad move and it has contributed to our property boom and collapse because not enough social housing has been built.  In reality, affordable housing was simply a prop for the market.  We should return to these things.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, has made criticisms and points about the proposals which should be taken on board.</p>

        <speech by="#AnneFerris" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Deputy Anne Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_392">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue which affects thousands of families throughout the country and in my constituency of Wicklow.  The economic crisis which the previous Fianna Fáil Government led this country into was not only a crisis that affected our banking and financial system, but one the effects of which have threatened the homes in which people live.  Let us be clear: the home is at the heart of the family.  It is where young couples seek to found families, where children can be raised and where elderly people can retire in later years.  The idea that the home could be under threat is a terrifying prospect but one thousands of people face.  Something should have been done by the previous Government to address this but it was not.  Much like other economic challenges, this challenge has been left to the current Government.  We have responded well on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">The Keane report sets out a number of targeted measures which will give options to families who are struggling.  In some senses, it throws a lifeline.  While a blanket debt write-off will not be introduced given the estimated €14 billion cost of clearing the negative equity in mortgage portfolios, other measures will, I hope, have a direct and meaningful impact on struggling home owners.  These measures are set out in a decision tree, albeit one which is not intended to provide an exhaustive list of proposed solutions.  The options include a split mortgage, under which a household that is not in a position to meet all the payments owed on a full mortgage could instead repay on a reduced amount and meet the outstanding amount using a pre-agreed formula which would be dependent on a number of factors.  Other ideas include mortgage-to-rent schemes under which the property is acquired from the banks by an approved housing body or through a long-term lease to a local authority.  In such circumstances, the State would avoid having to add to a burgeoning social housing list because the housing stock would be purchased with tenants who would be able to remain in their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">The reform of personal insolvency legislation must be progressed as quickly as possible.  Such legislation will alter the relationship between the mortgager and mortgagee by providing new judicial and non-judicial bankruptcy options.  While I am aware the Minister for Justice and Equality is working on the heads of a personal insolvency Bill, the sooner it is introduced the better because it is urgently needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">The measures outlined in the Keane report are important and necessary.  They may not provide a complete solution to the problems facing households but they offer a substantial range of options which should and must be pursued to put a human face on the current financial challenges.  Many people bought homes because they believed they would never get on the property ladder otherwise.  If they waited any longer, they believed the price of a home in their local communities would increase to the point where they would be forced to move away from their communities and family support networks.  They now find themselves in the middle of an economic storm that has left them in financial and emotional shock.  The Government must do its level best to help them.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Deputy Wallace correctly noted that the banks must play their part in helping those at whom they threw money, often unwisely, and who are now struggling.  I do not share his view that the Government is closer to the banks than citizens.  I do not have bankers queuing up weekly outside my clinic for a chat, whereas I have many families visit me who are struggling to pay their debts.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Although times are not easy, we have lived through difficult times before.  Many Deputies remember previous bad times which we overcame.  We will do so again by showing strength and toughness, two of the defining characteristics of the people of this island.  The Government must also display these characteristics in order that we can meet the responsibility bestowed on us by those who voted for us.  We must take every possible measure, including implementing the proposals in the Keane report.  Deputy Durkan stated that some banks were being helpful.  In my experience many of them are not being helpful.  I join other Deputies in urging them to do everything possible to help out those who are in crisis.</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_398">It is not a secret that the Keane report has come as a bitter disappointment to the hundreds of thousands of individuals who are being crucified under the burden of mortgage debt.  I refer to those who are included in the statistics and others who are juggling expenses and bills as they try to hold their heads above water and ensure their properties do not go into arrears.  The first step to be taken in addressing a problem is to quantify its scale and the first flaw in the Keane report is its failure to do so.  Unless one understands the scale of a problem, one cannot address it.  The Keane report consciously sets out grossly to understate the scale of the mortgage crisis.  The figures cited indicate 45,000 households are in arrears of nine months or more.  We have also heard that between 7% and 11% of the mortgage book is in trouble.  From where do these figures come?  They were provided by the banks, the source of many of the problems with which we are grappling and for this reason they cannot be considered reliable.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">The sub-prime lenders have generally been excluded from the figures.  These are the companies which preyed on the most vulnerable and hard-pressed citizens.  In January 2011, for example, Start Mortgages had arrears on approximately 40% of the loans in its mortgage book.  This figure is far in excess of the figures cited in the Keane report.  The fact that 55,000 households are deemed to hold restructured mortgages is cited as if the problem had been somehow solved.  We all know that many of these 55,000 cases amount to little more than dressing up the problem.  Applying an interest only arrangement for six months buries the problem and it will re-emerge when the six-month period has elapsed.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Our starting point must be to accept that mortgage debt is a massive problem, which extends far beyond 100,000 households.  Hundreds of thousands of people are affected even on the basis of this figure.  The problem will not be addressed by the measures proposed in the Keane report and the fact that the Irish Banking Federation was the only organisation to welcome it tells its own story.  The report is more to do with the interests of the banks than those of home owners.  As others have stated, many of the groups working at the coalface providing assistance to home owners believe their views and the valid submissions they made to the process have not been taken on board.  The report has suffered greatly as a result and is simply not goodenough.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Having initially indicated that the Keane report would provide a solution, the Government is now presenting it as some form of discussion document.  This issue cannot be allowed to rest as to leave matters as they are would store up massive problems, not only for the individuals affected but for society as a whole.  As Deputies are aware, it is difficult for someone who is having mortgage difficulties to acknowledge the problems with which they are grappling because they view them as personal.  We must acknowledge that the problem of mortgage debt is one for society.  In addition to the consequences this debt has for individuals, failure to address it will hold back the economy for decades in a Japanese-type period of stagnation.  Ireland is already the most indebted country <i>per capita</i>.  A solution to our economic problems will not be found until we address the crippling debt under which people are burdened.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The starting point must be to keep people in their homes.  Apart from the obvious benefits to the individuals in question, the economic and social cost of any failure to keep people in their homes would be immense.  We cannot have any more cases of banks repossessing family homes and seeking to sell them for a price below what the mortgage holder could have afforded to pay.  Home owners and their families have been moved out of their communities and forced into bankruptcy at a cost to the State of tens of thousands of euro in rent supplement and social welfare payments.  Those days must be consigned to the past.  People must be allowed to remain in their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">As an absolute minimum, we must adopt the idea put forward by a number of groups, including New Beginning, that repayments be based on 35% of net disposable income.  This is the only logical and sustainable debt repayment figure.  Splitting the mortgage and warehousing a section of it, while an important idea, must not involve interest being applied to the warehoused element.  Where else would one be presented with the scenario outlined in the Keane report under which the banks would continue to receive interest on warehoused parts of mortgages and ultimately receive more money for them than they would have received if the original mortgage agreement had remained in place?  This is a ludicrous proposal given the background to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">The main question is what will happen to the part of the property which does not relate to its current value.  Without a debt write-down, we will not find a way out of the crisis.  It is completely wrong to use the term "debt forgiveness" as if home owners are a type of criminal.  The owners of family homes, as opposed to trophy homes, buy-to-let or second, third or fourth properties, are victims of the crisis.  The only argument made against the idea of a debt write-down in the current circumstances is that it would cost the banks more money, which is, of course, true.  If it does not cost the banks more money it will cost the home owners more money.  They do not have it so the banks will not get it in any case.  We must start by recognising that reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">I fully support the need to have a general write-down of all properties in negative equity.  People who purchased their homes between 2003 and 2007 paid an uneconomic price in a false market.  They were scandalously ripped off because the houses were not worth the prices paid.  For those people, their children or their grandchildren, carrying that debt for decades is unsustainable and will cripple this economy into the future.  As was noted, the banks have already been given between €10 billion and €14 billion to absorb some of these costs.  Some €29 billion was pumped into Anglo Irish Bank to absorb its problems.  We must also look at what was done for NAMA and the big developers here.  Billions of euros of loans for private individuals have effectively been parked.  Figures were given out showing that 180 individuals had loans of €62 billion.  The write-down of those debts has cost the banks — namely, the taxpayer — €36 billion in bank losses.  That private debt was transferred to the banks.  The very least that home owners deserve is the same treatment.  Unlike some of the speculators, who fuelled the economic crisis for which we are all now paying the price, home owners were always only victims in this situation into which they were encouraged and cajoled by banks and the establishment.  This is the only way to act and it must be done for all properties, not only those with regard to which people are currently struggling.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The argument has been made that because the taxpayer now owns the banks the debt will be transferred to the taxpayer.  However, we already paid that hit and the bondholders should take this one.  It should not be transferred to the taxpayer.  A key part of the problem for the Government in regard to this report is that it does not recognise reality.  The money is lost in any case.  These debts are unsustainable and people cannot afford to pay them.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Some other aspects of the report need to be addressed and should be referred to briefly.  The report mentions 100 extra advisers who are to enter a new set-up.  A point was made by MABS, with which I agree.  Why is this new arm not linked to the MABS structure?  MABS is clearly under significant pressure and needs extra resources.  Crucially, it also needs legislative support to back up the positions it takes.  Why is its role as an independent adviser to home owners not being enhanced rather than have an extra 100 advisers placed under a new guise, umbrella, quango, or whatever?  It does not make any sense.  We should tap into the expertise already in place.  More than anything, this shows the urgent need to bring forward the legislation on personal debt and bankruptcy.  There is now a virtual cottage industry of companies that entice people to register in Britain, declaring themselves bankrupt in that country.  These companies extort thousands of euros from people for a process that costs £500 for registration.  We must address that anomaly and introduce legislation akin to the British system which allows people to start again after a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">This report cannot be the end of this discussion.  It is a completely inadequate answer.  In his better moments, the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, would probably acknowledge this.  The real question is the next step in dealing with this issue.  The Keane report is not that.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Willie Penrose)</from>
          <p eId="para_409">This is one of the most important debates we will have in this Dáil.  Like many of my colleagues, I wish we did not need to have it.  I hope for the sake of young couples and families around the country we will need to have it only once.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Almost three years ago, in December 2008, the present Tánaiste, my party leader, Deputy Gilmore, described the mortgage arrears crisis as a ticking time-bomb.  The ticking grew steadily louder for many months and it has now exploded.  At the time, the previous Government chose to do what it had done for years when anyone raised a concern about the ballooning housing market.  It tried to shout him down and deny the existence of a grievous problem.  The problem of mortgage arrears is the most painful, most shameful and most acute legacy of the boom years.  The time has come when we can no longer keep kicking the problem down the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">This report contains wide-ranging, meaningful and comprehensive measures but does not purport to be the final word on the problem.  The Government is not holding it up as a panacea.  The problem is simply too complex, as Deputy Clare Daly noted.  We welcome inputs and contributions from elsewhere, whether in this House or beyond.  I met the New Beginnings group this week and was keen to examine its proposed solution which is underpinned by key principles that should be explored and evaluated.  No solution to the mortgage arrears process should be discounted.  Perhaps the most important lesson to be learned from this report is that there is no one solution.  It will take a wide range of measures to even begin to resolve this most intractable problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">We need to be realistic.  We should avoid irresponsible claims that there are easy solutions — there are not.  For every solution proposed there are consequences — for the Exchequer, the taxpayer and other mortgage holders, for people who decided not to buy a home and for banks which have a significant role to play in resolving this issue.  There is a collective responsibility to deal with the problem.  We cannot cut loose those whose lives have been devastated by chronic arrears.  They cannot be left to sink or swim without assistance.  It is right that all of us, as a society,  should contribute and it is in our national economic interests that we should do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">To that end the report sets out a range of recommendations, targeting households with arrears problems of varying degrees.  Mercifully, not all households in arrears will be in that position permanently.  Many will recover and, in time, will return to paying their way.  These households do not need and would not want the State to intervene permanently in their housing circumstances.  Forbearance will work for some of these households and although these are worrying times for them many will emerge on the other side given time and proper breathing space.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Others with more pervasive arrears problems will need forbearance and temporary income support from the State through mortgage interest supplement.  Demand for this support has, as one would expect, grown very considerably in recent years and has increased more than fourfold since 2007.  It will continue to play an important part in supporting people in their efforts to keep the show on the road and remain home owners, although it must be recognised as having limitations.  For some householders, being a mortgage holder and a home owner is no longer sustainable. It gives me no pleasure to say that but it is a fact and must be recognised.  Only when we recognise this painful fact can we begin properly to plan solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Even in advance of the report, my officials had been working on possible mortgage-to-rent schemes, identifying two variations.  These will target householders whose mortgages are unsustainable and who meet social housing eligibility requirements.  Under each scheme the household will get to remain in the family home although it will no longer be the owner.  Instead, ownership will transfer either to a housing association or to the bank which provided the mortgage originally.  Where a housing association becomes the owner it will do so by acquiring the house at market value from the bank after the house has been voluntarily surrendered by the mortgagee.  A discount will apply to reflect the benefit to the bank of avoiding legal costs.  The acquisition will be financed through a mixture of loan finance, provided by the bank, and from Exchequer funding.  The householder will move from being a home owner to being a social housing tenant, paying a differential rent based on his or her new household circumstances, and the housing association will lease the property to the relevant local authority.  Under the bank-owned option, the same voluntary surrender process will take place but this time the bank will acquire the house itself which it will then lease to the relevant local authority on a long-term basis.  The household will pay a differential rent as under the first option.  These will be extremely helpful measures for many households that are currently facing a very uncertain future.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">I want to achieve the maximum impact with these schemes and am already moving to set them up on a pilot basis.  The pilot schemes will be based in a single local authority area and will involve one housing association and one bank.  The pilot phase needs to be sharp and focused so that bumps or issues which arise can be quickly ironed out ahead of wider implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has set out reforms in her area.   The establishment of a dedicated mortgage support and advice function will be critical to households facing one of the most difficult crises they will ever experience.  In the midst of the pain and anguish people are enduring, it is impossible to put a price on independent impartial advice to help them consider their options and make the right choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Reform of Ireland's archaic legislation is also required to bring about a resolution of the bankruptcy and personal insolvency regime.  The dynamic of the relationship between lender and mortgage holder must change if the arrears problem is to be dealt with effectively and compassionately.  Not all cases should go through the courts because only lawyers will benefit from this.  What is required is a non-judicial settlement option to stand alongside reformed and modernised bankruptcy laws.  These legislative interventions must be made either in conjunction with or prior to any ultimate solution in respect of this matter.  The entire thrust of policy must be aimed at ensuring that people who find themselves in difficulty will retain a roof over their heads and that the threat of their losing their homes will be removed.  People must be allowed to continue to live in some degree of comfort.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">I would like to explore, in the context of the mortgage-to-rent schemes, situations to which other Members have referred, even outside the House in the course of private conversations.  One Member inquired as to what would happen if a person who is a tenant or who has a long-term leasing arrangement recovered financially after a period of three or four years.  We must explore the options available for such individuals.  After a certain period, those who are currently social housing tenants acquire tenant purchase rights.  We must explore all of these matters and that is why the scheme should be initiated on a pilot basis in order that it might be amended as we proceed.  As already stated, we should not be blind to ideas from any side of the House or to those offered by people outside it, such as individuals who have served as local authority representatives for many years.  Their wisdom with regard to how we might identify a solution to this massive problem should not be dismissed.  Indeed, it should be incorporated within the overall process.  I would be keen to examine and evaluate the merits of any proposal aimed at resolving this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">We have made clear the importance we attach to dealing with this issue comprehensively and promptly.  We have also tried to approach the problem in a responsible and mature way, seeking to avoid raising unrealistic expectations regarding what will and will not be possible.  It bears repeating that there are no easy solutions.  We are open to all contributions to the debate and will consider all proposals and act on those which have merit and which stand up to scrutiny.  This is not a time for anyone to take to the trenches in defence of narrow sectoral or political interests.  Neither is it a time to reject solutions because they have not been tried before.  We need to be bold and brave.  We must examine every option and if it can contribute to solving the problem then we should try it.  As stated earlier, these are not times for the faint-hearted.  We must be bold, brave, imaginative and creative.  However, we must also display compassion and a sense of equity, fairness and balance.  In that context, I hope we will not be found wanting.</p>

          <from>Deputy Stephen Donnelly</from>
          <p eId="para_421">Earlier this week I sat down with one of my constituents at her kitchen table to discuss her situation.  For the purposes of this example, I will refer to her as Laura.  The woman in question is self-employed, has worked for more than 20 years and has paid her taxes.  She is a single mother with a daughter in university and, during the boom, she bought a nice semi-detached house in a new estate in Wicklow.  Her business clientele comprises mainly young professionals.  She was doing fine but, as is the case with many of our constituents, when the recession hit, she was badly affected.  In the run-up to the budget of 2010, people became very concerned and stopped spending money.  Laura informed me that as this year's general election was approaching, people again stopped spending and, as a result, she fell into arrears for the first time.  She said she immediately went to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, which negotiated a six-month agreement with her bank.  She is now back in arrears because the domestic economy remains depressed.  People are again not spending money because they are concerned about what the forthcoming budget will contain.  Laura is now in negative equity to the tune of between €200,000 to €300,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Three days prior to the end of the six-month agreement to which I refer, multiple branches of the bank with which Laura has her business began to telephone her place of work several times each day to inquire what she intended to do to meet her repayments.  Before the end of the agreement, one of the bank's debt collectors called to her front door.  When she arrived home that day, her daughter handed her a letter from the bank which basically said "We need to talk".  It was then that my office first heard from her.  I am sure the Minister of State has had experiences similar to mine in this regard.  Laura is absolutely distraught, she has not been sleeping and she does not know what she is going to do in respect of her business.  She feels humiliated.  What really struck a chord with me was when she said she feels violated by what her bank has done.  Laura went back to MABS but was informed that it does not have the capacity to help her any further and that she is on her own.  She has called in favours with several people and asked them to support her as she attempts to renegotiate with the bank this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">It is fair to state that every Member of the House wants to solve situations such as that to which I refer.  The obvious question that arises relates to why we cannot just write down Laura's mortgage.  If she owes €500,000 but can only make repayments in respect of an amount of €300,000, why not just write off the remaining €200,000?  If we could afford to do this, it would be a great solution because Laura would be economically productive again, would be able to invest in her daughter's future, would be able to pay the bank as much as possible and would be able to get on with her life.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Two arguments are repeatedly put forward with regard to why we cannot write down mortgages.  These have merit but they need to be challenged.  The first argument — which I do not accept — relates to moral hazard and is continually put forward in the Keane report.  There is a notion abroad that a swathe of mortgage holders are waiting for the opportunity to make gains against the system and obtain write-downs they do not need.  There are two aspects to the moral hazard argument.  The first of these is that if we write down Laura's debt, she might borrow again, purchase a bigger house and try to get back to the position she previously occupied.  The second interpretation is that other people monitoring her situation might decide to work less and reduce their incomes to try to create a false case and obtain a write-down.  I do not believe that the first of these aspects of the moral hazard argument is credible.  The second is credible but it can be controlled through legislation and by dealing with matters case by case.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The second argument put forward in respect of not allowing mortgage write-downs is that we cannot afford them.  The belief is that we own the banks and that, therefore, any surrender by the banks of a call on a loan would essentially mean a hit to the State.  In that context, I am obliged to state that we do not own all of the banks.  We own one or two banks in full and we own parts of a number of others.  However, there are also banks which are extremely active in the Irish mortgage market which we do not own at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">There is a second aspect to the argument which states that we cannot afford write-downs, namely, what will happen if we do not proceed with them?  I return to the case of Laura.  If she cannot obtain a write-down, she will find herself involved in bankruptcy proceedings, the bank will inevitably seek to repossess her house and the State will be obliged to rehouse her.  She may not work again and may not be in a position to invest in her daughter's future.  As a result, there is an immediate cash cost and a longer-term social cost to not allowing write-downs.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">What we were all seeking from the Keane report was suggestions with regard to how Laura, and the tens or hundreds of thousands of others who are in similar situations, might be provided with assistance.  In referring to the report, the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, used the phrase "wide-ranging, meaningful and comprehensive".  While there are parts of the report with which I am in absolute agreement, especially the emphasis placed on reforming the bankruptcy regime, I do not believe that it is, in its entirety, wide-ranging, meaningful or comprehensive.  None of the solutions offered in the report supports the principle of real burden sharing.  The split mortgage and mortgage-to-rent models protect, in so far as is possible, the value of mortgages for the banks.  They do not offer solutions for those who purchased houses for €500,000 but which are now valued at €300,000.  These people are in a situation which is unsustainable.  The banks will inform those to whom I refer that they should not have borrowed the money and that it should not have been given to them in the first instance.  The banks may have given a 100% mortgage or six, seven or eight times a person's income for a mortgage.  The banks were the experts and knew the property market was overheated and inevitably property prices would come down, so they are also at fault and should share the cost.  There is nothing in the Keane report to suggest that will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform met representatives of New Beginning, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, the Citizens Information Board and Mr. Keane.  I was impressed with Mr. Keane's presentation but it is fair to say that the burden sharing he referred to is the same type of burden sharing that the people from the banks referred to when they were before the committee.  Essentially, the banks would make a provision on their balance sheet because they did not believe they would get everything back from debtors but that would not be passed to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">The numbers are important in this regard.  After asking the question several times of the people from AIB and Bank of Ireland in the finance committee, two important figures emerged.  For AIB, the total value of loans to which it surrendered any legal claim was €600,000.  We have given AIB approximately €3 billion to deal with distressed mortgages and the bank has made a provision for approximately €836 million.  It has passed on €600,000 of that.  Representatives of Bank of Ireland were asked the question approximately six times at the committee and it took an intervention from the Chairman to force them to answer.  When we found out the answer, we were not surprised as the figure was zero, or not a single penny.  The mindset of the banks is clear: they will make provisions on their own balance because it is prudent accounting but they will go after debtors for everything they can get.  The banks do not accept responsibility and although they accept they must deal with the financial consequences, they do not accept any moral responsibility or burden sharing.  That is where the Keane report falls down.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I was going to spend most of my time addressing the shortcomings of the report but I am happy that there seems to be a growing consensus in the Houses that although the Keane report has some useful ideas, it is far from enough.  I hope my perception is correct.  Rather than spend my time addressing the shortcomings of the Keane report, which have been laid out very well by Members in the House, I offer ideas, some of which I submitted for consideration in the formulation of the Keane report.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">The first is a debt for equity swap which is critically based on the purchase price of the property.  If a house, for example, cost €600,000 and is worth €400,000 now, a debt for equity swap would lead to the bank writing down the mortgage by €200,000, and for that it gets €200,000 off the purchase price, or a third of the house.  Working this process benefits the bank because the mortgage becomes sustainable for the mortgage holder, as it can be paid down, and the bank would take a relatively small hit.  The mortgage holder would be kept in the house and although he or she would still be in negative equity, the mortgage would be sustainable and could be paid off.  I submit that proposal for consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">A second idea is not mine but comes from a Government party Member, although I will not say who because I am not sure if he has announced it.  We should find a mechanism to treat the negative equity portion of a mortgage as a pension contribution.  In effect, it is a negative contribution and until the negative equity is paid off, a person cannot start saving for a pension.  By treating it as a pension contribution, it becomes tax deductible.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I will submit more ideas to the Minister.  Payments should be set at 30% to 35% of what a household can achieve and bankruptcy laws should be implemented very quickly.  There is an interesting mechanism used in the US where the banks are given tax credits for write-downs.  An idea was mentioned by Ross Maguire at the finance committee yesterday that could be implemented immediately.  We could quickly pass legislation giving the courts discretion in cases where the banks have taken mortgage holders to court.  Currently, the banks want to but are not able to apply discretion and we could bring in a law to allow them do so very quickly.  I would like the Minister to consider setting up a cross-party working group to pull in elements of the Keane report and what we have heard in the finance committee and in the Dáil before formulating proposals.</p>

          <p eId="para_434">We are almost at the time allocated for questions to the Minister.  There are a couple of speakers offering, Deputies Kyne, Fitzpatrick and Ó Snodaigh, and they will have to wait until the next time when they will be the first speakers.  However, I offer them the opportunity now to ask questions first.  As they do not wish to avail of the opportunity, we will proceed with questions to the Minister, the first being from Deputy Tóibín.</p>

          <p eId="para_435">The Keane report has been described as minimalist in its approach to the growing crisis.  Sinn Féin's view is that it will provide little meaningful assistance to the hundreds of thousands of families currently unable to pay their mortgages.  It is difficult to believe that the report does not even consider, let alone advocate, targeted debt restructuring in which mortgage write-downs would be exchanged for an equity share of the property.  Given the level of recapitalisation in the banks recently, it is clear they have a capacity to absorb a portion of losses arising from the mortgage crisis.  This point was accepted by the Central Bank Governor, Mr. Honohan, during an Oireachtas finance committee meeting.  Will the Minister explain why this option was not even considered and what the Government's objections are to a targeted use of instruments like a debt for equity swap to enable people to remain in the family home?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_214">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
          <p eId="para_436">I thank everyone for their contributions to the debate.  The Keane committee did a great deal and worked through the holiday period to meet very tight deadlines set down by the economic management committee of the Cabinet.  I thank the Keane committee members for their hard work in producing the report.  It is not a minimalist report and there are very good ideas in it.  The committee was asked to address the problem and those involved were independent in the exercise of their powers of analysis and in reporting.  Some of what is contained in the report does not particularly suit the Government, advising in one case against an element in the programme for Government, as many Members have pointed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The report is independent and has been published for consideration.  As I originally promised, we brought it into the House as quickly as possible so that everyone could share the findings.  In parallel, outside groups with a contribution to make to the debate were invited before the finance committee.  We will examine the contributions made by outside groups and, by combing the record, take careful note of proposals for solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I am not ruling out debt for equity but there is a problem with facile solutions, although I am not saying it is facile.  We will study the process.  One of the models in the report, for example, mentions a need for further analysis in the context of the solutions around the warehoused part of the split mortgage.  If a mortgage is being split, and the report indicates further analysis should be done, this is a pointer that considerations for equity for the part not being dealt with could be valid.  We must analyse such matters before returning to the House and announcing Government intentions.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">We must always remember that there is no borrower without a lender and no debt without a creditor.  We have capitalised and have the majority share in most of the banks, which is relevant to mortgages.  It is true to say that we have 98% of AIB and 15% of Bank of Ireland, along with many preference shares and much money lost by the previous Government in there as well.  There are real lending agencies that underpin the housing market, such as the building societies.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Irish Nationwide, EBS and Permanent TSB are all either out of business or impaired in one way or another and have had to be recapitalised.  The three big mortgage names among the building societies are either out of business, like Irish Nationwide, or in State hands.  If one decides to write off debt, a lot of the time one is transferring it from the mortgage holder to the taxpayer because at the end of the day, that is what happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">Deputy Boyd Barrett made a great plea and challenged the Central Bank's figures.  He said the cost of impaired mortgages is not €14 billion, that when one examines the figures one can reduce them to €8.5 billion.  Let us consider €8.5 billion for a Deputy who cannot take the pressure of budgetary adjustments of about half that size.  Where are we going to get the money?  If we impose that on the banks the taxpayer must immediately put further capital into the banks.  It is not an easy solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I am very interested in the opinion of Deputies because the one thing about them is that they are meeting people all the time who have difficulty.  They understand individual cases and, frequently, the nuances of those cases.  There are other theoretical commentators who do not understand what they are talking about a lot of the time.  They are very good on the theory but they are not very good on the practical examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">One could ask where we are to go from here.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is working on the insolvency legislation.  We have accepted that the Fianna Fáil-sponsored Bill on insolvency which is based on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission will move on to Committee Stage.  Independently, the Minister is bringing forward his own insolvency legislation.  He is not delaying on it.  He nearly has the heads of the Bill ready.  We are within weeks of them being ready and being able to move on to the drafting stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Much focus has been placed on people continuing to live in their own homes and their status changing from owner-occupiers to tenants of a local authority or housing agency.  That is the back-stop.  That is the last case scenario.  Mr. Keane recommends a range of interventions in between where people will continue to own their houses.  Various arrangements will be made with them through the banks.  There is no one solution but there are a number of things in the report that provide solutions for individual cases.  If Members wish to add to those solutions, I make the commitment that we will take the proposals, analyse them and see whether they fit.  When we come back in a couple of weeks we will put a portfolio of possible solutions for individual cases with impaired mortgages.  We all know the scale of the problem and we all know the need for solutions.  Many of the problems are not easily addressed but we will do our best.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín</from>
          <p eId="para_445">Governor Honohan said there was capacity to deal with a debt for equity swap within the system.  My question was what the Minister's objections are to that.  A criticism of the Keane report is that its approach is to just leave it to the banks.  FLAC has said there is an unwillingness within the Government to impose solutions on the banks.  Considering the failure of lenders to respond adequately so far, what makes the Minister think that things are going to change in that regard?  Does it mean that the Government has abandoned the programme for Government initiatives that were discussed earlier?</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_446">The Deputy's question was whether I would consider debt for equity.  I am saying that Mr. Keane has allowed for a consideration of debt for equity in the residual portion of the warehoused mortgage if a split mortgage is the solution.  However, we must do further analysis and consideration of that approach.  The difficulty with equity stakes is that much of the time there is no equity.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_448">That is the problem.  If one has a situation where a mortgage is impaired and if it has also gone into negative equity and the bank is holding the deeds against the full mortgage, any swapping around with equity is the bank subdividing its own collateral.  The problem is that a lot of the time there is no equity to play with, but sometimes there is, and what I am saying is that there are a range of possible solutions.  Where we think the debt for equity solution fits in is if the initial decision is to do a split mortgage which then raises the question of how to deal with the bit of the mortgage that is warehoused.  Rather than accumulating compound interest, as Deputy Durkan said, there may be a solution in having an equity basis for that.  I am not rejecting Deputy Tóibín's idea.  I am just saying we will explore it and see whether we can work through it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_219">
          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_449">I thank the Minister for being present and responding to the questions.  I acknowledge that the Government has agreed to accept the Second Reading of the Private Member's Bill yesterday.  The public would like to see the House working collectively rather than points-scoring in a partisan fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Does the Minister not accept that one cannot just deal with mortgage debt on its own?  Anyone with a mortgage debt will also have many other debts.  The report is an important input into the debate but it is only an input.  I accept the Minister is open to other proposals.  Personal debt must be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">There is a big emphasis in the report, because it is in the terms of reference, on mortgage interest relief.  Approximately 18,000 people benefit from mortgage interest relief but there are probably 60,000 or 70,000 people on rent supplement issued through social welfare payments, the local authorities and the HSE.  That is part of the funding the Exchequer is providing towards housing.  That was not dealt with in the report but it is part of the mix.  It does not relate to people with mortgages but it is part of the mix of funding the State provides.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">Will the Minister indicate how he sees the approximately €5 billion, which has been provided for the banks to allow for mortgages that will be in difficulty over the next ten years, trickling down to individual customers?  It is fine for them to have a general figure but it must be made specific to individual customers somewhere along the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Does the Minister consider that there needs to be an intermediary between the bank and individuals because the relationship between them is unequal?  People need an intermediary to help them.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">People were often shocked to hear about 100% mortgages.  The Minister and I are aware from our constituency clinics that banks were giving out 130% mortgages.  They gave out the full value of the house, the cost of furnishing it and the cost of the wedding and honeymoon.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_458">That happened.  I want people to know.  People got credit cards and other bills added together.  The situation is that clearly there was irresponsible lending by the banks.  I am only talking on a case-by-case basis.  I know one cannot generalise.  I refer to cases where banks gave out loans they should not have given out based on projected incomes that were never going to materialise.  They calculated that each young person to whom they gave a loan would take in three tenants at €10,000 a year each and they factored in a make-believe extra income of €30,000.  That is what happened in the banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_460">In those cases the banks should be made to pay a heavier contribution to resolving the problem because the loans are unsustainable.  I do not blame the young 20 year olds who took out such loans.  When one is dealing with a big financial institution that is in business for donkey's years, one expects it to know that end of the business.  The banks in those cases should pay a heavier contribution to resolving such debts.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_461">One of the ironies is that in trying to punish a bank that has been totally recapitalised by the taxpayer, one ends up punishing oneself and all one's tax paying colleagues.  Not everything can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The mortgage interest supplement is a very good scheme that is keeping many people out of major difficulties, but it was designed as temporary assistance for people in temporary difficulty.  What we must do is move from a temporary situation to a permanent solution for people who are not in temporary difficulty and where it is clear that they will be in difficulty for years.  That is why we have the alternatives as the final back-stop where a person on mortgage interest supplement is getting a lot of money from the State already.  In future, an arrangement will be entered into between the local authority and the lender and it will become a social house.  The person who is the mortgage holder will have a change of status from owner-occupier to tenant but will remain in the house.  That has obvious social benefits.  Someone asked who will decide the rent.  The rent regime will be the same as that which applies to social housing.  It will be no different from how rent is decided for other local authority tenants.  In regard to whether an individual will ever get an opportunity to buy back his or her house, a buy-back arrangement from the original lender is not envisaged but he or she will benefit from the normal house purchase schemes applying to local authorities.  Those of us who are familiar with such schemes will agree they are more beneficial than any arrangement that might be made with a lender.  Many people thought our only aim was to turn owners into tenants.  That will only be done in a worst case scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The Deputy is correct about taking into account the entire quantum of debt because, in addition to mortgages, people can also have credit card debts, short-term credit and credit union loans.  If the arrangement with the local authority is the end of a long line of options, the first option is solvency legislation.  The insolvency and bankruptcy legislation will provide for managing the entirety of an individual's debt.  Prior to someone becoming bankrupt or insolvent, the entire quantum of debt will have to be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Some people dismissed the Keane report without reading it.  That is normal among outside commentators, although not among the Members of this House.  If we can put in place the various recommendations of the report and add on to them some of the ideas that Deputies and other agencies have suggested, we will go a distance towards a perfect solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The prudential capital assessment review, which formed part of the Central Bank's financial measures programme, provides for an annual stress test of the capital resources of the domestic banks under a given stress scenario.  The loan loss exercise in the financial measures programme, which includes estimated losses on residential mortgages, assesses the loan losses banks might experience under the base and adverse stress scenario over a three-year period and a loan lifetime horizon.  The Central Bank's three-year projected base loss for the Irish residential mortgage loan book is estimated at €5.8 billion, while the adverse scenario is in excess of €9 billion.  Under the PCAR requirement, the banks will be capitalised to meet the Central Bank's projected three-year stress losses.  In regard to how bank recapitalisation trickles down to dealing with impaired mortgages, the banks will negotiate case by case.  As the expected losses under stress are reflected in the overall figures, provision is made for writing down debts but this will be done according to the features of individual cases.</p>

Given that its guiding principles do not say anything about the culpability of bankers, developers or Fianna Fáil politicians, it is starting from the wrong point.  Is it not outrageous that the report states there should be no entitlement to particular solutions, that it is inevitable that some will lose their homes and that people should keep their homes "where appropriate"?  The latter statement implies there are times when it is appropriate that a person should not keep his or home and that one of the problems we have to address is inappropriate mortgage holder behaviour.

          <p eId="para_502">I asked the Keane group to report by the end of September.  It did that.  It did not involve outside bodies because I wanted an initial blueprint to put before the House so we would have some kind of framework for action.  It is not true to say the group ignored the banks, or took the side of the banks.  Like much of the language of the public service, the group's language is unemotional.  If one examines the report closely, one will see it is not in favour of the bankers.  In effect, the group's proposals change the balance between mortgage holders and bankers.  That is an essential piece of placement that has to be done at the start.  The report recommends a fundamental reform of the relationship between the lender and the borrower.  That is the key concept that is underpinning the proposals.  Many of the changes suggested in the report will place additional constraints on the institutions.  The institutions will not like the proposed bankruptcy reform, for example.  Do Deputies think the institutions want people to be able to work their way out of bankruptcy in three years?</p>

          <p eId="para_506">Under the mortgage-to-rent scheme, the bank will have to retain property and lease and manage it.  They will not welcome that.  Does the Deputy think the banks want to release property to local authorities while maintaining ownership of it?  Rather than the banks collecting mortgage repayments, the local authorities will be collecting rent.  When one examines the individual proposals, one sees the banks are not getting a free run here.  The split mortgage system, for example, will mean the banks have to amend the mortgage repayment schedules of a number of their customers.  They will have to agree to new arrangements.  As a result of the independent mortgage function, the cost of which the banks will have to meet, they will have to contend with more informed distressed clients.  I made a point to Deputy Sean Fleming about getting 100 people with experience to represent people with impaired mortgages.  When one goes through the report, one will see the recommendation that the banks, rather than the taxpayer, should be levied for the cost of this new service.  Does the House think the banks are welcoming that?  Of course they are not.  The process is governed by the protections included in the mortgage arrears resolution process, which is overseen by the Central Bank.  The mortgage arrears procedures are laid down by the Central Bank.  I would like to kill another criticism by pointing out that the mortgage arrears procedures set down and applied by the Central Bank apply to foreign banks as well as domestic banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_510">It comes together with the Central Bank's procedures.  There is a pretty strong policy unit in the Department of Finance.  We brought in the expertise that was in the National Treasury Management Agency.  There is a banking policy unit there now.  We are going to drive these recommendations.  I am not saying these are the only recommendations we are going to drive.  Mr. Keane did a very good job in an unemotional way.  His group produced a series of workable proposals.  If we can get them moving forward, they will help many people.  It is not a complete answer.  If any of the Deputies opposite can come up with solutions that I can add onto this list, I will take them on board.  We will analyse them.  If they are workable, we will add them on.  We will put them into the portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">We are not in the business of coming in here just for the sake of talking about it.  This has to move forward.  This has to move to interventions very quickly.  We already have a commitment from the Minister for Justice and Equality, who has been told to prioritise the insolvency and bankruptcy legislation.  He is doing that.  He is far up the road with it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, is already designing two pilot schemes on local authority involvement and housing agency involvement.  The Department of Finance has been instructed to engage with the banks immediately to make preparations for them to use the portfolio policy instruments when they are resolving mortgage situations.  There are other things we have to do.  I have not yet figured out how we will recruit 100 experts, how they will fit in and how they will relate to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  The concept is very clear.  When we move it along, move out of the debate and consider the outside representations that have been made, we will put an implementation group in place and go forward with it.  This is practical stuff.  This is not theory.  We have to move on it.  All Deputies know the difficulties families are facing, so we have to move on it.</p>

Obviously, it is not good for borrowers when the interest on their borrowings is continuing to increase, and the banks suffer when it comes to funding costs because the mortgages are not secured.  I know the issue relates to the Department of Justice and Equality.  If the Minister has some information on it, perhaps he can give it in his response.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">The Keane report does not relate to buy-to-let mortgages.  Will there be a second Keane report to deal with that?  We are four years down the road.  This country has been in recession for some time.  The real economy is suffering.  Decisions on arrears are made by bankers.  I hope this report offers some hope to struggling home owners.  It is imperative that we see action from the banks in relation to sorting out the situations of home owners who find themselves in arrears.</p>

          <p eId="para_515">There is no commitment or intention to have a second Keane report that would consider the rental end of the market.  There are problems in that regard.

          <p eId="para_517">Certainly, I do not see any particular reduction in rents within a couple of miles of this place.  The buy-to-rent market in certain parts of the country has gone very well.  There are problems with the buy-to-rent market to the extent that some of the development was driven by tax breaks.  The main prop when some blocks of apartments were being developed was a tax break.  They were not really run on business grounds at all.  There are difficulties in that regard.  If people are in the business of risk, I do not think the taxpayer has to go in on every occasion to bail them out if the risk goes wrong.</p>

          <p eId="para_523">The Minister referred to the 100 new experts and how they would relate to and consult MABS which I know has issues with the proposals made.  I note, for example, that there is no MABS office in Lucan and that its offices tend to be in locations chosen in line with the Celtic tiger economy.  There are no offices in many towns and villages in which many people have recently lost jobs or got into difficulty.  Therefore, changes are needed in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, stated that under the mortgage-to-rent schemes, a property would be bought at the market value with a discount.  Will the discount reflect the subsidy the banks have received, including for recapitalisation, which allowed for a debt write-off?</p>
          <p eId="para_525">I made the point earlier that there did not appear to be any scheme similar to the shared ownership scheme.  I would have thought this would be one of the solutions, given that not everybody will give up his or her home.  Some will get back on track and own their homes in the long term.  I accept that there were problems with the shared ownership scheme.  Deputy Clare Daly has mentioned that if people were given two distinct payments such as rent and interest payments under the shared ownership scheme, the amount they had to pay was prohibitive, with the result that many got out of the scheme as quickly as possible.  It is very important that the schemes put in place do not leave participants with unsustainable repayments if they have to pay rent and also keep a certain amount of equity in the property.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">These are the questions I would like to have answered.  Does the Minister have proposals in regard to shared ownership?  Will the discounts take into account what the banks have received in regard to recapitalisation?  Will there be consultation with MABS and changes to the spread of offices?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" eId="spk_277" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_527">I will deal with the questions in reverse order.  The shared ownership scheme involved a type of split mortgage, with the local authority taking an equity share.  It is not a million miles from the solutions we are proposing.  An examination of that model might offer a way of structuring the split mortgage subsequently.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The Deputy referred to the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose.  The reason he is proceeding by putting pilot schemes in place is to work out the detail.  We can see many difficulties would arise, but we will probably find solutions by trying out practical examples and testing them in practice rather than in theory.  We hope many of the difficulties indicated by the Deputy will be resolved as the Minister of State moves through a tranche of homes with owners on a pilot basis before schemes are firmed up.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">On the absence of MABS offices, I do not think we will attach the experts or interlocutors acting on behalf of householders to MABS offices.  There might perhaps be an arrangement where cases may be referred by a MABS office to certain individuals in certain areas who will do the negotiations with the lending agency on behalf of the householder.  While I am not sure how we will structure it legally — we are trying to figure this out — it does not seem to be an insurmountable obstacle.  One would not need a lot of face-to-face connections, as much of the process will be based on documentation.  If there is somebody with experience in accountancy who understands the mortgage business and receives the file, it should be possible to negotiate on the basis of what is in the file having met the householder for a short interview.  It will be something along these lines, but the Deputy should not tie me to what I am saying.  I am exploring the issue by having a conversation with her.  We will work through it to see what comes out of it.  However, we are not going to keep talking about it; rather, we are going to do it.  We will test it to see if it will work.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_532">We are talking about the interdepartmental mortgage arrears working group.  Therefore, one would have expected to see Departments represented on it, but the AIB, the EBS and the Central Bank were all included.  Essentially, this skewed it in a particular direction.  It should have involved Departments plus the banks and the people who are the victims in all of this.  Does the Minister agree that the report is much less satisfactory as a consequence of not having that balance and not including organisations such as MABS and New Beginnings?</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I am confused about what the Minister intends to do with the interlocutors.  Timing appears to be very important in terms of when, for example, the new bankruptcy or insolvency laws will be introduced.  The report states on page 17:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_534">The State currently has no infrastructure or resources in place to run a non-judicial debt settlement process.  This is likely to be very complex and take time to implement.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Is it intended to put in place such a system?  I am not at all clear on what is intended.  It is one thing to think about solutions and another to think about how they will be practically implemented.  In the absence of having a mechanism in place, is this issue being worked on?  If so, will it require legislation?  Are there practical arrangements in hiring people?  Are there institutional arrangements that need to be made?  This raises questions, but it does not give us a very good insight into possible solutions because, without such a mechanism, I cannot see how whatever solutions are arrived at can be rolled out in a way that would give certainty.  That is the primary issue I would like to have addressed.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_536">The composition of the group represented a pragmatic arrangement.  Mr. Keane has been seconded from KPMG to the Department of Finance for some time.  He is primarily an accountant with necessary expertise.  Therefore, we put him in as leader of the group.  There were officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government because they had expertise and responsibility for housing provision, in particular social housing.  There were officials from the Department of Social Protection as they had connections with mortgage interest supplement and so on and realised the difficulties families got into.  Their expertise was valuable.  The Department of Justice and Equality has officials working on insolvency and bankruptcy legislation.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was involved because all of this had cost implications and it was represented to monitor them.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">As a previous speaker rightly said, this was a group of public servants and, while they had their own mortgages, they did not deal with impaired mortgages in their working day.  Therefore, it was very important that we accessed individuals who dealt with mortgages, including the issues of the granting of mortgages and impaired mortgages.  Allied Irish Banks and the EBS are now in the one group, of which the State owns between 98% and 99%.  We got two individuals in from the mortgage department because we needed particular expertise in order that that theory could be tested against the practice.  It was not that they were given an inside track, it was just that we needed their expertise and Mr. Keane needed their expertise when he was drawing up the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">To revert to Deputy Tuffy's question, which the Deputy has repeated in a different way, the Keane report suggests in respect of advisers that they "should operate in 3 to 4 regional clusters in order to ensure that expertise and knowledge is captured and shared".  The report also recommends the linking of such clusters to MABS offices.  It suggests:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_539">The clusters could be legally part of MABS but would not have to be.  However it would be important that there is a link to the MABS network to ensure that mortgage holders know how to access the advice.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_540">Strict operating protocols would need to be enforced between MABS and these mortgage support clusters.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_541">It would be envisaged that the need for this function would be [limited in] time [to] perhaps 3 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">In respect of its scale, the report goes on to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_543">It is very difficult to determine the number of people that will need this support.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_544">Given that mortgage lenders estimate that they collectively require over 600 people in their Arrears Support Units it would be safe to assume that over 100 independent advisors would be needed in the first instance.  However it would be quite likely that [the] number [would] increase in time.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Moreover, "The skills required would include financial, accounting and legal", and with regard to the funding of the group, Keane recommended the "funding for this function should be provided by mortgage lenders".</p>
          <p eId="para_546">In other words, it is not just a suggestion but is fairly well fleshed out or filled out in the report itself.  My point is I do not regard anything Mr. Keane recommends as being the final say on the issue.  I want to hear what Deputies and outside groups think, after which I will bring proposals for the Government as well as an implementation mechanism to get this in place as quickly as possible.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_559">I wrote to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, on 20 July 2011 regarding this issue, which pertains to the unprecedented flooding in the autumn of 2009.  After that flooding, many residual issues remained.  In the first instance, as the Minister of State is aware, the then Government put in place humanitarian aid, which was made available expeditiously.  However, during my term as Minister for Social Protection, two main issues remained to be resolved.  The first was the relocation and the second was ensuring that those who would not be relocated would be provided with insurance for their houses.  In December 2010, two memoranda were brought to Government.  One put aside €4 million for relocation for up to 20 houses and it was clearly understood that if that number rose to 23, 24 or 27 houses, it would not be an issue.  I understand that in recent weeks, offers of relocation have been made.  I am very disappointed at the amount of time it has taken the current Government to implement that decision but I understand that some progress has been made in this regard at last.</p>
            <p eId="para_560">The other decision made in government dealt with the insurance issue.  The decision was that the Office of Public Works, OPW, would continue to progress spending on flood relief works for the worst affected areas in a structured way to reflect priorities, taking appropriate account of catchment flood risk assessment and management studies, as this approach represents the most cost-effective solution to the difficulties some people were having in getting insurance cover, in conjunction, where appropriate, with the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It went on to decide further that the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, an office now held by Deputy Brian Hayes, would take the lead role in the continuing discussions with the insurance industry about the provision of insurance cover in areas in which remedial works were being carried out, supported appropriately by the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Finance and would report back to the Government on progress.  Moreover, the Office of Public Works, which I reiterate is the responsibility of the Minister of State, was to put in place a regular and structured communication process with the Irish insurance industry to try to ensure a regular flow of information to insurance companies assessing the risk of flooding to homes and businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">Despite the fact that the Office of Public Works has stated to the people in various places, I will mention in particular Caherlea-Lisheenavalla and Carnmore in my constituency, that it will and has carried out works that will have a major impact on the possibility of flooding, those people still cannot get flood insurance for their houses.  This situation is absolutely ridiculous.  The Minister of State was charged with liaising with the industry.  The idea of the previous Administration was quite simple.  It was that the Minister of State would put it to the industry that in the event of the works being carried out and of clear progress being made, the industry would continue to insure these houses,  Such houses, which only flooded in extreme conditions in 2009 are no longer at high risk and even if there was a repetition of the kind of weather and flooding that took place in 2009, they would be highly unlikely to flood now because of the mitigating works.</p>
            <p eId="para_562">I expect the Minister of State will tell the House — I have it in a reply to a parliamentary question of 16 June 2011 — that this is all a matter for the insurance industry.  If the Minister of State believes that, he must believe in leprechauns and so on.  He is aware that the insurance industry, in the case of these small number of houses affected, will listen to the Government because the industry is and has been liaising with the Government since Fianna Fáil was in power in respect of the areas of priority in which works needed to be carried out.  As the Minister of State also is aware, in such a situation, it is easy to lay down that if the industry seeks the investment of millions of euro of State money by the Government in flood mitigation works, the Government in return would expect the industry to provide insurance to the small number of affected houses at which it has been decided that relocation was not needed because the risk would be so small.  It appears strange that the Government could not, through all this liaison work, ensure these households were provided with the insurance.</p>

By Government decision in December 2010 in respect of insurance matters, the previous Government agreed with the Office of Public Works that the latter would continue to progress spending on flood relief works for worst affected areas in a structured way to reflect priorities, taking appropriate account of catchment flood risk assessment and management studies, as this approach presents the most cost-effective solution to the current difficulties some people have experienced in trying to get insurance cover.  It also was agreed by that Government, of which the Deputy was a member, that the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works — the Deputy has rightly pointed out that I hold that office and I am fully aware of it — would take the lead role in the continuing discussions with the insurance industry about the provision of insurance cover in areas in which remedial works were being carried out, supported by the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Finance and the OPW.  Moreover, the OPW would put in place a regular and structured communication process with the Irish insurance industry to ensure a regular flow of information to insurance companies assessing the risk of flooding to homes and businesses.  It is noteworthy to recall that the previous Government, which included the Deputy, specifically decided not to pursue any other options to address the issue of insurance cover, which speaks for itself.</p>

            <p eId="para_571">Following my appointment as Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, I went to considerable lengths to inform myself regarding the problems and experiences of people and communities across the country which have suffered from flooding events in recent years.  This did not just happen since February despite all the pantomime performances we have had here today.  As well as witnessing the scale of damage experienced by many communities, the issue of flood insurance cover was raised in several areas.  I am aware of certain difficulties and concerns that some people are continuing to raise regarding obtaining flood insurance cover and I have moved to bring these to the attention of the Irish Insurance Federation.</p>
            <p eId="para_572">I met representatives of the Irish Insurance Federation, which was the first such meeting for a long time involving any Minister from this Government or the Deputy's Government and those discussions will continue.</p>

            <p eId="para_574">I met representatives of the Irish Insurance Federation in July of this year to explore the extent of these problems, which had been left to us to solve.  A further meeting with the IIF took place last month.  I am satisfied now that informational interchange between the OPW and the Irish Insurance Federation has been enhanced effectively to the extent that the Irish Insurance Federation has been provided not just with historical flood data, but is also being kept up to date with current minor and major flood alleviation and protection works and the up-to-date flood data analysis emerging from the catchment flood risk assessment and management programme.  In this regard, the Irish Insurance Federation has been provided with a full suite of documents relating to the preliminary flood risk assessment, following my engagement with its representatives, something that did not happen under the Deputy's watch.</p>
            <p eId="para_575">In addition the Irish Insurance Federation will be kept fully apprised of ongoing developments on the CFRAM programme and of relevant information arising from the associated CFRAM studies which are being commissioned across the six constituent river basin districts of the national river network.  I am reassured by the Irish Insurance Federation that this informational exchange is shared across the insurance industry and is of assistance to insurance companies in the assessment of applications for flood insurance cover.  However, where issues are brought to my attention such as those the Deputy has outlined, I will consistently raise them with it, now that we are getting close to having a protocol in place, which was not there in the past despite all the commentary otherwise.</p>
            <p eId="para_576">My focus at present, therefore, is to explore ways in which this very small cohort of applications, which may have their problems in obtaining flood insurance cover, can be reviewed to identify any particular difficulties which arise owing to inadequate information or market inertia.  I will continue my discussions with the Irish Insurance Federation to this end and I hope to be in a position to announce a satisfactory arrangement in this regard with the Irish Insurance Federation in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_577">On the issue of house relocation, as a former Minister for Social Protection, the Deputy will be well aware that this is a matter exclusively for that Department.  Where requested by the Department of Social Protection, my office has provided technical advice as to the sustainability of dwellings affected during the November 2009 flood events.  These advices have had necessary regard to the provision of flood protection and alleviation works considered as a result of the 2009 floods.  I see no inconsistency in highlighting the outlay of what, in many instances, amounts to considerable levels of funds from my office for flood risk prevention, which should be taken into account by other Departments and agencies of the State in deciding on applications for other forms of funding assistance.</p>

            <p eId="para_578">I am delighted the Minister of State in a very tardy fashion is implementing this fully.  I know the Minister for Finance has said he would not provide direct insurance from the State, which was our policy to which the Minister of State referred when he mentioned the decision we made.  Our decision was quite clear and was to interact with the insurance industry exactly as the Minister of State is doing.  My problem is that what should have taken two months has taken the Government virtually a year.  It is now almost two years since this flood event.  It has taken since December.  A general election intervened in the January and February period.  The Government came into power in March and it took until July to implement the Government decision to meet the Irish Insurance Federation and implement our decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_579">When does the Minister of State believe he will bring the process we introduced to a conclusion?  What is his intention in the event of the insurance companies not playing ball?  We believed we would resolve it in the way the Government is trying to resolve it.  We believe that with the energy we had we would have done it by now.  Why has it taken the Government so long?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
            <p eId="para_630">I promise this will be more peaceful.  I raise the issue of Priory Hall, which we all know has become an absolute nightmare for those involved.  The madness of it has meant the people there have had to move into hotel accommodation or apartment accommodation, often at quite a distance from where they work or where their kids go to school.  It is a frightening scenario and hopefully there will not be too many more, but I would not be shocked if there was.</p>
            <p eId="para_631">There is much responsibility involved in this.  The builder is the main culprit.  The architect signed off on stuff that clearly was not correct.  The engineer signed off on stuff that was not correct.  The local authority clearly did not regulate the matter or supervise the construction project in the correct manner.  I would also argue that the bank must take some responsibility.  If anybody wants to get a mortgage for a new apartment or house in this country, the bank will insist on either an architect, engineer or valuer of its choosing inspecting the property before it agrees to part with the money.  Whoever went out to inspect this on behalf the bank did not do a good job.  The bank must take some responsibility in the whole affair.</p>
            <p eId="para_632">For starters, there is no way that the people who have been moved out of these apartments should have to make their repayments while they are not in them.  All payments should be suspended.  Even if the builder fixes the problems to a certain acceptable level, the apartments in Priory Hall would not be worth the money that they were worth even two weeks ago.  They have been downgraded dramatically.  Nobody in their right mind would buy an apartment off any of the residents in Priory Hall if they wanted to sell on.  It is a complete non-runner.  The bank needs to take that on board, given that it is very much part of the equation.  The residents deserve a write-down on their mortgage, given that this was no fault of theirs.  Like everybody else, the bank has a responsibility and it should accept that.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_355" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_633">I thank the Deputy for raising this important topic.  The situation in which the residents of Priory Hall find themselves, through no fault of their own, is truly dreadful.  It is particularly harrowing for those with young children.  The Government is obviously conscious of their plight.  In this regard, I am pleased that the National Management Asset Agency has at short notice made available to Dublin City Council a list of 332 units in nine residential developments in the Dublin 11, 13 and 17 areas.  More specifically, these are in Clongriffin, Baldoyle, Finglas and on the Malahide Road.  The units range from one-bed apartments to four-bed houses.</p>
            <p eId="para_634">I understand Dublin City Council is now working to match residents' requirements to available units, which is the first step.  The next step is for Dublin City Council to approach the developers involved and agree rental contracts for those units identified as suitable for the residents.  Once that is done, NAMA will provide funding to enable the selected units to be completed.  This is expected to take two weeks after leasing contracts are signed.  I understand Dublin City Council has arranged for some families to move into hotel accommodation.  While these arrangements are necessary in the current circumstances, the accommodation is not somewhere that families want to continue living in.  Everyone needs their own private space in their own home for which they paid dearly.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">I want to turn to the contract that the mortgage holder has with the lender.  A mortgage agreement is a contract.  The terms of a contract cannot be altered without all the original parties or their successors in title giving their consent to the alternation.  The Minister for Finance has no powers in this regard and cannot force the lenders to alter the contract to affect a suspension in mortgage repayments.  However, I suggest the people involved discuss the matter with their mortgage provider.  The Deputy asked a straightforward question.  These people have been put on the street through no fault of their own.  Would I be paying a mortgage in that circumstance?  No, I would not.  I would raise with my mortgage provider the issue of the appalling treatment I have received.  Why these people have to continue to make mortgage repayments when they have no house in which to live is a fundamental question that their mortgage provider needs to answer.  If they encounter difficulties with the mortgage lender in regard to how they are treated in any such negotiations, then a complaint may be made to the Financial Services Ombudsman, who is an independent statutory officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_636">The Minister for Finance does not have the power to make that order.  We have an independent Financial Services Ombudsman to take complaints of this nature, and it would be a useful first step if the residents concerned initiated those proceedings, but that is a matter for them.  I cannot tell them to do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_637">I do not have details of which financial institutions, whether covered institutions or not, have lent to Priory Hall residents.  The issue remains in the legal sphere and is still subject to litigation.  It would not be correct to speculate in the House on the legal process.  However, once a decision has been reached through the legal process, the circumstances will then be clearer and any problems in respect of the mortgages in place with the residents will, I am sure, be reviewed by the relevant institutions in light of the court's findings.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
            <p eId="para_638">I thank the Minister of State for his positive response.  In arguing the toss with banks and other lending institutions on a case by case basis about whether there is room for manoeuvre on a better deal, a write down or compensation for what occurred, some people will be in a poorer position than others.  Unfortunately, the most vulnerable people are likely to get the rawest deal when confronting a powerful financial institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">I agree that people will have to discuss the matter with the lending institution, but given that the taxpayer owns a few of these banks which may be involved, I would like to think that if they were not behaving ethically in this case, the Minister of State and his colleagues might have a word with them.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_640">I thank the Deputy.  I suppose this is complicated because there are at least four parties involved here.  We have the unfortunate individuals who purchased the home, who are in this circumstance and who now have had to move out.  We have the lending institutions which provided the funds to allow that purchase to take place.  We have the local authority and its responsibility in this entire affair.  Finally, we have the builder's responsibility, the standard of the building and its certification.  It is a complicated legal issue that will ultimately have to be determined outside this House.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">Any effort involving the Government — I am thinking here of the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose and his Department — is all about trying to get the best possible deal for the people in this situation.  Any action the Government can take that will help resolve the issue will be taken.  We are limited by virtue of the fact that this is part and parcel of a legal process in which we cannot get involved.  I hope the remedies set out in my initial reply to the Deputy are there for the regulator to enforce, if complaints are made to him.  While I cannot instruct anyone to make a complaint, it is clearly a matter for him if complaints stack up in his office.  In the first instance, it is a matter for the residents concerned.  The Government will take any action it can to help in the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_643">Presentation secondary school in Miltown is one of three secondary schools in mid-Kerry.  It draws students from a vast area stretching from Annascaul to Killarney and Glenbeigh to Firies but mainly from its own catchment area.  It has a proud history dating back over half a century to 1958.  The Presentation Order has a history in Milltown dating back to the 1800s.  The current school site was acquired in 1976 and the new school built in 1981.  The student population has grown enormously since.  In a way, the school has become a victim of its own success, with its excellent reputation drawing more and more students every year.  The school population is now 543, even though it was designed and built to cater for a cohort of 180 to 200 pupils.  The population of Milltown will, undoubtedly, grow in the coming years, with nine new housing estates having been built in the village in the last decade.  This will further increase the pressure on the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">The school continues to turn out excellent young adults, many of whom have achieved highly in life during the years.  This is a fair reflection of the school's excellent staff and dynamic ethos.  Unfortunately, however, prefabricated temporary accommodation now comprises two thirds of the school buildings.  Some of these units have been on site for over 20 years.  On a recent visit to the school, I saw at first hand the cramped conditions in which staff and students had to operate.  The older prefabs, in particular, are often cold, damp and stuffy.  Four classrooms, located in a building across the busy R563 Killarney to Milltown road from the main school building, were originally built as a primary school in the 1930s.  They are poorly insulated and hard to heat.  As they are not sound-proof, it is hard for teachers and students to concentrate on their work while the activities of neighbouring classes can be heard.  The main problem is that every hour up to 240 students must cross the R563 between classes.  This is far from ideal in this day and age.  Even though a pedestrian crossing links these classrooms with the main school building, a student was knocked down last year on her way to class.</p>
            <p eId="para_645">A building adjacent to the school complex is also being used as a classroom owing to the shortage of space.  This building was originally built in the 1800s when it was used as a Church of Ireland primary school.  Unfortunately, it has not seen any major changes since.  Therefore, one can imagine the conditions experienced there.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">The school has no indoor physical education facilities, no changing area and no shower facilities.  All PE activity must take place outside, regardless of weather conditions, and students must change in makeshift changing rooms.  The lack of showers and proper sanitary conditions is unacceptable from a personal hygiene perspective.  There is no general assembly hall, no canteen and no library, while there are very limited IT and toilet facilities for students and staff.  There is also a shortage of administrative space.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">The school has a proud history of inclusiveness and a high number of students with resource teaching hours.  It also has a very high rate of student retention.  By being non-selective in its admission policy, it caters for a wide range of students.  In 2006 a greenfield site beside the existing school was acquired by the Presentation Sisters for a new school building which is badly needed, as continued departmental investment in temporary accommodation is not the long-term answer.</p>
            <p eId="para_648">I call on the Minister of State and his departmental officials to prioritise this school for the provision of a new school building, given the large student population and the need for a new building to facilitate the delivery of a modern, responsive education service for young adults.  While I understand the huge budgetary restraints affecting all Departments as a result of mismanagement by the previous Administration, I urge the Minister of State to make every effort to find the finance to allow this much needed school building project to proceed.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
            <p eId="para_649">I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.  I thank the Deputy for raising it, as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and to clarify the current position on the application for major capital funding from Presentation secondary school, Milltown, County Kerry.</p>
            <p eId="para_650">As the Deputy is aware, the Department of Education and Skills is forecasting an increase of over 24,900 post-primary pupils by the start of the 2017-18 school year.  In order to meet the needs of our growing population of schoolgoing children, the delivery of new schools, together with extension projects, will be the main focus for capital investment in the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_651">As the Deputy may know, the school in question applied for an extension in 1996.  It was assessed and assigned a band 2.2 rating.  As part of the assessment process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  A building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band 1 is the highest and band 4 the lowest.</p>
            <p eId="para_652">Owing to the restricted nature of the site, the condition of the existing building and a revised long-term projected enrolment of 600 pupils, a new building on a new site was recommended.  The trustees acquired a 2 ha site to facilitate the larger building project.  The Department received confirmation from the Presentation Sisters that they had acquired the site on 18 June 2010.  It is in that context that the building project for Presentation secondary school was included in the list of projects announced on 24 January 2011 to commence architectural planning.  Officials from my Department's planning and building unit have recently finalised the schedules of accommodation which have been issued to the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_653">My Department will continue to liaise with the school authorities in the context of progressing the project to the next stage of the architectural planning process.  In the meantime, the school applied for temporary accommodation for the introduction of transition year from 2009 and was sanctioned an all-in grant of €49,437 in July 2009 to build two additional rooms.  The school also applied for temporary accommodation for a general classroom for September 2010.  Its application was approved and a devolved grant of €70,000 sanctioned.</p>

            <p eId="para_654">I acknowledge the investment made in the school in the provision of temporary accommodation in recent years.  Unfortunately, however, as I am sure the Minister of State will agree, the provision of temporary accommodation is not the long-term answer.  The new school building should be built as soon as possible.  While I appreciate the efforts being made to move the project to the next stage, we need to see an intensification of the process in order that the new school building will be given absolute priority.  Any help the Minister or the Minister of State could give would be greatly appreciated.  While the new school building is awaited, hundreds of students will pass through the existing school buildings in the next few years in unacceptable conditions.  Students are getting wet while walking considerable distances between classrooms in the rain.  This is not acceptable.  I want to see this project being given absolute priority.  I hope we will not have to wait years to hear good news.  Therefore, I urge the Minister of State and the Minister to do everything in their power to ensure the project school is given absolute priority.  I invite them to visit the school to see at first hand the conditions being experienced.  They would be more than welcome.</p>

            <p eId="para_655">The band 2.2 rating the school has been assigned indicates there is a substantial and significant accommodation deficit.  While the condition of the existing accommodation is adequate, there is still a deficit in meeting the overall accommodation needs of the school.  In difficult economic circumstances it is fortunate to be at an advanced stage in the process of architectural planning.  I heard the Deputy's concerns and will undertake to pass them on directly to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, who has ultimate responsibility in this area.  I will liaise with the Deputy regularly to update him on any progress on this matter.</p>

          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_362">
            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_656">As the Minister of State well knows, St. Michael's House, an organisation based in Dublin 9, is the largest provider of intellectual disability services in Dublin and the third largest provider of services on a national basis.  Some 80% of St. Michael's House's services are on Dublin's northern side in the HSE north-east region and the remaining 20% are on the southern side in the HSE Dublin mid-Leinster region.  Day services are provided on average to 1,616 citizens per day and residential services, with dedicated full-time care, are provided for 450 citizens in homes across the north side.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">Although there are 114 additional people receiving day services and 44 additional people in St. Michael's House residential services than in 2008, the organisation has suffered swinging cuts to its budget over the past four years.  In addition, it has lost 104 staff members who cannot be replaced due to the moratorium in recruitment in the public sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_658">Over 2009, 2010 and 2011, St. Michael's House funding has been cut by €8.7 million in total.  The 1.8% cutback imposed on St. Michael's House in 2011 has left the organisation at the absolute pin of its collar.  Through the incredible work and sacrifices of the dedicated St. Michael's House staff, led by the CEO, Ms. Patricia Doherty, the organisation has managed to maintain and expand its services over the past four years.  However, any further significant cuts would devastate the organisation and would mean the closure of critical day and residential services.  This is at a time when the services provided by St. Michael's House have never been more necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">At a recent briefing that I and a number of other Deputies received in Dáil Éireann from CEO Ms Patricia Doherty and her deputy, Mr. David Kenefick, Ms Doherty reported that St. Michael's House has the longest waiting list for residential care in the country.  For example, there are currently 240 parents over 70 years of age caring for their son or daughter at home.  St. Michael's House reports that 147 of these families are in serious difficulty.  There are 263 parents from 61 to 70, 283 from 51 to 60, and 410 from 41 to 50 whose children use St. Michael's House day services but who more than likely will eventually need residential care support.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">The Minister of State will agree that St. Michael's House has performed the extraordinary feat of keeping services going under immense budgetary pressure due to the commitment of its whole team of staff to a programme of streamlining the organisation as much as possible and to keeping costs at an absolute minimum across the board.  There is very good flexibility in all areas of the operation.  I understand that St. Michael's House was the first health care organisation to sign a comprehensive agreement under the Croke Park agreement, which has resulted in enhanced flexibility across the organisation and a significant reduction in absenteeism, to just over 3%.  St. Michael's House understands that, in the Department of Health's current value-for-money cost-per-client group review of intellectual disability services, it is below the national average on costs and value for money across the board.  The Minister of State will probably confirm that.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">St. Michael's House's staff greatly fear that a cut greater than last year's cut of 1.8% will be imposed in budget 2012.  I understand there are suggestions from the HSE that the budget for mental health and intellectual disability services may be cut by up to 4% or 5%, which would devastate organisations such as St. Michael's House.  I hope the Minister of State will, on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, be able to provide some reassurance to the St. Michael's House community and its magnificent workforce that no cuts will be imposed on the organisation under budget 2012.</p>

          <speech by="#RoisinShortall" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_363">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Róisín Shortall)</from>
            <p eId="para_662">I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this matter.  I am responding on behalf of my colleague Deputy Kathleen Lynch, Minister of State at the Department of Health, who is not in a position to attend today.  I will bring Deputy Broughan's concerns to her attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">Under the Health Act 2004, the HSE is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services, including disability services.  The integral role of the non-statutory agencies such as St. Michael's House is of particular relevance to the provision of health and personal social services to people with a disability.  These agencies provide a very significant and broad range of services in partnership with and on behalf of the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">Expenditure on health services for people with a disability in 2011 will be around €1.5 billion, with an overall staffing level of 15,800 whole time equivalents.  The majority of that funding is used by the non-statutory agencies providing services, such as St. Michael's House.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">The HSE's national service plan for 2011 includes the maintenance of core disability service levels, 9,200 people in residential places, 20,000 day service places, 7,500 people receiving respite residential support and 3.34 million hours of personal assistant or home support hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">I am very aware of the excellent work done by St. Michael's House, generally and in the north side of Dublin.  Its facilities are in my constituency and the Deputy and I regularly have an opportunity to express our appreciation of the outstanding work of the organisation.  We know how much this work is valued by our constituents.  We are very conscious of the wide range of services St. Michael's House provides, including community-based day, respite, residential and early services for people with an intellectual disability on behalf of the HSE under section 38 of the Health Act 2004.  Services are provided through a service level agreement which is reviewed on an annual basis.  The HSE provided funding of €72 million to St. Michael's House in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">Expenditure on health services for people with a disability in 2011 will be around €1.5 billion.  Special consideration was given to disability and mental health in budget 2011 through a maximum reduction of just 1.8% in the allocation for these two sectors.  Nobody wants to see any cuts in this area but it is important to point out that the reduction of 1.8%, which is relatively low by comparison with other reductions under the health budget, recognises that these services are provided to vulnerable groups and should help to ensure that existing services are maintained and that priority is given to the delivery of front line services.  The HSE has informed me that it is working closely with service providers in 2011 to ensure the maximum delivery of services in an efficient and effective manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">The HSE was provided with an additional €10 million for disability services in 2011.  Taking the reduction in the overall HSE disability budget into account, the HSE was asked to manage the additional resources and engage with service providers to ensure existing support needs, and demands for additional places and supports, are managed most effectively within the overall allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">The level of funding available for the overall health budget is being considered as part of the comprehensive review of expenditure and the Estimates process for 2012, which is currently under way.  Deputy Broughan is keen to establish the budgetary position on behalf of St. Michael's House.  However, deliberations by the Government on the expenditure allocations for next year are likely to continue until budget time and it would, therefore, not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of those deliberations.  The very difficult financial position facing the Exchequer will obviously require very careful management of the sector in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_670">There is a value-for-money review under way at present and it is expected to be completed by the end of 2011.  Notwithstanding that, I note what the Deputy said on the streamlining work that has already been undertaken with St. Michael's House and the efficiencies it has achieved.  The review will make recommendations that will ensure the very substantial funding provided to the specialist disability sector is used to the maximum benefit for persons with a disability, having regard to overall severe resource constraints that regrettably affect all sectors at this time.</p>

          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_364">
            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_671">I agree that the delivery of front line services must be the absolute priority.  I wish the Minister of State well in the comprehensive review of expenditure and hope she will do battle for us on the north side and for St. Michael's House and similar organisations.  I wish her success in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_672">Last year, the then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, former Deputy John Moloney, issued a directive that funding for mental health services and children with an intellectual disability should be ring-fenced and not cut by more than 1.8%.  Had the then Government survived, this commitment would have had to have been honoured.  Does the ring-fence still exist?  Are we still committed to the figure in question?  This is first and foremost an issue for the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</p>
            <p eId="para_673">I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has met the leadership and board of St. Michael's House.  Has the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, made a response to the organisation or will she do so?  Does she plan to meet them again in the final days coming up to the expenditure review?</p>
            <p eId="para_674">As the Minister of State is aware I have had first-hand experience of the work of St. Michael's House and other fantastic providers such as the St. John of God services and the desperate struggle that took place to build the current level of services.  I impress on the Minister of State that the parents in their 70s, 80s and beyond are the first generation of Irish people to have cared properly for people with intellectual disability.  They made great sacrifices to create the St. John of God and St. Michael's House network and this generation and this Government has an obligation not to drop the ball.  I urge the Minister of State to go in with her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, and do battle for us and secure no cuts for this great organisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_675">I assure the Deputy that all Ministers in the Department of Health are battling hard to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, we can protect the health budgets in difficult circumstances.  There is an attempt to ring-fence several critical areas within the health sector and that work is underway at the moment.  I am conscious that St. Michael's House has experienced severe cuts in the past three years.  Its base figure is especially low and we are conscious of this, as is the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch.  We are working hard to ensure that these critical areas are protected in the budgetary context.  St. Michael's House has been in touch with me, as a northside representative, seeking a meeting and I realise Deputy Broughan raised this matter with me only last week.  I am pleased to liaise with Deputy Broughan to set up an early meeting with St. Michael's House.  I am happy to meet them and I am aware of the excellent work they do in the area.  I assure Deputy Broughan of my determination and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to support this work to the greatest extent possible.  I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this important issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_678">Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each local authority.  The annual rate on valuation applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function of a local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">The Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county-by-county basis.  The purpose of the revaluation process is to update commercial valuations which will assist in providing a more equitable distribution of rates for those liable to pay rates.  Local authorities have been asked by my Department to exercise restraint in setting the annual rate on valuation in this and previous years and they have responded positively in this regard.  I recognise these are difficult economic times for many businesses.  I will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration and review and I am determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain and reduce costs in the local government sector.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NiallCollins" eId="spk_368">
            <from>Deputy Niall Collins</from>
            <p eId="para_680">It is fair to say this is one of the greatest challenges facing commercial Ireland and its small and medium sized businesses, as the Minister is aware.  It is also fair to say there has been no statement of substance from the Government that has given any degree of comfort or hope to commercial ratepayers.  The Minister has met the new group, Irish Employers for Affordable Rates, which held a lobby last week across the road.  Such is the message they have given me.</p>
            <p eId="para_681">We realise the system is complex.  There are some 170,000 businesses and they pay €1.3 million in rates per annum.  At the Committee of Public Accounts this morning, the Valuation Office indicated the current revaluation exercise could take more than ten years and this is of great concern.  We must see a degree of action on the matter.  The Irish Employers for Affordable Rates pointed out, correctly, that Colm McCarthy was able to undertake an exercise swiftly and the Minister and the Government has accepted and is implementing many of his recommendations.  The McCarthy group was able to undertake an exercise that started in late 2008 and finished during the middle of 2009 with the production of a comprehensive document.  As the Minister is aware, we need action on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_682">Will the Minister not consider the United Kingdom model whereby a business's ability to pay is taken into consideration?  Has consideration been given to any variation or amendment to the Valuation Act?  The household charge has been debated here and the Minister has announced that it will come into effect in January.  I understand it will be a self-assessment tax, like the non-principal private residence, NPPR, tax.  Could we consider a system of self-assessment for businesses based on another model, one that is perhaps similar to the VAT registration model for businesses above a certain threshold?  At the moment small and medium sized businesses are falling flat on their faces.  This is a barrier to their survival, a point we cannot emphasise enough.  The Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, and every elected person in the House understands as much as well as everyone in the business community but nothing appears to be happening about it.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_369" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_683">I agree totally with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Niall Collins on the small business sector.  Those in the sector are under pressure from a variety of areas and the cost base of surviving in business is a legitimate concern for them.  However, given that 29% of local authority income is from the commercial rate base one can understand how important a source of income it is for local authorities as well.  In the past two years there has been a reduction in commercial rates of 0.64% across the 88 local authorities.  This may be a small reduction but in the context of the times we are in it was important that we did not increase them.  That is always the easy options for local authority members.  I am pleased that my initiative in this regard has worked well with the leaders of the groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_684">I met the Commissioner of Valuation recently and we considered various ways in which we could improve the revaluation process and speed it up.  It is totally unacceptable that it could take ten or more years to carry out a revaluation process.  Revaluation has been carried out in several local authorities in the Dublin area with mixed success.  Some people believe that a revaluation process will be a winner for them but that it not always the case.  There are winners and losers in this process.  Nevertheless, if a revaluation process is carried out and people believe there is a fair application given the times we are in, then they should be prepared to acknowledge that.  I expect the Commissioner on Valuation will come back to Government, the Minister for Finance and myself with proposals in the coming weeks.  There is a valuation Bill on the A list to go through the Houses of the Oireachtas this session and that will give us an opportunity to determine what we can do to help.</p>

The assessment breaks down housing need under several headings to identify those whose need arises, for example, from unsuitable existing accommodation, age or special needs resulting from physical or mental incapacity.  A notable feature of the current assessment is the number of households whose identified need arises from their no longer being able to afford their own accommodation.  This equates to some 67% of households in need, which is clearly a reflection of the current economic circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">A new approach to assessing need is now being implemented resulting from regulations which came into effect after the current assessment was concluded.  In time, this will provide a more consistent, objective and timely system for the assessment of need.  This new system includes a standardised set of eligibility criteria designed to bring greater equity and transparency to the assessment process.  While these new regulations are now in force it will be some time before data on housing need are accumulated under the new system of assessment.  I will keep the new system under review and I will make any further adjustments required in light of experience to ensure it delivers a timely and robust assessment of need on an ongoing basis.  In that regard, I have already increased the eligibility criteria in respect of income by €5,000 in each case.  While this will have the effect of further increasing demand for social housing, it is beneficial in providing for a broader based and more sustainable approach to identifying and addressing social housing need.</p>

            <p eId="para_691">I tabled this question because of the large number of people experiencing difficulty in having their names added to local authority housing waiting lists.  While I accept the Minister of State's comments on the introduction of a standardised set of eligibility criteria, the new application form runs to between 16 and 18 pages and as many as 18 separate items of documentation and supporting evidence are required of applicants.  This is causing significant problems.  In some cases, it is easier to obtain a visa to visit Australia than to join the local authority housing waiting list.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">When I raised the issue of medical evidence with the Minister of State about three months ago, he provided a helpful reply in which he stated it was not a requirement in all cases that a medical report be provided by a consultant.  The local authorities continue to hold out in this regard and are demanding that a consultant's report be furnished, despite the Minister of State's clear statement that such a report is not required in all cases.  There is a communications problem in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_693">At least two local authorities have withdrawn the requirement that applicants for local authority housing have a local connection dating back five years.  This clause has been questioned and challenged.  What is the position in this regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_694">The guidelines require that a copy of the tenancy agreement be furnished.  Some local authorities also seek the landlord's Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, registration number.  While Sinn Féin supports full compliance with the requirements of the PRTB, the refusal of some landlords to provide tenants with a PRTB number is creating major problems for housing applicants.  In some cases, landlords who have a PRTB number are refusing to provide either a PRTB or PPS number.  It is also difficult for tenants to obtain from a landlord written confirmation that rent payments are up to date.  For example, landlords are reluctant to provide such confirmation in cases where the tenant pays rent one month in advance.</p>
            <p eId="para_695">I ask the Minister of State to provide clarification as regards the provision of the PRTB number and the five year local residency clause.  I have a copy of his previous reply on the requirement to furnish a consultant's report as medical evidence.  Will local authorities be informed by circular that such evidence is no longer necessary in all cases and that, for example, an occupational therapist's report may suffice in some cases?</p>

          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_375" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_696">We are trying to introduce objective and standardised criteria.  It should not be necessary to produce a consultant's report, given that it may take a long period to obtain such a report, thus prolonging the process and creating further trauma for applicants.  There may also be a financial outlay required of the applicant who may not have the wherewithal to meet the cost.  An ordinary general practitioner's report or, in specific circumstances, an occupational therapist's report or a combination thereof should be sufficient in the vast bulk of cases related to social housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">I will examine the provision of having a local connection for five years, which is an extremely long period, given that, in many cases, applicants have returned to an area they left, through no fault of their own, to secure employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_698">I am less sympathetic on the issue of the Private Residential Tenancies Board number.  We all share the same objective in this regard and the sooner we amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 the better.  If we transfer responsibility for rent supplement to local authorities, it will be critical that we ensure landlords do not receive rent supplement unless they are registered.  Last year the PRTB found that a substantial number of landlords were not registered.  We must address this issue.  If landlords are tax compliant, we will have an opportunity to obtain perhaps 20% or 25% of the outlay of the rent supplement scheme, which costs approximately €500 million per annum.  We must start to get some of this money back and get better value for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">It is my intention to issue circulars to ensure standardised criteria apply.  These should not be excessively onerous on those who seek to secure a place on the housing list.  As the Deputy will be aware, the number on the housing list was found to be more than 100,000 on 1 March.  However, the figure is a moveable feast and I have no doubt it has increased significantly in the meantime.  We are obliged to ascertain the number on the housing list every three years.  I intend to do so more frequently to ensure the figures are up to date.  If we were to calculate the number on the housing list tomorrow, I have no doubt the figure would have increased to 115,000.  I also live in the real world.  I will address in a constructive manner the issues raised by the Deputy.</p>

          in relation to the five person committee recently appointed to assess the viability of merging Waterford City Council with Waterford County Council, known as the Waterford Local Government Committee, if he will clarify the reason there are no publically elected members from either the city or county councils appointed to this committee; the reason this committee was not chosen by the independent commission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_701">The Waterford Local Government Committee is a statutory committee established under the Local Government Act 1991 to carry out a review of local government arrangements in Waterford and submit a report containing recommendations on whether the county council and city council of Waterford should be unified.  The appointment of members to the committee was undertaken in accordance with, <i>inter alia</i>, section 28(4)(<i>d</i>) of the 1991 Act which provides for the disqualification of certain persons from membership, including members of a local authority.  Accordingly, I have no discretion in that regard. </p>
            <p eId="para_702">The appointment of the five members in question was based on their range of knowledge, experience and expertise, including in local government matters; public administration generally; business and development; and their knowledge of matters relevant to Waterford.  I have full confidence in their ability to examine the issues rigorously and report in an objective and informed manner and in accordance with their terms of reference, a copy of which was issued on 23 September and is available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_703">The work of the Waterford Local Government Committee is an important component of an overall programme of reform and development in the local government sector, under which significant decisions in the case of counties Limerick and Tipperary have already been taken by the Government.  The report of the committee which is to be submitted to me not later than 29 February 2012 will be published and I will bring proposals to the Government for decision in relation to local government arrangements in Waterford in the light of the committee's findings.  To ensure public representatives are informed of matters relating to these issues, regular briefings will be provided for the committees of the relevant local authorities on the implementation of any measures to be introduced.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Halligan</from>
            <p eId="para_704">As the Minister is well aware, the merging of Government bodies is always fraught with danger.  Job losses are inevitable, whether they are councillors, who one must remember are also workers, or local authority staff.  Many are concerned about the potential for job losses.  It is still unclear whether the independent commission could have been brought on board in terms of the Waterford Local Government Committee.  I hope the committee will not be influenced by the Government.  Its members must not be former members or supporters of the Government or related to members of the Government.  This is a reasonable concern, given that the decision pending which is due in February could result in job losses.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">The Minister who was a very good councillor will know that county and city councillors work at the coalface.  I will be nice to the Minister for a couple of seconds.  He realises these people know what is happening on the ground.  With regard to the European study, we represent more people than many other councils.  It would be a disaster were the Minister to consider reducing the size of city or county councils.  That would not be in line with local government reform or being up-front with people.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">I gather the Minister will be in contact with city and county local authorities before any decision is made and I am delighted this is the case.</p>

        <b> Deputy Niall Collins</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government</b>
          his views on financial grants for those rural households who must upgrade their septic tanks following inspection by his Department in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  
        [30522/11]

          </question>
          <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_385" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_715">In October 2009, the European Court of Justice ruled that Irish legislation does not adequately provide for domestic waste water from septic tanks to be recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and without using processes which could harm the environment.  Accordingly, the ECJ found that our legislation is, therefore, not compliant with the waste directive.  I expect to bring a new Bill to establish a system of registration and risk-based inspection of septic tanks and other on-site systems to Government shortly seeking approval for its publication.  Full details of how the new system will operate will be announced at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">The remedial action required on foot of an inspection of a septic tank under the new system will, in many cases, only involve householders having to empty or de-sludge their tanks more frequently.  In other cases, householders may be required to upgrade or replace their septic tanks.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">The question of introducing a grants scheme for any purpose must be very carefully considered in light of the current very significant budgetary constraints.  My Department will keep under review options to provide financial support to householders, whose systems are deemed, following inspection, to require substantial remediation or upgrading.  Any such support would have to take account of the overall budgetary situation and of the financial position of individual households.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NiallCollins" eId="spk_386">
            <from>Deputy Niall Collins</from>
            <p eId="para_718">To be fair, the Minister met the IFA on this point and that organisation was first to moot it.  It comes on foot of some of the recent retro-fit schemes which were grant-aided through Sustainable Energy Ireland.  The case has been put succinctly by the IFA and others in this House that such a scheme should be a product of a new registration regime.  We should make every effort and strive to implement this, not only for the jobs involved but because it will encourage people to comply with the new regime when it is up and running.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">Perhaps the Minister might address the household charge.  There is a division between urban and rural Ireland in that the registration charge will affect rural dwellers only.  That bone of contention has been articulated in this House and outside it.   When water metering is rolled out — I am not trying to stray from waste disposal — and each dwelling in urban Ireland has a water meter will there be an attempt to promote equity between urban and rural dwellers?  Is there such thinking somewhere within the bowels of the Minister's Department?  I do not claim it is the Minister's thinking but indications are emanating of a policy that would charge urban Ireland for waste water treatment according to the water-in water-out model that currently exists for waste water treatment charges to commercial premises.</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_720">I certainly have heard nothing of that kind said in the Department.  If the Deputy is advocating that proposal, fair enough.</p>

            <from>Deputy Niall Collins</from>

            <p eId="para_722">No, I have not heard anything about it.  It is certainly not my intention to do that.  Water charges by metering will be introduced in due course, as a separate charge from the household charge, as the Deputy knows.  We always stated that would be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">The registration charge is a nominal amount.  Some septic tanks date back pre-1963.  We must ensure we catch everybody in the sense of what we know exists in the form of a septic tank.  We believe there are 475,000 in total.   There will not be an annual charge of €300 per annum, as was advocated by the IFA and others.  I understand the IFA stated it would cost €150 million to remediate some of the problems with septic tanks.  If that is the case we have a very serious problem but I do not envisage any such expenditure being required to upgrade septic tanks for the purpose of improving our ground water.  It is a risk-based model and I believe people will be satisfied with the monitoring and inspection that will be carried out.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">I cannot consider a grant scheme, perhaps until 2014, because inspections will not take place until 2013.  That will give us an idea of the extent of the problem.  If help is needed for low-income families it can be considered at that stage.</p>

          the action he will take to support the residents of Priory Hall, Donaghmede, Dublin, who have had to evacuate their homes due to totally inadequate fire safety and bad construction; if he will carry out an urgent review and reform of building and fire regulations and inspection regimes, ending self regulation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_726">Following an application by Dublin City Council, a High Court Order was granted on 14 October 2011 for the evacuation of the development at Priory Hall on the grounds that it is unsafe.  My Department understands that, following a further hearing on 17 October 2011, a stay has been put on the evacuation order until 20 October 2011, and that the developer has committed to carrying out a schedule of necessary remedial works in the coming weeks.  Dublin City Council has also made arrangements for the temporary accommodation of the affected residents.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">The events of the past week have come on the back of more than two years of enforcement activity and discussions with the developer.  It is an extremely distressing and stressful situation for the residents at Priory Hall who, through no fault of their own, have had to struggle with the consequences of building defects.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">I attach high priority to consumer protection in the area of quality construction of new dwellings.  That is why I announced in July 2011 a number of measures to be advanced by my Department and local authorities with a view to improving compliance with, and oversight of, the requirements of the building regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">In broad terms the measures will involve: the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the building regulations have been met; more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective and meaningful oversight of building activity; standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions; and better support and further development of the building control function nationwide.</p>

Last week they were made refugees in their own country because of the unscrupulous and disgraceful developers, Coalport, and totally inadequate planning laws.  Has the Minister met the Dublin City Council manager or the city housing manager to address the housing needs of these residents?  I understand the Minister's point regarding the action Coalport is supposed to take.  However, it is a very serious situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">What does the Minister know of the proposed arrangements with NAMA?  Can he take action to ensure the cost of renting NAMA properties is not borne by the residents or the city council but by Coalport?  Is the Minister aware that Dublin City Council is carrying out the building investigation into Priory Hall?  This was promised to conclude in three weeks' time.  Will the Minister ask the council to ensure it will be concluded and the report published in this promised timeframe?</p>
            <p eId="para_733">The situation for people with mortgages on apartments in Priory Hall is dire.  How will their plight be addressed?  Will the Minister agree to meet residents to discuss this and all other issues, and will he keep a hands-on approach?  What action will he take to reform the planning, building and fire safety laws and end  so-called self-regulation?  He mentioned some actions but it is important to have proper inspection of buildings to prevent such a scandal ever happening again.</p>

            <p eId="para_734">A robust system of controls does exist.  That is why Dublin City Council has been trying for two years to oblige the developer involved in this case to carry out certain works in order to ensure the building met fire compliance standards.  The developer chose to ignore the council's directions in this regard.  As a result, the latter had no option but to take the matter before the courts in August 2010.  I appreciate the courts system is somewhat slow.  However, the local authority, which has a devolved function in this case, acted as quickly as possible.  I expect it will publish the report in three weeks' time.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">As the Deputy is aware, the unfortunate residents who have been caught up in this situation through no fault of their own are in temporary accommodation.  NAMA has made a schedule of properties known to Dublin City Council, not the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in respect of this matter.  I will continue to do everything in my power to facilitate the actions undertaken by the council to provide, in so far as is possible, the residents with assistance in order that they might overcome the trauma which has been visited upon them.  I will also do everything in my power to ensure the developer who caused this problem will be brought to book and that the High Court proceedings, which are ongoing, will be concluded as quickly as possible in order that there might be certainty with regard to improvements required in respect of this particular building.  We must ensure the families involved will be able to return to permanent, independent living accommodation as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_736">The Minister stated there is a robust system in place.  It is my experience that this system is paper-driven rather than being based on inspections.  The position is similar in respect of many local authorities.  There are many problems with housing schemes and developments throughout the country.  This is true of the area in which I live, north-west Dublin, where the system relating to the policing of developments was extremely lax.  There is a need to tighten up the system and to adopt a hands-on approach.  In that context, it is extremely important that physical inspections should take place.</p>

            <p eId="para_737">I agree with Deputy Ellis.  It is important that such inspections should take place.  That is why, before any of the difficulties relating to Priory Hall began, I was taking action under the Building Control Acts.  I am changing the system as quickly as possible but there is a need for some consultation with the relevant stakeholders in order to ensure we get it right.  We are determined to get it right and all local authorities may rest assured that a mandatory certification process will replace the self-regulation model which obtained in the past.</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_739">Under section 42 of the Planning Act, an extension of planning permission is given, on application, in a case where substantial works have been carried out within the original duration, subject only to the condition that an application complying with the relevant regulations was made before the expiration of the initial period.  An amendment to these provisions was introduced in section 28 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that the duration of a planning permission may be extended where substantial works have not been carried out, or where the development has not even commenced, in cases where the planning authority is satisfied there were considerations of a commercial, economic or technical nature beyond the control of the applicant which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works pursuant to the planning permission, again provided that an application complying with the relevant regulations was made before the expiration of the initial period.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">The new provision is, however, subject to a number of qualifications, including that the planning authority is satisfied there have been no significant changes in the development objectives in the development plan or in regional development objectives in the regional planning guidelines for the area of the planning authority since the date of the permission such that the development would no longer be consistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area; and that the planning authority is satisfied the development would not be inconsistent with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to any guidelines issued by the Minister under section 28.  I consider the new provision strikes an appropriate balance and that it is right that in cases where substantial works have not been carried out, or the development has not even commenced, the duration of permission should not be extended in respect of developments for which the planning authority would now refuse permission in respect of current applications.</p>

            <p eId="para_741">I disagree with the Minister's assertion that the new provision strikes a balance.  It is my contention that it does not do so.  As I am sure is the case for other Deputies who represent a rural constituency and are involved in interactions relating to one-off rural housing applications, I have evidence to support my argument.  I have dealt with approximately 20 applications for one-off rural housing developments since the legislation was introduced and planning extensions were denied in all but one instance.  There is an inherent hypocrisy in the legislation which, I accept, was introduced by the previous Government.  I voted in favour of it at the time but I would like to see it changed now.  There is a need for a practical and reasonable approach in respect of this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">If a person's original planning permission has a year to run, he or she can build a house and live in it for as long as he or she desires.  If, however, he or she cannot build it within the first five years and applies to roll the permission over into the following five years, he or she will be refused.  That is a contradiction in terms.  We are all aware that it is difficult to obtain planning permission.  Regardless of how it is dressed up, the policy does not favour one-off rural housing developments.  Everyone knows this to be the case and we may have participated in the development of the system through the creation of local area plans.  Planning permission extensions were designed, in view of the prevailing economic circumstances, to give people an opportunity to proceed with their developments at some point.  In addition, an appeal system was supposed to be put in place but provision in respect of it was not included in the legislation.  We should re-examine this matter.  If a person has planning permission, he or she should, regardless of the environmental standards that apply, be allowed to extend it, particularly in light of current financial circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_743">I take on board what Deputy Collins stated in respect of this matter.  I will be bringing forward a new planning and development Bill in 2012 and this will provide us with an opportunity to review some of the anomalies thrown up by the 2010 Act about which both the Deputy and I are concerned.  I also take on board the Deputy's statement to the effect that he dealt with 20 applications since the latter Act was passed and that only one of these was successful.  Perhaps we should survey all local authorities in order to determine their experience to date in respect of extensions to planning permission.  I would be glad to facilitate the carrying out of such a survey.</p>

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_750">On 16 June 2011, I launched the Government's new housing policy statement which will serve as a framework for a sequence of legislative and policy initiatives in the short to medium term.  Based on a number of fundamental principles and goals that will form the foundation of a substantial reform programme, the new framework for housing policy responds to current and emerging conditions in the housing sector and takes account of the dramatic cycle of rapid growth and sudden collapse in the residential property market.  The centrepiece of the approach is to chart a way forward for housing policy in Ireland by placing greater emphasis on choice, equity across housing tenures and delivering quality outcomes for the resources invested.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">There is clear potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's policy objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  My Department and I have been engaging directly with NAMA to discuss options for bringing unsold suitable residential stock controlled by it into productive use for social housing purposes.  The first scheme of this nature, with property held by NAMA being purchased by an approved housing body through loan finance from the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, was launched in July 2011.  Other proposals are currently being examined.  I again met the chairman and CEO of NAMA to encourage them further to become involved in leasing options as well as the sale of units.</p>

            <p eId="para_752">We are all aware that the housing list is growing year on year, with an associated cost for the rent supplement scheme to the Exchequer.  The Minister mentioned that he met Mr. Brendan McDonagh, whom I listened to recently when he spoke at a conference.  I do not want to misrepresent what he said but he indicated that the State would be offered first refusal on NAMA properties in commercial terms.  That is my understanding but is that shared by the Minister?  It certainly was not the wider understanding of the people and the view is that NAMA is handling many of these properties, many of which are vacant and close to being finished out at a small cost.  Where do we stand with NAMA and will it have to operate on strictly commercial terms with the State with regard to social housing?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_403" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_753">The Deputy knows that from legislation NAMA is required to have a commercial mandate for all activities.  Notwithstanding this, I was very pleased with the meeting a week ago with the chairman and CEO of NAMA, when we outlined our requirements with regard to compliance with our business plan.  Social housing lists are foremost in our minds in this respect.  Many single families could be easily housed in some of the apartments in the major urban areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_754">With regard to housing issues, my Department outlined very clearly to NAMA the importance of securing a social dividend from the overall NAMA process.  There is also the reorientation of housing policy away from reliance on local authority new builds and acquisition to a more flexible delivery option, including leasing and rental accommodation schemes.  There is an increasingly prominent role for approved housing bodies in overall social housing delivery.  NAMA has been in touch with the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency in the past few days to identify properties and see where we can make progress on leasing options.</p>

          <speech by="#DessieEllis" eId="spk_404">
            <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis</from>
            <p eId="para_755">I have heard the Minister's comments on his plans for any properties we get from NAMA in this regard but many people expect much from the NAMA properties.  Addressing the social housing issue is a priority for me and my constituents.  The social end to which the Minister referred goes to voluntary housing rather than social housing, which is one of the problems I have with the Minister's comments.  With NAMA we could address many of the homelessness problems and try to reach our target date of 2013 for the elimination of long-term homelessness.  Some of these properties could be used in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">There is a way to deal with NAMA and we can enter into five-year contracts on properties, letting the local authorities handle the issue and buy them out over a period.  We can get people on the housing lists into properties, which will provide money for the local authorities.  We would also eliminate much of the €500 million per year we spend on rental subsidies.  There would be much advantage if we used these properties for social housing.</p>

            <p eId="para_757">I agree with Deputy Ellis and hope I did not give the impression that we are exclusively dealing with voluntary bodies.  It is just one option for voluntary bodies to engage with NAMA and we engage directly with NAMA, with 8,000 to 10,000 apartment units available in major urban centres.  Properly finished — not much money is required for this — they would be available for people on the social housing list.  How we can use the money more effectively is a constant issue in the formulation of policy in the Department, as it will ultimately allow people to buy their homes.  We will facilitate this.  Voluntary housing associations may not be totally happy with the Government decision to allow people buy out their homes that way.  I agree with Deputy Ellis and the Government is pursuing the sentiments he expressed.</p>

          his views on whether giving local authorities the power to regulate the scrap metal industry within their own jurisdictions is productive in view of the ease with which criminals can travel to neighbouring counties, which may have lesser regulation, to sell their stolen metal; if he will implement legislation to regulate those who purchase scrap metal, in effect disabling criminals from selling it at ease; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_759">Waste activities in Ireland are required to hold an authorisation in accordance with the Waste Management Act 1996; the terms of such authorisations are primarily derived from requirements of EU directives on waste and specific waste streams such as end-of-life vehicles or electronic waste.  Depending on the authorisation required, these activities are controlled either by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, or by local authorities as competent authorities nominated by the State to implement such legislation.  The purpose of these controls is to regulate the collection, recovery or disposal of waste in order to protect the environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">Enforcement of waste legislation is a matter either for the EPA's office of environmental enforcement, OEE, with regard to waste licences or for local authorities with regard to waste permits.  The OEE operates an enforcement network to foster co-operation between the various public service bodies involved in the enforcement of environmental legislation so that a higher and more consistent standard of enforcement is delivered throughout the country.  I have asked my Department to examine the licensing and permitting legislation to ensure all necessary provisions, particularly relating to traceability, are in place to avoid situations that might be exploited by criminal elements.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">Metal theft is a crime and is therefore a matter for An Garda Síochána in the first instance.  A stakeholder forum on the matter has been set up by the Garda and is working to produce a metal theft crime prevention and reduction plan.  My Department is one of the stakeholders participating in the work and will continue to play its part in supporting the work in this area, which is led by the Garda.</p>

            <p eId="para_762">I am sure the Minister is aware that there is a great deal of theft in the countryside, in particular, but believe it or not it also happens in Dublin.  A copper cable 22 mm thick feeding a crane 36 metres high was robbed from me a couple of weeks ago.  Copper scrap is achieving €6,000 per tonne and although I do not know what price the thief got, it cost me €5,000 to replace the cable.  In Wexford and Kilkenny people have contacted me about the issue.  I know councils have done much work in regulating businesses that take in scrap but a person can still bring scrap to certain places and be paid cash.  That practice should be stopped.  Even if the practice is stopped in Wexford but continues in Kilkenny, people will drive to Kilkenny to get the cash.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">We need a policy for the country in this respect.  Anybody bringing scrap to a business should provide an RSI number and should only be paid with a crossed cheque so that it must be deposited in an account.  It would also be a good idea to hold the money for two weeks as this would give the fellow taking in the scrap time to check it.  The Garda could also investigate potential thefts as much material would have been stolen.</p>

            <p eId="para_764">I can see Deputy Wallace's practical experience in these matters is coming into play.  I thank him for that as what he described is exactly what is happening.  The practice seems to be particularly prevalent in the south and south east.  I am prepared to consider a permit system and take on board some of the suggestions made by the Deputy, such as an obligation to produce RSI numbers and so on.  The Garda is leading a forum on the subject and I hope it will not be long before a report is given to me; I hope it will be weeks rather than months.  We can then get on with making the necessary changes to legislation and licensing permits in order to tackle this growing problem.</p>

            <p eId="para_765">This is an important issue raised by Deputy Wallace, who made some very good points.  This does not just happen in country areas.  We have had experience in the Ballymun regeneration project where steel doors worth thousands of euros were stolen and the city council lost a fortune as a result.  A sculpture, "The Bronze Lady" has also been removed from the Moate roadside.  St. Kevin's Church has also been stripped of metal.  We have had many thefts and we should have a more coherent policy across the whole country.  The local authorities should be involved and these permits should be watched more carefully.  The rules should be more stringent</p>

            <p eId="para_766">The Minister mentioned a review of the permit system in response to Deputy Wallace.  Around the country GAA clubs have what is termed "scrap Saturday", and I am sure the Minister has heard of examples in Kilkenny.  My local club, Patrickswell, organised a "scrap Saturday", where the community brings all the waste scrap to the local GAA grounds and it in turn sells it on and it is used as a fund-raising vehicle.  The local authority pulled the plug on it because it did not have the correct permit.  It was a disgrace.  When the Minister is conducting a review of the permit arrangement, he should look at the activities of legitimate voluntary clubs and organisations because they are, in effect, providing an environmental service.  The decision of Limerick County Council beat all.  Other clubs in the county had been engaging in similar activities under the radar and raised significant amounts of money towards the running costs of the clubs which we all support and promote.  I just wanted to make the Minister aware of this.</p>

            <p eId="para_767">The lack of common sense in such matters displayed by Limerick County Council is not worthy of the work being done.  Given that there was no criminal involvement and that it was clear the activity was community-related, the local authority should have been much more flexible in its arrangements.  I invite Deputies, in particular Deputy Wallace, to make submissions on such matters to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and feed into the forum we have established under the Garda Síochána.  I hope we will be in a position to deal with these matters.  It used to be the case that one followed the money, now one follows the metal.</p>

            <p eId="para_774">My question was motivated by the fact that in housing estates one could have up to four collectors driving in and out on the same morning, which is not best practice.  My question is whether the proposed change will damage competition and if there will be significant price increases.  The Minister appears to suggest local authorities would licence one operator for Kilkenny, Drogheda or wherever else and that it would have the franchise for the area.  What measures are being taken to prevent that from happening?  What guidelines are in place for operators?  Will local authorities control the franchising of the service?  Will Louth County Council or Drogheda Borough District Council be responsible for the waste collection service in Drogheda?  I would welcome more detail in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">Has the Minister advanced any plans for a waiver scheme for low income households as part of the review process?  Some local authorities provide waiver schemes for pensioners and other low income households.</p>

            <p eId="para_776">As part of the review, I am considering a waiver scheme for low income families.  There is an Ombudsman's report on the matter which will feed into the process.  The intention is to regulate the market in such a way that we can achieve maximum efficiency and, therefore, reduce prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">We must also be mindful of the fact that under the landfill directive, we have to move away from landfill.  Therefore, we have to find greater means of recycling.  We must deal with and dispose of waste other than on landfill sites.  There are big issues to be considered.  I am conscious of the fact that we need a competitive tendering arrangement to keep prices as low as possible and include a waiver scheme for people on social welfare, those living alone or on low incomes generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_778">This week I met the largest service provider in the Limerick region, Mr. Binman.  The company had to apply for examinership last week and is now in the examinership process.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this.  The case is due for mention in court tomorrow.  It is a family business with more than 300 direct employees and more than 300 indirect employees.  It is an employer of major significance in the region, with 65,000 customers who are happily served and are happy to continue their custom with the company.  We all hope it will come through the examinership process successfully.  I met the company to discuss a number of issues.  I referred to the consultation process which the Department was undertaking in the context of the issue raised by Deputy Stanley of licensing a single operator in an area.  It was indicated to me that the waste collection service had originally been acquired from Limerick County Council and Limerick City Council when they opted for privatisation.  An issue arises for service providers which, as they see it, have purchased an asset they are now entitled to utilise and on which they seek a return.  I wish to inform the consultation process in that regard.</p>

Does the Minister expect private companies to challenge the new system that it is intended to franchise?

            <p eId="para_780">It is a matter for Dublin City Council to decide the collection arrangements for households.  It is working on the basis of existing policy, but it must also be mindful of the draft document issued for consultation.  What we are trying to do is minimise the volumes of waste generated in the first instance, as we wish to divert waste away from landfill.  We also wish to maximise the value from waste because it is no longer just a product for disposal; it is a resource in which so many people are interested in developing technologies to generate businesses from waste disposal.  The aim is also to achieve a positive environmental outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">I take on board the concerns of people living in the Dublin area in which there is uncertainty.  I have gone through the consultation process and I am considering the submissions made.  I will not delay in removing the uncertainty between now and the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">In response to Deputy Niall Collins, I am also conscious of the fact that people have invested a significant amount of money in infrastructure in recent times, not just confined to the Limerick area but throughout the country, and that this must be taken into account before a final decision is made.</p>

          his plans for regulating bodies and persons in view of the sizeable role that voluntary housing associations, private landlords and developers will be playing in the new social housing policy

            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_784">The Government's new housing policy, launched in June, is predicated on a more integrated, choice-based and tenure-neutral approach to social housing provision.  It will mean a much greater role for approved housing bodies in the voluntary and co-operative sector as providers of social housing.  As such, I intend to develop an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both for the sector and its external partners as it takes on an expanded role.  I will develop this framework in consultation with the sector, but I expect that it will assist approved housing bodies to develop key governance and management structures to facilitate an expanded remit; provide independent scrutiny and validation of such bodies' competences; and place sustainable housing management policies and practices at the heart of a co-ordinated approach to the development of the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">The move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition to more revenue-funded options presents challenges for the sector.  The regulatory framework will assist in meeting these challenges and facilitating the sector in attracting the loan finance necessary to deliver on its expanded remit.  The development of a regulatory framework will take time.  In the meantime, I wish to work with the sector on the development of a voluntary code to which, I hope, most approved housing bodies will sign up over time.  This code which I would like to agree in 2012 will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and my Department as we develop a longer term statutory framework that will best support the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">It is also my intention to extend the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act to those segments of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector that most closely parallel the Act's current remit.</p>

            <p eId="para_787">A shocking 96,000 people are on housing waiting lists, many for as long as ten years.  Most of the people on the list believe that at the end of their unacceptable wait they will get a council home with proper standards and a housing authority that is accountable to the public in terms of the condition of that housing.  They do not realise that the Minister ended those hopes in June with his proposals on outsourcing social housing to private landlords' leasing arrangements and now with the new proposals on the banks, they may even have bankers as landlords.  This makes no sense in light of the rental revenue lost to the State and the stupidity of handing over €600,000 per year to private landlords.</p>

            <p eId="para_789">Given that the Minister seems intent on these reforms, what assurance can he offer that we will not end up with a repeat of the 19th century style of slum landlord?  If there is no regulation, we will return to the tenements of the 19th century.  I have heard appalling stories about the conditions that people face when renting from private landlords, although I do not want to tar all of them with the same brush.  These stories have included RAS tenancies.  What assurances can the Minister give tenants that they will get proper, high quality housing rather than slum landlords?</p>

            <p eId="para_792">I know he is busy.  We have engaged with the over-supply in the housing market.  We do not need to construct new homes because we already have them.  We have to match supply with demand from people on the social housing lists.  We have engaged with the National Asset Management Agency to assign the over-supply of housing it controls in major urban areas to local authority lists.  We are working in a proactive way to make supply meet demand.  We will use State resources to assist people into proper accommodation.  It is costing us a significant amount of money but we want people to get high quality accommodation and, equally, be able to own their homes in time.  Our first port of call is to ensure people on local authority housing lists are able to get good accommodation in the private market.  Ultimately these properties may be sold to their occupants.</p>

            <p eId="para_794">I am concerned about the cost of leases.  Accommodation is being taken from the private sector in three ways, namely, RAS, social leasing and the rent allowance.  When that is totted up at the end of the year it will be a substantial amount and the costs will mount over several years.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">I also wish to ask about the property portfolio of voluntary housing organisations.  New voluntary housing bodies are popping up or coming from other jurisdictions to set up shop here.  They are acquiring substantial property portfolios with taxpayer subvention.  The taxpayer might end up funding these organisations without being able to exercise control over them.  What percentage of the tenants of voluntary housing organisations have to be taken from the local authority waiting lists?</p>

            <p eId="para_824">The EU-IMF programme of financial support commits the Government to introduce a property tax from 2012.  The programme reflects the need, in the context of the State's overall financial position, to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for them.  A property tax would take some time to introduce, in the light of the complex issues involved, including the need for a comprehensive property valuation system.  Accordingly, to meet the requirement in the EU-IMF programme, the Government has decided to introduce a flat-rate household charge as an interim measure in 2012.  Proposals for a full property tax will be considered by the Government in due course.  The legislation to underpin the household charge will contain the precise details of the charge.  It will be published and brought before the Oireachtas before the end of the year.  Similar to the charge on non-principal private residences, it is intended that the household charge will be administered on a self-assessment basis.  It will be a matter for owners of residential property to register and pay the charge by the due date.  In the event of non-payment, penalties will apply.  Unpaid household charges will remain as a charge against the property concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_825">When the Minister announced the proposed household tax in August, there was a huge uproar.  People said they could not afford it.  Therefore, the proposal needs to be reconsidered by the Minister.  We have just discussed the issues of mortgage debt, credit debt and the burden on families as they try to stay in their homes.  People are facing an austerity package of a minimum of €10 billion — it could be up to €14 billion — in the next three years.  As Mr. John FitzGerald of the ESRI has said, it is likely that the tax will increase to €1,400.  Therefore, the Minister should be honest with the people.  He has said the household tax will be €2 a week, but if it is €1,400, it will be between €20 and €25 a week.  That is the austerity the people are facing.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to reconsider this proposal, as it is not an option for most.  If we are talking about it in the context of household debt, it is clear that an holistic approach has to be taken.  The suggestion penalties could be imposed over a period of time is an absolute disgrace.  There have been many meetings on this matter in Dublin city.  Some 18 meetings have been held in response and people have said they will not pay this tax.  Almost 200 people opposed to the imposition of a household tax attended a meeting in Gaoth Dobhair.  The Minister should reconsider.</p>

            <p eId="para_839">The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 regulates the tenant-landlord relationship in the private rented residential sector. My Department conducted a review of the Act in 2009 and the incorrect retention of deposits by landlords was identified in the review process as one of a range of issues that merited specific attention. In July 2011 the Government approved the drafting of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill 2011. The General Scheme of the Bill proposes the introduction of fines where a landlord is found to have incorrectly retained a tenant's deposit as a first step to eliminating the problem of deposit retention.  However, my Department is currently liaising with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel regarding the drafting of the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">The Programme for Government 2011 commits to the introduction of a deposit protection scheme and it is important that action in this regard is taken in the context of a strong evidence base. I have therefore asked the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), the independent statutory body charged with the administration of the Act, to commission cost benefit analysis-based research on such a scheme and to report back to me with recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">I understand that the PRTB will be tendering for such research in the coming weeks and I expect that the Board will revert to me with detailed research and recommendations in the first half of 2012.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_844">I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 19 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">A range of work relevant to the reform and development of local government in accordance with the Programme for Government is under way and significant progress is being made.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">In relation to structural reform of the local government system, I announced, on 28 June 2011, a Government decision to create a single local authority to replace Limerick County and City Councils with effect from the local elections in mid-2014. Subsequently the Government decided to establish a unified county council in Tipperary with effect from the same date. Implementation groups have been appointed to oversee planning, preparatory work and initial implementation of the reorganisation process in both Limerick and Tipperary and their work is proceeding. I have also established a Local Government Committee, under section 28 of the Local Government Act 1991, to consider whether the creation of a unified authority in Waterford would be desirable and that committee is due to report to me by end February 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">These measures are being progressed ahead of more comprehensive policy proposals which I intend to bring to Government shortly in relation to local government structures generally at regional, county, and sub-county levels. Decisions in relation to any further changes in local authority structures will be a matter for Government in that context.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">In relation to the efficiency agenda, the work of the independent Local Government Efficiency Implementation Group is progressing. The Group has met on four occasions to date and will report to me at regular intervals, with its first report due shortly. A review of staffing levels in Dublin City Council has been completed and was published in July 2011. The report has identified a number of options for staffing reductions in the Council over the period to the end of 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">Specific measures to modernise local government are underway in parallel with the Efficiency Review Group's recommendations. These include implementation of the programme for Public Service Review and the Public Service Agreement (PSA) in local authorities in areas such as shared services, HR, ICT and procurement. Reports on progress and savings under the Local Government Sectoral Action Plan of the PSA were made to the Implementation Body in May 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">In line with the requirements of the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, I announced the introduction of a household charge in 2012, on 26 July 2011. The announcement reflects the need, in the context of the State's overall financial position, to put the funding of locally delivered services on a sound financial footing, improve accountability and better align the cost of providing services with the demand for such services.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">Finally, options for the greater alignment of community and enterprise functions with the local government system, in accordance with the Programme for Government, are also under consideration in my Department.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Willie Penrose)</from>
            <p eId="para_853">A wide range of property-based tax relief schemes was introduced up to the mid-2000s, including town renewal and living over the shop schemes. While many important developments were encouraged by these schemes, independent reviews concluded that the tax costs of the initiatives were high relative to the outputs achieved and the Department of Finance is in the process of winding down existing schemes in light of the current economic climate and the ongoing legacy costs of such schemes to the Exchequer as investors use their reliefs and capital allowances.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">Similarly, the Urban and Village Renewal Programme 2000-2006, through which grant assistance was provided by my Department to local authorities for a range of interventions to upgrade the fabric of the built environment in cities, towns and villages, ended in early 2008. That scheme involved total EU and Exchequer co-financed expenditure of over €158m. The 2007-2013 Urban and Village Regeneration Programme, administered by my Department, was deferred due to budgetary constraints.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">Nonetheless, my Department remains committed to working with local government and other community development and enterprise stakeholders to ensure that a recovering economy will result in an even distribution of opportunity. In this regard there is a particular need to target in an integrated way urban areas which face particular problems resulting from both the economic downturn and investments in the past which did not facilitate the development of sustainable communities capable of benefiting from the period of high prosperity or coping with the subsequent downturn. Major regeneration programmes in Ballymun and Limerick together with a range of other remedial works schemes across the country are being prioritised to assist in addressing this deficit.</p>

            <p eId="para_869">Statutory responsibility for a youth homelessness strategy rests with my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, while the Health Service Executive (HSE) leads on its implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">In May 2011 my Department was represented at a meeting arranged by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs with a range of interested bodies and service providers at which the current Youth Homeless Strategy was discussed.

            <p eId="para_874">Under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to 2009 it is the function of local authorities to provide the primary response to littering.  My Department's role is to provide the legislative framework for combating litter pollution, and to motivate and energise anti-litter responses as necessary.  It is the responsibility of each local authority to both prioritise and determine the most appropriate course of action to tackle litter pollution within the relevant legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">As stated in the previous reply referred to, the Anti-Litter Awareness Grant Scheme, which is administered by my Department, allows local authorities the opportunity to apply for grant funding for suitable projects such as adopt a road schemes.  In the context of making allocations from the €1 million I have made available under the Anti Litter Awareness Grant Scheme this year, I requested local authorities to examine and investigate the possible roll-out of adopt a road schemes in their functional areas, where practicable.  Of the 34 submissions received from local authorities, 14 have applied for funding of adopt a road type schemes.  This represents a significant increase over the 2010 figures, where 6 local authorities had projects of this nature in operation. It is estimated that the total cost of the projects this year will be in excess of €90,000, compared to approximately €33,000 in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_890">The vision for the future of the housing sector in Ireland, as set in Government's Housing Policy Statement published in June 2011, is based on choice, fairness, equity across tenures and on delivering quality outcomes for the resources invested. The overall strategic objective will be to enable all households access good quality housing, appropriate to household circumstances and in their particular community of choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">The main focus in terms of housing supports provided by Government will be on meeting the most acute needs — the housing support needs of those unable to provide for their accommodation from their own resources. The financial parameters within which we will be operating for the coming years rule out a return to very large capital-funded construction programmes by local authorities. A restructuring of my Department's social housing investment programme to allow for the delivery of new social housing through more flexible funding models will provide key sources of delivery in the period ahead. The social housing leasing initiative and, in particular, the Rental Accommodation Scheme will play a key role as long-term social housing supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">My Department's Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) will continue to provide capital funding for the provision, by approved housing bodies, of housing to meet the accommodation needs of persons with specific categories of need, including older people, people with a physical, intellectual or mental health disability and homeless persons. My Department intends to issue a call for proposals for new voluntary housing projects, including sheltered housing projects, in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">Housing authorities are currently engaged with my Department in a series of Housing Action Plan meetings which include discussion on the social housing investment programme for 2012 and beyond, including in relation to proposals for sheltered housing.

It will be a matter for individual authorities to decide on the nature of these proposals having regard to local housing need.</p>

            <p eId="para_898">Implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) new Code of Practice on Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems Serving Single Houses, as published in October 2009, is one such key measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">Relevant elements of the Code of Practice, which sets out comprehensive requirements in relation to the design, installation and maintenance of on-site wastewater systems, have been called up for building control purposes in the Technical Guidance Document to Part H (Drainage and Waste Water Disposal) of the Building Regulations 1997-2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">While the Code of Practice may pose engineering and planning challenges in certain parts of the country where soil and geological conditions create very difficult drainage conditions, it also sets out a number of potential technical solutions.  These include innovative designs of proprietary wastewater treatment systems, and the consideration of discharges other than to sodden or otherwise unsuitable ground conditions, that can be used to ensure that development on suitable sites can proceed while protecting the environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">The onus is on the installers, manufacturers or suppliers of alternative wastewater systems to demonstrate, with, where appropriate, independently certified test results from a recognised testing laboratory, that their system is capable, having regard to operating conditions in Ireland, of meeting the required EU and Irish performance standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">My Department will continue to work proactively with local authorities in ensuring that the planning system takes proper account of river basin management plans, water quality legislation and new technology in assessing the on-site wastewater treatment and disposal system aspect of proposals for housing to meet the needs of rural communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_910">The first National Housing Development Survey database, published in October 2010, established an authoritative baseline analysis of unfinished housing developments to assist in fully understanding the scale and extent of the issues involved. Last week I published the findings of the 2011 survey. This showed that the number of complete vacant units had decreased by 20% since the 2010 survey from 23,250 to 18,638. Furthermore, 7,343 dwellings recorded as vacant in 2010 are now occupied (a 9.4% increase), while 17,872 dwellings are at various further stages of construction, 8,794 (almost 50%) being nearly complete. I remain committed to exploring all options for bringing suitable unsold residential stock into productive use for social housing purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">The results of the 2011 survey are testimony to the fact that measurable progress is being made in addressing the issues relating to unfinished housing developments and that the policies and initiatives which I have launched since assuming office are beginning to bear tangible fruit.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">The overall approach is being coordinated through the National Co-ordination Committee which, I established and am chairing to oversee implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group on Unfinished Housing Developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">To date, my Department has approved some €2.13 million to eighteen local authorities in respect of 95 estates from the €5 million funding allocation made available to address immediate safety issues. The types of works that have been approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting, and other works to secure sites. My Department will be making further allocations as applications are received from local authorities and assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">The works are being carried out by the individual local authorities, using a mixture of sub-contractors and their own personnel. I am therefore not in a position to furnish numbers of people employed as a result of this initiative.</p>

            <p eId="para_916">The Dormant Accounts Act 2001 together with the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003 and the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2005 provide a framework for the administration of unclaimed accounts in credit institutions (i.e. banks, building societies and An Post) and unclaimed life assurance policies in insurance undertakings.  The main purpose of the legislation is to reunite account holders/policy holders with their funds in credit institutions/insurance undertakings and in this regard, institutions/undertakings are required to take steps to identify and contact the owners of dormant accounts and unclaimed life assurance policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_917">Dormant funds/unclaimed life assurance policies, which have not been reclaimed by the original account/policy holder or their beneficiaries, are transferred each year by the financial institution/insurance undertaking to the Dormant Accounts Fund (the Fund) which is managed by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).  The transfer of monies takes place on the basis that the beneficial owner will have a guaranteed right of reclaim to their property at any time in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_918">Funds may be reclaimed by account holders contacting the institution with whom the account or policy was held — the bank, building society, An Post or insurance company.

My Department has no role in this matter and therefore has no information on the number of account holders involved in reclaims.</p>

            <p eId="para_935">I attach high priority to consumer protection in the area of quality construction of new dwellings.  That is why, in July 2011, I announced a number of measures to be advanced by my Department and local authorities with a view to improving compliance with, and oversight of, the requirements of the Building Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">In broad terms the measures will involve:—</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_937">(a) the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the Building Regulations have been met;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_938">(b) more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective and meaningful oversight of building activity;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_939">(c) standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions;</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_940">(d) better support and further development of the building control function nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">Implementation of these measures is being advanced as quickly as possible in consultation with the relevant stakeholders and I have asked my Department to give the matter priority attention. The regulations required to give effect to the introduction of mandatory certification are currently being prepared and will be the subject of industry and wider public consultation in the near future.  The implementation of the other measures will be progressed by local authorities in consultation with my Department in the context of the wider programme of achieving greater efficiencies in the local government system.</p>

            <p eId="para_948">There is a range of services available to deal with needs arising in cases of domestic violence, both in terms of protection of the abused partner and any children, and any need for emergency accommodation.

The household must also meet the other need and eligibility criteria prescribed in the 2011 regulations in order to qualify for social housing support.</p>

         his plans to increase the resourcing of the Private Rental Tenancies Board. 
        [30404/11]

          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_483">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Willie Penrose)</from>
            <p eId="para_952">While the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) received Exchequer funding for a number of years since its establishment in September 2004, it has operated on a self-financing basis since 2010.  I have no plans to restore Exchequer funding to the PRTB and, in the current economic circumstances, it is critical that the Board continues to manage its financial resources to best effect.  The Board's staffing resources are also constrained and must be managed under the Employment Control Framework designed to contain and reduce staff numbers in the PRTB.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">The PRTB's funding is derived primarily from a proportion of the fee income accruing from tenancy registrations, as set down by ministerial Order. The PRTB is currently entitled to retain 80% of the registration fee income to fund its activities, with 20% going to fund Local Authority inspections of private rented residential accommodation.  It also retains the fees it charges for its dispute resolution services.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">The registration fee for a new tenancy is currently set at €90 or €180 if the tenancy is registered more than a month after the creation of the tenancy.  The fees for the dispute resolution services are €25 for adjudication or mediation and €100 for an appeal to a tribunal. The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 allows the PRTB to change its registration fees having regard to changes in the value of money generally in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">The Board's published accounts are available on its website at <i>www.prtb.ie</i>. The most recently available accounts relate to 2009 and its total expenditure for the year ended 31 December 2009 was €7.391 million. I understand that the Board’s 2010 annual report and accounts will be submitted within a few weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">I am satisfied that the PRTB is actively engaging with its resources challenges and has taken steps to optimise its use of resources.  In this regard it has, for instance, invested significantly in a comprehensive ICT strategy that now facilitates online registration of tenancies and will allow for automation of a range of currently time-intensive manual processes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1060">I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 43 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property, determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function of a local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">The Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis.  The purpose of the revaluation process is to update commercial valuations which will assist in providing a more equitable distribution of rates across those liable to pay rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1063">Local authorities have been asked to exercise restraint in setting the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) in this and previous years and they have responded positively in this regard. Local authorities are also facilitating payment of commercial rates by instalments including by direct debit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1064">Under the legislation the person liable for payment of rates is the person in occupation of a rateable property on the date of the making of the rate by the relevant local authority. The owner rather than the occupier may be liable for commercial rates if the property in question is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate. Should a person's occupancy commence after the date of the making of the rate then that person is not primarily liable for rates for that year.  However, as a subsequent occupier, that person can be held liable for up to two years arrears of rates if they cannot be recovered from the person with whom the primary liability lies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1065">I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and I will continue to keep all matters relating to rates under regular consideration in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1067">I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 350 and 323 of 18 October 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">The Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP) is divided into 4 Axes. Axis 1 deals with competitiveness of the agricultural sector, Axis 2 aims to improve the countryside and environment and the objectives of Axis 3 are to support the diversification of the rural economy and improve the quality of life in rural areas. Axis 4 or the LEADER Axis provides support for the use of a "bottom up" approach to development which ensures that local people are involved in the decision making thereby facilitating sustainable development in a more inclusive way. In Ireland the LEADER approach is used to implement Axis 3 measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069">A significant number of projects funded under the previous LEADER+ programme (2000-2006) and under the Diversification and Business Creation measures of the current RDP involve support for enterprise initiatives that add value to agri-food products. Basic Agricultural products are listed in Annex 1 to the EC Treaty and are commonly called Annex 1 products. Under the main Rural Development Regulation 1698/2005 support/grant aid for adding value to Annex 1 products is facilitated under Axis 1 of the programme. At the start of this year Ireland was notified by the European Commission that support/grant aid for adding value to agri-food products is not eligible under Axis 3 but rather under Axis 1 as detailed in the regulation. As a result of this, grant aid under Axis 3 of the RDP for this type of activity is currently suspended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">A significant part of enterprise activity in rural areas focuses on food and food- related businesses and the continued provision of support for these businesses is critical as we look to ways to generate employment in rural Ireland.  My Department is aware of the seriousness of this issue and is continuing to work with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to seek a solution as soon as possible.  I am not in a position to make any decisions regarding additional funds for the types of project referred to at this time. Any such decisions will be made in the context of the overall budgetary situation in due course.</p>

As part of the process, my Department has made a submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Departmental submissions made in the context of the CRE are a central part of the overall pre-budget deliberations of the Government. As such, release of these documents could not be considered in advance of Government decisions on the forthcoming Budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_1076">The Government is acutely conscious of the difficulties many households are facing in terms of mortgage arrears. Where any borrower, either from a local authority or from a private financial institution, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage proactively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution. The services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service are also available to such borrowers and support is available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.Provisions regarding lending by local authorities for the purposes of house purchase are set out in section 11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. Where a loan stands in default, section 11(10) provides that a local authority may make such monetary arrangements with a borrower as they consider equitable to take account of the particular circumstances of the borrower.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">In addition, my Department issued comprehensive guidance to local authorities on the treatment of mortgage arrears, including local authority mortgages for shared ownership transactions, in March 2010. That guidance was closely based on the Central Bank's first statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">To reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct — which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt — my Department is currently preparing updated guidance to local authorities in consultation with the City and County Managers Association.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">Mortgage interest supplement under the Supplementary Welfare Scheme, administered by the Department of Social Protection, is payable, subject to the qualifying conditions of that scheme, in respect of mortgages under shared ownership transactions, in the same way as in the case of mortgages generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">Under the Shared Ownership Scheme, further support is available through rent subsidy. This is available to households who have a gross household income of up to €28,000 per annum in the preceding tax year. The level of subsidy ranges between €2,550 for incomes up to €13,000 and €1,050 for incomes up to €28,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_1082">Of the 55 recommendations contained in the Report of the High Level Group on Green Enterprise, 17 are directly relevant to my Department. Of those, 6 actions have been fully delivered, including the lowering of thresholds for wind farm approvals under the Strategic Infrastructure Act, the implementation of the Food Waste Regulations and the transfer of responsibility for foreshore licensing to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">Significant progress has been made on the other 11 recommendations under the remit of my Department.  3 of these, namely a decision on the future regulatory structure for the waste sector, coordinated regional waste management plans and further efforts to promote composting and anaerobic digestion, are also relevant to the development of a new national waste policy, which is expected to be complete by the end of 2011, and will ultimately contribute to their achievement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">The Group also recommended that efforts be made to develop additional reprocessing capacity for recovered materials, such as paper, glass and plastic. The recently published Irish Recycled Plastics Arisings Study concluded that 70% of plastic goes to landfill and 30% of recycled plastic remains in Ireland for processing. My Department is now considering how best to utilise this data to develop all-island market opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">In terms of water management, the Group recommended that levels of unaccounted for water should be progressively reduced towards best practice, that volumetric treated water charges for domestic users be introduced and that a single water authority be established.  In relation to these issues</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1086">water conservation measures have been prioritised within the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012;</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1088">the Programme for Government also provides for the establishment of a new, State-owned national water authority to assume responsibility for managing and supervising investment in water services infrastructure; an independent assessment concerning the establishment of such an authority, as provided for in the Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the EU/IMF, is under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">In relation to the Group's recommendation that the monitoring and enforcement of standards in relation to septic tanks be given greater priority, my Department is currently preparing draft legislation which will introduce a registration and inspection system for domestic wastewater treatment systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">The final 2 recommendations of relevant to my Department concerned Green Public Procurement (GPP). Considerable work has been undertaken on the preparation of a GPP Action Plan and I expect to publish the Plan next month.</p>

            <p eId="para_1094">The Government approved the publication of the Report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Mortgage Arrears on 12 October.  In establishing the group, the Government set two core objectives:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1095">To assist those facing real difficulties to remain in their own homes where appropriate, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1096">To ensure a distinction between those who cannot afford to pay their mortgages and those who choose not to pay their mortgages.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">Work is now underway to implement key elements of the report and I will shortly launch two mortgage-to-rent schemes in line with the report's recommendations.  These schemes will operate on a pilot basis initially, subject to prompt review ahead of wider roll-out.  Under each scheme, households in extreme mortgage distress who are eligible for social housing will be able to remain in their homes as social housing tenants with either the lending institution or a housing association taking ownership of the property.  My Department has now begun working with a lender and an approved housing body to make the pilot schemes operational as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1188">I have been advised by the Central Bank that a decision has been taken to require any bank that has received Government capital support to provide an impact analysis of any proposed standard variable mortgage rate increase in terms of the implications for its arrears position and future capital requirements. The Central Bank  has also indicated that the Board of Directors of such a bank must, in future, review and approve this analysis to ensure that proper attention is given to the costs of such actions.   The Deputy may wish to refer to the address given by Mr Matthew Elderfield, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank to the Association of Compliance Officers in Ireland at University College Cork on 14 October 2011. This can be accessed on the Central Bank's website <i>www.centralbank.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1189">It would not be realistic to expect a lender to fix mortgage interest rates for a period of twenty years. This is because the cost of funds is not fixed for such a long period.  Non-recourse mortgages are not a practical solution to the mortgage arrears problem. There are accrued property rights which subsist as a consequence of existing property mortgages; legislation to alter such mortgage contracts could raise constitutional issues. Also the provision of non-recourse mortgages carries a higher level of risk for lenders. This risk would likely be reflected in higher costs to borrowers in the future.  The Deputy may also wish to be aware of the recent publication of the Report of the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group. This report was discussed in the Dail on 18 and 20 October 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_1191">The stamp duty levy of 0.6% applies to the market value, on the valuation date, of assets under management in pension funds and pension plans approved under Irish tax legislation. I cannot say what the precise impact of the levy will be on individual funds, schemes or members as this depends on whether and to what extent pension fund trustees and Life Offices decide to pass on the levy to individual members, given the particular circumstances of the pension funds or pension plans that they are responsible for.</p>
            <p eId="para_1192">I can say that the Finance (No. 2) Act 2011 provisions which introduced the levy include certain safeguards in this area.   The payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, will be entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. However, should the option of reducing scheme benefits be taken, it must essentially be applied in an equitable fashion across the different classes of scheme members that could include active, deferred and retired members. In no case may the reduction in an individual member's or class of member's benefits exceed the member's or class of member's share of the levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1193">The Revenue Commissioners are also afforded oversight authority to review, where they consider it appropriate, instances where benefits are adjusted as a result of the payment of the levy to ensure that any such adjustment is in keeping with the requirements of the levy legislation. In undertaking any such review Revenue may consult with appropriate experts as they see fit. However, before Revenue could act in that regard, instances of concern on foot of actual adjustments made would first have to be brought to their attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1194">As regards the basis for applying the levy, the levy is a relatively small charge on the significant assets of pension funds, much of which are represented by investments outside of Ireland. As the legislation introducing the levy makes clear, it is for a temporary four year period only and pension funds are being asked to make a contribution to getting the domestic economy moving again over that period.   This is a reasonable and targeted tax measure being introduced to fund the various measures set out in the Jobs Initiative.  The country is facing an economic and unemployment crisis and the Jobs Initiative will help tackle that crisis and applying a temporary levy to pension funds is less damaging economically than raising other taxes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1198">As Minister for Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.  The Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for the regulation of credit unions and is independent in the exercise of his duties.  As Minister for Finance, I have no function in relation to the appointment of auditors by credit unions.  The issue raised by the Deputy is a regulatory matter.  I have consulted with the Registrar who advises as follows.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">The position regarding appointment of external auditors in credit unions is set out in Part VII of the Credit Union Act 1997.  The members of a credit union elect the auditor at the AGM. The Central Bank is not involved in the appointment process and any procedural matters including tendering, engagement, fees, etc., are a matter for the credit union concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">However, Section 113(9) provides that where the Central Bank is of the opinion that it would not be in the interest of the orderly and proper regulation of the business of a credit union or its members' interests, it may by notice in writing order the credit union not to elect or re-elect to the office of auditor, or the directors not to fill a casual vacancy in that office with, a named person.  The only circumstance where the Registrar of Credit Unions has powers to appoint an external auditor is when the membership fails to elect an auditor at the Annual General Meeting (AGM).</p>

The strategy was drafted following a review undertaken by the Social Finance Foundation on my behalf, to identify recommended actions to achieve a substantial reduction in financial exclusion over a 3-5 year period — including the introduction of basic payment accounts on a pilot basis in 2012. It is noted in the report that the post office network has the potential to play a key role in the delivery of basic payment accounts. My department has reviewed the submissions received on the report and is assessing the best approach to implementation of the strategy.   Any financial products which are offered by the post office network are a matter firstly for An Post. However, I will examine any proposals An Post may have which relate to the role the post offices might play in the restructured banking landscape.</p>

          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_502">
            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_1216">The Deputy will be aware the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating teaching staff and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to special schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, which now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217">As set out in my Department's Circular 0042/2011, in order for the NCSE to complete the processing of applications for mainstream schools in the first instance, the existing 2010/11 level of SNA supports have been maintained in special schools for the coming school year, other than for schools with declining enrolments, with a review to take place in Autumn of the 11/12 school year. The school referred to by the Deputy has therefore not received a reduction in its SNA staff levels over those applying at the end of the last school year. The review of SNA support at special schools is currently ongoing and I understand that the review of SNA provision at the school referred to by the Deputy will take place in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1218">In relation to teaching posts, Circular 0042/11 states that there are a small number of special schools which have significant excess teacher posts and that the NCSE may therefore contact such schools to review the individual circumstances in these schools. The Circular indicated that the NCSE may suppress a post in schools which have excess teaching posts in order to create a post in a school which does not have excess posts and which has growing pupil numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">The special school referred to by the Deputy caters for pupils with severe/profound disability and ASD. The correct teacher allocation ratio for schools catering for children with severe and profound disability is 6:1. In 2010/11 the school had 7 approved class teaching posts, 3 surplus teaching posts and 28 SNAs. The enrolment is 38 pupils, including the 9 new children enrolled for September 2011. One of the surplus teachers retired at the end of the last school year and the school is not eligible for a replacement. A further surplus post has been withdrawn leaving the school with 1 surplus post above recommended staffing allocation levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220">It is the position of both my Department and the NCSE that given the exceptionally high levels of teaching and support staff which have been allocated to the school, that notwithstanding the outcome of any review, that the school has sufficient support within its overall allocation to enable it to provide for the teaching and care support requirements of all of the children enrolled to the school.</p>

            <p eId="para_1222">The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1223">The school referred to by the Deputy has an allocation of 1 SNA post and 11.25 Resource Teaching Hours.  I wish to clarify that the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.  It is considered that, with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources, there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">The NCSE has now advised all mainstream schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, of their SNA allocation for the current school year, taking into account the care needs of qualifying pupils attending the school. The NCSE has recently published statistical information in relation to the allocation of Special Needs Assistant posts and resource teaching hours to Primary Special and Post Primary Schools. The information is provided on a county by county and school by school basis on its website at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1225">The NCSE also has a retained capacity to respond to emergency cases, or where additional care needs arise for schools as a result of new school enrolments, injuries or diagnoses, during the school year, in the context of existing SNA provision in the school.  The NCSE will advise schools early in the near future of a process to review allocation decisions to ensure that correct procedures were followed and that they comply with my Department's policy. The merits of individual allocation decisions will not be open to appeal under this mechanism.  It will be expected that schools, before requesting a review, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_1250">The Government is proceeding with the drafting of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill on the basis of the General Scheme prepared by my Department. These proposals followed extensive consultations with survivors of residential abuse and the groups which support them, together with a public consultation process. The General Scheme, together with a copy of a Report on the Consultation Process is available on my Department's website. I intend to introduce the legislation in the Autumn with a view to having it enacted by the end of the year. While some former residents advocate a simple distribution of the available money, I believe that the Fund should target resources at services to support former residents' needs. To that end, the General Scheme provides for approved services to include, counselling, psychological support services and mental health services together with such health and personal social services, educational services and housing services as the Fund may determine. Further services can be prescribed as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1251">The Statutory Fund will focus solely on victims of residential institutional abuse, with eligibility being confined to those who received an award from the Redress Board or an award following a court decision or settlement who would otherwise have received an award from the Redress Board. Over 13,000 victims have received awards from the Redress Board to date. I am satisfied that it is the correct approach, with the focus of the Statutory Fund being on those former residents who have successfully completed the redress process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1252">The Government intends that some €110 million will be available to the Fund, this being essentially the cash portion of offers made by religious congregations in the aftermath of the publication of the Ryan Report. To date, €21.05 million of these cash contributions have been received and placed in a special interest bearing account in the Central Bank pending the establishment of the Statutory Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_1253">Funding for the Education Finance Board, which was established on a statutory basis in 2006, has been provided from the €12.7 million contribution provided by the religious congregations under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement specifically earmarked for educational support for former residents and their families. Prior to its establishment, grants were paid to eligible applicants under an administrative scheme. At the end of 2010 the total funds available to the Board was €3.649 million approximately with the Board estimating that the remaining funds would be committed prior to the end of 2011 or shortly thereafter. As noted in the Board's 2010 Annual Report, it has been the Board's policy to estimate the costs to completion of the course and to reserve the amount of these future costs or the balance of the persons overall grant limit whichever is the lower. If all such commitments at 31 December, 2010 were to be realized, the remaining funds available to the Board for new applications would be reduced by an additional amount in the order of €1.358 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">Under the terms of the proposed Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill, the Education Finance Board will be dissolved and its staff will transfer to the Statutory Fund, which will assume its functions in relation to the remaining moneys available to the Board. When the remaining moneys fall below €0.1m, the Minister will direct the National Treasury Management Agency to close the relevant account and transfer the remaining balance to the Statutory Fund and the Fund's functions in relation to the Education Finance Board provisions will be terminated.</p>

            <p eId="para_1256">I have held meetings with educational book publishers, representatives of parents' organisations and the Society of St Vincent de Paul regarding the cost of school textbooks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1257">The following publishers were represented at the meeting with me on 10 October 2011: CJ Fallon, Forum Publications, Educational Company of Ireland, Gill and McMillan, Mentor Books, Educate.ie, An Gúm and Folens.</p>
            <p eId="para_1258">All of the publishers present stated that they were committed to the code of practice where publishers undertook not to publish new or revised editions of textbooks for six years, except in the context of significant change to the curriculum or examinations. Publishers also said they were willing to make minor updates available online in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">Publishers stated that they would allow discount rates for bulk buying to schools, which would support the introduction of book rental or loan schemes in schools. I understand and accept that independent book sellers also make discounts available to schools that make bulk purchases of textbooks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">I requested publishers not to print workbook style material within textbooks as this rendered loan or rental schemes impracticable. The publishers undertook to bear the my concerns in mind in the development of any new publications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">In relation to Junior Cycle reform, I indicated that reform was in the process of being finalised. I stated that I intended to communicate clearly with publishers on the implementation of the reform and to provide adequate notice of curricular changes. The publishers welcomed my intention to treat them as important stakeholders in discussions of implementation of reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">I recognise that educational publishers are independent commercial companies who compete in an open market for the sale of their textbooks. I recognise that I cannot interfere in the matter of price setting but have sought assurances from publishers they will facilitate schools that wish to purchase bulk stock for the operation of rental schemes. I am pleased to have received this assurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">I am very satisfied with the progress made in my two meetings with publishers and I welcome their positive and proactive approach to co-operating with me in reducing the cost of textbooks to students and families. My Department is undertaking a survey of schools to establish the current situation regarding school book rental and loan schemes so that I can consider how I might incentivise the introduction of book loan or rental schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">I have invited the National Parents Councils at primary and post-primary levels to provide me with examples of good practice of book rental schemes. My Department is currently preparing guidelines for schools on best practice in the operation of such schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1266">I am very aware that public procurement can be an important source of business for local enterprises.  In general, SMEs' flexibility and ability to respond speedily to requirements can be advantageous in competing for local contracts.  Current guidelines from my Department require public bodies to promote participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the award of public contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1267">The guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote SME involvement in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime.  The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1268">supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of €25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i> www.etenders.gov.ie</i> website;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1269">less use of "restrictive" tendering procedures and greater use of "open" tendering;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1270">ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1271">sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1272">the needs and possibilities for small businesses to compete and supply to be taken into account when setting up panels / framework arrangements;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1273">encouragement of small companies to combine with others to make a joint bid for a contract that they might not be in a position to perform on their own.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">Public contracts above a certain value must be advertised EU wide and awarded to the most competitive tender in an open and objective process.  The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_1275">The Government will continue to review the situation in regard to SME participation in public procurement and where consistent with achieving value-for-money, probity and transparency, will seek to address any further issues that might be identified.</p>

            <p eId="para_1277">The priorities set out in the Programme for Government for the rationalisation of State Agencies states that rationalisation must be cost effective and lead to a more transparent, accountable and efficient public service.  The overriding imperative is the absolute requirement to achieve major savings in all areas of expenditure and to reduce staff numbers and administrative overheads.  This underscores the need for radical streamlining of bodies, abolishing those bodies whose remit is no longer essential and amalgamation of other agencies or sharing of services between bodies, so that public services and functions can be delivered more cost-effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1278">The question of rationalisation and the reduction in the number of State bodies including Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Valuation Office and the Property Registration Authority is being considered in the context of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and the overall budgetary and estimates process for 2012, and decisions on such matters will be made by the Government over the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1284">The Heritage Service of the Office of Public Works (OPW) is responsible for the conservation, care and management of approximately 780 National Monuments that are in State ownership or guardianship.  Of these, some 50 are presented to the public by way of a dedicated guide service.  Many of the monuments are open year round while others open on a seasonal basis.  These can be visited by prior arrangement or by contacting an OPW appointed key holder. Many other National Monuments that do not have a guide service are freely accessible to the public.  Some monuments, however, are situated on privately owned land and do not have public right of access unless with the permission of the landowner.  A number of monuments may be closed for a period for the purposes of conservation works. It is the policy of the OPW to ensure that as many of the monuments under its care are accessible to the public.  A recent initiative to offer free access on one day each month to all monuments at which a charge normally applies has raised public awareness of these sites and has resulted in a significant increase in visitor numbers.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianHayes" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform" eId="spk_517">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Brian Hayes)</from>
            <p eId="para_1288">The Clontarf seafront area was identified as one of the areas most at risk of flooding in the Dublin Coastal Flood Protection Project study completed in 2005 by international expert consultants Royal Haskoning, which was commissioned by Dublin City Council and partly funded by the Office of Public Works.  Following the completion of that Study, Dublin City Council appointed Royal Haskoning to design a flood relief scheme for the area.  In August 2006 to Dublin City Council's Environmental Consultants for the scheme, OPW provided information on the standards and allowances to be considered in the design process to provide the appropriate level of protection.indicated that, in determining the height of the flood defences, the normal design standards for coastal and tidal flood defences along with the freeboard and Climate Change allowance should be used.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">Dublin City Council then proceeded to design the scheme and it was progressed through the planning process.  The Environmental Impact Statement and the Project were subsequently approved by An Bord Pleanála in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">Although the scheme was being advanced by the City Council, OPW was asked to provide funding towards the costs of the design, which it subsequently did, with a total of €852,000 being provided between December 2007 and November 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">After receiving approval for the scheme from An Bord Pleanála, Dublin City Council decided to advance the scheme as part of the North City Watermain Project.  The procurement process for the overall project, which includes the North City Water Supply Scheme Phases 1 &amp; 2 and the flood defence works, was progressed as one contract for reasons of efficiency and economies of costs.  OPW agreed in principle to provide the funding for the flood defence aspects of the works which were calculated as approximately 46% of the overall costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">OPW has a large number of flood relief schemes at various stages of design and construction throughout the country.  These are normally procured and managed directly by OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts in partnership with the relevant local authority.  In some cases, the local authority, rather than the OPW, acts as the contracting authority. Under this approach, the local authority commissions the design of the scheme, procures the contractors and monitors progress and in doing so, uses the normal planning process, with funding being provided by OPW. In addition to major flood relief schemes, OPW developed the Minor Works Scheme in 2009, which is ongoing and which allows local authorities to make submissions to OPW for funding of localised flood mitigation works and studies with a maximum limit of €500,000 in each case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">The contracting authority for the Clontarf scheme is Dublin City Council.  OPW's role is mainly that of funder and ensuring that appropriate standards of flood defence are provided. Clontarf is the first major coastal flood defence scheme which OPW has been involved with, but the flood defence measures proposed by DCC to be implemented in Clontarf are typical measures which OPW itself would normally include in its fluvial flood relief schemes.  These include construction of wall and earthen embankments which, for example, form part of OPW schemes for the Rivers Tolka and Dodder in Dublin City, Clonmel, Co Tipperary and Mallow and Fermoy, Co Cork.  Demountable defences are features of the schemes in Clonmel, Mallow and Fermoy, while a glass wall has been used in sections of the Waterford City scheme, which is being undertaken directly by Waterford City Council with funding from OPW.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">The City Council has designed the scheme in Clontarf in such a way that incorporates the use of landscaping rather than extensive wall construction, which is designed to minimise impact while providing the appropriate level of flood protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">In response to concerns raised from residents and members of the business community in the last few weeks, Dublin City Council made a presentation to a special meeting of Councillors of the North Central Area Committee last week.  At that meeting, the Council agreed to arrange meetings with the residents with a further Area Committee to take place on the 7 November.  OPW had a member of staff at the meeting who explained that the rationale for OPW providing funding for the scheme is based on the scheme being cost beneficial and that it would conform to the normal standards applying to such coastal schemes.  OPW awaits the outcome of the further consultation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296">OPW received an allocation of €41Million in 2011 for flood relief activities plus a carryover of €4 million from 2010 bringing to €45 million the total available this year.  €2 million was included in this year's allocation for the advancement of the Clontarf scheme.  No definitive guarantees can be given regarding funding in 2012 for the Clontarf scheme.  Much will depend on the outcome of the Government's Review of Expenditure, which is expected to be completed by end-October.  Other demands for funding for other priority schemes could also impact on the availability of funding for the Clontarf scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1305">Aetna will not cease operations in Castleisland until December this year and the facility will be in use up to this time.  It is IDA's understanding that the Company has not expressly decided to give the facility to a statutory body or local authority and that it is still evaluating options but is most likely to seek to sell the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1306">Since the announcement by Aetna of their decision to close their site at Castleisland, IDA Ireland has worked closely with the company to develop a prospectus setting out the skills and capabilities of the workforce and a profile of the facility at Castleisland.  Using the prospectus IDA is marketing the site to potential prospects throughout IDA's global overseas network and all of IDA's operations divisions.  While there has been some initial expressions of interest, engagement is still on-going to attract interest from genuine parties for alternative employment opportunities for the Castleisland site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1307">IDA Ireland's Strategy for County Kerry is:—</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">To work with Local Authorities and relevant infrastructure and service providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure to the region.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1309">To attract new Investment</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1310">To progress the development of a knowledge economy so that the region can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1311">To work with the existing IDA client base and to help them to further develop their presence;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1312">To provide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure Shannon Development carries out the property function in North Kerry while IDA Ireland have responsibility for property in South Kerry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1313">IDA Ireland promotes Kerry as part of an integrated region with access to the county population base of 139,616 as well as the expanded population of both the Mid West and South West Regions with a combined population of 935,039.  Based on the strengths of the region IDA is particularly targeting the ICT (including software), International Financial Services and Globally Traded Business sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1314">To support this strategy, IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions in the region, in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county.  IDA is also working with FÁS to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needed by those in the workforce who are interested in upskilling.</p>
            <p eId="para_1315">IDA continues to market all available land and buildings in the County including its 12 acre Business &amp; Technology Park at Tiernaboul, Killarney, Co. Kerry.  In Tralee, IDA is also marketing the Kerry Technology Park which is owned and managed by Shannon Development in partnership with the Institute of Technology Tralee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1316">In addition to attracting new foreign direct investment, IDA continues to work closely with its existing clients in Kerry to encourage them to expand their operations in the county.</p>

            <p eId="para_1333">In relation to Regulatory Agencies and Statutory bodies, my Department is working to effect the merger of the National Consumer Agency (NCA) and the Competition Authority.  As work on a review of the operation and implementation of the 2002 Competition Act was well underway, rather than give effect to the amalgamation of the NCA and Competition Authority in a stand-alone piece of legislation, to be followed in due course by legislation to amend, reform and update the 2002 Act, it was decided to introduce a single comprehensive Bill and Government has approved the drafting of the Consumer and Competition Bill in July 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1334">In relation to the Employment Rights and Industrial Relations bodies within my Department's remit, I have announced my intention to streamline the work of five bodies currently dealing with employment disputes in the workplace into a two tier structure.  Four of the existing bodies — the Employment Appeals Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, The Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court — are currently within my remit and one— the Equality Tribunal — is currently within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I expect this reform and streamlining project to deliver a measurable improvement in the quality of services provided to users of the State's employment rights/industrial relations dispute resolution services and to reduce the cost of accessing such services for both users and to the State.  I have announced an ambitious timeline for delivery, including a number of initiatives to be delivered by the end of this year.  I have appointed a dedicated Project Team, led by Ger Deering, to drive this reform initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1335">In terms of the Enterprise agencies under my Department's remit, I am currently considering how the policy and research functions of Forfás could be integrated with my Department's resources to further enhance the formulation and development of national enterprise policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1336">As agencies operating under the aegis of my Department, the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) support micro-enterprises (employing up to 10 people) in the start-up and expansion phases and also promote economic activity and entrepreneurship in their areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1337">Within my Department we are currently seeking to determine the extent to which there should be restructuring of the CEBs, and the nature of that restructuring, having regard to the Programme for Government, and to other recommendations on CEB restructuring, to the need to achieve a rational and focused model for entrepreneurs, as well as the need to ensure that there is targeted local delivery of enterprise support, driven by a national enterprise policy, in a manner which eliminates overlap and duplication.</p>

        <b> Deputy Anthony Lawlor</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social Protection</b>
         the steps in place to ensure that persons who are in receipt of jobseeker’s benefit are actively seeking employment; the measures taken to deal with social welfare recipients who have refused a job offer; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [30448/11]

          </question>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_524">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_1342">The jobseeker's schemes provide income support for people who are seeking their first job or have lost work and are seeking alternative employment.  A fundamental qualifying condition for both the jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance is that a person must be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1343">To satisfy this condition, it is necessary for the person to demonstrate that he or she has taken some positive action and is making genuine efforts to secure employment.  If a person fails to satisfy this condition his/her claim will be disallowed.  In addition, an unreasonable refusal to accept an offer of suitable employment may also lead to a disallowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1344">The National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) is the main activation measure for jobseekers and provides for a systematic engagement of the employment services with unemployed people.  The NEAP process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the live register.  It provides a stimulus to job search and affords an opportunity to explore, under professional guidance, the full range of employment and training services offered by FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1345">As one pillar of this overall approach, reduced rates were provided for in the Social Welfare Act 2010, which will encourage jobseekers to improve their skills, in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed, and help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis.  The intent of the reduced rates is to ensure compliance with the activation processes.  Basically, there is a right to a payment but also a matching responsibility on the unemployed person to engage with the system.  This, I think, is a reasonable approach from the individual's and the taxpayers' perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_1346">The reduced rates applying to personal jobseekers payments, may be implemented where a jobseeker:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1347">i) refuses an appropriate offer of training by an officer of my Department;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1348">ii) refuses, or declines to avail of, an offer of training from FÁS;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1349">iii) declines an intervention under the NEAP;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1350">iv) does not attend NEAP meetings with a FÁS officer;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1351">v) drops out of the NEAP process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1352">The relevant legislation provides safeguards for the social welfare recipient in terms of the reasonableness of the intervention being offered.  In common with many social welfare provisions, the new measures allow for discretion on the part of a deciding officer, as an offer of training, education or employment must be viewed in the context of a person's circumstances.  Where a customer has been subject to the reduced rate, the normal rate of payment will be restored from a current date when the person subsequently engages with the NEAP process or takes up offers of training that were made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1353">The NEAP is central to ongoing development in the labour market policy area and will be progressed within the framework of a new National Employment and Entitlements Service which, as provided for in the Programme f or Government, is being established by the Department.  The new service will integrate employment and benefit payment services, currently delivered by FÁS and the Department, respectively, within the Department and will be based on a case management approach with the objective of providing a more customised and personal service to customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1354">In line with good international practice, this new service will focus primarily on activation.  The objective is to encourage and enable customers to embark on developmental pathways appropriate to their needs; pathways to employment, training and/or personal development.  The objective of the new service is to offer users a high level, personalised employment support and prioritise the provision of  more intensive support  for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment.  A key feature of the new service will be that customers will be expected to engage with these options in order to retain their entitlement to full benefit payments.  The measures outlined above support this approach.</p>

The options include payment at a local post office or through a bank, building society or certain credit unions or payment by cheque. The post office is the preferred choice of the majority of customers for the receipt of their social welfare payment.

            <p eId="para_1388">The current contract with An Post for the payment of welfare customers expires on the 31st December 2013.   In line with public procurement guidelines and in the interests of economy, public sector contracts for the supply of products and services are generally awarded following a publicly advertised, competitive tendering process. In addition, the award of public sector contracts with a significant financial value is subject to various EU Directives. This ensures that the taxpayer receives value for money and that all potential suppliers are given the opportunity to put forward for efficient, effective and competitive solutions for consideration and evaluation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">The Department is required to tender for any new contract for the delivery of social welfare payments before the current contract with An Post expires in 2013. In this context, the Department is developing a Payment Strategy to support the modernisation of welfare payment methods. This strategy will enable the Department to continue to modernise the payment of welfare benefits in line with wider Government policies and objectives such as better public services, better and more effective e-payments and the National Payments Implementation Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">It will of course be open to An Post as the current provider to bid for the new contract. The procurement process will be completed in advance of the termination of the contract, in order to ensure continuity of payments to our customers.</p>

The ACTs will help to ensure that all activation and control activities, established and new, across all schemes, are being vigorously applied and augmented with targeted specific approaches based on local knowledge and circumstances.

            <p eId="para_1415">Rent supplement is subject to a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur.  Rent limits are set at levels that enable eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation, having regard to the different rental market conditions that prevail in various parts of the country.  It is essential to ensure that state support for rent supplement tenants, who form a substantial section of the rental market, does not give rise to inflated rental prices with particular negative impact on those tenants on lower incomes, including people in low paid employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">Staff administering rent supplement have the authority to set levels lower than those provided for in the regulations, in respect of sub-divisions of their functional areas, where this is appropriate. This power is provided to reflect the fact that lower rent levels may apply in certain locations within counties.  Under normal circumstances rent supplement is not paid where the rent charged for the accommodation is above the relevant maximum rent limit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">The most recent rent limit review established new maximum rent limits from June 2010.  The rent limits introduced in Co. Kildare were in line with the most up-to-date market data available and I am satisfied that the rent limits are sufficient to enable eligible households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation in Co. Kildare.</p>

This initial phase has been largely devoted to the communication of the goals and content of the Strategy and the setting up of the required organisational and operational structures required for the Strategy’s long-term implementation. The establishment of a number of inter-departmental and inter-agency working groups has been a key aspect of this initial phase.

            <p eId="para_1547">Regulations are already in place for the testing of aggregates.  The Construction Products Directive provides for a system of harmonised technical specifications for construction products.  IS EN 13242:2002 is a harmonised European Product Standard for "Aggregates for unbound and hydraulically bound materials" for use in civil engineering work and road construction.  IS EN 13242:2002 was published by National Standards Authority of Ireland (NASI) in 2002 and came into effect in January 2003: it sets out the rules for producers to demonstrate conformity with the standard.  It requires initial type testing before an aggregate is placed on the market, and these tests to be repeated if the aggregate comes from a new source, if there is a major change in raw materials or when the aggregate is to conform to a new requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">Standard Recommendation (SR) 21, published by NSAI in 2004, provides guidance on the use of IS EN 13242:2002.  SR 21 was revised in 2007 to give additional specific guidance on reducing the risk of reactive forms of pyrite being present in material fill for use under concrete floors in dwellings and buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549">Part C (Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture) of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations sets out the legal requirements for Site Preparation and Resistance to Moisture.  Regulation 3 stipulates that <i>“</i>the floors<b>, </b>walls and roof of a building shall be so designed and constructed as to prevent the passage of moisture to the inside of the building or damage to the fabric of the building.”  The related Technical Guidance Document — C<b> </b>(TGD)<b> </b>provides general guidance on hardcore.  TGD C was amended in 2007 to take cognisance of the additional guidance given in SR 21.</p>

            <p eId="para_1551">Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that where estates have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority, and enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within the relevant period, the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of owners, initiate the procedures for taking the estate in charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">Section 180 was amended in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to provide that a planning authority may take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the planning authority consider that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer.  Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.  The decision as whether to take an estate in charge is ultimately one for the elected members of a local authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_1567">The landfill levy is chargeable on waste presented for disposal at landfill facilities.  The increase in the levy to €50 per tonne which I recently introduced is intended to send a strong price signal to the producers, collectors and managers of waste, to alter behaviour and to encourage a shift away from landfill to more sustainable management of waste.  Further increases in the levy are also planned, to €65 per tonne in 2012 and €75 per tonne in 2013.  I hope to see significantly improved levels of prevention, recovery, recycling and reuse of waste as a consequence of these increases.  As the waste collection market is currently structured, the pricing schemes used by private waste collectors are a matter for determination as between the service providers and consumers of the service, subject, of course, to a service provider's collection permit and other legal responsibilities being complied with.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce competitive tendering for household waste collection, under which service providers will bid to provide waste collection services in a given area, for a given period of time and to a guaranteed level of service.  A public consultation on the issues involved, designed to inform the policy development process, has recently concluded.  The responses received are being examined and I intend to bring policy proposals to Government before the end of the year.  The relative merits of different pricing schemes, including schemes which include a pay-by-weight component, will be among the issues considered during the Government's deliberations on the future approach to regulating household waste collection markets.</p>

            <p eId="para_1570">A number of local authorities, through conditions attached to Waste Collection Permits, require waste collectors to provide a 3-bin service, including the brown bin for organic material, to a set percentage of the households served.  In 2009, the number of local authority areas where household brown bin waste was collected at kerbside increased to 22 from 16 in 2008. I am anxious to see an intensification of measures to achieve more appropriate collection and treatment of household organic wastes.  A Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) on a set of draft regulations is being finalised currently which, if brought into operation, would have the effect of requiring authorised waste collectors to provide a food waste collection service to households on a phased basis.  I expect to complete the RIA and make a decision in respect of the proposed regulations before the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1574">Responsibility for performance of local authority functions is shared between the elected members, as public representatives, and the manager.  However, the majority of the major decisions are reserved as the exclusive prerogative of the elected members who also enjoy various powers which enable them generally to oversee and direct the activities of local authorities and ultimately to direct a manager as to the manner in which an executive function is to be exercised in any particular case.  The manager is also subject to statutory requirements regarding the provision of information to the elected members in relation to business of the authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1575">Authorities are required under the Local Government Act 2001 (Section 237A) Regulations 2003 to put in place arrangements to provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the supply of specified documentation to Oireachtas members.  They are also required to deal with requests for access to information by a parliamentary representative as expeditiously as possible and in accordance with a proper level of customer service.  In this regard, local authorities are obliged to put in place arrangements to ensure that systems, procedures and time frames equivalent to those used by them in relation to correspondence from local authority members also apply in respect of parliamentary representatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1576">I refer also to the reply to Questions Nos. 15 and 19 on today's order paper, which indicates the significant progress being made in relation to the reform and development of local government in accordance with the Programme for Government.  This programme of work involves an emphasis on early implementation of individual components of the reform agenda which can be advanced in the short and medium term, while building progressively towards overall sectoral reform and development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1577">Initial decisions have concentrated on local government structural arrangements at city and county level, which is a key element of the local government system.  Building on the decisions made to date and work underway, I intend to bring more comprehensive policy proposals to Government shortly in relation to local government structures generally at regional, county, and sub-county levels.  In this context I will also indicate further aspects of the local government system on which policy proposals will be brought to Government, including such matters as local authority powers, governance, civic leadership and community engagement.</p>

            <p eId="para_1579">Where any borrower, including a borrower purchasing under the shared ownership scheme, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage proactively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution.  The services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service are also available to such borrowers and support is available through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1580">Provisions regarding lending by local authorities for the purposes of house purchase are set out in section 11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  Where a loan stands in default, section 11(10) provides that a local authority may make such monetary arrangements with a borrower as they consider equitable to take account of the particular circumstances of the borrower.  In addition, my Department issued comprehensive guidance to local authorities on the treatment of mortgage arrears, including local authority mortgages for shared ownership transactions, in March 2010.  That guidance was closely based on the Central Bank's first statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned. To reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct — which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt — my Department is currently preparing updated guidance to local authorities in consultation with the City and County Managers Association.</p>
            <p eId="para_1581">Mortgage interest supplement under the Supplementary Welfare Scheme, administered by the Department of Social Protection, is payable, subject to the qualifying conditions of that scheme, in respect of mortgages under shared ownership transactions, in the same way as in the case of mortgages generally.  Under the Shared Ownership Scheme, further support is available through rent subsidy.  This is available to households who have a gross household income of up to €28,000 per annum in the preceding tax year.  The level of subsidy ranges between €2,550 for incomes up to €13,000 and €1,050 for incomes up to €28,000.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Willie Penrose)</from>
            <p eId="para_1584">The vision for the future of the housing sector in Ireland as set out in the Government's Housing Policy Statement, launched in June 2011, is based on choice, fairness, equity across tenures and on delivering quality outcomes for the resources invested.  It is predicated on a more integrated and tenure-neutral approach to social housing provision and will involve a much greater role for approved voluntary and co-operative housing bodies as providers of social housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1585">I intend to develop an enabling regulatory framework for the voluntary sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector and to its external partners as it takes on an expanded role.  I will develop this framework in consultation with the sector but I expect it will:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1586">assist approved housing bodies to develop key governance and management structures to facilitate an expanded remit;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1587">provide independent scrutiny and validation of such bodies' competencies, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1588">place sustainable housing management policies and practices at the heart of a coordinated approach to the development of the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">Under the terms of my Department's voluntary housing funding schemes, approved housing bodies are responsible for the proper management and maintenance of dwellings funded under these schemes and for the operation of letting policies, the fixing of rents and compliance with all relevant statutory requirements.  In the case of family-type accommodation provided by approved voluntary and co-operative housing bodies under my Department's Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme, tenants are drawn from the local authority housing waiting list and rents are largely based on the local authority Differential Rents Schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1590">In the case of accommodation provided under the Capital Assistance Scheme, which is aimed at persons with special housing needs such as elderly, the homeless or persons with a physical or intellectual disability, rents are charged at a reasonable rate having regard to tenants' income.  Given that the circumstances of individual tenants may change many times during the period of their tenancy, it is accepted that the rent payable by a tenant to an approved housing body should be capable of review in light of such changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1591">The development of a regulatory framework will take time.  In the meantime, I wish to work with the sector on the development of a voluntary code which, I hope, most approved housing bodies will sign up to over time.  This code, which I would like to agree in 2012, will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop a longer-term statutory framework that will best support the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1592">It is also my intention to extend the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act to those segments of the voluntary and cooperative housing sector that most closely parallel the Act's current remit.  The intention is to provide the same security of tenure and access to dispute resolution mechanisms as currently exist in the private residential sector.  This would be a significant step for equality of treatment of tenants of voluntary housing bodies and would address shortcomings in the current system around issues such as inequitable rents policies and where arrangements for dealing with rent arrears are perceived as unfair.</p>

            <p eId="para_1594">The overall objectives for investment in water services are to ensure that the timing and scale of investment facilitates economic and other development, achieves compliance with statutory requirements and promotes environmental sustainability objectives.  The main vehicle for achieving these objectives is the multi-annual Water Services Investment Programme.  The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 is available in the Oireachtas Library.  This programme is complemented by funding for group water schemes and small public water and wastewater schemes under the Rural Water Programme.  A total of €435 million in Exchequer capital resources has been made available for these programmes in 2011.</p>

The Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the EU/IMF commits Ireland to undertaking an independent assessment of the establishment of such an authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1596">Work on the independent assessment is under way.  The assessment will examine the optimal organisational structures for Irish Water, including its proposed powers and responsibilities, and will consider in detail the legal, financial and organisational structures together with an implementation plan.  This plan will take account of the need to ensure that this critical public service is delivered efficiently during the transition and that there is no loss of momentum in the delivery of key projects.  It is intended that the outcome of the assessment will be considered by Government together with proposals for the establishment of Irish Water before the end of 2011.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Willie Penrose)</from>
            <p eId="para_1598">Local authorities have long led the way in dealing pro-actively and sympathetically with mortgage arrears.  They can and do exercise the powers available to them and endeavour, in all arrears cases, to engage proactively and constructively with a distressed borrower with the aim of enabling a household remain in their home.  The available data strongly bears this out and suggests that repossession, where it does occur, is always a last resort.</p>
            <p eId="para_1599">Local authority borrowers have received considerable protection from the worst effects of the downturn in terms of their borrowing costs.  The effective rate for borrowers has come down by 2% since end November 2008 and now stands at just 3.25%.  These rates represent exceptional value by comparison to rates charged by commercial lenders; as of now, the local authority rate is more than 1% lower than the average market variable rate.  Provisions regarding lending by local authorities for the purposes of house purchase are set out in section 11 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. Where a loan stands in default, section 11(10), and more recently section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, provide that a local authority may make such monetary arrangements with a borrower as the authority considers equitable to take account of the particular circumstances of the borrower.</p>
            <p eId="para_1600">In addition, and to support consistency of approach and ensure best practice across all local authority areas, my Department issued guidance last year, based on the Regulator's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.  Also, to reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct — which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt — my Department is currently preparing updated guidance to local authorities in consultation with the City and County Managers Association.</p>
            <p eId="para_1601">The single most important advice for any borrower facing difficulties in meeting repayments — whether their mortgage is with a local authority or private institution — is to engage early, proactively and constructively with their lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution.</p>

            <p eId="para_1606">The primary objective of water conservation is to reduce water loss and leakage in the distribution networks to an economic level and to address high levels of unaccounted for water.  Since the national water conservation programme was rolled out in 2003, over €187 million has been specifically invested in water conservation by my Department.  In addition, local authorities fund active leakage control, detection and repair from their own operational budgets.  Most of the effort to date has been focused on putting in place the water management systems to allow for active leakage control and better planning of mains rehabilitation.  Most local authorities have now prepared water mains rehabilitation strategies, which set out the priority mains for replacement and repair over the coming years and provide the platform for accelerated investment in this area over the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1607">Such investment is a key priority under my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2010 to 2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The Programme makes provision for the commencement of water conservation contracts to the value of over €300 million over the programme period.  It is estimated that this investment will allow for some 640km of mains to be rehabilitated.  Funding is particularly targeted at areas where the level of unaccounted for water is unacceptably high.  Over time, this investment coupled with ongoing active leakage control should lead to marked reductions in unaccounted for water and improve service to customers.  Progress will continue to be monitored on an annual basis through the local authority service indicators and through the collection of data from local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1608">A review of the progress under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010 to 2012 published in July this year, generally indicated the good progress is being made on rolling out this more intensive water mains rehabilitation programme.  It is expected that by the end of 2011, some 25 new water mains rehabilitation projects will have commenced.</p>

My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy and guidance, and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment (within the overall funding available) of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to the approved purchase of fire appliances and equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1614">The cities of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford have full-time fire services, and Drogheda and Dundalk have a combined full-time and retained service.  Fire services in all other communities are provided by the retained system where, in the event of an emergency call, the relevant group of fire-fighters are alerted, respond to their stations and turn-out.  The retained services provide an excellent model of service delivery where, to a substantial degree, a contingent rather than continuous capability is required.</p>

This means that when this legislation is enacted newly appointed judges will no longer be entitled to appoint an usher or crier.  Judges will still require support staff and serving judges may continue to avail of the existing structures but the repeal will allow the Courts Service to develop over time, in consultation with the judiciary and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, a support structure that will be appropriate to the needs of the  judiciary and the requirements of the modern courts system.</p>

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of submitting written representations setting out reasons why he should not be deported.  He was also advised of his entitlement to submit an application for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.

            <p eId="para_1734">An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was received in the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) in May 2005.  On examination of the application submitted it was determined that the person in question did not meet the statutory residency requirements as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. The person concerned was informed of this in a letter issued to him on 26 May, 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1735">Section 15 of that Act provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. The conditions are that the applicant must — be of full age; be of good character; have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; have, before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows—(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and (ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded.  These include — periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State; periods granted for the purposes of study; periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act, 1996.  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the prescribed statutory requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_1744">The persons concerned are a mother, who lodged an asylum application in October, 2005, and her two young children in respect of whom separate asylum applications were lodged in June, 2010. Their respective asylum applications were refused following the consideration of their individual cases by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1745">Arising from the refusal of their respective asylum applications, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the persons concerned were notified, the mother by letter dated 14th October, 2009 and the children by separate letters dated 14th October, 2010, that the then Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them.  They were each given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against them.  In addition, they were notified of their respective entitlements to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1746">The persons concerned submitted individual applications for Subsidiary Protection.  However, on 4th March, 2011,  the mother, through her legal representative, withdrew her application.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">Following consideration of the children's Subsidiary Protection applications, it was determined that they were not eligible for Subsidiary Protection.  The children were notified of these decisions by letters dated 20th June, 2011 and 21st June, 2011 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1748">The position in the State of all three persons concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before final decisions are made.  Once decisions have been made, these decisions, and the consequences of the decisions, will be conveyed in writing to the persons concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1749">I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

            <p eId="para_1937">By way of background, the Deputy might wish to note that the person concerned is a failed asylum applicant. Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 7th April, 2004, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.</p>

Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1939">The Deputy will appreciate that the purpose of requiring production of a national passport is to establish a person's identity and nationality so that international travel and residence can be facilitated. Permission to reside takes the physical form of some type of passport endorsement such as, in the Irish case, a residence stamp.  Given the importance of ensuring that an immigration permission be availed of only by the person for whom it is intended, it has become a fundamental requirement in immigration regimes around the world that foreign national visitors or residents must be in possession of a valid passport so that the appropriate immigration permission may be placed within it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1940">In the context of the person concerned, his identity and nationality has not been definitively established. As a result, it is in his interests to provide my Department with documentation which attests to his identity and nationality so that a final decision can be made in his case.</p>

This is comparable to Ireland, where over 98% of the population speak English.</p>
