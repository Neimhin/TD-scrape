          <p eId="para_4">Is mór an onóir dom a bheith san iomaíocht don phost an-tábhachtach seo, Leas-Cheann Comhairle Dháil Éireann. Tá sé an-tábhachtach go roghnófaí duine cosúil liom nó Teachta Connolly, duine a bhfuil an Ghaolainn aige nó aici agus atá in ann díospóireacht trí Ghaolainn a reáchtáil. Tugaim geallúint go n-oibreoidh mé go dian ar son gach duine sa Teach seo, is cuma cén páirtí ina bhfuil sé nó sí. Tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh seans ag cúlbhinseoirí Dháil Éireann ach go háirithe a bheith páirteach go hiomlán sa Dáil. Déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall a bheith neamhspleách agus chun cothrom na Féinne a thabhairt do gach duine gach lá a bheinn sa Chathaoir.</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> It is a great honour for me to be nominated by my party, Fine Gael, and by Fianna Fáil agus an Comhaontas Glas to contest this election to the post of Leas-Cheann Comhairle. It is a great honour to be given that opportunity. I acknowledge everybody here, regardless of party or background. We all have the same mandate. We are all Teachtaí Dála. We are the voices of the people. We are democracy in action. This is where that must work best of all. </p>
          <p eId="para_6"> If I am elected as Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I promise always to be fair to everybody, to be impartial and to give due respect and recognition to everybody's point of view, regardless of what it is. My door will always be open to all Members to listen to any views they may have and to take on board ideas and suggestions. As a politician, I believe in inclusion in our society and in our Oireachtas. I also believe in dialogue. Above all, if I am elected to this position, I will be businesslike and fair and will always strive to uphold the recognised rights of Members. </p>
          <p eId="para_7"> Speaking as someone with a lot of experience as a backbencher, I know how hard it is to become a Member of this House. I know what it is to fight elections. I also know, however, that we are here most of all to represent our constituents and their views and to fight for our communities and the people of our counties or districts. We are all committed and dedicated to that. I am aware of the sacrifices that Members and their families have made that have allowed them to vote here today. I recognise the importance of raising issues for one's constituency and of Topical Issue debates. It is important to be able to get messages out when raising issues with Ministers or when holding a Minister to account. Although I would not be responsible for committees in this role, I also understand how important it is to interrogate and to make sure that State bodies, public bodies and semi-State bodies are made properly and absolutely accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> If Members vote for me, I will guarantee them fairness and equality. I will be absolutely impartial. My record is good. I have acted as Mayor of Drogheda on three separate occasions. I have a lot of experience in public life as a town councillor, county councillor, Senator, Deputy, Minister of State, backbencher and, recently, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport. Members will recall the inquiry we held into the issues regarding the Football Association of Ireland. I believe I showed myself to be fair and impartial to everybody. If Members vote for me, as I hope they will, I will absolutely guarantee them respect, fairness and impartiality. Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht an seans labhairt inniu.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_9">Tá sé deacair seasamh anseo agus mé féin a chur os comhair an Tí mar iarrthóir sa toghchán seo. Tá sé deacair mé féin a mholadh. I ndáiríre, ní hé sin atá i gceist agam mar tá ról an Leas-Cheann Comhairle ró-thábhachtach do mholadh.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">Táim ag seasamh anseo mar bhean láidir, le taithí agus le cáilíochtaí cuí, agus mar dhuine a bhí ag feidhmiú mar chathaoirleach ar feadh tréimhse ó 2016. Le linn na tréimhse sin, tá súil agam gur shaothraigh mé bhur meas mar chathaoirleach a bhí cóir agus cothrom. Táim ag seasamh anseo inniu ag lorg bhur dtacaíochta. Chuir sé gliondar ar mo chroí nuair a chuir mé m’ainm chun cinn agus fuair mé tacaíocht ó na páirtithe beaga uile, ó Shinn Féin agus ó ghrúpaí éagsúla neamhspleácha. Thug sé sin spreagadh dom leanúint ar aghaidh.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> Tá sé tábhachtach go gcuirtear bean chun cinn don phost seo. Níl mé ag lorg bhur dtacaíochta nó bhur vótaí mar bhean, ach mar dhuine atá ábalta agus atá taithí aici. Chomh maith leis sin, tá deis ag Teachtaí inniu cinneadh a dhéanamh chun an stair a athrú. Le breis agus céad bliain anois, ní raibh bean riamh sa Chathaoir sin mar Cheann Comhairle nó mar Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Tá na fíricí liom agus ní mór dom iad a chur san áireamh. Tá sé tábhachtach go gcuirtear bean chun cinn mar, taobh amuigh den Rialtas agus ceannairí an Fhreasúra, is iad róil an Cheann Comhairle agus an Leas-Cheann Comhairle na róil ab fheiceálaí do mhuintir na tíre. Sin iad na daoine a fheiceann muintir na tíre ag stiúradh na Dála seo agus is gné lárnach den phróiseas daonlathach iad.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> I stand here before my fellow colleagues today. It is not easy to stand here and praise myself, but that is not my purpose. I am standing on my record as a politician, locally from 1999, as Mayor of Galway, and of working in different employments, which has been a privilege and has added to my experience. I hope that since 2016 I have earned the respect of my colleagues as a fair and just chairperson. I realise the fundamental importance of the role of Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and that of the Ceann Comhairle, which has been honourably filled by an Teachta Seán Ó Fearghaíl. It is essential that we have somebody who realises the importance of the role and the essential aspect of that to the functioning of democracy in this Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> In 101 years, there has never been a female in the Chair, either as Ceann Comhairle or as Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I point that out not by way of saying, please vote for me as a woman, but because, first, it is very important symbolically that we have had a list of male Chairs and males in the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle and, uimhir a dó, that there has never been a woman, but uimhir a trí, it is the most visible aspect of our democracy outside of the Taoiseach, the Government and the leaders of the Opposition. The Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle are the most visible aspect of our democracy. They are what the people of Ireland see, and it is important that we have gender equality in that role. It is important that we take that step today based on capability and experience. It is very important to me and to the people to whom I have spoken that the role would be filled by a Member of the Opposition, in the interests of balance and appearances, but also in the interests of reality, so that we would have a balance ensuring that democracy takes place in this Chamber and, I hope, in the Dáil as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> I assure the House that in recent years I have gained a deep insight into the role of Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I have learned – it has been a humbling experience for me – to listen from that seat to the effort made by all Deputies to represent their constituencies. If elected, I promise to continue to be fair and just. I realise that Deputies are elected to speak for the people who elected them, and I hope there will be an alignment at some time in the future between doing one's best for the people and also for the common good. Go raibh míle maith agaibh go léir agus táim ag tnúth leis an toghchán.</p>

As Members have already been provided with ballot papers, they should not leave the auditorium until after the votes have been cast. We will now proceed to the secret ballot.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> I will now go through a number of instructions relating to the ballot. The ballot will be counted under the proportional representation, single-transferable vote system. Accordingly, Members may number the candidates in the order of their choice. If a Member inadvertently spoils his or her ballot paper, it should be presented to me. I will inspect the ballot paper and may decide to allow a replacement to be issued. In such cases, I will retain the original ballot paper and issue a certificate in order that another ballot paper can be issued by the officials at the doors.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> Members will have ten minutes in which to mark their ballot papers in their seats. After the ten minutes have elapsed, the ushers will direct Members to cast their votes in the ballot boxes provided. Members may leave the auditorium when they have cast their vote. The poll will remain open until 10.15 a.m. When the poll has closed, the ballot boxes will be removed from the auditorium and kept in a secure location. They will be brought to the count centre in the foyer on level 4, where the count will take place today at 2 p.m. Members will now have ten minutes in which to mark their ballot papers at their seats.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">Before Members are invited to cast their votes, I call on the Superintendent to confirm the ballot boxes to my left and right and the two ballot boxes located on level 4 are empty.</p>

            <p eId="para_24">As the Minister will be aware, a significant number of renters have lost income or jobs as a result of Covid-19 restrictions. We are all concerned about the impact of what we are calling the rent arrears debt burden on both tenants and the rental sector overall.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> Will the Minister outline if he has received the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, research report his Department commissioned on this issue and outline what his plans are to deal with this rent arrears burden?</p>

            <from>Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government (Deputy Darragh O'Brien)<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_26">I thank Deputy Ó Broin for raising this important issue. It is important we understand that we deal with any issues that relate to residual debt, particularly, with renters, due to losing jobs or income because of the Covid-19 pandemic. As the Deputy will be aware, tenants are required to pay rent to their landlord during the Covid-19 emergency period and in the event of tenants having difficulty doing so, they are encouraged to engage with landlords at the earliest opportunity. My Department recently published a guidance document on Covid-19 support for both tenants and landlords that sets out emergency rental measures, income and other supports available to tenants and landlords during this emergency period. That document is available on the Residential Tenancies Board's website and it is also a frequently asked question so it is pretty handy. It is prominent on that site to help people.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> Regarding the ESRI report, as the Deputy will be aware, my Department operated a programme of collaborative research principally focused on housing economics. Under this programme, researchers from the institute and my Department prepared a research paper exploring the short-run implications of the Covid-19 pandemic on the private rental market. The research paper is focused on rental payment affordability and the potential incidents of arrears during the first three months of the pandemic among non-supported private market renting households, that is, among renting households that did not receive any housing subsidies. Changes in consumption patterns arising from public health measures are also considered in the paper. I am glad to say the preliminary research findings do not identify a significant rent arrears problem emerging during the first three months of the pandemic. I do not have that report yet, but I have been in contact with the ESRI and expect to receive it in the coming days. Once I receive it, I intend to share and publish it because it will be important that we work on it together as an Oireachtas.</p>

            <p eId="para_28">I thank the Minister for his response. Sinn Féin conducted an online survey of renters recently and more than 1,000 renters replied with a good geographical, age and income spread. While the survey does not claim to be scientifically representative, it gives us an insight. Some 60% of respondents said they had lost income due to Covid-19 and a significant number, almost 70%, believed they would have rent arrears of up to €3,000 after the first three months. A further 13% expected the rent arrears to go up as much as €5,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> We would not have expected significant rent arrears in the first month because people would have paid their month's rent in advance and possibly even in the second month. However, given that a disproportionate number of those who are on the pandemic unemployment benefit, PUP, are young renters in sectors of the economy that are not going to recover fully, certainly, until the very end of this year, will the Minister give a commitment to work with the Opposition and landlords' and tenants' representative organisations to put together a proper pathway to deal with what could be a significant level of rent arrears on the other side of Covid-19?</p>

            <p eId="para_30">This is going to be an issue and we must base our response on the scientific research. The Deputy mentioned Sinn Féin has carried out research. I am carrying out research through the ESRI and the initial response from that is there has not been a massive increase. However, I take the point it is in the first three months and we have got to watch that.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> Measures like the PUP and temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, have helped and many of our renters are in the hospitality sector and sectors that have been badly hit by the pandemic. I use this opportunity to remind people we also have the emergency rent supplement payment and only 7,000 applicants have applied for it. That is a concern and I have raised it on a regular basis in every media interview I have done to get that support out there. People should not fall into rent arrears due to losing their job or their wages being reduced due the pandemic. Once the report is published, I will share it and I am happy to discuss it with all Members of the Dáil.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eoin Ó Broin<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_32">I thank the Minister for his constructive reply and I absolutely share his concern about the low level of uptake of the rent supplement. That is because the previous and current Ministers with responsibility for social protection and the Department are not doing enough to promote that payment. I echo the Minister's call for people to avail of it. If one looks at the latest figures from the Department on rent supplements, the average rent supplement payment currently for those 7,000 applicants is €670 per month. In Dublin, it is only €783 per month, and given that average rents in Dublin now are €1,700 per month, that shows that even if one is getting the rent supplement, and it is a good support, there is still the very real possibility of significant arrears.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> I also urge the Minister to not only engage with us, but to actively consider the possibility of including partial or full write-downs of arrears as part of an overall package, including interest-free payment holidays for landlords on their mortgages as well as the rent supplement. This will ensure the burden of those rent arrears is not left solely at the door of renters but is fairly shared across all concerned.</p>

I would say to Members that we need to look at further protection of tenants' rights on a permanent basis as well. That is why in the next couple of days I intend to bring to Cabinet a new residential tenancies (amendment) Bill which I will have in the Oireachtas next week. There are some permanent measures to strengthen rights for tenants, but it will also look at the area, particularly, around rent arrears and how we can flag them sooner and provide assistance to tenants, so we do not build up a large amount of rent arrears. I look forward to bringing that Bill to the House next week and to constructive engagement with those in the Opposition on it. I will act once I have the data and research, based on the facts the ESRI bring to me in the coming days.</p>

            <p eId="para_38">I thank the Deputy for his question. The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 introduced what the previous Government defined as a new streamlined arrangement to enable planning applications for strategic housing developments, SHDs, of 100 units or more or student or shared accommodation developments of 200 bed spaces or more to be made directly to An Bord Pleanála for determination.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> Section 4(2) of the Act provided for the possibility of the extension of the SHD arrangements beyond their initial end date of 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2021. The Deputy will be aware of that. This is subject to the undertaking of a review of the operation and effectiveness of the SHD arrangements and the laying of a report, as well as the Minister's conclusions on that report, before each House of the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> In this regard, an external SHD review group was established by the previous Minister in June 2019. The report of the review group was received by the previous Minister on 24 September 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> The previous Minister signed an order on 2 December 2019 to extend the SHD arrangements to 31 December 2021, which is the end date of Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. That is the maximum period for which SHD arrangements could be extended under the Act. Copies of the reports are available on my Department's website. I am sure the Deputy has one.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> The new Programme for Government: Our Shared Future commits to not extending the SHD arrangements beyond their legislative expiry date of 31 December 2021. I give a commitment again in the House that there will be no further extension to the SHD arrangements. Given that a recent review was carried out, I have no plans to initiate a further review of the SHD provisions prior to the expiry of those arrangements. I will not extend them beyond 31 December 2021.</p>

            <p eId="para_43">I am glad to hear the Minister say that because he was quite vocal in his constituency on this matter. Fianna Fáil representatives in my constituency were very concerned about this legislation on the basis that it was not doing what it was designed to do because a number of planning cases ended up in the High Court and it was overriding the powers of the local authority. When something overrides a local authority, it overrides the democratically constituted development plan of the city.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> As people know, councillors have limited powers but one of the powers they do have is to put together a development plan, which includes zonings. If legislation can override that and people can go directly to An Bord Pleanála for developments comprising more than 100 units, this means that An Bord Pleanála does not have to be bound as rigidly by the zonings, which has led to a lot of controversy about certain lands which are zoned in a particular way. I know the Minister will appreciate that. I want him to reaffirm his commitment that he will not extend SHD legislation beyond the date he has indicated.</p>

To wind it down now would take as long as it would take for it to expire. I can give the Deputy a firm commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> Colleagues in my party also raised concerns about this matter on a number of occasions. In the programme for Government we have made a commitment that there will be no further extension beyond the expiry date of the SHD process. I want to make sure that our local authorities and planning teams are resourced so that they are able to deliver housing that is sustainable for our people and the infrastructure that is badly needed. My focus, as Minister, and that of my Department, along with my colleagues, is to deliver homes for people and families. That is what we intend to do. The SHD provision will not extend any further than its expiry date. I can give the Deputy that commitment.</p>

            <p eId="para_47">It is crucially important for local democracy that people elect their local councillors and that those councillors oversee the development plan, the running of the city and zonings. The latter are there for particular reasons, namely, to protect open spaces and build communities which can thrive into the future and which people can live in and enjoy. Councillors and council planners are there to oversee a city, county or area that works. The legislation to which I refer is particularly destructive in that regard. I am glad the Minister has recognised that and that we can work together to ensure that it will not be renewed. We will hold the Minister to that commitment because we do not want him to change his mind six months or a year from now.</p>

We will need to work together on the joint committee on housing, local government and heritage, as it will be constituted, on how we can strengthen resources within our local authorities and planning teams so that we can deliver good plans more quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> One of the arguments going back to the passing of this legislation was that there was a hold-up in the planning process in 2016. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to the use-it-or-lose-it clause for planning permissions that relate to any development of over ten homes. As a Government, we will address that and I look forward to working with the Deputy on it because if someone is granted planning permission there should be a reasonable time given for that person to activate it. People should not be allowed to continuously extend planning permission or flip it over. I can give the Deputy a firm commitment that there will be no extension past the expiry date of SHDs.</p>

I have a concern that he seems to have two different and competing definitions of what constitutes affordable housing. During the election campaign he correctly called for affordable homes to be delivered at a cost of €250,000 or less, a position shared by Sinn Féin. More recently, he is on the record of the Dáil as saying that setting absolute limits on the price of affordable homes is flawed and that he is instead opting for the equity share model. Can he clarify which of the two models he is basing his scheme on and the full price he will expect people to pay for much-needed affordable homes?</p>

            <p eId="para_52">I thank the Deputy. As he knows, I am committed to putting affordability back at the heart of our housing system through the expansion and acceleration of State-backed affordable housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> Long-term financial sustainability is an important guiding principle to ensure that individuals and families can be helped to secure affordable housing on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> Therefore, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, under which affordable homes for purchase will be made available, provides for a charge equal to the percentage discount on market value up to a maximum of 40%. The amount charged must be repaid to the Housing Authority by the end of the charge period of at least 25 years. It may also be paid off by instalments anytime after the first five years of the charge period.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> Since taking up office at the end of June I have established two top-level groups of delivery partners. One will target homelessness services and social housing provision in the immediate term and another will work on homelessness and social and public housing. In the weeks ahead I will be expanding the work to encompass affordable housing. I have started that work, building on the work I did in opposition and on the commitments I made in my party's manifesto and those contained in the programme for Government. While I am preparing and doing that work, I will not inhibit what might be in it. There will be a number of delivery mechanisms in an affordable scheme that works.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> While I mentioned ceilings and rates on salaries and prices, I remind the Deputy that the motion brought forward by Sinn Féin on affordable housing referred to basic salary caps of €75,000 for couples, which is not helpful. I say that because in urban areas, such as the greater Dublin area, a couple earning average incomes will be over that threshold. I want to make sure that cohort is included in proposed schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> I will not set a ceiling on prices yet. I will bring a detailed report on delivery to the House and publish it in the autumn. I seek feedback. The Deputy has published a scheme which is very similar to one of mine. We all want to make sure that we provide affordable housing which can be purchased by working people.

            <p eId="para_58">I thank the Minister. The problem is that there are two ways of addressing this issue. The first is that houses are built and sold at cost price and, in that scenario, the price can be determined at the outset. The alternative is to take a market price at a discount, but that discount must be repaid. That second model is of shared equity, as the Minister has just mentioned. The difficulty is that when that model was used most recently, when Fianna Fáil was most recently in government, it caused problems when the crash of 2008 happened because, under the old shared ownership scheme, 44% of shared ownership householders fell into significant mortgage arrears in the years that followed. That was four times the mortgage arrears rate for the overall economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_59"> Shared equity is not affordability. Rather, it is simply a way to get around the Central Bank's sensible macroprudential rules. Will the Minister opt for the full-cost recovery model which would allow for the delivery of genuinely affordable homes - at prices in Dublin, for example, of €230,000 or less - or will he go for the shared equity model, under which people have an initial price of €250,000 or €260,000 but ultimately must pay more than €300,000 because, as the Minister said, they must repay 40% in addition to the mortgage? That latter option is not genuine affordability.</p>

            <p eId="para_60">Sometimes the Deputy thinks he has all the answers on these matters but he does not. There are not only two mechanisms to deliver affordable homes. There are other mechanisms that can deliver. I have stated publicly the guide on prices that I want to see. Depending on the type of house in question and the area in which it is, that price would be between €160,000 and €260,000. There will be different economic realities depending on the sites of those houses. There is an emphasis in the programme for Government on delivering public homes on public land and affordable homes. I am also bringing that emphasis. There will be options for affordable purchase and cost rental. We also need a national cost rental plan. I have asked the expert group, which have met on that matter for well over a year, to start to conclude their considerations and bring me a report before the end of the year. It is important that we get this right. There may be a number of delivery mechanisms for affordable homes and I am looking at those options. I will not restrict myself at this early stage because I do not think that would be prudent. I believe that if the Deputy were sitting in my chair, he would not restrict himself either. My priority is making sure that couples and individuals will be able to buy homes that are truly affordable.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">My concern is that the Minister is evading the question. I am not talking about delivery streams, I am talking about the fundamental principle of what constitutes affordability. There is a universally accepted distinction in the industry between building homes and selling them at the cost of building them, and thereby getting genuine affordability, or allowing the market to dictate a price and the State taking a shared equity portion which must, ultimately, be repaid. The difference is that if the Government opts for the second option that the Minister has talked about repeatedly, families do not end up buying a home for €250,000 or less, but pay €300,000 or more. That is what happened in O'Devaney Gardens. The purchase price was allegedly €310,000 but finally amounted to €360,000. The available options are houses that are bought at cost price or at a market discount. One cannot have both, and the sooner the Minister decides which of those models he will go for, the sooner hard-working families are going to know if this Government will deliver genuinely affordable homes or, like the most recent Fianna Fáil Government, homes that look affordable but are not and get purchasers into trouble at a later stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_79">I thank the Deputy and assure him that, whether he is on the housing committee or not, I intend to work with any Deputy who brings forward constructive measures on housing. I will absolutely do that. The matter of the composition of committees is for the Whips and the Business Committee. I cannot control it.</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> To answer his specific question, the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2019 provide that where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of six months with no valid notice of termination having been served during that time, a Part 4 tenancy is established to cover the next five years and six months. Section 34 of the Act provides that a landlord must state a reason for the termination of any tenancy notice served in accordance with the grounds for termination set out in the table to that section.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to improving security and affordability for renters. To achieve that, we will develop a cost rental model for delivery of housing that creates affordability for tenants and a sustainable model for construction and management of homes. We will also support the adequate supply of rental accommodation by ensuring equity and fairness for tenants and landlords alike. We will reform the fair deal scheme to incentivise renting out vacant properties, which is a massive issue. We will improve security of tenure for tenants and increase Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, enforcement. I am also examining incentives for further long-term leasing. I am going to instruct local authorities, as part of their housing strategies, to undertake and publish a rental needs assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_82"> To answer the Deputy's specific question, subject to Cabinet approval, I aim to introduce residential tenancy legislation in the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer recess to further protect tenants who have been economically impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

            <p eId="para_83">I thank the Minister for his reply. He mentioned in that reply that he is looking at incentives, cost rental and different measures. Is he actually going to look at measures that will improve security of tenure for tenants across the board? We need more than just incentives for long-term tenancies. I do not think there is any rationale for a four-year cut-off point, after which one is back to the start. Will the Minister be looking at getting rid of that four-year limit so that, once one has established a tenancy, apart from grounds such as failure to pay rent or anti-social behaviour, one can keep that tenancy? Will the Minister be examining that issue?</p>
            <p eId="para_84"> Will the emergency legislation that the Minister is considering only cover tenants who can prove that they have been specifically impacted by Covid-19? Will it not offer general reform and protection for renters over the next few months? The Minister might clarify those matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_85">There will be a couple of parts to the Bill that I bring forward. One relates to significant and permanent changes to tenancy protections that will endure beyond the Covid pandemic. We all want to see the pandemic conclude as soon as possible, but it will be with us for a while. I will bring forward other measures, subject to Cabinet approval, and the Bill has not been approved by Cabinet yet. Those measures are focused on those who are most vulnerable during the pandemic. I hope to be in a position to publish that legislation in the next couple of days.</p>
            <p eId="para_86"> There are other things at which I am looking, for the information of the House. I have received anecdotal evidence as both a Deputy and a Minister to the effect that the termination of a tenancy due to sale was being abused in some areas, prior to the pandemic. I am looking clearly at that issue to make sure that if a notice of termination is issued for reason of the sale of the property, outside the pandemic emergency legislation, there needs to be a follow-up to make sure that sale has happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">When a sale does not happen and it has just been used as an excuse to put someone out, we must be very tough on those who break the rules. There are other elements I am also examining.</p>

            <p eId="para_88">I thank the Minister. I was a member of the Government commission on the private residential sector which drew up the plans that are currently in place. I was a representative of tenants' interests at the time. Even though it was more than 20 years ago, the means by which many of the grounds for eviction in the legislation came about are very clear. They are far too wide in scope and need to be narrowed. This is fundamentally about whether a rental home is actually a home as well as an investment vehicle for someone who is renting it out, and whether rights come with that status. Are those rights paramount and will they be recognised as such? We need to recognise that a rented property is a home.</p>
            <p eId="para_89"> I would like to ask about narrowing the grounds for termination and making further improvements beyond the scope of the legislation the Minister is bringing to Cabinet. What is the timeframe for this action? When will these measures be taken?</p>

            <p eId="para_90">There will be some permanent measures in the Bill I intend to bring before the House next week. They will take effect from 2 August so there will be no gap between them and the current protections. There will be a seamless transition to the new provisions. The session of the Dáil beginning in September will also be important. We will need to work with the joint committee on further measures. I have mentioned one example concerning termination on the grounds of sale. That ground for termination can be very valid but I have evidence that it is sometimes used erroneously. There are things we need to do there.</p>
            <p eId="para_91"> Fundamentally, I want to ensure we are providing secure tenancies and secure public housing. People must have a home to call their own, including through public housing schemes. I want public housing on public land. We will introduce the Land Development Agency legislation in the next session. The affordable purchase scheme and the affordable rental scheme are also a part of that effort. There is a lot of work we must do together which is very important for this country. We will see some movements in that regard next week and very early in September.</p>

            <p eId="para_94">In order to support the local government sector, my Department continues to keep local authority income, expenditure and cash flow under review and is working with all local authorities on all issues arising in the context of the Covid-19 public health emergency.</p>
            <p eId="para_95"> While the County and City Management Association has estimated the loss of non-rates income for 2020 to be in the region of €91 million, it is not possible to accurately calculate the loss of income from commercial rates for all of 2020 at this stage due to the range of payment plans available to ratepayers and the variety of payment patterns among ratepayers of different sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_96"> As the Deputy will be aware, earlier this year a waiver of commercial rates for a three-month period from 27 March 2020 was announced for all businesses that had been forced to close due to public health requirements.

The Minister of State does not need to be told that huge holes will have to be plugged if services are to continue effectively and if the councils are to avoid any staff cuts. Funding is required in three areas, namely, the revenue usually raised through rates, non-rates revenue and moneys for Covid-19-related expenses, which I understand will amount to millions of euro.

            <p eId="para_99">I assure the Deputy that the Department is working very hard and liaising with local authorities on a daily basis to measure the funding deficit and plan the July stimulus, which will be announced later today. Rates account for approximately 30% of local authorities' income on average. Goods and services account for in the region of 28% of their income, a sum of €1.5 billion nationally. We have been very clear that the July stimulus package must be of the appropriate scale and must reach businesses in a timely fashion. In regard to rates and the funding of local authorities, it is clear that the quickest way to get cash to businesses is to refrain from taking it away in the first instance. That has been the trajectory of the Government from the start. We will keep in touch with local authorities and I am confident that we will see a very strong and robust response from the Government this afternoon.</p>

Dublin City Council faces €41 million in additional costs due to Covid-19. It has experienced a loss of non-rates income of €32 million. The Minister of State will agree that this is a really serious situation. Communities and people throughout the State rely heavily on services provided by their local councils. We must ensure that there are no cuts to services in our communities or staff numbers. This matter must be addressed urgently.</p>

I said very clearly in my initial reply that there will be no cuts to local authority staff or services. I made that absolutely crystal clear. I also made it very clear that the components of today's stimulus package aimed at local authorities will be of scale and will be timely. I have been absolutely clear that the Department is liaising with local authorities to fill this gap and that we will come back this afternoon with clear certainty in terms of the trajectory to get through this pandemic. We will provide certainty for all local authorities. The Government has been to the forefront in supporting businesses throughout this pandemic. It has gone far beyond the effort made in other jurisdictions. That will continue to be the case. This stimulus package will be of the scale required to get our economy going again and to support all our small businesses.</p>

            <p eId="para_103">"Public homes on public land" is the demand of the housing movement, a movement which has seen what the disaster of allowing developers to make a killing from public land means. I offer the example of O'Devaney Gardens. This promise made its way into the Green Party manifesto and, interestingly, the Minister of State has uttered this slogan twice so far during our half hour of discussion. However, the indications are that the privatisation of public land is set to continue with the development in Killinarden under the authority of South Dublin County Council. Does the Minister mean public homes on public land? Will he commit to reversing that privatisation or is it just sloganeering?</p>

            <p eId="para_104">Deputy Paul Murphy asks if someone is just sloganeering. I thank him for his question. I say that in jest and honestly do not mean any disrespect. The programme for Government commits the State to playing a greater part in the provision of affordable and social housing, with a focus on those earning low and middle incomes and the development of sustainable mixed-tenure communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_105">These principles will guide our housing policy and the work of the Land Development Agency, LDA, in assembling strategic sites in urban areas and ensuring the sustainable development of social and affordable homes for rent and purchase. This will include ensuring that public housing rental stock on public land is under the control of local authorities, approved housing bodies or other similar bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_106"> The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued an update to the public spending code in October 2019 to include a requirement that prior to seeking approval from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to dispose of lands and buildings on the open market, all non-commercial State bodies must first consult with the LDA on the appropriate disposal of those lands. I will further strengthen that requirement by way of the commitment in the programme for Government that any State lands being offered for sale will automatically be offered first to the LDA, which will be a very different agency from what was previously proposed. This will mean that if such lands can be acquired by the LDA, it will acquire them, thereby ensuring they remain in the ownership of the State and are used to provide appropriate housing. I intend for that LDA legislation to come to the House in the next session. My Department and I are working on it with Cabinet colleagues. As I said, I want to see public homes on public land.</p>

            <p eId="para_107">I think the Minister engaged in a bit of a sleight of hand in his response - the same sleight of hand in which the programme for Government engages - when he said he will ensure that "public housing rental stock on public land is under the control of local authorities, approved housing bodies or other similar bodies". The point about the slogan "public homes on public land" is not primarily about who has control of public homes, although that is important. The point is that all of the public land that exists in the State should be used for public homes. None of it should be privatised at a time when we have some 100,000 people on housing waiting lists across the State. When we have enough public land to build 100,000 homes, we should be building public homes as opposed to giving developers an opportunity to profit. I will give the example of South Dublin County Council, which put the construction of 500 houses in Killinarden out to tender. Only 20% of those homes will be social housing and the so-called affordable homes are set to cost up to €290,000, which is completely unaffordable for most people.</p>

            <p eId="para_108">We want to get to a stage where it is not a question of whether people's homes are public or private in this country but that they are simply people's homes. We want to ensure we are delivering both types of housing. If we look at the Shanganagh development in Dublin, nearly 600 units have been approved by the LDA and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and all of them will be social and affordable homes. That is what we want to see in most places. There may be instances where that exact model will not suit, but I am saying that this Government will be acutely focused on ramping up our public housing stock, with an emphasis on building new public homes. That is what I want, namely, a clear emphasis on building public homes for our people, like what was done by governments in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and onwards. That can be done and it is what we want to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_109"> At the same time, I also want to deliver affordable homes for working people through affordable purchase and affordable rental mechanisms. We have started to do that and I will bring forward new schemes later this year. I intend that we will see homes being delivered through that model next year. I have said from the very beginning that we must work with the local authorities to get our public housing stock up. That is what we intend to do and what we will focus on.</p>

            <p eId="para_110">The slogan "public homes on public land" should mean using all public land for public homes. In the case of Killinarden, even setting aside for a moment the unaffordability of the so-called affordable homes, 400 of those 500 homes will be sold by the developer for whatever price the developer wants for private profit. Does the Minister agree with that and, if not, will he halt the sale of the land? The scale of the housing crisis is such that a one-bedroom apartment in Exchange Hall in Tallaght has gone up for rent for €1,700 per month. The situation is absolutely out of control. The private market will not deliver what is needed and it will not resolve this crisis. The only answer is significant public investment in the building of public housing. The solution is to make public housing available for all as opposed to continuing to provide the opportunity for private developers to profit from the crisis that exists in housing. If the Minister is not willing to give a commitment that he will not privatise any public land, then what he is saying is just empty sloganeering.</p>

            <p eId="para_111">Our job is to deliver homes for our people through various mechanisms and that is what we will do. Our focus has to be on driving down homelessness and continuing to focus on accommodation for singles. Approximately 60% of adults who are homeless are single and we do not have enough accommodation for them. That is why I put out a call this week to all local authorities - I assume the Deputy has been in contact with his own local authority on this matter - to ensure that they buy homes to put into public stock. That is being done right now. It is only three weeks into this Government and we are very focused on tackling homelessness and providing homes for those who need them most. Some 50 large families in this country have been homeless for four or five years because there is no suitable accommodation for them. We have to focus on those types of issues. I have spent the first three weeks in office meeting with people from homeless charities all over this city and county. In the next few weeks, I will be meeting people from all over the country. I am acutely aware of how important it is for us to provide homes for our people and that is what we intend to do. I say again that this will clearly be based on the principle of public homes on public land.</p>

To put the issue in context, not one co-living development has been built. That said, I am aware of applications that have come in quite recently in the co-living space. I want to make sure, through the review, that there is no impact on or any unintended consequences for purpose-built student accommodation or other things. I have started that review and I do not intend it to go on forever. My intention is to come back to the House on it in the autumn and to work in consultation with the joint Oireachtas committee on housing, whenever that is established.</p>

            <p eId="para_115">In many aspects of Irish life, Covid-19 has ripped off the plaster. If it has particularly exposed any one issue in Irish society, it has been in regard to housing and how people are living. If we ask people to stay at home as a national call, then we have to be mindful of how people live. If they are living in overcrowded accommodation, if three generations are living in the one house, if people do not have access to a back garden, then all of the things for which people have been criticised for campaigning on over the years are now seen to have been valid complaints. The Minister says that no co-living accommodation has been built and that may be true, but he must be aware that planning permissions have been granted for such accommodation. What is his and his Department's intention in regard to this reality?</p>

            <p eId="para_116">I am absolutely aware that some permissions have been granted. I looked for detailed figures on this and they show that out of 62,546 homes which were approved up to June this year, 600 were deemed to be shared accommodation. That is the proportion we are talking about. However, the Deputy makes a very fair point that there are applications coming in and permissions have been granted. As he knows, I am precluded from talking about particular applications but I have initiated a review and I am serious about it. My own views on this issue have not changed. I want to make sure, as part of the review I am undertaking, that there are no unintended consequences to proceeding with such schemes. The Deputy made the further really important point that we already have people living in shared accommodation in overcrowded apartments and houses, sometimes with three or four generations in the same home. These are not examples of the new co-living schemes but the reality of co-living for many people. We have to address that, through our building programme, by building more public homes.</p>

            <p eId="para_118">What is the timescale for the completion of the review? All the while, planning applications are being submitted and permission is being granted, which leads to a bigger problem. If the review and Government action are swift, we will avoid the construction of a significant number of co-living accommodation units with which we would then have to contend. In light of the possibility of a second wave or having to deal with Covid for several years, it would be absolutely irresponsible to suggest that anybody should live in this way. It was a bad idea before Covid because it is not an ethical housing policy. There is no dignity attached to it. It makes money for some people but it is not the way we should be building communities. I think the Minister agrees with me in that regard. When will the review be completed? If the Government is serious about doing something on this issue, when will it act?</p>

            <p eId="para_119">The views of the Minister on this matter are well known. I will remind the House of remarks he made a year ago, almost to the day. He described the policy as "bonkers" and stated that Fine Gael was out of touch for trying to pursue it. He stated that Fine Gael should scrap co-living and that if Deputies Varadkar and Eoghan Murphy wanted this bonkers policy so much, they should live together.</p>
            <p eId="para_120"> The Minister is not duty-bound to carry out a review. He has mandatory ministerial guideline powers that were introduced by Deputy Kelly when he was Minister in 2015 and early 2016. He can walk into the Custom House and abolish this bonkers policy right now. There is no need for a review. All the review will do is incentivise developers to do exactly what Deputy Ó Ríordáin outlined, that is, to rush in applications to jack up the price of the land. A review is no good. In fact, it is bonkers to carry out a review of a bonkers policy. The Minister should scrap it now.</p>

            <p eId="para_122"> To answer Deputy Ó Ríordáin's question, which was a genuine one because he wishes to see a resolution to this issue, I have been in office for slightly less than four weeks. We have done a significant amount of work in that period. I have initiated the review. It will not go on forever. I started it very recently. I expect that we could have the work done by early autumn, probably in September.</p>
            <p eId="para_123"> There are other priorities which I have already discussed. I must balance the work I do. I do not have infinite human resources or time and, as such, I must prioritise issues such as public housing delivery and the affordable purchase scheme, which I very much wish to bring through, as well as the residential tenancies Bill I mentioned in response to Deputy O'Callaghan, which I hope to get up and running next week. There are some urgent matters which I need to act on immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_124"> The review is under way. I intend to come back to the House in autumn with it. I will engage directly with Deputy Ó Ríordáin on it.

            <p eId="para_127">I will read a prepared response as it is a very specific question. On its establishment, the LDA had access to an initial tranche of nine sites that have near-term delivery potential for approximately 3,600 new homes. The sites in question are the Central Mental Hospital site in Dundrum, Hampton in Balbriggan, Hacketstown in Skerries, Devoy Barracks in Naas, the former Meath Hospital in Dublin city centre, St. Kevin's Hospital in Cork, Columb Barracks in Mullingar, Dyke Road in Galway and Shanganagh, which will be developed in partnership with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_128"> The establishment order of the LDA empowers it to acquire ownership of lands and buildings. However, ownership of these sites will not transfer to it until the Land Development Agency Bill is enacted. The transfer of local authority lands is a matter for local authorities under section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended. Significant preparatory work is under way in respect of the initial sites, with feasibility planning and other preparatory works already initiated. The LDA has entered into presale agreements with landowners, as appropriate, to ensure that it has full access to the sites to carry out necessary pre-construction activities. All sites are being developed by the LDA, with the exception of the Shanganagh site, which is being developed in partnership with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. All sites except Shanganagh are at pre-planning stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_129"> The LDA has been granted planning permission for the development of 597 homes on the site at Shanganagh. It is intended that approximately 34% of the units in the development will be for social housing, 51% will be for cost rental and 15% for affordable purchase. Construction is due to start on the site by mid-2021. The tabular statement following this statement sets out the detailed information the Deputy has requested. I have a copy of the report before me and will give it to the Deputy as well as sending it to him electronically.</p>

            <p eId="para_181">I thank the Minister for his detailed reply. I appreciate that he will circulate the tabular information. I refer to the potential for different housing models. I made reference to this issue while speaking to the Sinn Féin motion on affordable housing. I acknowledge that the Minster spoke about affordable purchase previously. We previously discussed the idea of a rent-to-buy scheme and the Minister stated he would look into it. There is potential within the LDA model for that type of scheme to be pursued. We previously discussed the scheme that was abandoned ten years ago when the crash came but which had helped certain families.</p>
            <p eId="para_182"> The current situation is that couples and individuals in Dublin and elsewhere cannot rent and save at the same time. If they are renting, that uses up all their disposable income and they cannot save for a deposit.</p>
            <p eId="para_183"> Is there potential within the LDA model for a rent-to-buy scheme? I previously discussed the details of such a scheme. It could involve three years of rental, after which one would have a chance to put the rent paid towards a deposit, to keep renting or to leave the scheme. Is that type of model something the Minister could consider within the framework of his proposals?</p>

            <p eId="para_184">In preparation for oral questions, I met my officials yesterday and raised the comments made last week by the Deputy regarding rent-to-buy. My officials will be in direct contact with him on the issue. I intend to meet him on the matter. As I stated in response to other Deputies, there are multiple ways of delivering affordable housing. We must be open to looking at other ideas. I spoke to my officials yesterday regarding the suggestion made by the Deputy. They will contact him directly. I intend to meet him officially on the matter if he has time to so do.</p>
            <p eId="para_185"> The LDA as it will be constituted under the legislation that will be brought in later this year will have latitude, subject to the approval of the House and the Seanad. I am open to considering ideas that have worked in other jurisdictions or in Ireland previously in the context of rent-to-buy and I will discuss them with the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_186">Can we weave that sort of model into the LDA legislation or should it be provided for in stand-alone legislation that allows for various models to be pursued? It is a model that worked in the past. It will deal with a particular issue. As I previously mentioned, throughout the country there are several generations living in the same house. Part of the problem is the lost generation of people in their 20s or 30s who are living at home. They cannot afford to rent because they are saving to get onto the property ladder.</p>
            <p eId="para_187"> Is it possible to be prescriptive within the LDA legislation in the context of dealing with this issue? Can the legislation provide for dealing with various housing schemes that we wish for the LDA to pursue or is it just going to be enabling legislation which will allow us latitude to pursue various housing models such as the rent-to-buy scheme about which we are so passionate?</p>

            <p eId="para_188">This will be very important legislation. I assure the Minister that I have kept a very careful record of everything he stated on this issue at the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government. We will compare the legislation with the comments he made.</p>
            <p eId="para_189"> The key issues are whether the LDA will be a designated activity company, whether it will be fully subject to freedom of information and the lobby register in respect of its commercial and non-commercial activities, and whether it will stick to the 10% social, 30% affordable and 60% private allocation that Fine Gael originally proposed. Will it have fully fledged compulsory purchase order powers? Those will be the tests. I do not expect the Minister to have the answers to all those questions now. When will he introduce the legislation?</p>

I have circulated the Bill among Cabinet members for observation. We are already at that stage. It will come back to me and it will go to the joint Oireachtas committee for pre-legislative scrutiny. I certainly want to see affordability tied into the Bill. On the other elements, I am acutely aware of what I raised when I participated in pre-legislative scrutiny in the last Dáil. This Bill is informed by contributions by the Deputy, me and others who were on that committee. It is detailed legislation that will require much work. We have to get it right. I intend to have freedom of information, compulsory purchase order powers and things like that in the Bill. I will be consulting with the joint Oireachtas committee as well at the right pre-legislative stage. When I publish the Bill is when we will be looking for input, which is what pre-legislative scrutiny is for. I ask Members to look at it in a constructive and open way. We need a land management agency, or whatever we call it. The State needs to manage its land properly.</p>

            <p eId="para_195">There is a substantial number of vacant houses right across the country. We have a housing crisis and we have to look at building as many houses as possible but we have 1.75 million existing houses and we must do our utmost to ensure that as many of those homes are occupied as possible. The number of those vacant at any one time varies at present between 50,000 and 180,000 depending on the source. Every effort must be taken to ensure that we maximise the occupancy of existing housing.</p>

            <from>Deputy Peter Burke<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T11:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_196">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_197"> A range of measures to assist in meeting Ireland's housing needs by ensuring that our existing housing stock is used to the greatest extent possible were set out in pillar 5 of Rebuilding Ireland. An overarching action within that pillar was the commitment to develop a national vacant homes reuse strategy. This strategy was published by my Department in July 2018 and strives to provide a targeted, effective and co-ordinated approach to identifying and tackling vacancy across the country. It draws together all of the strands of ongoing work into this document.</p>
            <p eId="para_198"> Local authorities have been and continue to be encouraged to utilise all available supports and develop new approaches to ensuring that existing housing stock across the country is utilised to the fullest capacity. This has resulted in the development of innovative responses to dealing with vacancy, such as the website <i>vacanthomes.ie</i> developed by Mayo County Council in July 2017 on behalf of the local government sector. This site acts as a central portal for individuals to log possible vacant homes and has proven useful in supplementing the country-wide analysis on vacancy and in mobilising local communities to assist local authorities in developing and implementing a targeted approach. Some 4,220 properties have been registered to date. The website provides useful information for property owners on how to bring their vacant properties back into use and available financial supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_199"> The supports available to bring vacant stock back into use include a number of schemes developed by my Department to incentivise reactivating suitable dwellings into livable housing stock. In that regard, at the end of 2019 a total of 1,540 applications for the repair and leasing scheme had been received from property owners. Some 165 of those homes have been brought back into use and were tenanted. Since the introduction of the buy and renew scheme, it has helped local authorities to purchase 529 vacant properties to accommodate households seeking social support. In January 2017, my Department established a revolving acquisitions fund of €70 million managed by the Housing Agency, which has facilitated 840 properties being made available to approved housing bodies to accommodate households seeking social housing supports. Some 51 additional properties are currently in the process of being secured. The Housing Agency has also assisted local authorities in acquiring a further 468 vacant properties from financial institutions for social housing purposes, with a further 211 currently in the process of being secured as social housing. Therefore, in addition to the almost 700 properties brought back into use to date under the buy and renew and repair and lease schemes, more than 1,500 other vacant properties held by financial institutions have been secured or are currently in the process of being secured for social housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_200"> Tackling vacancy will continue to be the focus of targeted attention by my Department through the ongoing implementation of measures set out in the national vacant housing reuse strategy. That is an overarching roadmap and focal point for the co-ordination and implementation of initiatives right across government to ensure we are utilising our existing housing stock to the fullest extent possible. To that end, it facilitates actions to return as many recoverable vacant properties back into viable use as possible, increasing supply of sustainable housing while also revitalising the vibrancy of our local communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_201">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I accept that this is a complex area and yes, there are initiatives such as the repair and lease scheme, the buy and renew scheme and the acquisitions fund. The difficulty is that there are blockages within the system at present. One of them is the fair deal, or nursing home support scheme. There are 9,000 vacant houses across the country where older people are in long-term care. If those older people lease out their home, they are penalised three times. The capital value of the house is taken into account, the rental income is taken into account, and money going through the bank account is considered as capital on deposit. Will the Minister of State give me an assurance that the anomaly in respect of the fair deal scheme will be resolved to ensure that some of these houses are made available for these schemes?</p>

            <p eId="para_202">It is very clear regarding vacant houses that a blend or suite of measures is needed to ensure that we bring housing back into use. In the pilot project that was undertaken by the Department in connection with six local authorities, they found a vacancy rate of around 2.9%. That required two inspections over a six-month period. At times this can be put across as though there is a huge amount of low-hanging fruit but sometimes we will find that vacant homes are in difficult locations in which demand is not as strong for social housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_203"> On the powers that are available to local authorities, Waterford City and County Council and Louth County Council have been pioneers in using compulsory purchase orders to replenish vacant housing. We also have vacant housing officer roles which have been funded and put into the local authority system. In connection with Deputy Naughten's specific point, it is something we can examine and I will raise it within the Department.</p>

            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T11:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_204">Another bottleneck in availing of these schemes is probate. People in County Roscommon and the adjoining county of Galway, for example, have to wait an average of three and a half months for a probate application to be processed. If one is unfortunate enough to live in County Kilkenny, the process can take four and a half months. In Cork city it is taking two and a half months. In Waterford, which the Minister of State has already mentioned, it takes three and a half months to process a probate application. Clearly this is another impediment to the release of housing stock back onto the market. Absolutely there are complex legal processes in order for the application to be lodged with the probate office in the first place. If the e-probate system was rolled out across the country it would deal with much of the initial administrative problems and allow for these to be processed quickly. When are we going to see the e-probate system rolled out across the country?</p>

            <p eId="para_205">That is an area for which my Department does not have responsibility but I take the Deputy's point, which is very well made. It is an issue that has to be tackled. Myself and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, will raise that with the Department. The Deputy also alluded to that measure. There are a number of measures that need to be brought together as a blend to try to get housing stock back in use. No one wants vacant housing units. We will do all we can to ensure we achieve that.

            <p eId="para_206">That is great. I have two more measures for the Minister of State as well. The first is that his Department is spending approximately €31,000 through the local infrastructure housing activation fund and the serviced sites fund in releasing sites for housing development, mainly across the urban centres, the eastern part of the country and in our cities.</p>
            <p eId="para_207">At the same time, we have a substantial number of vacant houses in many rural villages and towns. The local authorities are not interested in the context of the various schemes because there is not a demand in those locations for local authority housing. However, there are many families here in Dublin or in other cities who would relocate, particularly now that they can work remotely. I ask that we introduce a grant scheme for families whereby they could get half the amount to which I refer, up to €15,000, which would allow them to relocate from the cities into some of the villages and bring life back into those where the necessary infrastructure is already in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_208">The local infrastructure housing activation fund was introduced by the previous Government. It is a key tool in the context of activating sites and is linked to the national planning framework, which is important in keeping our towns and villages vibrant.</p>
            <p eId="para_209"> Sometimes the issue of vacant housing can be taken out of proportion. Looking at the vacant homes register, in Roscommon in the Deputy's constituency, 72 properties are listed. While I acknowledge that we want to work to secure those properties and make them the subject of viable tenancies, we can also take the Deputy's suggestions on board and meet him to discuss them if he so wishes. It is important that we take a collaborative approach to housing. Many measures are used in conjunction with each other in order to try to tackle this issue. There is no silver bullet. When one looks at the pilot study that was carried out and the information available on <i>vacanthomes.ie -</i> that information is independently held and is obtained, from the ground up, in constituencies - sometimes the perception is that this is a greater problem than is actually the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_210">There are multiples of those 72 properties in Roscommon alone. I could bring the Minster of State to locations adjoining our constituency in Monksland where there is huge housing demand and where houses are vacant for one reason or another. If we are going to encourage families to relocate to some of these communities, we must look at the tax credit system currently in place. It needs to be modernised and updated.</p>
            <p eId="para_211"> Finally, across my constituency there are problems with raw sewage running down the main streets of villages, in the likes of Kilconnell and Caltra in east Galway and locations in County Roscommon. We must invest in our water and wastewater infrastructure, particularly in villages, in order that we might provide suitable accommodation for families.</p>

            <p eId="para_212">I take on board the Deputy's concerns about Irish Water. I would be at pains to point out, however, that the Department has invested significant funding in a co-ordinated approach to try to unlock vacant properties. I refer to measures to deal with the ghost estates we were left with after the crash and the amount of money that was invested in unlocking unfinished estates. The latter ensured that houses were completed and are now the subject of secure tenancies. We have also encouraged and prepared vacant housing plans with local authorities and facilitated the appointment of vacant home officers to drive that. This needs to be driven at a local level where the knowledge lies. There is also our repair-and-lease scheme and the Housing Agency acquisition fund. I mentioned Waterford and Louth, where local authorities have used the compulsory purchase order process to key effect. This is a co-ordinated approach. We need to be very careful how we manage it, and we must continue to bring homes back to the point where they can be the subject of secure tenancies.</p>

            <from>Deputy Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_217">I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 15 and 24 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_218"> I am absolutely committed to ensuring that affordable, quality homes are available to everyone in Irish society. This key Government goal is clearly reflected in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future.</p>
            <p eId="para_219"> In particular, I am focusing on progressing the affordable purchase scheme and delivery programme and moving the cost-rental scheme forward. This work will focus on our major urban areas, where people and families are facing the greatest challenge in the context of housing access and affordability.</p>
            <p eId="para_220"> After taking some time to review progress and consult delivery partners, I will outline my detailed plans for affordable housing in the autumn. In doing so, I will also take account of the progress made under the serviced sites fund, SSF, and other existing measures, such as the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme and the help-to-buy scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_221"> Together with State-led affordable housing for purchase and cost-rental, I also plan to expand Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to deliver much needed affordable as well as social housing and protecting the 10% social provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_222"> I am bringing all delivery partners together to work on the expansion and acceleration of our affordable housing programmes. Local authorities, the Housing Agency, the Land Development Agency and approved housing bodies all have a part to play. They have all been most helpful to me in recent weeks since I took over as Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_223"> I intend to expand the €310 million SSF, which targets local authority areas where affordability has been identified as an issue and which provides funding for facilitating infrastructure on local authority land thereby subventing the end cost of the affordable homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_224"> With a maximum funding ceiling of €50,000 available per home, the SSF can facilitate at least 6,200 affordable homes. To date, funding of €127 million has been allocated in support of 35 projects in 14 local authority areas, which will assist in the delivery of almost 3,200 affordable homes. Details of all projects that have received funding approval, including those in Dublin and Cork, are available on the Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_225"> In terms of affordable purchase, Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, commenced in June 2018, provides the statutory basis. Under regulations issued in March 2019, a scheme of priority is decided by each local authority detailing the arrangements for the access to affordable purchase homes. In the first instance, it is the responsibility of local authorities to identify affordability issues and bring forward sites where the provision of more affordable housing is viable. The scheme of priorities has been problematic and must be greatly improved on and that will be part of the more streamlined affordable housing approach for local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_226"> The main eligibility criterion under the Act is that the applicant must be a first-time buyer, with limited exceptions. The applicant's net household income must be such that the repayments on a 90% mortgage for the purchase of a suitable home at market value would not exceed 35% of his or her net income.</p>
            <p eId="para_227"> As part of my work leading up to the autumn announcement, I will be scrutinising the statutory basis of the scheme with delivery partners, particularly as it relates to viability and eligibility criteria, in order to ensure that it reflects this Government's policy priorities and delivers the outcomes we need.</p>
            <p eId="para_228"> The first homes that will be made available under the new affordable purchase scheme will be on Boherboy Road in Cork city in early 2021. I commend Cork City Council on its progressive work in respect of this project and utilising moneys from the SSF. Other local authorities are following suit and I will ensure that we see more and more projects like this delivered on key local authority sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_229"> To support rental affordability, the Government is also committed to the introduction of cost-rental housing in Ireland, where the rents charged cover the cost of delivering, managing, and maintaining the homes only. A working group has been examining the most appropriate model for delivering cost-rental, including the use of public land, appropriate Exchequer inputs and operational matters such as tenant eligibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_230">The work is also being supported by research by the European Investment Bank. I expect initial findings of this group to be completed within the coming months and I have asked that this work be expedited. This will allow us to expand on the three pilot developments currently under way. I will also provide an update on cost rental in the autumn. We need options on a national cost rental plan and policy. I know I will have the Deputy’s assistance in putting that together and I hope that has answered her specific question on affordability.</p>

            <p eId="para_231">I thank the Minister for his reply. Unfortunately many people of my age and indeed many of my friends cannot afford to buy their own homes despite having good jobs. If the average worker cannot afford to buy a home then we are failing them. Today a person on the average industrial wage for a full-time worker can borrow just €175,000. That is not much use to a person who may want to live in Lucan, Clondalkin or elsewhere in my constituency. Will the Minister confirm that people on the average wage will be able to buy affordable homes under his plan?</p>

            <p eId="para_232">I intend that will absolutely be the case. Under the Government plan, we will not exclude couples who earn more than €75,000, unlike what other parties have put forward, which would exclude nearly half of those who need housing. We need to look at the net cost for people. The Deputy is 100% correct in that there are so many people out there who are working hard, paying 50% to 60% of their net take-home pay on rent. They are trying to save every cent, and are never going to reach the target they need to reach, first in savings, but second in income. I do not want them to be chasing an unaffordable mortgage. That is not what this Government or the Deputy wants.</p>
            <p eId="para_233"> In the interim we will keep other measures in place. We will keep the help to buy grant in place which helps some first-time buyers and we will potentially expand it. The Rebuilding Ireland home loan has been a really good support for people as well and it will be expanded. There are moneys there for this year and I would ask people to look at it. It is a very good fixed-term mortgage contract for 20 to 25 years. To answer the Deputy’s question, we will be ensuring that those working on average, normal incomes will be able to access our Government’s affordable housing scheme.</p>

People have waited too long for an affordable purchase scheme. We can deliver homes quite quickly under some of the options that I am also looking at. Fundamentally, there is a whole generation of people to whom the Deputy referred, including her friends in the constituency, who feel right now they have no hope of ever owning their own home. We are going to change that and I, as housing Minister, am absolutely convinced that we will. This is a priority for me on which we are working every day. This autumn I intend to launch the plan and bring it forward. Let us get moving on it to deliver affordable homes for our people.</p>

            <p eId="para_240">I thank the Deputy for his kind words.</p>
            <p eId="para_241"> The Programme for Government – Our Shared Future sets out a range of actions that relate to local authority funding, including a commitment to review how commercial rates will be treated for the remainder of 2020. The programme also commits to bringing forward legislation for the local property tax, LPT, on the basis of fairness and where most home owners will face no increase. It also states that those counties with a lower LPT base will be adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case. </p>
            <p eId="para_242"> My officials are considering these commitments and will work with key stakeholders, including drawing on the work of the local government funding - baseline - review group, as necessary. This process will give the opportunity to address any historical anomalies in local authority areas that may exist, including in County Meath.</p>
            <p eId="para_243"> Notwithstanding the particular challenges that individual authorities face, all local authorities are experiencing financial challenges as a result of Covid-19. In order to support the local government sector generally, my Department continues to keep local authority income, expenditure and cash flow under review and will continue to work with all local authorities on both collective and individual issues that arise, including those issues as referred to by the Deputy that face Meath County Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_244"> My officials are happy to work with Meath County Council, on any financial issues that may be arising. Looking at the trajectory of funding over the past number of years from 2016 to 2019, Meath County Council has experienced an increase of 130%.</p>
            <p eId="para_245"> The Government is very clear about this emergency. There will be an announcement later today as to how we will further support local authorities and give them certainty that neither their services nor their staff will be cut.</p>

            <p eId="para_246">I thank the Minister for of State for his reply. I have a local government funding review here submitted by Meath County Council in 2018. The figures from that are that Meath County Council is losing out to the tune of €72 million per year by not getting its fair share of local government funding. At the moment we are getting 61% of the national average. According to figures from 2018, for example, in housing and building, we are getting 45% of the national average; on roads, transport and safety, 90%; on environmental services, 48%; recreation and amenities, 43%; development management, 62%; agriculture, health and welfare, 53%; and miscellaneous services, 77%, which is an average of 61%. These are staggering figures for our county.</p>
            <p eId="para_247"> Meath County Council receives €537 per head of population compared to the national average of €875. One can imagine the effect that this is having on a population of 200,000 plus and on services such as roads, footpaths, public lighting, libraries, playgrounds, recreational centres and so on. Will the Minister of State address the inequalities in funding?</p>

            <p eId="para_248">Many measures can be used to measure the funding local authorities receive. On population size, this can be a crude instrument to determine what level of funding is delivered. As I said, the increase to Meath County Council since 2016 is very clear. Other avenues are available to, and are at the disposal of, the local authority to increase funding. One key issue is if the local authority takes a decision to vary its local property tax rate. If Meath County Council had raised the local property tax rate by 15% over the past six years, it would have brought in an extra €2.6 million to the fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_249"> We should look at the return on investment that some local authorities can get. An example is Longford, which is my constituency. It increased its local property tax which gave it access to huge funding streams from central government through the urban and rural regeneration funds.</p>

            <p eId="para_250">Let me tell the Minister of State what the property tax has done for Meath. When former Minister, Phil Hogan, brought in the local property tax, he said local authorities were going to keep 80% of it. He did not say he was going to do away with every other Government grant that the local authority was getting. The people of Meath paid an additional €18 million in property tax but their services have not been increased by one cent because every other Government grant was taken away.</p>
            <p eId="para_251"> In 1996 the population of Meath was 110,000 people while today it is more than 200,000. This is the highest rate of population growth in the State since 1996. Expenditure per person is an agreed standard for measuring the level of service a local authority can provide. Meath County Council is under significant pressure to meet the service delivery needs of the population. How can Meath County Council deliver the services needed in the county with 61% of the national average funding from central government funds or a shortfall of €72 million per year? I am asking the Minister of State to bring local government funding for County Meath up to the national average.</p>

            <p eId="para_254">I note that the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, spoke about the local property tax, but at this point if we were to increase it by 10% to 15%, we would deal only with the cost of the land banks in County Louth that were bought under instruction from Government around 2006 and 2007 in many cases. We are talking around about 50 acres. Some of these land banks have been dealt with but a significant amount are left. Last year, Louth County Council spent about €1 million to service the debt. We need the Government to meet with Louth County Council, with elected representatives and with the executive about putting solutions in place that deal with the substantial unit cost of these lands. Some of them would be perfect for affordable and social housing and affordable cost rental. We need these meetings and solutions to occur as quickly as possible.</p>

            <from>Deputy Peter Burke<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_255">With regard to the local property tax, it is incorrect and not factual to say that all other grants were removed from local authorities. Record streams of funding are now available to local authorities through urban and rural regeneration funds and various grants, including equalisation funds for local authorities that are short. By raising the property tax in County Longford, the council got access to multimillion euro funding. One has to examine the responsibility of councillors. With regard to Meath County Council, it is clear that there has been a 130% increase in what it has access to from central Government since 2016. A significant funding stream is available to local authorities. It is not correct to use a crude instrument such as population to determine and measure how local authorities are funded. We can all pick various metrics as it suits us to try to argue our case, but we in the Department have to be fair and ensure that local authorities are fully funded. I have given a commitment about the July stimulus package, with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, that it will be of scale and timely, and that it will respond to the challenge that local authorities face to ensure that they will not lose services or staff. I have been clear about that this morning. We also need to ensure that we support our local authorities. I will not be found wanting in that regard and nor will the Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_256">Tá na scoileanna druidte ó 13 Márta agus tá tuismitheoirí, páistí agus múinteoirí fágtha sa dorchadas ó thaobh na bpleananna don todhchaí agus do Mheán Fómhair. Cuireadh moill ar fhoilsiú na bpleananna seo arís agus arís. Rinne an t-iar-Rialtas agus an t-iar-Aire praiseach dóibh agus anois nílimid ag feiceáil nó ag cloisteáil aon rud ón Aire úr. Schools have been closed since 13 March. Parents, teachers and students have been left in the dark ever since. We have had delay after delay. The previous Government made a mess of things. We had promises and commitments from the previous Minister that a comprehensive roadmap for the reopening of schools would be published. He changed his mind on numerous occasions. The plan never emerged. It is more of the same under the new Minister. No plan has materialised.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> We are just over four weeks from the traditional date of reopening schools and as it stands, schools, parents, students, school transport operators and we in the Dáil do not know what is happening. I suspect that on the Tánaiste's side of the House, the Government does not know what is happening either, based on the silence from the Minister for Education and Skills so far. Tens of thousands of parents have no idea how their children are going back to school in September. I have no idea how my four kids are going back to school in September. My wife is a teacher and my three sisters are teachers. Like tens of thousands of other teachers, they do not know how they are going back to school in September. They deserve clarity from the State, along with the thousands of other ancillary support staff in our education system across the country. By the time the Government talks about publishing its plan, we may be just three weeks from reopening schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> I get that some of this is complex. I understand and appreciate that. However, some of it is not. We know that some of it is quite straightforward. We know that we will need additional teachers and that more money will be needed. We know that we need more space. We know that we will need increased investment in cleaning, hygiene and other measures. We know that children will need buses to get to and from school, and we know that other children with additional needs will need to be catered for in this environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> The reality is that parents are worried, stressed out and anxious with regard to this. At this time, as is the norm, they are getting things together such as school uniforms, about which there are mixed signals about whether they will be needed or not, schoolbags and so on. They are being contacted by Bus Éireann to tell them they now need to start paying fees for school transport, not knowing how school transport will operate. They are being asked to pay for school books in the school. Many parents who I am speaking to simply do not have confidence that this Government has the ability to get their kids back to school in September in a safe way. I ask the Tánaiste to reassure them and to give us a commitment that all children will return to school for five days each week from September. Will he tell us how many extra teachers are to be hired and when recruitment will start? Will he give some indication about what is happening? Parents, students, teachers and school management need answers.</p>

          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_260">I thank Deputy Doherty for raising this important issue. I know Members from all parties in this House have taken an interest in this important matter. There are hundreds of thousands of parents across the country who are concerned about this and want to know the details and how their children will go back to school at the end of the year. There are more than 1 million children and young people who need to get back to school at the end of August because they have lost three or four months of schooling, which is not good for their education, development or socialisation. While one might be able to make up for the four lost months, it would be hard to make up for losing more months beyond that. That is why it is crucial that we get the schools open at the beginning of the academic year at the end of August, as planned. That is the plan. Provided that the virus continues to be suppressed as it is now, that will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> Much work is being done by the Minister for Education and Skills, the Department, the teachers' unions, principals and school partners to get everything in place that we need to have in place for the schools to open at the end of August. We want to get all the details right before we share them widely because it would undermine confidence to come out with a set of details and plans today and then change them in a week or ten days. We need people to bear with us a little at least for the next couple of days or couple of weeks while those plans are put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> Many other countries across Europe have a higher incidence of the virus than us, for example, Germany, which has dealt with the pandemic well but which as of today and indeed for the past few months has had a higher incidence of the virus than us, and it has been able to reopen its schools. Other countries have suffered much worse than us in the pandemic and never closed their schools fully. It would reflect badly on us as politicians, on the Government and on the education partners if we were unable to open our schools in August when other countries that have suffered much worse than us did not close them fully at all or were able to reopen them in June.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_263">The Tánaiste said that is the plan but none of us have seen the plan. He has asked the people to bear with us for a couple of days or a couple of weeks. The reality is that the people have borne with the Tánaiste for the past four months since the schools closed. It is now just over four weeks until the schools are due to open. We need a bit of certainty. We appreciate that some of this might take a bit longer. We need to know, for example, if the plan is for all children, nearly 1 million of them, to return to education for five days a week at the end of August or start of September. Is that the plan? Will the Tánaiste outline that? Will he tell us how many additional teachers will need to be hired, at a rough estimate, and when that process will happen? That does not happen automatically. What is happening with school transport? Bus operators do not know, yet the bills are coming in to parents and households. Will the Tánaiste give an indication that there will be no ban on school uniforms, for example, which are causing anxiety to parents?</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> Parents need these answers. They have waited for four months. They heard the previous Minister, Deputy McHugh, stand with the Tánaiste at a podium and say that there would be a comprehensive plan by the end of June. It did not materialise. They have experienced complete deafness from the Minister for Education and Skills, who has said nothing over recent weeks about what is envisaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">Will the Tánaiste answer some very simple questions as to what are the principles of this plan? Will the Tánaiste give certainty, if things remain the same in relation to the virus, that all children will return to school on a five-day basis at the end of August?</p>
        </speech>

          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_266">We have learnt a lot about this virus over recent months, things we did not know back in March when the schools were closed. One thing we have seen from other parts of Europe and across the world is that while nothing is no risk, the risks that arise from opening schools are low. This is why it should be done. Countries that have a higher incidence of the virus than Ireland and suffered worse than us in this pandemic did not close their schools fully. The schools north of the Border, for example, were never closed fully. In other places such as Germany, which has a higher incidence of the virus than us, the schools reopened in June. This is something we have to do as a country and as a society. It would reflect very badly on us if our schools were the only schools in Europe not to be open in September. A lot of work is being done on this by the Minister for Education and Skills and by the Department with the education partners. I do not want to give detailed answers to questions only for those answers to change in a few days or a few weeks. This is still evolving.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> It is not true to say there is no information out there. The interim public health advice from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, has already been published. That is the public health advice on what needs to be done in schools to make sure they can open in a safe way. There is a lot of stakeholder engagement happening at the moment, which is also crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> On uniforms, the Department has received interim public health advice for educational settings provided by the HPSC. This advice focuses on keeping Covid-19 out of the schools and control measures to minimise the spread if it is introduced into schools. There is emphasis on hand and respiratory hygiene and on physical distancing measures. No issues from a public health perspective have been raised regarding children wearing school uniforms. The normal policy for each school for the wearing of uniforms will remain a matter for each school and its board of management. There is no public health reason for any change of policy on uniforms. As is always the case, and as was the case before Covid-19, that is a decision for boards of management.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanKelly" eId="spk_103">
          <from>Deputy Alan Kelly<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_269">Yesterday evening, as I do on most evenings I am in Dublin, I FaceTime my kids, Aoibhe and Senan, who always have a number of questions for me. They asked me last night - genuinely they flummoxed me when they said: "Will you find out if we're going back to school?" Their mum, Regina, is a teacher. The Tánaiste knows her as straight talking. She had told them that she did not know and said to them to ask their dad on FaceTime. It is critically important that we get this right. The decision is the fulcrum around which all society is going to operate in late August and early September. It is the most important issue that we need to plan for and get right, yet nobody knows, including the parents, principals, teachers and children. The Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin, said that this is the number one commitment, and I agree with this. I am not confident that this is going to happen, and I say this genuinely, given what I have seen from the Department of Education and Skills and from the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> The Minister, Deputy Harris, announced recently a package on third level funding, which I welcome, but I also note his guidance. This is important. The guidance speaks of a 2 m distance requirement in colleges and a maximum of two hours in a classroom. Unions, principals, teachers and parents have all noted this. It is a precedent. If that is the guidance, and this may be it, full stop, where does this leave the opening of schools? Parameters have been set. The Minister for Education and Skills has not in any way answered any questions. The way the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, dealt with my colleague Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin in the Chamber last week was a disgrace. One must be accountable as the Minister. Hiding away in the Department, doing briefings and issuing press releases is not acceptable. I have one question for the Tánaiste. Will he please ensure that the Minister comes into the House next week to answer questions on education? Surely that is not too big an ask. I ask that the Tánaiste would please do this. They are genuine questions. The way in which my colleague who asked the question last week was treated is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> The questions people have around school reopening include how special needs assistants, SNAs, will operate. They cannot be treated in the way proposed. There are questions also around school transport, hygiene protocols, the curriculum, books and materials. What about children and teachers who are high risk with underlying illnesses? What happens if Covid-19 does break out in a school? All of these are genuine questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> I want the Tánaiste to guarantee that schools will reopen fully in September. I am not talking about blended learning. If blended learning happens in September, it means that the Government did not do its job. We need schools fully reopened. I also want a guarantee from the Tánaiste that the Minister for Education and Skills will come into the House, which she has not yet done, to answer questions. The people need to know where we are going with schools reopening in four weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">Time flies. Getting back to business, the Whip informs me that the Minister, Deputy Foley, will be in the Dáil next week to answer questions, will answer questions on this matter, and will be happy to do so. In my view, if one looks at this rationally, the shops are open, hotels and restaurants are open, hairdressers and barbers are open. The Dáil, albeit in unusual circumstances, is open and functioning. Many countries in Europe that suffered from Covid-19 worse than us did not close their schools fully at all. Many places that suffered worse than Ireland and had higher incidences than ours now, opened their schools in June. There is no good reason Ireland should be the only country in Europe that does not have its schools open at the end of August for the start of the academic year. That is what we are working towards and that is the Government's plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> It will not, however, be business as usual. There will be a new normal, or at least a new normal for a while. We will have to make changes. Everyone appreciates and understands that, be it adaptions to the school buildings, cleaning schedules or how classes are organised and children are kept separated in smaller groups and pods. This work needs to be done and completed, but the Minister, the Department and all the education partners are working really hard on it. It is essential, provided the virus stays suppressed, that schools open, that parents have that assurance and that children get back to education and their social and educational development, which is so crucial.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanKelly" eId="spk_109">

          <p eId="para_279">I will take it that the Tánaiste's comments about the Minister coming into the House to answer questions are not the oral parliamentary questions she is due to take on Thursday, and that this will be a separate questions and answers slot on the reopening of schools. In fairness, I believe that everyone in the House feels this is necessary. Will the Tánaiste please verify that?</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> The precedent set by the Minister, Deputy Harris, with regard to 2 m and classroom sizes has been set. Workers, teachers and people who work in the third level sector cannot be treated differently. If there are issues around how long a person can spend inside rooms, and obviously there is the 2 m issue, I just do not know how schools can reopen fully. I would like the Tánaiste to answer this question. How can they reopen fully? I have looked at the preparation for this. An education Estimate will have to be brought in because changes will be needed, and very soon, given the amount of money being spent. I noted, and this is just one example of a lack of planning, that the Department issued a request for information on personal protective equipment, PPE, with a deadline of 24 June, but no tender has gone out for educational supplies of PPE in Ireland. No matter what way we approach the reopening of schools we will need PPE. This lack of planning does not breed confidence that the schools will actually reopen fully. How will it be done with the precedent set by the Minister, Deputy Harris? Will the Tánaiste guarantee that the Minister for Education and Skills will come into the House to answer questions specific to the reopening of schools?</p>

          <p eId="para_281">The Minister will be in the House next week taking oral questions, and I am sure that among those questions will be questions on schools reopening. The Business Committee is giving consideration to an additional slot as well to deal specifically with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> What the Minister, Deputy Harris, produced the other day in terms of third level reopening is welcome. It paints a pathway by which colleges, institutes of technology and other further education facilities can reopen in the autumn. We need to appreciate, however, that we will have different solutions for different sectors. Most, not all, childcare facilities and crèches are open. They came back at the end of June. We were concerned that we would have more difficulties than actually arose. That sector has done a really good job in the context of reopening. There are arrangements for childcare that are particular to that sector. The same applies, for example, to restaurants and the hospitality sector where there are particular guidelines for those places. Paediatric healthcare never stopped. Our paediatricians continue to work throughout the pandemic and have done a really fabulous job. Accordingly, I have no doubt that our teachers will rise to the challenge. The paediatricians never stopped doing their job. Childcare workers came back and have done a great job. I have every confidence that teachers will rise to the challenge and make sure that schools are open.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">I too want to raise the issue of the reopening of schools in September. The latter is only four to five weeks away. I am certainly picking up a sense of panic from parents and hearing questions from teachers. Obviously, the aim for some considerable time has been for schools to return in September. However, the question now is how that will happen. We know that youngsters have missed out on play-based learning. We know they have missed key building blocks in terms of their social and learning skills. We know children going into secondary school have missed out on particular rites of passage. Some of these events have been lost. The question is where we go from here. There must be a recognition that whatever we do must be done safely. However, there is no clear picture emerging. My colleague, Deputy Gannon, and others met with the Minister for Education and Skills last week. Not one single piece of reassurance was provided at that meeting. There was no clarity whatsoever on what is on offer. Quickly after the meeting, there was a press statement indicating that a broad briefing had been provided. That was not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> At the meeting of the Business Committee earlier, I requested that there should be a slot for a debate on this matter next week. I feel we got a reassurance that there would be such a debate. I see the Deputy Chief Whip across the Chamber, and I hope that will be the case. There is a framework document sitting on the Department's website. I have no doubt that there is an aspiration to open schools, but an aspiration will not cut the mustard. We have to see the details.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> We can see what it takes for people to socially distance in this auditorium. There are classrooms in which there will be 32 children, a special needs assistant and a teacher. Space is tight even at the best of times. Will additional teachers be brought in? Is the Government looking imaginatively at other facilities and locations that could be used, such as sports halls etc., which could be used to get our schools back up and running? Are we talking about schools fully returning? Will the Tánaiste specify what the term "partially back" means? Parents are now full-time carers and full-time educators and are working full-time. They are at breaking point. We need information as to how outbreaks in schools will be handled. There are so many details we need to know in the context of how this is going to happen. What is the optimum of what we can expect?</p>

          <p eId="para_286">I am not sure there is much I can add to my previous replies, other than to say that additional teachers will be required and that space will need to be used differently. For example, spaces such as libraries, general-purpose rooms and gyms may be used in addition to classrooms. Stakeholder engagement is strongly focused on the shape and design of solutions that are both workable and supported by sufficient and appropriately targeted resources. Draft Covid-19 plans for both primary and post-primary schools, with details on a range of practical actions to allow schools to reopen safely, are being progressed through the work of all stakeholders. The procurement process is under way for a framework which will be provided to schools to draw down any additional equipment or cleaning products needed. A considerable financial support package to assist schools in reopening is currently being planned by the Government. Further details will be announced shortly. There will also be comprehensive communication with students and parents in advance of reopening in order to ensure that they will be fully informed as to what the new school environment will look like.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">The Tánaiste rightly refers to what is happening in other countries. Ireland is not the same as other countries. We have much bigger class sizes. In some parts of the country, 32 pupils in a classroom is the norm. That is in buildings which in many cases were not designed for the new curriculum. We are not talking like for like. We are going to have to be imaginative about other locations in communities that could be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> Funding for additional teachers and lessons about washing one's hands are important. We go on about the importance of the etiquette that is required, about social distancing and about washing one's hands. People have to have the ability to do that. Schools cannot be told to cover that the week before they open. There has to be a degree of information and it will cost money to provide that. If it is a question that we have to sit late next week in order to deal with a budget for that, we will do so. We cannot go into September without this being in place. Time will be required in order to put it in place. Will we get those kinds of details to which I refer next week? If we do not, we will spend the month of August with people rightly clamouring for the Dáil to return in order to deal with this matter in order to get children back to school.</p>

          <p eId="para_289">I cannot say for certain whether the Deputy will get those details next week. The Minister for Education and Skills will be here next week and she will be able to answer questions. I am sure she is more up to date than I am on the issue of schools reopening.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> While we do not know everything about this virus by any means, we have learned a lot in the past few months about it. For example, we have learned that opening schools is on the lower end of the spectrum of risk. NPHET has been clear about that and the science backs it up, which is significant. This virus does affect children but not as severely as it affects adults. They are not super spreaders in the way they can be with influenza. We know that opening schools is at the lower end of the spectrum in terms of risk. We have been able to open childcare and we know that paediatric services have continued to function. There is no reason schools should not be able to reopen at the end of August. Schools in countries that have a higher incidence of the virus have already reopened. I refer, for example, to Germany, where schools reopened in June, and France, where they reopened before that.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> It will not be the same; it will be different. It will be a new normal or, at least, a new normal for the duration of this pandemic. I understand that parents want to know what that looks like. They want that information and they deserve it. We will share that as soon as we have it. However, we want to make sure that the information is right. We all appreciate that mixed and changing messages do not constitute a good communication strategy. We want to get it right and ensure that the information is out there in good time, is clear and does not change.</p>

          <p eId="para_292">I wish to raise some defence matters with the Tánaiste. There is almost universal acceptance that there is a severe and worsening staff retention issue in the Defence Forces. All we have to do is look at the naval base in Cork where two naval ships are tied up. These vessels are unable to put to sea because there are not enough sailors to crew them. I have also been reliably informed that a further two ships will be tied up by the year end. Almost half the fleet, four ships, will be at anchor, unable to put to sea on the eve, perhaps, of a hard Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> If this were to happen in any other EU country, I suspect heads would roll. EU countries value their sovereignty and take their obligations to police their territorial waters seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">This issue requires urgent action.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> While I have pointed out the problems, there are reasons to be hopeful and almost cheerful. Having interacted with the new Taoiseach and the new Minister for Defence over the past number of weeks, I detect a genuine and sincere shift in attitude towards solving this problem, but we need to focus on it. It would also be remiss of me were I not to highlight the support that we have received from the Opposition benches. There is cross-party support for fixing this issue. There is almost a consensus at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> I have two questions for the Tánaiste. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, is on record as suggesting that a package of financial measures will be brought to the Cabinet some time during the summer to alleviate this issue. I would be grateful if the Tánaiste could indicate approximately when that will take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> The second issue I would like to raise relates to the budget, which I will discuss the next time I stand.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">I thank Deputy Berry for his question and his ongoing interest in and commitment to matters relating to the Defence Forces. It is true that we have a significant recruitment and retention challenge in our Defence Forces, and have had for five or six years, if not longer. It is something with which we have struggled to deal. Recruitment is not so bad, but retention poses a considerable difficulty. We want a reasonably high turnover in our Defence Forces, but the turnover rate in Ireland is much higher than it is in other jurisdictions. We are unable to keep people in the Defence Forces because they are often very capable and qualified and go on to much better jobs in the private sector. We need to do more to encourage them to stay on. It is something the Minister and the Taoiseach are committed to addressing.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> Regarding ships being tied up, it is not that unusual in other countries. I understand that, at any given time, the Royal Navy is only able to send approximately half of its ships out to sea. Naval life is not easy and all European countries struggle to recruit seamen and other naval service personnel. However, that it is a problem in other countries is not a justification and does not make it okay.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> Actions have been taken. For the past couple of years, there has been considerable pay restoration for members of the Defence Forces in line with public sector pay increases. Pay bottomed out around 2013, but it has been increasing consistently since then in line with pay restoration across the public service. There was also a package of increased allowances for members of the Defence Forces, which was implemented a couple of months ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> As to whether there will be a further package, the Minister for Defence is working on that. However, I do not have the details and I am unsure as to when it will be brought to the Cabinet. We want to do it, but difficulties arise in this regard. As Deputies know, the House passed legislation to reverse FEMPI and underpin the existing public sector stability arrangement for all public servants. Any increase in basic pay or general allowances that is outside the public sector stability agreement or a ruling of the Labour Court cannot be done by the Government. They would require the House to legislate and I imagine there would be knock-on claims. I doubt that Deputies would be willing to say that no one else in the public service had a legitimate claim. That must be borne in mind.</p>

          <p eId="para_302">I thank the Tánaiste for that clarification. My follow-up question relates to the defence budget. Based on percentage of GDP, we already have the smallest defence budget in the EU. Compounding this problem has been the practice in recent years of significant Department of Defence Vote moneys being returned to the Central Fund at year end. The size of that return depends on one's interpretation of it, but I am particularly concerned this year. Most of the Deputies present will know that we have voted through Revised Estimates for nearly all Departments in the past few weeks with the notable exception of the Department of Defence. I deduce from that that expenditure under the Department of Defence's Vote has not reached 70% or 80% of its threshold yet. I am concerned that a significant sum of money will still be unspent by the end of the year. Will the Tánaiste provide assurances or a suggestion that all the moneys given to the Vote at the start of this year will be used for their intended purpose and none will be handed back unspent at the end of the year?</p>

          <p eId="para_303">There is a long-standing myth - I will be polite in using the word "myth" - that the Department of Defence hands back millions of euro to the Central Fund every year. I do not know whether it is an error or mischief on the part of those who continue to repeat it, but it is not true. While it is the case that money is reallocated from one part of the Department's Vote to another, that is normal. Anyone who has been in the Oireachtas for long enough or who has run a Department knows that one will often move money from one part of the Department's budget to another. Sometimes, money is moved from the pay budget to pensions. Sometimes, it is moved from the pay and pensions budget to buy new equipment, improve barracks, etc. Overall, however, the Department of Defence almost always spends all of its budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> In 2014, its budget was €900 million. That year, €100,000 was handed back. Its budget was €900 million the following year, when €400,000 was handed back. It was €905 million the year after, with €100,000 handed back. In 2017, the budget increased to €921 million, with just under €1 million handed back. In 2018, the budget increased to €946 million, with €2.7 million handed back. Last year, the budget was more than €1 billion for the first time in a long time, with €100,000 handed back. Taking those years in the round, the Department hands back approximately 0.08% of its funding. As such, the idea that the Department has handed back a great deal of money to the Exchequer in any recent year is false. However, money is reallocated from one budget line to another within the Department of Defence Vote regularly.</p>

          <p eId="para_306">On Tuesday, I was glad to see that the Tánaiste agreed with my view when a spokesperson said on his behalf that, if the travel advice for countries on the green list was not different to the advice relating to other countries, we would be better off not having a green list at all. Fair play to the Tánaiste. On Tuesday night, however, the Government agreed the opposite. It gave a green light to go and then said "Do not go". The advice from the Government remains not to travel except in essential circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> Last night, Ryanair sent a notification to thousands of people across the State telling them that they had the green light to fly to Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Malta and more and offering them cheap flights. Has the Tánaiste received that notification? Maybe he also received it. We are used to ridiculous announcements from Ryanair, but we are discussing public health. This is not a gimmick. Yesterday, a Minister was forced to admit that the issue of the green list was confusing. That is a result of Government policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> Does the Tánaiste share my concern that Ryanair is using the green list to encourage people to fly to the destinations on it? What action, if any, can the Government take?</p>

          <p eId="para_309">I thank the Deputy. No airline or tour operator can issue travel advice on behalf of the Government - the Government issues travel advice. If anyone is confused about travel advice, he or she should go to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's website to find it. It may not be simple, but it is clear. What we are saying to people is that the safest thing is to stay at home and holiday in Ireland this year. However, there is a difference between countries that have a very low level of the virus and those that do not. If someone is travelling to and returning from a green list country or just coming from there, that person does not need to restrict his or her movements for 14 days on arrival in Ireland. The list will be updated every two weeks based on public health advice and epidemiological data. If someone is coming in from countries that are not on the green list, which account for the majority of the world, including Britain, that person needs to restrict his or her movements for 14 days. The individual will be treated as if he or she was a close contact. This means staying at home like during the lockdown and only going out for exercise on his or her own or to purchase essential supplies. I hope that is clear.</p>

I understand that next week the families will protest outside this venue because nothing has changed. The most vulnerable people in our communities and society, those with intellectual disabilities, are losing the will. I spoke to a mother this morning at 7.30 a.m. whose son is 29 years of age and had been up early. They are at their last tether. What has happened in the last two weeks? I have a list of all services in Ireland across each CHO area. There are little services, if any, in many cases. These are the people we are leaving behind. We are genuinely leaving these people behind. It is immoral. What are we going to do to ensure their day services are returned as soon as possible because we cannot countenance this any more?</p>

In the last 20 days since I took office I have liaised directly with the HSE and the Department of Health and yesterday I met the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, to address this particular issue. I am acutely aware that there are 1,000 services and only 286 of them up and running and only 500 people have returned. We have set in place communication between the Department and the various providers. They are all individual units. As I said, I met yesterday with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly. We are acutely aware that funding needs to be put in place to ensure services can reopen in a safe way. A memo will be brought to Cabinet next week seeking funding in respect of which all providers can submit their plans for their units. The objective is to have at a minimum 50% but hopefully 70% of capacity returned by September. That is where we want to get to.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">I get reports of wildlife crimes and habitat destruction on a regular basis. When I contact the National Parks and Wildlife Service the response is that an investigation will be carried out but very few investigations result in prosecutions. Recent successful prosecutions range from five in 2014 to 21 last year. Clearly, these rates are not a deterrent to people who illegally hunt, poison raptors and damage habitats. Why are there not more prosecutions?</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> The programme for Government commits to reviewing funding for the National Parks and Wildlife Service but it desperately needs to go further.

          <p eId="para_319">I thank the Deputy for the question. The budget for the National Parks and Wildlife Service has been increased in recent years and I am confident it will be again. We have some fabulous national parks in Ireland. A lot of people will have an opportunity to discover them over the next couple of months. I was in the Burren National Park last weekend. I encourage people to visit but not in too large numbers because it does take away from it when there are too many people there. It is difficult for me to answer the question so I will ask the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to correspond with the Deputy in more detail. I do know that prosecutions can be difficult to take in this area because for a prosecution to be effective evidence is needed. Evidence of wildlife crimes usually involves either a witness or a video. Without those, it is hard to secure a prosecution. We need to do more for sure.</p>

Is it not the case that the term "stimulus" is completely a misnomer when what was leaked today and was in the air for the last number of days is that there will not be a stimulus for some of the people on the lowest incomes and some of the people who have been hardest hit by loss of income and unemployment, caused not by any fault of their own but because of the impact of Covid? The plan now is not to stimulate but to slash the payments of people who have lost their jobs and whose incomes have been reduced and to cut progressively the pandemic unemployment payment over the coming months. How is cutting the incomes of people who have lost jobs and incomes a stimulus?</p>

          <p eId="para_329"> Deputy Boyd Barrett asked what is a stimulus. Stimulus is the Government pumping money into the economy. That is exactly what we are doing. We will pump about €30 billion into the economy this year. The stimulus package is only part of that. We are taking in about €50 billion in taxes and spending €80 billion. Therefore, €30 billion is being pumped into the economy. That is a stimulus. The plan was to end the wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment around 10 August but that will now not be the case. They will be extended and there will be a further stimulus but we will set out how they will be phased out because they cannot last forever. People appreciate that. The best way to help people is to get them back to work, not to keep them on welfare forever, which is a very different type of policy that I do not support.</p>

The NDLS centre in Clonmel, and others throughout the country, are closed, over-booked and cannot provide appointments to people whose licences will expire today, next week or the week after and it is not possible to renew a licence online. This is a very serious situation. People who do not have a licence cannot drive. This is affecting business, families, young people and old people. The Government needs to provide for a further extension of licences that have expired or are due to expire until such time as people can get an appointment to renew them. There is anarchy out there. All proper living people will not drive without a licence. Also, they are not insured to drive without a licence. People need to be given appointments to renew their licences and in the meantime the extension needs to be further extended.</p>

          <p eId="para_337">I want to ask the Tánaiste a question on education. Some smaller schools will lose a teacher this year because of a drop in pupil numbers. Can a moratorium be put on that for 12 months to allow them to meet their requirements in respect of Covid-19? For a school of four teachers to go to three, it will have a significant impact on social distancing within that school. It is common sense that there be a moratorium for 12 months on smaller schools losing a teacher.</p>

          <p eId="para_338">I have raised this matter before and I have serious concerns. The pragmatic step to take would be to bring in a moratorium. I raised the issue with the previous Minister with responsibility. It is only fair and right because many additional substitute teachers will be needed. There are schools that are falling only marginally short of the number of pupils required to retain teachers. If they lose that valuable teacher, it will put them in a difficult position. In my constituency, I am aware of one school in Ferbane that is losing a teacher. It is totally unfair. Given that we are in the middle of a pandemic, I ask that we show some common sense and put a moratorium on any teacher losses.</p>

          <p eId="para_339">This is an important issue. I understand that a mechanism is in place for small schools that were due to lose a teacher to have that decision appealed or reviewed. I do not know whether there are plans to have a moratorium. As I mentioned earlier, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, will be here to take oral questions next week. The deadline is still open for Deputies to submit questions and I am sure she will be happy to answer them in detail.</p>

          <p eId="para_340">The programme for Government promised to increase the capacity within our hospitals, which means additional beds. This week, at a meeting of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, stated we need to fast-track 7,100 acute community and rehabilitation beds, as well as doubling the capacity in ICU. A total of 25% of acute hospitals' inpatient beds could be lost as a result of physical distancing measures. Given what the IHCA stated and what is promised in the programme for Government, why are we failing to carry this out on the ground?</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> Belmullet hospital is a case in point. There are five patients within the hospital and there is a full complement of staff. There is no provision to do the slight maintenance work that needs to be done. At a Labour Court hearing on this last year it was recommended that four staff would be employed, but then the Government brought in the moratorium, so that could not happen. There are carers who cannot avail of respite and there are no step-down facilities. All we have is empty promises.</p>

          <p eId="para_342">I cannot answer the Deputy's question specific to Belmullet hospital but I will ask the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to correspond with her on that. There is no moratorium. We have 15,000 more health staff now than only a few years ago and we are recruiting all the time. Bed capacity is being increased. Three new hospitals are under construction in the country, one of which, the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire, has recently been completed, while new hospital wings have been built or completed all over the country, in Clonmel, Waterford and Limerick, for example. It might not be happening fast enough but it is happening and we will try to speed it up.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> It should not all be about beds. I can understand why hospital consultants and people who work in hospitals will always say there should be more hospital beds but there is more to the health service than hospitals. Although when compared with many other countries, we have many fewer beds, it is interesting that when we are compared with countries such as Denmark or Sweden, where primary care is very advanced, we actually have more beds per head than they do, and a similar number to that of the UK National Health Service. It should never be simplified to that level; it is a very hospital-centric view of things.</p>

          <p eId="para_346">Yesterday I was contacted by a constituent whose mother is a resident in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon. By chance, on a visit to her mother last week, she was told that, in four and a half weeks' time, her mother and residents from two other wards in the home will be removed to two other nursing homes in the county. This relates to works that are necessary for the nursing home to be HIQA compliant.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> Understandably, families are really concerned about any relocation of residents, given the Covid-19 crisis, which we are not through just yet. A HSE statement today stated consultation is under way with families and residents, yet in the case of the resident whose daughter I spoke to yesterday, the family have not even got a letter or any communication from the HSE about this move. Will the Government please ensure that the HSE communicates and consults the families and residents who are going to be moved? Will it also ensure that the HSE communicates with HIQA on any alternatives that could be put in place, rather than moving residents in the midst of a global pandemic?</p>

          <p eId="para_349">I wish to ask the Tánaiste about the detail of the promise in the programme for Government to "[i]ncrease the number of specialist palliative care beds countrywide over the next five years, ensuring that there will be a hospice serving every region in the country." I was very disappointed when reading the programme for Government that there is a lack of detail throughout the document. There are very few numbers, which means there are very few clear targets. I feel that this is just a way to avoid being held to account when little or no progress is being made. What is meant by a "region"? Is it a county, a province or a major town? County Laois does not have an inpatient hospice or a specialist palliative care unit but we need one. We need a clear plan as to how and when it will be delivered, and we need one that is fit for purpose and for the future. In developing end-of-life services, the care and dignity of a dying person and his or her family must be our focus.</p>

          <p eId="para_350">I think we would all agree that our hospices in Ireland provide excellent end-of-life care, both in terms of hospice care and home care. There has been a significant increase in capacity in our hospices in recent years. The hospice in Mayo opened only in the past year or so, I think a new hospice is due to open in Wicklow soon, while there are new hospice developments both in Waterford, in the Dunmore wing, and in Drogheda. Much progress is being made in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> A "region" does not mean a town or a county; it is bigger than that. It is acknowledged that one region that does not have a hospice at the moment is the midlands region. There has been some difficulty in agreeing on where in the midlands that should be, but the Government wants to put that right and ensure there is an inpatient hospice in the midlands within the next five years.</p>

          <p eId="para_355">The programme for Government gives a commitment on page 5 to value our older people and in this regard I raise the closure of Mount Cara on Redemption Road in Cork city. This is a residential care setting with capacity for 25 patients and which currently has 15 patients. The latest HIQA report from January indicates that residents reported being happy and content in this setting. This is another devastating loss to the north side of Cork city and the patients, their families and the staff are very worried about being moved from a nursing home that does not have Covid-19 now. They are very nervous about it. Will the Tánaiste give a commitment that the HSE will step in and take over the running of this facility?</p>

The roll-out has been very slow as only 12 of 29 children with this condition have so far received treatment. Spinal muscular atrophy is a degenerative disease and these continued delays have a real and psychological impact on children with the condition, who lose a little more motor function every day. Adults are not included in the roll-out of the drug. Will the Government address this matter and ensure all children and adults who need it can receive the drug?</p>

          <p eId="para_358">I know the drug was approved for use some months ago if not last year. However, the process is not straightforward and this is not just a medicine that can be given to a patient, including children. This must be administered in hospital in a particular way. The Children's Health Ireland group, including the Crumlin hospital, must scale that up over time.

          <p eId="para_359">There is a commitment in the programme for Government on the future of the aviation sector. We are an island nation and the sector is of essential strategic importance but it has been adversely affected by Covid-19. The approach of the industry in response to this has been to delay refunds and the issuing of vouchers to people who had flights cancelled, to charge exorbitant rescheduling fees for people adhering to the public health advice and to cut jobs and change the terms and conditions of workers. This is doing reputational damage to the sector and undermining public health advice and the public health effort.</p>

          <p eId="para_362">Mr. Pádraig Harnett from Killarney posted on social media two hours ago, stating that a drive-in cinema is allowed but our hard-pressed musicians and comedians cannot do drive-in shows because the law does not give permission for anybody to be on a stage. He referred to "more of this lazy one rule fits all governing". The income of our musicians, comedians and all the crews has been wiped out, with no date set for a return to indoor events. Venues that looked to be proactive and book acts had to cancel them due to another poorly written law.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> There are 35,000 people involved in the entertainment business. Taking the Gleneagle INEC venue in Killarney as an example, a far finer venue than where we are sitting today, it had a summer schedule arranged. It included people like the great comedian Bernard Casey and others. It was arranged but now the venue has had to stop the performances. It does not make sense that we can go to a drive-in cinema or drive-in bingo but not this. There was drive-in bingo in Castleisland two weeks ago that drew a great crowd. I went there and played bingo and I was very glad to do so. However, it makes no sense that we cannot have a drive-in concert.</p>

We have some time over the next couple of weeks to examine the matter. I am not a public health expert but if people on stage are adequately socially distanced, it should be okay.

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_429">That a sum not exceeding €21,704,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 2020, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I am appearing today on behalf of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to present the 2020 Estimate for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform group of Votes. This includes the Office of Public Works, which is my responsibility. I intend to share my time with the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> The group comprises a significant number of Votes, including the Vote for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Votes for a number of offices under the aegis of the Department, including the State Laboratory, the Public Appointments Service, the National Shared Services Office and the Office of the Ombudsman, the Vote for Superannuation and Retired Allowances, which covers Civil Service pensions, the Secret Service, the Office of Government Procurement, the Office of the Chief Government Information Officer, OCGIO, which is a new Vote, and the Vote of the Office of Public Works. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will address the issues relating to the Office of Government Procurement and the Office of the Chief Government Information Officer.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> As the Revised Estimates for 2020 published in December 2019 were not voted upon prior to the dissolution of Dáil Éireann earlier this year - the Estimates process is normally concluded in February - spending to date in 2020 has proceeded under the four fifths rule, which is applied under the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965. Under this rule, Departments can spend an amount up to 80% of that included for the relevant Department in the previous year's Appropriation Act. This provision ensures that Departments can continue to spend in the period before the Estimates are voted by the Dáil. A number of Votes within the public expenditure and reform group are at risk of reaching their four fifths limit in the coming weeks so to enable spending, both in terms of pay and pensions of the public servants concerned, and that the important programmes administered across these Votes continue, the 2020 Estimates are presented today for approval by Dáil Éireann, and I would appreciate the support of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> I note that a detailed briefing has been supplied to Deputies by the Department's officials who were assisted in this task by their colleagues in a number of bodies under the aegis of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Further detailed material is also contained in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2020, which was prepared by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> Covid-19, along with other areas, has presented unprecedented challenges for our officials, Members of this House and communities across the country. Arrangements for business continuity and flexible working have ensured that essential public services can continue to be delivered while also ensuring that the general principles of health and safety and welfare in the workplace are adhered to. Officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the bodies under the Department's aegis have played a central role in responding to the challenges of the crisis. On behalf of the Government, I take the opportunity to thank all of those involved for their collective efforts in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> In an overall context, it is worth noting that the total gross allocation for the public expenditure and reform group, comprising ten distinct Votes for 2020, shows an increase of 6.4% on the 2019 allocation. The majority of Votes are showing very modest increases. The 2020 overall gross figure is approximately €1.334 billion compared to €1.25 billion in 2019. In 2020, a new Vote, Vote 43, has been established for the OCGIO. This new Vote will serve to drive a process of digital transformation across Government and the implementation of various strategies. That is something I am fully aware of having been Minister with responsibility for eGovernment in the previous Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_436"> The structure of the public expenditure and reform Vote remains unchanged in 2020, with two strategic programmes focused on public expenditure and sectoral policy and public service management and reform. The requested resources for each programme in terms of staffing and funding are set out in part III of the Estimate. In 2020, a 27% decrease in the gross allocation for this Vote brings the total gross allocation to €44.9 million. This decrease is driven largely by the move of the OCGIO subhead to a new stand-alone Vote for 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> Public service reform remains a key priority for the Department. Funding for the public service innovation fund has doubled to €1 million in 2020 to reflect the demand from public service bodies seeking their services and operations. </p>
          <p eId="para_438"> Turning now to the other Votes within Vote group 1, I would like to mention that a memorandum of understanding has been agreed between the Public Appointments Service, PAS, Vote 17, and An Garda Síochána. This will result in the Public Appointments Service playing a key role in the selection aspects of internal Garda to sergeant and sergeant to inspector promotion competitions in 2020. Agreement has also been reached to transfer associated funding from the An Garda Síochána fund to the PAS fund to reflect this additional level of service. The impetus for this development is the 2018 Future of Policing in Ireland report which highlighted the importance of putting in place well-designed promotion systems within An Garda Síochána that are managed transparently and in line with best practice in the public sector. The Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda Síochána management have welcomed the increased involvement of the PAS in terms of introducing modern practices to the Garda in terms of its internal promotion procedures and practices. This can represent an important symbol of change within An Garda Síochána as people promoted through these competitions will have a critical role to play in shaping the future of policing across Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> Regarding superannuation and retired allowances, Vote 12, this Vote provides for funding to allow the payment of pensions for retired civil servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The variation in expenditure from year to year is primarily driven by the number of individuals who will opt to retire before reaching their compulsory retirement age and whose age, service, grade or pay level are variable and uncertain. The Estimate being proposed today involves a gross provision of €640.1 million, representing an increase of €25 million, or 4.1%, on the gross figure for superannuation. This reflects an increase in the number of pensioners on the payroll and the number of civil servants reaching retirement age this year. The increase in gross expenditure is mitigated by an increase in contributions from the single public service pension scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> A modest increase to the State Laboratory's 2020 Estimate under Vote 14 will allow for investment in specialised laboratory equipment enabling the lab to respond to increases in the number of samples to be tested for veterinary drug residues following the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> The National Shared Services Office, NSSO - Vote 18 - has played an important role in the reform of public services in recent years through the delivery of human resources services, payroll services and shared services to clients in the Civil Service and the public service. The increase of the NSSO's gross budget by 10% in 2020 reflects the continued need for investment to save, in other words, to deliver more efficient standardised services.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> The Estimate providing for the Office of the Ombudsman, Vote 19, will allow the various constituent offices to deal with their increased workload, continue investment in ICT modernisation and meet the challenge of delivering essential services to the public remotely at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> The 2020 Estimate provides a gross allocation of €505.427 million for the Office Public of Works, OPW, which is my responsibility. This supports the ongoing and widely respected work of the OPW and the provision of vital services to people across the areas of flood risk management and estate management, including our much-valued heritage estate. Our programme for Government recognises that climate change is one of the most significant challenges facing our country. The OPW has a significant role to play in climate action in two specific areas, namely, ensuring the energy-efficiency of the State's building stock and implementing a holistic approach to flood risk management.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> At the core of the OPW's flood risk management work is the objective of reducing the flood risk to people, property, infrastructure and the environment to the greatest extent possible. In the context of this role, the OPW delivers services in four key areas. These include: strategic planning to manage future flood risk, including the co-ordination on behalf of the Government of cross-sectoral policies that mitigate flood risk; a programme of capital investment delivered in partnership with local authorities; programme maintenance of 11,500 km of river channels, including 800 km of embankments, and of arterial drainage; and advising the State and the general public on preparation for and response to flooding events.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> The OPW has completed the largest study of flood risk ever undertaken in the history of the State, the catchment flood risk assessment and management programme, CFRAM. This study included an analysis of significant flood risks throughout 300 designated communities that are home to more than 3 million people. It provided 29 flood risk management plans which prioritise feasible measures to manage the assessed flood risk. As Deputies will be aware, the Government launched a €1 billion flood risk management investment programme under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 as part of Project Ireland 2040. Since the launch of the flood risk management plan in May 2018, the OPW has almost tripled the number of major flood relief schemes at design and construction stage, increasing the number from 33 to 92 by the end of 2019. This investment will provide protection to 95% of the homes identified under CFRAM as being at significant risk of flooding. It will also deliver sustainable benefits to our communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> The OPW has incorporated assessments of the potential impacts of climate change into the CFRAM programme to identify potential future risks. It takes account of the need for adaption in the design and implementation of each flood relief scheme. In addition to this, the OPW has prepared a climate change sectoral adaptation plan for flood risk management which runs from 2019 to 2024. This is in line with the requirements of the national adaptation framework and the climate action plan of 2019. The plan was approved by the Government in October 2019 and includes a range of actions to adapt our flood risk management practice to effectively manage the potential impacts of climate change on future flood risk. Managing Ireland's flood risk is a long-term commitment requiring a multisectoral approach involving both capital infrastructural measures and non-infrastructural measures. The OPW co-ordinates an integrated whole-of-Government approach to flood risk management and an allocation of €126.219 million has been provided for within the Estimate to deliver this essential service.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> The OPW's second significant programme, estate management, has been allocated a gross sum of €379.208 million. This allocation supports essential work in the management, design, maintenance and conservation of State properties, including Civil Service office accommodation and our internationally recognised heritage sites and monuments. In all, the OPW manages 2,500 properties on behalf of the State. The OPW continues to focus on optimising and sustaining modern, flexible and energy-efficient working environments for Departments and their employees. Like all public bodies, the OPW is in the process of responding to the immediate challenge arising from Covid-19 and will have a key role to play in designing the workplace of the future for the Civil Service. The OPW is working with other Departments to address this issue and to ensure new and agile ways of working are developed to meet the changing requirements for our office accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> The OPW is also responsible for the management and conservation of some of Ireland's most significant heritage properties, monuments, gardens and arboreta. The management role includes the curation and presentation of 30 major historical properties, gardens and arboreta and significant collections of art, artefacts, plants and trees. It also ensures public well-being and enjoyment of these estates. Heritage continues to play a pivotal role in our tourism sector, which, like many other business activities, has been sorely affected by the current pandemic. It is important, therefore, that we adequately fund this area in order to ensure we are all well positioned to support the recovery of the sector and the wider economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> I have only made reference to a small section of the work of the OPW and I have not gone into the detail of how it can contribute widely to the economic stimulus. However, it goes without saying that investment in the work programme of the OPW reaches into every county and community in the country, providing support and significant public benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> The Minister of State with responsibility for public procurement and eGovernment, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will address the issue of the Votes in his own areas of responsibility.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Ossian Smyth)<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_452">As Minister of State with responsibility for public procurement and eGovernment, I am very pleased to introduce the 2020 Estimates for the Votes for the Office of Government Procurement and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> The Vote for the OGCIO, Vote 43, is new and has only been established this year. As Minister of State with responsibility for eGovernment, I am pleased to lead the continued digital transformation across government and the implementation of associated strategies through the OGCIO. It is important that the State matches the productivity gains which 21st century technology is bringing to industry. As a result, it is essential to have a dedicated Minister and a public body to champion, innovate with and harness automation and technology. This can enable public service employees to give their best, provide greater value for money for the taxpayer and improve services for the citizen. The establishment of the Vote for the OGCIO will enable an even wider adoption of its full range of build-to-share services, which in turn will drive digital transformation in government at a faster pace by freeing up Departments and bodies to focus on transformation initiatives rather than simply keeping the lights on.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> Building on our recent experiences of digitally enabled large-scale remote working, there is much we can learn to introduce more long-term improvements in how we work throughout the Civil Service and the public service and how we serve our stakeholders. The impact of the OGCIO Vote will be seen on two fronts. It will enable more bodies to avail of the OGCIO's common ICT services and it will provide increased scope for the OGCIO to drive the Government's digital agenda through further strategic investment, thus ensuring digital transformation is a high priority across all sectors of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> In the current situation, it is even more critical that the public service continues to develop digital services that are consistently easy and convenient to use. In recent months we have seen the value of our public service portal in providing the single source for information for citizens about the pandemic itself and the Government response. Use of the <i>gov.ie </i>platform has increased by 760% from 2019. The key to progress in providing digital public services is having people with the right skills in the right roles to develop the services. We have been working with Civil Service HR departments to progress a range of initiatives relating to ICT professionalisation in the Civil Service. I am very pleased with the progress of our pilot. An apprentice ICT specialist programme has been designed and more than 30 apprentices have already been placed with 11 Departments and offices. I look forward to seeing our apprentices qualify and join the Civil Service ICT cohort in the coming year. I am also looking into a similar programme for retraining people whose jobs have been affected by the pandemic and the related growth in digitisation and automation.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I see great potential for the digital technology sector to help to drive recovery through the establishment of a govtech ecosystem, as it is called, which could further accelerate digital government while also stimulating our indigenous SME start-up sector. The recent success of the Covid-19 contact tracing app, which was developed by an Irish company and is now being replicated across the world, is evidence of what can be achieved when we all work together.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> I will turn now to my responsibilities for public procurement. The Office of Government Procurement, which is covered in Vote 39, has played an important role in recent months in supporting the national response to Covid-19. This has included direct procurement support to the HSE and other public bodies engaged in the delivery of front-line services to the public. The office has issued a number of important policy information notes to public bodies providing guidance on managing the procurement implications of Covid-19. The office has ongoing responsibilities as the central purchasing body for eight categories of commonly purchased goods and services, leading the ongoing reform programme for public procurement, setting national policy in regard to public procurement, supporting the professionalisation of the practice of public procurement and managing the national procurement platform, eTenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> The programme for Government sets out a number of ambitious policy objectives in the areas of environmental and social considerations through public procurement while also delivering value for money and supporting the continued participation of small and medium enterprises in this important business opportunity. I look forward to working with the Office of Government Procurement to build on its ongoing work in these areas. I am happy to present the 2020 Revised Estimates for the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and the Office of Government Procurement, approval of which will allow them to continue to meet their responsibilities and deliver essential services. I look forward to the debate on these proposals and I am happy to answer any questions that arise.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mairéad Farrell<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_459">Táimse ag tosú do Shinn Féin. Tá sé dochreidte go bhfuil muid anseo inniu ag plé athruithe airgeadais agus muid i lár paindéime. Sa tseachtain chéanna inar chlois muid go mbeidh Airí Stáit ag fáil ardú pá d'os cionn €16,000, tá daoine agus gnólachtaí faoi bhrú uafásach. Níl a fhios acu cén t-ioncam a bheidh acu sa todhchaí. Léiríonn an cinneadh seo nach bhfuil tuiscint ar bith ag an Rialtas ar shaol an gnáthdhuine. B'fhéidir, fiú, nach bhfuil suim ag an Rialtas i saol an ghnáthdhuine.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> This has been another chaotic week for the Government. Once again, it has proved itself to be completely out of touch with reality. On Tuesday, I questioned the Minister on the use of taxpayers' money for the hiring of excessive numbers of well-paid advisers, 17 in total, for the Taoiseach and the leader of the Green Party. That same evening, media sources reported that a decision had been made at Cabinet to increase the wages of the three super junior Ministers by €16,000. Does the Government need a reality check? In the middle of a pandemic, a wage increase of €16,000 is massive. Are they called super junior Ministers because they have some kind of superpower? Unless they do actually have superpowers, I do not understand why the Government thinks they need an extra €16,000 in income.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> In regard to the Revised Estimates, the manner in which the information has been presented to us is lacking in specific detail and does not allow for as much scrutiny as we would like. A consistent approach to performance budgeting, including metrics on financial allocations, would help to facilitate more effective scrutiny, which is surely in the public interest. In addition, it would be helpful if there were a proper breakdown of capital expenditure into subsections for the acquisition of new non-current assets versus the enhancement of existing ones. I am aware that there will be a difference in how capital expenditure and current expenditure can be reported given that the former must go through several stages before construction begins. Nevertheless, greater clarity and transparency could be provided on forthcoming capital expenditure projects that are proceeding to the implementation stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> With regard to capital expenditure, there should be no doubt, in the midst of an economic crisis, that we need shovel-ready projects that will put people directly to work in good jobs and support ancillary jobs in local communities. We need strong procurement contracts and to move away from the cost overruns we have seen in the past. We need the inclusion of social clauses that allow people to get jobs in their communities and enable apprentices to be taken on and upskilled. There is an opportunity for the Minister to do this right. However, as I alluded to, the lack of detail in the Revised Estimates makes it more difficult to know what the capital expenditure consists of.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> In my own constituency, there are numerous badly needed capital projects, many of which have already been subject to a cost-benefit analysis and given initial approval. The much-needed Inis Oírr pier development, for example, was promised in 2015 under the Government's capital investment plan, Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-21. It is now more than four years since that plan was published but no works have been done on the pier. I put in a parliamentary question on this issue to the previous Minister, who was unable to give an exact update as to when the works would commence. This is a critical piece of infrastructure for Inis Oírr. The project is essential for public safety as well as being fundamental to the survival and sustainability of the island's economy. The development of Inis Oírr pier cannot be rowed back on by the Government under any circumstance.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> Another example of a project in my constituency that has not progressed is the development of Rossaveel Harbour in Connemara. A cost-benefit analysis report on the proposed deepwater quay was undertaken by DKM Economic Consultants for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, following which planning permission was sought and obtained in 2018 for the new development. However, there has been no further movement on the project and the people of Rossaveel and Connemara have been left in the dark, with no explanation or justification for this lack of action and progress. The report clearly states that the development of a deepwater quay in Rossaveel is a worthwhile project that would yield significant and substantial benefits for the local economy in terms of tourism and employment, something that is made all the more pressing in the current economic climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> I strongly welcome the funding that is to go towards flooding prevention. It is absolutely essential for Galway, the west and the midlands. We have seen time and again the devastation that flooding can visit on communities, businesses and family homes. It is essential that the work is done to alleviate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> I have a question regarding the allocation to the secret service. I have seen an indication that there will be a 60% increase in this provision from €900,000 in 2019 to an estimated €2 million this year. I would like clarity as to the accuracy of that apparent jump.</p>

          <p eId="para_467">We are, in effect, in committee when debating the Revised Estimates and, as such, I expect a back-and-forth engagement with the Ministers of State during the five minutes available to me. I want to make the point again and send a clear signal to the Government that the way some of the business in this House is conducted is not acceptable and is showing disregard to the Dáil and to Members. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform should be here for this discussion. It is standard practice that it is the Minister who brings forward Estimates. With no disrespect to the Ministers of State, they are not responsible for the vast amount of the Estimates that are being put forward here. We had the Tánaiste not turning up for legislation last night. We had the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform leaving after 30 minutes of Question Time. We had the Minister for Finance not turning up for legislation last week, which meant the Dáil had to be suspended. That has to stop and we must send a clear signal in this regard. The Ceann Comhairle needs to intervene if this is the way Ministers think they are going to treat the Members who are in here representing the public in their constituencies. Ministers must start attending the relevant business. If there is a scheduling issue with committees or subcommittees, that issue will have to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> My main question for the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, is whether he can confirm that a memorandum went to Cabinet to approve a €16,288 increase for a Minister of State who is already receiving a salary of €124,439. I ask him to answer that question first.</p>

          <p eId="para_483">I am trying to be respectful to the Deputy's party and answer the questions asked by the previous Sinn Féin speaker, Deputy Mairéad Farrell, as well as those asked by Deputy Doherty. She deserves answers to the very important questions she raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> On the issue of capital expenditure within my Department, Deputy Farrell raised a very interesting issue in the context of Covid in particular. There is a €200,000 allocation within the voted Estimate for additional ICT expenditure. Much of this funding will help to support staff of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who must work from home, including staff of my section, the OPW.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> The Deputy raised the issue of shovel-ready projects. I am the Minister of State with responsibility for most of the capital works carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because they come under the auspices of the OPW. We are on target to spend €1 billion over ten years. I will have to revert to the Deputy on the issues she raised in respect of Inis Oírr and Rossaveel in Galway because I think they relate to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> I thank the Deputy for her support for the OPW in the context of its work on flooding. The more support I get from Deputies and the more the issue is raised, the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> On the secret service, there has been a convention in the Dáil that the Vote for the secret service is noted but it is not discussed in detail. There has been a marginal increase in the allocation and I think the Deputy will accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> I understand that Deputy Doherty is not happy. I was here last week. I cannot do anything about the matter. A Cabinet meeting is currently under way. I hope he will respect the fact that I am trying to answer his question. On the issue of the memorandum he stated was brought to the Government last night, I will try to get that confirmed for him before the sitting is finished.</p>

          <p eId="para_489">I believe I am correct in my understanding because legislation is being brought forward tomorrow. The priority of the Government in the middle of a pandemic, at a time when cancer patients cannot get medical cards, people are seeing their PUP being cut and students are wondering how they will get back to school, is to introduce legislation to give a junior Minister who is already on €124,000 an extra €16,000. The former Tánaiste did not know that this even happened at Cabinet. Can the Minister of State confirm whether Ministers nod off at Cabinet meetings as well as doing so in the Dáil? Can he explain to me and, more important, to the public, how under God the Government thinks it appropriate at this time to increase the salary of a junior Minister who is already on €124,000? A sum of €16,000 is a significant amount of money. This sends out all the wrong signals. Just a few years ago when Fianna Fáil was in opposition it stated that it is adequate to have two super junior Ministers and that it is not a matter for the Dáil to pass legislation to solve an informal Fine Gael demotion or promotion issue. What has changed? We know that Fianna Fáil could never be trusted. The only thing that has changed is that it is now the beneficiary of the super junior Ministry and the bump of €16,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_493">On Vote 13 - Office of Public Works, I wish to raise the issue of flood defences. The Minister of State will be well aware of the flooding problems in Limerick city in recent years. In 2014, a massive flood destroyed parts of the city. A report was carried out under the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, but it is now six years later and most of the required defences have not been put in place. Is there any way to prioritise them or speed up their delivery? The Minister of State referred to the CFRAM programme and stated that 95% of flood areas in the country will be protected under the programme. What will be done for the other 5%? Is the Minister of State looking at a plan to bail out people living in houses that, unfortunately, cannot be protected by flood defences?</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> The Minister of State was at a meeting last week with Shannon Group which I also attended. I raise the matter as it relates to Vote 13 - Office of Public Works. Will the OPW consider taking Shannon Heritage into its charge? The Minister of State will be well aware that many people have no confidence in Shannon Group. I and other Sinn Féin members representing the mid-west have asked that the board of Shannon Group would step down. We believe it has not focused on Shannon Heritage whatsoever. The sites are to close at the end of August. Staff are concerned about their jobs. We believe many of the sites, which include Bunratty Castle in County Clare, King John's Castle in Limerick City, my constituency, and, believe it or not, Malahide Castle in County Dublin, could remain open all year around. They were profitable last year. We understand that there has been a drop in the number of foreign tourists, but people are being encouraged to take staycations. I was in Bunratty Castle last Sunday and it was packed. One had to queue for everything. There is demand for it. I respectfully ask the OPW to consider taking Shannon Heritage into its charge because Shannon Group has not looked after it to date.</p>

          <p eId="para_499"> On the issue of Shannon Heritage, I was at several meetings organised by Deputy Carey specifically in respect of the Shannon Group's handling of its heritage portfolio. It is an issue about which I am concerned. I understand that Clare County Council and Limerick City and County Councils have engaged on the matter. If there are specific forms of support the OPW can give, such as advice and so on, it will certainly consider that. It already has a comprehensive portfolio of sites which take up a substantial amount of money. My understanding is that there was a development plan for Bunratty Castle and King John's Castle. I will request further detail in that regard and have it circulated to the Deputy. No formal request for the OPW to take on those properties has been received. Obviously, we are prepared to engage in dialogue regarding Bunratty Castle and King John's Castle because we understand their significance in the context of tourism.</p>

          <p eId="para_500">I share the disappointment of the Sinn Féin Deputies that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, is not here for this matter. I mean no disrespect to the Ministers of State who are present. It is incredible that the Minister, Deputy McGrath, is not present, but it is more incredible that there have been several Cabinet meetings so far this week. That is not a good image for a Government that is in its early days to portray. A Government that holds so many meetings in such a short time is a Government that is under serious pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> The belated July stimulus will be announced today after the Government spent the past three weeks inventing a mini July stimulus for itself. There are now a near-record 20 junior Ministers. There have not been so many Ministers of State since the days of Bertie Ahern and Charlie McCreevy. Some 17 special advisers are soon to be appointed to work with the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Green Party leader and Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Eamon Ryan. As has been noted on the record, yesterday it emerged that the three super junior Ministers will receive an additional €16,000 each in allowances. I am old enough to remember when two super junior Ministers were sufficient. This is a very anxious time for families and businesses, but there is no sign whatsoever of the Government tightening its belt and acknowledging or understanding the pain and difficulty in which many people find themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">This approach is absolutely tone-deaf to the day-to-day needs of families across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> They say a good start is half the battle but most people are watching the first few weeks of this Government's tenure and observing its behaviour from behind their hands and behind the couch, it is such a car crash. Much of what is in this document is actually historic. In many ways, going through these Revised Estimates is almost pointless. This is no way to present the Estimates. They are quite opaque and lacking in detail. We have no real idea or granular detail regarding how much of this money has been spent, nor do we have sufficient time to forensically examine expenditure, which is unfortunate to say the least. Today we will get the first glimpse of the economic trajectory and philosophy of this Government. Unfortunately, I get a sense from newspapers and media reports in recent days that in many respects it is going to be a case of "Meet the new Government, same as the old Government" only with a small change of emphasis.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> What lessons have been learned from the overspend on the children's hospital debacle? The capital works management framework has been established. This is an important body charged with managing an enormous amount of public expenditure over the next number of years in the context of Project Ireland 2040. We need to ensure that we get value for money and that cost overruns are managed properly, transparently and accountably.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> Can the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW advise which of the office's sites have been most impacted in terms of the fall-off in admission revenue this year? Clearly, the figures there are very concerning. In terms of subhead B.5, could the Minister of State also comment on what sites and buildings the OPW intends to purchase this year? Are any current leases being reviewed given the number of public and civil servants who are working from home? That should be the new normal. They should be supported to do that and the public service should lead by example. Are any expensive leases being reviewed in terms of cost-saving measures for the State?</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> In response to our Sinn Féin colleague's question about the comparatively high increase of 60% in the expenditure on the allocation to the Secret Service, it was stated that there is a convention in this House that this is passed on the nod. Clearly, that is a secret and we have to accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> On the Special EU Programmes Body, has any progress been made in respect of the Narrow Water bridge initiative involving north County Louth and south County Down?</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> There is a programme for Government commitment on transitioning the national minimum wage to a real living wage. A good place to start would be for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to take responsibility for ensuring that all public and civil servants receive the hourly rate of the minimum wage in terms of their salaries. There are several thousand who do not and I would like the Ministers of State to elaborate on plans that the Department may have to progress this initiative across the public service. The State must lead by example.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> One of the Ministers of State might outline the Department's commitments and those of the new group of Ministers in terms of the reform agenda, particularly around political reform. That agenda has been let slide since 2016, which is a concern. Government must happen transparently and accountably. There are things that we need to do that we are not doing. Some of the behaviour over recent days in terms of the reduction in the number of people who can be members of committees, issues in respect of speaking time and so on constitutes a flagrant abuse of this House and of our rights as Deputies. Those rights need to be protected. I want to hear from the Ministers of State regarding the political reform agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> There has been a long-running open sore in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the pension rights of community employment supervisors. There was a 2007 Labour Court recommendation and a forum was established by the former Minister, Deputy Howlin. That has essentially been ignored and bypassed by the Department over the last couple of years. Can the Ministers give any clarity on the provision of pensions and redundancy payments, if the need arises, for community employment supervisors in the future?</p>

          <p eId="para_511">Deputy Nash asked about any new financial controls or reforms that may have been put in place. He referred to the national children's hospital. He is absolutely right to ask that question. There was a gross overspend in respect of the national children's hospital. We have a substantial number of large capital projects planned, by which I mean those valued at more than €100 million, under the national development plan. I have no wish to see a second national children's hospital-style event take place. With that in mind, there was a report by PwC last year on what went wrong with the project. That report contained specific recommendations about reforms to be made. Included in those was that governance had to be improved, risk-sharing had to be improved and there had to be better analysis. Specifically, PwC also pointed out that the system whereby the contracting body was also the body that monitored projects was not good enough. Whoever commissions a huge project costing more than €100 million cannot also be responsible for monitoring whether that project is on track. There has to be some independent external review all the way through of the cost of these projects. That unit is the investment projects and programmes office, IPPO, which is within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It will be reviewing and providing ongoing control of costs on major capital projects.</p>

          <p eId="para_512">Just to make it clear, one of the Sinn Féin Deputies did not get in. There are only 20 minutes available. Deputy Pearse Doherty wanted a question-and-answer session. It was not my fault. The Minister only had a minute and a half to reply to all the questions. I cannot be criticised for how Deputies divide time among themselves.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_513">I have a number of questions about and comments on the Estimates. I join others in saying that it is disappointing that the senior Minister has not seen fit to turn up for this debate in order to account for spending within his Department. This session has been scheduled for some time. It is disrespectful to the House and to Opposition spokespersons that he is not present for the scheduled debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> I want to raise an issue that has come to the fore recently, namely, the role of the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the health budget oversight group. Questions have been asked of the Secretary General about spending for the purposes of testing and tracing but he was reluctant, and in fact refused, to answer questions on that matter. I find it quite difficult to understand why that was the case. Perhaps one of the Ministers of State could explain. There are questions about the overall budget for the testing and tracing regime. A figure of €206 million was sanctioned. To date, €47 million has been spent. There is an estimated total spend this year of €414 million. Given that we are into the seventh month of the year, maybe somebody could explain why there is such wide variation in those figures and why the Secretary General has not responded to questions on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> On the decision to appoint three super junior Ministers and the additional Estimate that is required to top up their salaries, can either of the Ministers of State provide a justification for that top-up? It is very hard to understand. There might be an argument in a three-party coalition for somebody from each party to attend Cabinet. What is the rationale or justification, though, for a top-up on what is already quite a generous salary?</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> The overall 2020 budget allocation was 22% less than last year's Estimate because of the establishment of the OGCIO.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">Excluding a fall due to the office being established, the Department's programme expenditure increased by €1.1 million. My question relates to the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer. This is a new Vote which has been established. It is worth €21.7 million, which accounts for the 28% reduction in the Department's main Vote. What is the exact purpose of this office? Why was it established as a separate office? Could it not have operated as a unit in the Department? Are there additional expenses associated with establishing it as an office? What are the main projects that it will concentrate on? </p>
          <p eId="para_518"> The public service innovation fund is another new subhead. It receives €1 million, double the allocation of last year. There is a good argument for such a fund. The Civil Service is often criticised for not being sufficiently innovative and we need to bring new thinking and new approaches across the Civil Service. Last year the fund was very highly oversubscribed, to the tune of 136 projects requesting nearly €7 million across the public service, and we see the same has happened again this year. Does the Minister of State accept that the figure is an underestimation of the level of funding needed if we are serious about innovation across the service? It strikes me as tokenism. Was there any attempt to measure the demand for such a budget? Does the Minister of State accept that we should put our money where our mouth is to a far greater extent to encourage that fresh thinking and innovation?</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> The construction innovation support is a new subhead to encourage innovation and increase productivity in the construction sector. There seems to be a good argument for that. We should encourage innovation across the sectors. The fund's purpose is to foster digital leadership and culture change, to create digital standards, encourage digital education and training and introduce digital procurement. Why was only the construction sector selected for this? What was the basis for this decision?</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> I will stop there and ask if the Ministers of State can answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_521">I will try to answer as quickly as I can. Some of them are no longer within my brief, although they were until the transition.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> The construction innovation fund is a concept that was developed during my time in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform around the area of building information modelling technology so that we could use best practice in the private sector to ensure that when the State goes out to the market or develops concepts internally, we can use the best available technology like building information modelling. That goes on to the next point on the innovation services and fund in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I drove this concept initially because I believe that across the Civil Service, we have a range of talents that might not necessarily be exploited, and to allow people from outside agencies and the outside world with skills that are not exploited to use those skills. The Deputy is correct that the fund was oversubscribed in the first year. It is being doubled. The first thing was to get the centre up and running and give it teeth. People were seconded from agencies or organisations, including the Defence Forces. It is innovative in that it brings people from all over, seconding them and allowing them to go back to use their energies and experience. Often Governments are criticised - I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts - rightly or wrongly for the overuse of consultants. As a former Minister of State with responsibility for the area now covered by Deputy Ossian Smyth, I believed that this was a way to make progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> The Deputy mentioned the Secretary General's role in relation to the Health Vote. I do not know the detail but I will bring this back and ask that the Deputy get a response on the €414 million. That topic might be specific to the Health Vote which the Minister for Health might take.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> The additional Ministers of State at Cabinet will be debated in the Seanad today. Before the Government was formed, there was much concern about the possibility of Departments being reconfigured and different areas of society requiring different people to have higher levels of responsibility. The Government is responding to demands where the 15 Minsters sitting at Cabinet allowed for by Bunreacht na hÉireann may no longer be fit for purpose given the range of demands across Government. I am sure this will be debated in the Seanad over the next few days.</p>

          <p eId="para_528">That is really not good enough. I will tell the Minister of State who deserves pay rises for their level of responsibility. It is the nurses and the health workers who fought on the front line to protect our health, and the many workers in retail and other essential front-line services, often very low-paid workers, who worked throughout the pandemic. They deserve an increase. The people who do not deserve pay increases are politicians and Ministers. It is shocking and disgusting that Ministers of State on €124,000, about three times the average industrial wage, and about three times what the average nurse would get, are now to get an additional €16,000: Jack Chambers, Hildegarde Naughton and Pippa Hackett. It is extraordinary. Is €124,000 not enough for these people that they have to get an additional €16,000 and this is to be done at the very same time that the Government is planning to cut the pandemic unemployment payment from €350 to €300, and for others down to €250 or €200. Workers who have lost their jobs and incomes through no fault of their own as a result of a pandemic and Government-imposed necessary public health guidelines are to see their incomes slashed where it may be very difficult or impossible for them to return to work, but Ministers of State on €120,000 will receive an additional €16,000. Seriously, it is shocking. Does the Minister of State really think that is the right signal to send out? Does he really think that is just in the current climate when hundreds of thousands of workers in this country face serious hardship and uncertainty or are simply unable to go back to work because of the situation we are in? Will the Minister of State give us a better explanation or justification for that?</p>

          <p eId="para_530">As I already told Deputy Shortall, the rationale for increasing the number sitting at Cabinet was laid out by the three party leaders when the Government was formed. There are increasing demands on all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">There was a suggestion of Departments being abolished or being merged in advance of the programme for Government, which some interest groups, lobbies and Deputies opposed. There were suggestions before the Government was formed that new Departments were needed. The Government is bound by the Constitution of 1937 to limit the number of people with seals of office sitting at the Cabinet table to 15. After that, decisions have to be made as to how the various different interests and demands, be they societal, economic or otherwise, are to be represented at Cabinet. The decision was taken and was published in the programme for Government. It is on the back page of it. It was not something that was concealed or dreamed up. It was designed to ensure that specific areas were covered. For instance, the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, to whom the Deputy referred, will have overall responsibility for aviation and other elements of the transport sector, an area I know from being a Minister of State in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in the previous Dáil. Myself and the Deputy have clashed on a number of occasions. That sector, along with other sectors, has grown massively since the 1937 Constitution was written. The real issue here is that the 1937 Constitution is no longer fit for the purpose of dividing out responsibilities within Government to people who need to represent particular sectors. Everybody will accept that if someone is sitting at the Cabinet table and he or she takes on responsibilities to this House and the other House, then he or she should be treated the same as other Ministers sitting at the Cabinet table. They need to be accountable to the House, and this accountability will continue in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> The Deputy is absolutely right on the point he made about other workers. That is why we are committed, and I said it here last night, to the 2% increase for public servants which will have a significant impact on the finances of the State. We are also committed - the Minister, Deputy McGrath, has made this very clear - to opening up discussions as soon as possible with representatives of employees within the civil and public services and employers to ensure that in the context of Covid-19, which we have all learned a great deal from, a new way to address pay over the next number of years will have to reflect the points that have been raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett, which are no different from the points I raised. Nobody has a monopoly of concern on low pay. We all have family members who might be regarded by some as being low paid. This Government has started on an agenda, which will be seen later on, to stimulate the economy, to put more people back to work, to keep people at work and to spend a significant amount of money which will be voted through from this Department. Some of this may require legislation but it is designed to support the people the Deputy mentioned today and whom he routinely mentions, and in respect of whom I support him. We have to do it in a way that is reflective of the current climate, which we will do. We would welcome the Deputy's support.</p>

          <p eId="para_533">I will support the Minister of State if he gives our nurses and front-line healthcare workers the pay rise they deserve and gets rid of the absolutely shameful pay inequalities suffered by public servants at every level in the public service, where new entrants have to suffer the indignity of working on lower pay than people doing exactly the same job, just because they came in after a certain arbitrary date when austerity was imposed on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> Whatever way the Minister of State cuts it, in the current climate where the Government is talking about cutting the pandemic payments for people who have lost jobs and income as a result of a public health crisis over which they have no control, and then to give junior Ministers a €16,000 increase is, to put it mildly, sending the wrong signals. To put it not so mildly, it is absolutely disgraceful. If the Minister of State wants equality at the Cabinet table perhaps the senior Cabinet Ministers might cut their pay a little to show leadership for people who are suffering out there and are on fractions of the salaries and wages they are on.</p>

          <p eId="para_535">In response to the Deputy's earlier contribution, I meant to acknowledge the support he has given to the temporary wage subsidy scheme and to the pandemic unemployment payment. We are in the situation with this Estimate where four fifths of our spending has already been reached. We need to ensure that this Estimate is passed for the very people the Deputy talks about, namely, nurses and public servants who are on different levels of pay, and to ensure we can pay salaries and pensions next week or shortly after that. If we go over that four fifths limit the Government will not have the power to do that. The Government responded initially, and I thank the Deputy for his support, by way of some €16 billion to shore up this economy and to ensure it did not go down the tubes like it did in 2008. We will continuing on that road today.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> It is also important to point out that in respect of the two schemes the Deputy referenced, 50,000 people came off them at the last count and 35,000 people off them at the count before. We are getting people back to work, which needs to be acknowledged.</p>

          <p eId="para_538">Last year the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform allocated €1.6 billion to agriculture, food and marine. A significant amount of that allocation was aimed at delivering the high level goal of income and market supports to underpin the rural economy and environment. That particular amount was €874.1 million. What was surprising to me, however, was the fact that a further €356.7 million was spent on agricultural policy and strategy. I fully accept that we need to have good and robust policies in place but does this not seem like a disproportionate amount, especially in light of the overall spend on actual financial supports being delivered to farmers and the rural economy? This is something I have concerns about, especially in the context of the public service performance report. Last year’s report highlighted the pilot programme of equality budgeting within a number of Departments. This process is supposed to track the progression of policies that aim to advance equality, reduce poverty and strengthen the economic and social rights of citizens. How is the equality budgeting concept being implemented with reference to agriculture and the rural economy? Is it reducing poverty and strengthening the rural economies? We need to know the answer to that given the level of expenditure being directed to that Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_543"> The money for the supervisors is a very important issue because these people have played an integral role in our society and have done so much for small towns and villages and have been treated very badly. I want to know for a fact if these people are going to have their pension rights and entitlements taken care of or not.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> When we are talking about prudence, managing finances and budgets, we have to be sure, and I have said this here already today, about what we are doing with money because people are very concerned and worried about this. I welcome the July stimulus in advance but I want it to be spent prudently. The Minister of State has common sense and will understand what I am trying to say here. If one goes back - I am not talking about this Government or the last one but about previous Governments - to the issue of housing, what we are all doing is issuing policy after policy and document after document on how we are going to address this housing crisis or how we are going to address the poor prices farmers will receive for their beef. We are getting bogged down continuously in what I call money evaporating schemes in order to dream up a solution for the problem. For instance, when we are talking about beef, it is the easiest thing in the world to solve because all we need to do is to ensure the factories give the beef producers a proper price for the beef at the end of the day. We need not have conferences to discuss it.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> When we need to know how to provide housing for homeless people and people on our housing list, let us go back to what the politicians before us did, and in my case Jackie Healy-Rae who was a Member of the Dáil and Kerry County Council. What was their ambition? What did the Acting Chairman do when he was a member of Tipperary County Council? They fought to ensure fields were bought, machines were sent in, planning permission was got, and houses were built. Those houses were local authority houses forever. That is how problems are tackled.</p>

          <p eId="para_547">Restaurants, pubs and hotels are calling for the continuation of the temporary wage subsidy scheme to be able to keep staff employed over the autumn and winter lean period. I am sure it is more important to have people working than unemployed. They are also calling for a reduction of VAT to a minimum of 9% and refer to Northern Ireland, where it is at 5%. Will the Government, from today, continue to pay the trainee nurses? All other apprentices in this State are paid while they train. Our front-line staff and nurses need to be paid properly while they train. They looked after us through the pandemic and now it is time that we stood up and paid them for the training they are doing to look after us in future.</p>

          <p eId="para_548">I am glad to get this opportunity. There was a big announcement yesterday by the EPA about septic tanks. I believe it is targeting people who want to build single, one-off houses in the country, and to stop them from doing that. I want to talk about Kilcummin. This village has been promised a sewerage scheme since 2004. It was to start in 2008. Money was announced here in 2013 by a Labour Deputy and the job was supposed to be done last year. It was cancelled last year. I ask the Minister of State to make sure it is on a programme this year and no later than next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> I want to ask about funding for group water schemes. Kerry County Council is practically at a standstill, pushing the can down the road. One can make an application but it will go nowhere. Several groups of people such as those in Lyreacrompane, Gneeveguilla, Rathmore or other parts of Kilcummin are waiting to get approval for a group water scheme. The basic right of any householder or community is water, and many of them do not have a safe water supply at present. We have had a rates waiver scheme for many years. Where people could not pay, it was either waived or reduced. Much is happening now and I ask the Minister of State to ensure the Government compensates the local authorities, including our local authority in Kerry, because if he does not, many other services will be denied to people who are entitled to the services. I can see a problem there if the Government does not adjust and ensure it gets the funding to compensate the local authorities for the lost rates revenue they cannot get. Look at the rural publicans; they cannot even open. I ask the Minister of State to look at that.</p>

          <p eId="para_550">I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, on his appointment. He is a mid-west Minister of State so we hope he will deliver plenty in Clare and his home county, Limerick. I wish him the best as he gets under way with his new portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> There are a number of things I wish to bring to his attention in the realm of public expenditure. The first is a sewerage scheme in Meelick which is supposed to be completed in quarter 4 of 2021. As I am speaking, there are technicians from Irish Water applying older suppressants to the sewage treatment plant. Calling it a "treatment plant" is a stretch of the imagination. It is actually an open tank, 7 ft or 8 ft deep, with a fence around it. Occasionally, children have hopped over it to retrieve footballs and have gone in. It is probably the most dangerous sewage treatment plant I can think of in the country. There is a plan to replace it and to link it up to the Limerick mains drainage. A 300 m pipeline will bring it from Ballycannon Heights to the nearby estate of Elton Court and on into Limerick city. It is simple and the design is agreed but it needs funding. Irish Water has it tentatively in its calendar but in light of everything going on there today and of the ongoing public health risk it poses, there is a need to move that forward. It is a real cause of nausea. It is headache-inducing. People cannot even hang out their clothes there, so it needs to be advanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> I know the Minister of State has been good at calling out to the Shannon Group meetings at Bunratty and the Shannon Heritage sites. A number of long-term solutions for Shannon Heritage sites have been looked at, including divesting them to Clare and Limerick authorities and to the Office of Public Works. I have spoken with a number of workers on the ground. There is a closure looming for Shannon Heritage long after the end of August. Long after we have dealt with that, we need to look at a different management model for the sites. I think the OPW, which is the Minister of State's responsibility, would be ideal for that. If we go with the local authority model, we would end up splitting the Shannon Heritage sites across their constituent counties. There is King John's Castle in Limerick, Bunratty, Knappogue and Craggaunowen in Clare. The OPW offers a perfect fit. More immediately, we have a need for the Government to step in and help to keep these sites open beyond 31 August. It is of strategic importance that they remain open. There are 350 staff, with 145 employed year-round.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> The next issue I wish to raise is flood defences in Clonlara. It has been called a 100 year flood phenomenon, yet there were serious floods there in 1995, 2009, 2015, 2018 and in February 2020. The week after the election, there was 4 ft of water in the Clonlara area, spilling into and destroying houses. It cannot be called a 100 year flood any more. It happens almost annually or biennially. In 2009, there was an elderly lady who has since passed away, Lord have mercy on her, Laura Mason, who at 80 years of age had to be lifted out of her house in the front-loader bucket of a tractor, and brought out to safety in a trailer and a boat. There is a plan for this scheme but it has been held up over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> There is a man, Peter Sweetman, who fronts The Swans and the Snails Ltd. He is an environmental objector. He lives in Rathmines, which is more than 200 km from Clonlara. He is a serial objector. He has objected to and held up flood defences in Clonlara, coastal defences in Doonbeg and a bridge crossing in Killaloe. In future, the Government needs to look at having pre-qualifiers for those who can object to projects. I would not dream, in a month of Sundays, of objecting to a project in the middle of Dublin or in Cork city. There is a place for environmental groups, An Taisce and for lobbyists to come in and look at the environmental implications of projects, but I believe it is vexatious for someone in Rathmines to hold up key projects that are required in the mid-west and elsewhere in the country. There is planning going on in Clonlara and I have every faith in the Minister of State, as a Minister of State in the mid-west, that he will allow for safe passage so that we can actually see that happen. We cannot go through another winter in that area without those key flood defences.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> The final issue I wish to raise relates to the Inagh river in north Clare. I visited it recently on the invitation of Ger McDonagh. Ger and about 50 other landowners are flooded several times a year. Most of their landholdings are along the main road from Ennis to Ennistymon and fall from there to the Inagh river. It is prone to flooding. Unfortunately this is one of the old drainage districts that falls outside the remit of the OPW. Clare County Council gets an annual sum of approximately €20,000 to deal with the drainage districts throughout the county. It is an inoperable, unrealistic sum, yet these lands flood and are totally unviable. I saw cattle out there last week. One would want to see it in the winter. Their winter is much longer than it is for other people in the area due to the geography of their land. Will the OPW facilitate or give strong consideration to a minor works scheme application in this area?</p>

        <speech by="#JoeFlaherty" eId="spk_226">
          <from>Deputy Joe Flaherty<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_556">I commend both Ministers of State on an excellent insight into the Estimates. It is good to have an opportunity to speak to them here today. Later this afternoon we will see the launch of the July stimulus, which is all about securing jobs, securing the viability of businesses and attempting to address regional imbalance across Ireland. Political commentators and economists are telling us that the way to deal with the crisis we face is to borrow money and subsequently to spend that money on capital projects. It has never been as cheap or as opportune to borrow money, with sovereign finance now available at nominal rates just above 0%. In reality, we have a blueprint for getting the country back on its feet that is Project Ireland 2040. It is further copperfastened by the current programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> On the back of Covid-19 we have the opportunity, and possibly our best chance ever, to truly address rural imbalance and especially some of the regional and structural deficiencies that haunt counties such as Longford. In Longford we have waited ten years for the N4 upgrade. It is one of the final pieces of major road infrastructure that needs to be completed. It is probable that every industrialist or investor who has travelled on that short section of road will say that it is one of the single biggest impediments to foreign direct investment in Longford and the wider region. Covid-19 has challenged us on an awful lot of levels. It has challenged us to look at how we live and how we function. It has also challenged us as a Government to do better and to ensure proper regional growth and development will, in time, take the strain off our big cities and urban centres. The N4 is the big ticket item for County Longford at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> We also note that our second and third largest towns in the county, Edgeworthstown and Ballymahon, are both effectively at a standstill with further development because both require new sewage treatment plant upgrades. The challenge for Longford as a county, and for many other similar-sized counties, is to try to kick-start commercial house building activity within the county once again. We have not had a three-bedroom semi-detached house built in Longford in more than 11 years. This is the standard-bearer in commercial house building. There is a difficulty for any developer who wants to build a scheme in Ballymahon or Edgeworthstown now because Irish Water would inflict heavy and punitive charges onto that developer in an attempt to finance the upgrade of those sewage treatment plants. Both of those projects need to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> Staying in Ballymahon, it is more than two and a half years since the county council submitted a request for a new fire station in the town. Since then Center Parcs has opened in Ballymahon, which is the largest new tourism project in Europe, let alone in Ireland. When it is fully operational, the park attracts 2,000 visitors to the town each week. It is simply unbelievable to think that the town does not have a modern and up-to-date fire station at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> Moving on to Longford town and out towards the Dublin Road and still within the 40 mph speed limit, houses there were built more than 30 years ago that have still not been able to connect to the main sewers. These houses have extremely deficient and archaic septic tanks. Within the town confines, two of our oldest and proudest estates, Teffia Park and Annaly Park, have sewerage systems that are creaking. Going across to south Longford and to Lanesborough, there is an issue with the rising main leading to the reservoir that serves up to 4,000 houses in the south Longford area and into Longford town. At one point this was at the top of the list for an upgrade, but suddenly Irish Water appointed a new contractor, and because the work would have required cutting through limestone and the contractor only likes to work with clay-based projects, it has fallen down the pecking order.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> How we respond to Covid-19 and the challenges it presents will define us as a nation. We have an opportunity as elected Members in this House to make the right decision on so many levels: the right decision for rural Ireland and, more importantly the right decision for future generations.</p>

          <p eId="para_564">Much of what Deputy Flaherty referred to is covered in the national development plan under a number of different agencies, including Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Irish Water and the councils.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> With regard to Deputy Crowe's comments, I do not have responsibility for water in the sewerage system. This is under the remit of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. I have attended the meetings organised by Deputy Carey and I also referred to Deputy Quinlivan in the Sinn Féin group.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> I am well aware of the issue around Shannon Group and I know what is being tried and attended to. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Naughton, will have a role in this because she is the line Minister with responsibility for aviation and the Shannon Group.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> I remember the Clonlara incident when a lady had to be lifted out of her house. As Deputy Crowe has rightly said, Clare County Council has submitted an application to An Bord Pleanála. I am glad the Deputy referred to objections. The Acting Chairman will also be aware of this. As a Government we are going to have to do something about what defines an objection. I am veering off-script now but we have to try to make sure that objections to large infrastructural projects, which are there to protect property and protect people's lives, are not vexatious objections. Often many objections are submitted, especially on flooding issues, and every rural Deputy will be aware that sometimes those objections do not even come from the area where the flood relief scheme is to be built. It is a source of massive frustration for local authorities. The OPW normally gets the blame then. We get the blame for people lodging objections, which has nothing at all to do with us. If schemes are outside the Arterial Drainage Act, then Clare County Council can apply, and naturally consideration is given to all applications. The better the application, the more likely it is to be funded.</p>

          <p eId="para_568">I congratulate the Ministers of State, Deputies O'Donovan and Smyth, on their appointments. I wish them well in their new roles.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> I support the Estimate as presented. I have a number of issues I want to raise, predominantly around the OPW and the work it does. There are many unresolved issues in County Clare. The flooding at Clonlara and in Springfield is an issue that has raised its head far too frequently over the past two decades. There was flooding in Springfield in 1995, 2002, 2009, 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2020. While floodwaters have disappeared since the spring of this year and the residents who were evacuated have returned to their homes, it is important that when this scheme secures the necessary planning approval from An Bord Pleanála, it proceeds with pace. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, can give me an assurance that he will support this very important scheme when it comes before him. I also join the Minister of State in his comments on serial objectors. This scheme has been held up as a result of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> Another important issue is the Shannon town and environs flood relief scheme. The scheme was launched last year. It is a three-element scheme that will protect Shannon town and provide the necessary flood defences to protect families, individuals, communities, companies and the driver of economic activity in the mid-west and west, Shannon Airport. It is important that this project is enabled to progress through all the different phases in a timely manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> There are many other issues such as the Kilkee flood relief scheme, the Spanish Point minor works scheme, and the White Strand at Miltown Malbay scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> I turn now to the continual flooding of the Limerick-Ennis railway line. As Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development, I brought all the stakeholders together. Up to that point it had been a case of pass the parcel.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">All the agencies, Clare County Council, the Office of Public Works, OPW, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Irish Rail came together to produce a report. Will the Minister of State resurrect that work to bring about a solution? It is a much used piece of infrastructure and has been flooded over the past decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> The minor works scheme is an essential tool. Will the Minister of State consider enhancing this particular scheme? Much of what is not facilitated through the Arterial Drainage Act can be facilitated through the scheme. Will the Minister of State consider expanding the scheme's role?</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> The Minister of State has attended meetings with me, as have other Oireachtas Members from the mid-west region, about the Shannon Heritage sites. The State-owned assets of Bunratty Castle and Folk Park, King John's Castle, Craggaunowen Castle, Knappogue Castle and Dunguaire Castle are magnets for drawing tourists into the area and drivers of tourism traffic to smaller attractions across County Clare and the mid-west region. The Shannon Group intends to close these sites on 31 August, however. Such a move would lead to the loss of jobs on the sites themselves and would have a detrimental impact on County Clare. Bunratty Village indirectly employs 600 people in the hospitality and services sector. Their trade is intrinsically linked to visitors coming to the Bunratty site. Its closure will have a detrimental impact on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> There is a need for an interim arrangement to be put in place and a cash injection to keep these sites going on a year-round basis. A new home for Shannon Heritage is also needed. Perhaps the OPW, Clare County Council or Limerick County Council could step in to provide a lifeline to these particular sites. This is critically important. What are the views of the Minister of State on this?</p>

          <p eId="para_577">I also want to extend my best wishes to the Ministers of State, Deputies O'Donovan and Ossian Smyth. I wish them every success in their new roles and portfolios. I look forward to working with them both in the period ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> One particular project of vital importance in the Mayo constituency is ensuring that the Crossmolina flood relief scheme goes to tender as quickly as possible. As we are discussing the Revised Estimates for the Office of Public Works today, I welcome the funding that has been allocated to the Crossmolina flood relief scheme. This is an area which has seen repeated flooding of a severe nature, adversely impacting local residents and business owners who are living in fear of further flooding potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> The Minister of State's predecessor, along with other Oireachtas Members, councillors and me, met with the Crossmolina community to get an update on progress of the project plans last October. While funding has been allocated and secured for this €10 million project to succeed, it has been delayed for various technical reasons. I want to ensure no further delays occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> I note a new fire station went to tender in May, which will be a welcome addition to tackling flooding in the winter months once it is completed. However, local residents are living in fear of gloomy skies, fearful of the devastating impact further flooding will cause to their livelihoods and community. I am aware that both the OPW and Mayo County Council, working in collaboration with the local flood action group, have been proactive in implementing interim flood protection measures in Crossmolina pending the construction of permanent flood defences. It is now time, however, to ensure there are no further delays in proceeding with the erection of permanent defences. Significant time has been given to ensuring the scheme adheres to both Irish and European environmental legislation for which significant effort has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> I truly empathise with the local community when rising waters devastate their homes and businesses. Crossmolina is one community which quite simply cannot afford to wait any longer for its flood defences. Accordingly, I am hoping the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, will be able to provide an update on the timeline for when the project will proceed.</p>

          <p eId="para_582">On Cloonlara and the area around Springfield in particular, Clare County Council applied under Part 10 for planning permission on 20 July. I lend my support to the council's application for that scheme. The OPW is committed to it. I am a neighbour down the road in County Limerick. We in the mid-west know the connection between Cloonlara and Limerick. We have sympathy for the people in this area because there is much history with the Shannon scheme. What happened over several occasions was terrible.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> The current costs for the Shannon flood scheme are estimated at €20 million. It is the airport that is applying for permission. Consultants have been appointed for the design of the scheme. Again, it is not just of a local but national infrastructural importance, considering the importance of the airport and protecting it. The OPW is supportive of what the Shannon Group is trying to do in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> I am aware of the issues around the rail line because many people use it for commuting. It is the main rail line from Ennis to Dublin and Limerick to Galway. The Government is committed in the programme for Government to increase rail usage and to get more people using public transport. There is a problem with this line north of Limerick when there is heavy rain and it floods. The OPW is part of a group which is working with the stakeholders in ensuring an alleviation can be got there. I will revert to Deputy Carey on the latest update.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> I thank Deputy Carey for his initiative to bring all Oireachtas Members from the mid-west together on Shannon Airport. It involves not just the airport but also the properties and the Shannon Heritage group. I responded earlier on this. The OPW is prepared to assist in terms of advice and co-operation, particularly around the area of protecting national monuments. The councils have an important role as does the Shannon Group. Aviation is the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton. Her role will be formalised tomorrow. I am sure this will be one of the issues she will be anxious to progress as she is also a local Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> Deputy Dillon has raised the issue of the Crossmolina flood relief scheme in the House on several occasions. It is a €13.5 million scheme but it has run into several difficulties, primarily due to the karst landscape, with many underground drainage issues. It is not the easiest of flood relief schemes to design. An OPW team is finalising the environmental impact statement. Hopefully, we should be in a position to go for approval for the next stage in the third quarter of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> I thank the Deputies for raising these issues. These are important issues for the people of Crossmolina, Cloonlara and Shannon.</p>

Some of our old embankments are incapable of carrying walkways, but some of the newer ones that we are rolling out present an opportunity for them to do more than just hold back water. I have asked the commissioners to begin a process that will involve other stakeholders, including councils, landowners, Sport Ireland and the Department with responsibility for sport under the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Catherine Martin. Obviously, we will be seeking co-financing. This is a long-term project whose details I hope to be able to bring to the House over time. I hope to see our flood defences being used for more than just flood defences. We could then change the narrative around them. I am a cyclist. As Deputy Carey mentioned, many of these flood embankments are in urban areas, but some are in quite isolated rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> This will be a process, however, and we will have to bring people with us. Naturally, we would appreciate any support that local Deputies, including those in Clare, could give us as part of the planning process.</p>

          <p eId="para_593">As has been stated a number of times, the figures involved in these Revised Estimates are large and denote the scale of the challenge we face in the coming months and years. Coupled with this is the considerable level of uncertainty with regard to the future of our economy, education system, health system and communities as the pandemic continues to play a major part in our decision-making. This will likely continue in the months ahead until a vaccine for the Covid-19 virus is made fully available. It is only right that the focus of the Government when agreeing spending and supports should be on providing a safety net to those grappling with difficulties during these times. It is in this context of challenge and uncertainty that we should seek to bring a rigour to our methodology in public spending. This is where developing our processes in respect of a just transition and the use of our future budgets, particularly available stimulus funds, will be important and keenly felt.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> In March 2020, the National Economic and Social Council issued a report that considered the most effective and people-centred way of implementing a just transition. It recognised that governments around the world were trying to identify with the greatest possible certainty which sectors of their economies were most at risk of disruption from transitions over the coming decades. The pandemic is a microcosm of that work. The report notes that complex transitions were not occurring in isolation from other global trends and potential transformations, such as urbanisation, population growth and globalisation as well as the move towards a circular economy and increased protection of biodiversity, habitats and ecosystems. It also noted that societies and economies were becoming increasingly service oriented and urbanised. For Ireland, this will present a significant challenge. In the programme for Government, we committed to a just transition. As we end fossil fuel dependence and digital disruption and automation become more prevalent, we need to ensure that no one is left behind. This means creating economic opportunity through climate justice policymaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> In considering the broad scope of these Estimates and some of the newly created subheads, and in light of the newly announced EU stimulus package, I was disappointed to see that the allocation for the just transition fund will be €17.5 billion, less than half of what was previously proposed. This is one of the supports that we will rely on to move towards a fairer and more environmentally responsible economy. The changes to the fund do not match the scale of the challenge that the EU and, specifically, Ireland face in the economic impact of Covid-19 or the unfolding climate emergency. In gutting the just transition fund, a small number of countries have decided that electoral politics back home matter more than EU solidarity. Poorer countries will pay the price for populist politics in wealthier nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> Though itself one of the wealthier nations, this is particularly relevant for Ireland, given that there is considerable uncertainty around upcoming issues like the CAP reforms for farmers. We are asking farmers to play a big role in reducing carbon emissions, improving biodiversity and ensuring food security, but many of their farms are not big enterprises, meaning it is not clear how they will do this with much less support.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> With these gaps in funding for a just transition and farmers, how will these activities now be funded? The need for such funding has not gone away. More than ever, it is important that we use the funding we are getting from the EU, including Brexit funding where appropriate, and our own borrowing to invest in public services and projects that will support these aims. As we vote through these Estimates and continue the discussions in respect of further supports, it is imperative that we get this right and instil a just transition in any and all legislative work. Will the Minister of State outline how, as Estimates continue to increase, we can stitch just transition decision making into our legislative work?</p>

          <p eId="para_598">I thank the Deputy. Instead of specific numbers that I would ordinarily be asked to respond on, she is asking more of a policy question in the particular context of what is happening at the moment. I do not disagree with what she has said. In recent years, we have seen different types of displacement in our economy, including in terms of what the future of jobs will look like. For example, there has been a climate change displacement in recent years, with the Government, society and communities realising that things will have to be done differently. We have seen displacement in terms of Brexit, where our country was jolted into considering how to manage our connectivity to and place within the centre of the EU. I mean connectivity in basic terms, for example, in the context of infrastructure. This does not even take into consideration the wider issue of how to connect ourselves to the EU while working with the UK, which will become a third country. There has also been digital displacement. As part of the national development plan under the previous Government, the then Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, launched a specific fund in that regard to assist businesses, communities and individuals where there was going to be displacement. Over the past number of years, certain types of job have disappeared and will never return.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> A just transition needs to happen in the midlands. Other communities will face challenges. For instance, the agriculture sector is facing challenges, which is spelled out in the programme for Government. The farming organisations, in conjunction with farmers, have taken to the concept of accepting change. Through various initiatives established by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Teagasc and others in recent years, farmers have changed. Deputy Hourigan is right, in that we are trying to provide a food island not only for ourselves, but for the wider EU and beyond in the most responsible way. We are transitioning in that regard and must bring people with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> To give the House the short version, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a role in this matter. The largest part of that role will be the bilateral meetings that will run between now and the end of September between the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and individual Ministers and Ministers of State. Regard will have to be had of those elements that are spelled out in the programme for Government. The Government has already shown that it is adept at and up to doing so, but there will be a process of change.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> Covid has been another major shock to us, but whether the displacement is in the just transition, farming practices, digital disruption, changed work practices or gender equality - Deputy Nolan raised that issue and I am sorry that I did not get a chance to respond to her, but I hope to revert to her in writing - our Department plays a central role in leading that. Every penny that passes through the State's coffers must come through us. We are almost like a clearing house. Consequently, the policies adopted by every Department must come through us. We are not just accountants or financial types who only have regard for pounds, shillings and pence. We also have regard for the programme for Government and the legislative programme that the Government has laid out. The Department oversees that. We will work with Deputy Hourigan, Deputy Nolan and every other Deputy who has raised important issues to ensure that those matters are addressed over the coming years.</p>

          <p eId="para_603">Before I move the Order for Second Stage, with the permission of the Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, I would like to give an update on where we are in terms of Covid. There is some good news. On the one hand, the number of cases per week has been rising, which is something we have all been watching. In the past four weeks, the number of cases went from 61 cases in a week to 93 cases, to 124 cases and last week we hit 143 cases. At the same time, the average number of close contacts is still high at more than five. However, I was informed today after the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, meeting that the view is that, in the past ten days, things have stabilised, which is very welcome. The number of tests done in the past seven days is 51,000 and we have a very low positivity rate of 0.3, which suggests that the prevalence of the virus in the population is low. The five-day average of new cases is 18 per day and the reproduction number has fallen and is now somewhere between 1 and 1.4. That is some positive news that I know the House will be interested in.</p>

          <p eId="para_605">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> It is my pleasure to introduce the Health (General Practitioner Service and Alteration of Criteria for Eligibility) Bill 2020 to the Dáil. Today marks another important step in working towards achieving the Sláintecare principle of universal access to care at low cost or no cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> This Bill provides for two key measures that are central to achieving universal access to healthcare in a manner that is fair and affordable: a welcome increase to the gross income limits for medical card eligibility for persons aged 70 or older and the phased expansion of general practitioner care without charges to all children aged 12 years of age and under. We are all aware of the barriers that exist in the health system that prevent people from accessing the right care at the right time in the right place. The measures being debated here today will enable us to progress towards the achievement of the core message of Sláintecare, which I know is supported by all parties in this House. These measures will provide a significant benefit to cohorts at different ends of the life spectrum but who each have their own identifiable health needs. A range of measures have already been implemented to expand access to persons in receipt of medical cards and GP visit cards, which has resulted in almost 43% of the population having access to GP care without fees at this time. However, while these initiatives are welcome, this Government recognises the need to do more. That is why we have committed in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future to implement new measures to expand access to GP care without fees and to wider health services. As Minister for Health I am delighted, therefore, to be bringing forward this legislation for debate today and affording it the priority that it deserves.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> The first key measure provided for in this Bill is a welcome increase to the gross income limits for medical card eligibility for persons aged 70 or older. Expanding eligibility for medical cards to this cohort is an important initiative in ensuring better health and active ageing for older persons. As we seek to support older persons to live independently in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, we must put in place policies that enable them to access high-quality care close to their home, where feasible, to prevent unnecessary admission to hospital. This very measure is a key enabler to achieving this as it will increase the number of people who can access a wide range of services in the community at no cost or at very low cost. Health and healthy ageing are undoubtedly key determinants in the quality of life experienced by older persons. The Health in Ireland - Key Trends 2019 report identified that life expectancy in Ireland has increased by almost 2.5 years since 2007. It also highlights that each year the number of people aged 65 or over is increasing by about 20,000, a trend that is likely to continue. This is a positive and welcome development and reflects the decreasing mortality rates for major diseases. However, these factors also remind us that there are resultant implications for individuals living longer and for how we plan our health system to meet the needs of the inevitable increase in demand for health services. It is important that we put in place now the policies that will enable this older cohort to live well.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> We know that the prevalence of frailty and chronic disease increases as people age. Therefore, having affordable access to a range of health services is key to both preventing and managing the impact of frailty and chronic illness. This is why this measure being debated here today is so important, especially when one considers that a significant number of people may benefit from its implementation. For many older persons, an immediate benefit of qualifying for a medical card is that they will be able to have affordable access to medicines. For example, we know that while persons aged 70 or over only account for 23% of all medical card holders, they account for over half of the spend on medications dispensed under the medical card scheme. Thus, expanding access to the medical card will ensure that a greater proportion of older persons will have affordable access to medicines, which is essential in managing chronic disease and enabling people to have better health and to live well.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> Living well and healthy ageing not only benefit the individual, they are also important for society generally. Older persons are the fabric of our community. They undertake many important roles and their contribution is vital. This was borne out in a recent Trinity College Dublin study which utilised data from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, TILDA. That study identified that almost one-third of people over 70 are caregivers and that many are caring for their spouses. Additionally, it found that older people participate both economically and by volunteering in the community and they undertake caring responsibilities for relatives and grandchildren that enable others to participate in the workforce. This demonstrates the need to ensure that policy measures are implemented so that older people are supported in achieving healthy ageing so that they can contribute and continue to play an active part in their families and wider communities. The implementation of this measure will support this by giving access to health services at a time when their health needs are greater and undoubtedly more complex.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> It is also important to highlight the sacrifices made by older persons in our society in response to Covid-19. I know that social distancing and cocooning - an awful word - were and remain very challenging for many older persons and have resulted in a rise in levels of loneliness and social isolation which have impacted on many people's well-being. Many people who have lived through this have shown incredible spirit and commitment. I acknowledge that today. It has not been an easy time for an awful lot of people. It is still not an easy time for an awful lot of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> I turn now to the second key measure for which this Bill provides: the phased expansion of free GP care to primary school children. Deputies will be aware that the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future also includes a commitment to expanding to more children access to GP care without charges. It is an important deliverable in terms of Sláintecare and its implementation strategy, which commits to expanding eligibility for access to healthcare on a phased basis. Already since 2015 all children under six are automatically eligible for free GP care. Today's Bill provides a legislative framework to continue this path of universal expansion. It is a significant milestone and I am proud to be welcoming this beneficial public health measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> There are many good reasons to provide universal access to GP care to children. Studies have shown that the identification of health issues at a younger age can mitigate or reduce the impact of ill health later in life and that the health and well-being of children is linked to the economic and social environment in which children are brought up. The measures being debated here today will, therefore, ensure that irrespective of the social and economic background of children, each child up to the age of 12 will have access to GP services without charge. We know that the cost of GP visits acts as a barrier to accessing care. The Growing Up in Ireland study, for example, showed that those who face out-of-pocket expenses to access GP care make significantly fewer GP visits and that children from high-income families are more likely to visit their GP. Therefore, there is a clear rationale for children having access to medical care in their own right, regardless of their parents' economic circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">Providing this access will also bring great peace of mind to many parents who, perhaps, would previously have avoided attending a GP clinic due to unaffordability. Removing cost as a barrier will not only enable better utilisation of GP services but will also play a critical role in helping to address important health issues for children such as childhood obesity. As the vast majority of health needs of children can be met in the primary care sector, the GP is well placed to address early health issues arising, which helps to mitigate their impact in later life. It is estimated that the phased expansion of GP care without charges to children between six and 12 years of age will benefit approximately an additional 300,000 children.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> Such positive large-scale reform of GP expansion will have inevitable costs attached with its implementation. These will depend on several factors, including the timing of the phases, the number of eligible children, the uptake and determination of fees payable to GPs and so forth. Furthermore, the implementation of this measure will require negotiation with GP representatives to address issues such as fees payable and the scope of services to be provided and, critically, whether there is capacity in the community and in general practice for it. I also recognise that such reform cannot happen overnight.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> The initial stage of this phased expansion, therefore, will be first to all children aged between six and eight years so as not to overwhelm the health system. Specifically, the legislative framework provides a roadmap for the phased expansion to the following three age categories: phase 1 is to children who are aged under eight, that is, children who are six or seven years of age; phase 2 is to children aged under ten years, that is, children who are eight or nine years of age; and phase 3 is to children who are under the age of 13, that is, children who are ten, 11 or 12 years old. This approach will ensure that the expanded service can be introduced in a way that will meet the ongoing health needs of children and also be sustainable for general practice in the current Covid environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> In that context, it is important to acknowledge the impact of Covid-19 on general practice. During this pandemic, GPs have remained at the heart of service delivery, demonstrating fantastic flexibility in adapting to new norms and taking pressure off the acute hospital system. This is unlikely to change as we move into the latter part of the year. In the likelihood of reduced hospital capacity for the forthcoming winter as a result of Covid, it is anticipated that a greater burden of care will fall on GPs to manage patients within the community wherever possible. In that regard and taking account of the forthcoming winter season, it is important that an expansion of GP care will not inhibit general practice from delivering appropriate care in the community for all patients. Thus, the implementation for the expansion will require careful consideration by officials in my Department and the HSE in consultation with GP representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> The purpose of the Bill is twofold, to provide the legislative framework for the further expansion of GP care and to increase the gross income limits for medical card eligibility for persons aged 70 and over. Before I outline the Bill's main provisions, I draw the House's attention to a miscellaneous provision included in the Bill, namely, an amendment to the Health Act 1970 that is provided for to take account of the new governance structures of the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> Section 2 will amend the existing legislation relating to the gross income limits for medical card eligibility for persons aged 70 or over under the Health Act 1970. The amendment of section 45A of the Health Act 1970 will provide for an increase to the gross medical card income limits for persons aged 70 or over from €500 to €550 for a single person and from €900 to €1,050 for a couple.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> Section 3 will provide a technical amendment to section 53C of the Health Act 1970 to replace the reference to "Director General of the Health Service Executive" with a reference to "chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive". The Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2019 established a board and the chief executive officer governance structure for the HSE, replacing the directorate and director general structure. Part 3 of that Act amended reference to the "Director General" of the HSE, replacing this with reference to the "chief executive officer" of the HSE. This necessary technical amendment, therefore, will ensure that section 53C is consistent with the amendment approach previously provided for in the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> Section 4 will amend the existing legislation under the Health Act 1970 that relates to the making available of a general practitioner medical and surgical service without charge to persons who are ordinarily resident in the State and under the age of six. The amendment of sections 58 and 58B of the Health Act 1970 expands the availability of these services to persons who are ordinarily resident in the State and have not attained the age of eight. This is the first age category being provided with eligibility for free GP care under the first phase of expansion.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> Sections 5 and 6 will provide for the further making available of a general practitioner medical and surgical service without charges to persons who are ordinarily resident in the State and have not attained the ages of ten and 13 years, respectively. These are the second and third age categories being provided with eligibility for free GP care under the two remaining phases of expansion.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> Section 7 will provide for the Short Title of the Act and for the introduction of both GP expansion and an increase to the gross medical card income threshold by commencement orders as required, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> The measures provided for in the Bill are good news for all of us, for our children, parents and grandparents. I am confident they will significantly improve access to GP services and to a range of services for both older and younger people in our society. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the views of Deputies.</p>

          <from>Deputy David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_625">This is my first time, as the Sinn Féin spokesperson for health, to exchange with the Minister for Health. I wish him well. There are significant challenges in healthcare that we, collectively, have to deal with in the coming weeks, months and years.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> We will support the Bill and have supported its quick passage through the Houses. Nevertheless, given the crisis in both primary and community care and acute care settings because of Covid-19, and the need to deal with Covid care, non-Covid care and what many are now calling the catch-up programme to deal with mis-care, we need rapidly to ramp up investment in our health services. I would have much preferred if the Minister had spelled out to us where that investment, that is, the additional investment in community care, primary care and acute care, will come from in the coming weeks and months.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> I am not sure whether the Minister watched the "RTÉ Investigates" programme last night. It laid bare again the extent of the crisis in our health system and what front-line workers in all healthcare settings are facing, from supporting older people and acute hospitals to primary care, right across the board. It showed that because we did not invest in community and primary care to the extent we should have over the past decade, we have been left with an acute care system that simply cannot cope. Imagine if we had invested in the primary care infrastructure that we in Sinn Féin called for and if we had more GPs working for the HSE and better community infrastructure that could deal with diagnostics, for example. It would take a great deal of pressure off our acute systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> The Bill is welcome insofar as it will extend GP cover to more sections of society. Some 150,000 children aged between six and 12 already have access to free GP care and the Bill will extend that service to about 300,000 further children, which we support. It will also provide for an increase to the gross medical card income limits for people aged over 70, which will benefit about 56,000 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> What we now need to hear from the Minister is what will come next. One aspect of the programme for Government that puzzled me, and it is something the Government needs to clarify, is the several references to affordable care - not universal care but affordable care. We all know there is a big difference between universal healthcare and affordable healthcare. We were promised by the previous Government that it would implement what was in Sláintecare, that we would have a new dispensation in healthcare that would finally separate private from public healthcare, that people would be treated on the basis of need and that there would be a health service that was truly equal and accessible for all citizens. We do not have that, however, and we are a long way from it. One of the first steps I took when I became the health spokesperson for my party was to read Sláintecare again and the implementation reports. Any objective reading would suggest we are a long way from the targets that were set, and that was before Covid struck.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> We are discussing expanded GP cover in this Bill so I will mention some of the measures that could have been in the legislation. For a long time my party has called for all cancer patients to have a medical card. I remember when we called for this in the past the previous Government argued that if it was done for cancer patients, it would have to be done for other patients. We want to see free GP care for everybody and we have a plan to do that over five years. However, a bit like what the Government is doing in incrementally rolling out free GP care to children who are under certain ages, we must start somewhere. A good start would have been those patients with cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> My mother passed away from cancer two years ago. I remember when she was first diagnosed the shock it was to her and the family. Every one of us knows people who have, unfortunately, developed cancer and the trauma that brings to families. The last thing they need to worry about is the additional medical costs. For all the heartache, trauma, care and treatment they must face, it is wrong that they must also worry about costs. The cost to the taxpayer of doing this is approximately €40 million. The Minister supported this when he was in the Opposition. It would mean 14,000 cancer patients would have access to medical treatment free of charge. It is one of the first things that should be done by this Minister and his Government in the expansion of GP care.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> As we reflect on the commitments made in Sláintecare and seek to deliver a new healthcare system that addresses health on the basis of need rather than ability to pay, we must hear the Minister's plan as quickly as possible. What will the Minister for Health do to accelerate the implementation of commitments that his party signed up to along with my party and other parties in this Chamber?</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> I know we have a big challenge with the Covid-19 crisis. There are a number of big challenges that face the health service as we speak. We must deal with the ongoing Covid-19 crisis and people will need care if they contract the virus. We must prepare for a potential second wave or surge, which would put major stress on our healthcare system, which was unable to cope even before the virus struck. We had people waiting on hospital trolleys and waiting far too long for hospital treatment. People were waiting more than 15 months to see a hospital consultant. I could give the Minister a long list of specialties in this category in my constituency of Waterford, including orthopaedics, with people waiting two, three or four years simply to see a consultant. This was the reality before Covid-19 struck. We must still be able to deal with all the patients who must be treated if they contract the virus.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> We must also deal with the existing non-Covid care that should happen anyway, and we have to catch up on missed care. There is absolutely no way this can be done with current capacity. Nevertheless, I do not see any plan from the Government to tell us where the additional capacity will come from. Where will we get the required beds, staff and diagnostics? Where is the plan? It is months since the election, although the Minister is only weeks in his job. Parties have had much time to reflect on what is needed. This is an urgent matter and if the Minister had seen last night's programme, he would know how urgent it is. Nevertheless, no plan has yet been published by the Government as to how it will inject serious capacity into the health service to ensure people do not die.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> Cancer screening services, including bowel and breast cancer screening, must get up and running as soon as possible. If the Minister listened to the contributions to the Covid-19 committee some days ago, he would have heard the advocate groups crying out for help. They argue that if services are not rolled out quickly, there will be many missed diagnoses and people will die as a result. The Minister would accept that this is not scaremongering; it will be the reality if we do not inject serious capacity into the healthcare system.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> I support the Bill and its intentions. Regardless of who became Minister for Health, we would have had this Bill before us. However, the Minister must come forward with a plan very quickly. Whatever about the cost, the Minister should agree that such a plan must come about. If we do not build modular units or capacity in community care very quickly, and if we do not get more beds into acute hospitals, we will have a crisis in healthcare in the State that we have never seen before. It is the reality facing us. We know it. People will die unnecessarily if we do not do the right thing. I want to see more urgency from the Minister and his Government. I want to see a plan very quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> There is no point in any of us slapping front-line workers on their backs, telling them how great they are, if we can see the significant stress they endure and the lack of the capacity in what they need to treat patients and keep people alive. We would not be doing our job in that case. We know what they will do, what they are capable of doing and what they have done in this crisis. We have our job to do, which is to ensure they can keep people safe and treat people. They will not be able to do that unless the Minister provides serious funding and capacity in the time ahead.</p>

          <from>Deputy Violet-Anne Wynne<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_638">I commend the Government on bringing the Bill before the House to deal with a very important matter, the expansion of a scheme to include all children under 12 and provide them with free GP services, as well as the raising of income limits applying to people over 70. This is most welcome, especially for my constituents in Clare.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> As the House is aware, we in Sinn Féin promised two free GP visits to each person in the country as part of our 2020 general election manifesto, with the long-term aim to provide universal healthcare free at the point of need and not based on an ability to pay. The Bill does not go that far or even to a point we would see as far enough, but I welcome that it is at least a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> The reality right across the country is that workers and families are struggling. These workers and families were undoubtedly struggling before Covid-19 but with the uncertainty brought by the health pandemic, they are in a state of financial despair. They are counting the cost of childcare and medical appointments and even preparing for costs arising in advance of the new school year, as well as many other household bills that loom over parents as they raise a family. The cost of attending a GP is quite often one of the most expensive of these bills and the need to attend is mostly unpredictable. As a mother of five children, I am very much aware of the unexpected cost of attending a GP when a child falls ill and how much an effect this can have. It is an average cost of €50 per visit just to be seen and heard by a GP, and this can often be the extraordinary cost that can push already struggling families over the edge. The Minister did not use the right word in this instance. Not being able to afford the cost of a GP visit for any child is an awful position for any parent.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> There is also the raising of income limits for people over 70, which is a welcome announcement. Many older people in our society are often forgotten but seriously struggle with the costs of daily life. Most older people have worked their entire lives and contributed to the building of the country we live in today. I am happy to see this Bill will ensure that we, as a State, can give a little back to these people. They are the most vulnerable in our society, along with children, and it is our duty to ensure their most basic of healthcare needs are met.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> It is estimated that this expansion of the criteria will benefit approximately 300,000 extra children and approximately 56,000 people over 70. I have no doubt the introduction of this access to healthcare will take some pressure off our hospitals, which is a crucial point. The reality is that early access to medical care if and when required can have a knock-on effect on people ending up in accident and emergency departments. This is an important matter for the people of the mid-west and particularly my constituents in County Clare.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">The reality is that those who are fighting to keep bread on the table often have to pick and choose between bills. It is hoped that this legislation will ensure that their health will not be sacrificed for the payment of a bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> According to the 2016 census, there are approximately 22,000 children in County Clare under the age of 13. Those, along with the 12,000 people, approximately, over the age of 70, will welcome the introduction of this Bill to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> The only hesitation I have about the Bill before us is the lack of a commitment to a timeframe. As I have said, while this Bill is welcome, I call on the Government to ensure that it is implemented as a priority as soon as possible. I also call on the Government to ensure that a clear, definitive timeframe is provided to ensure that this roll-out is completed as soon as possible but, at the very least, within the timeframe of this Dáil. The Minister should tell the people of Clare when it will be enacted because they want action now and not any more waffle. I call on the Government to address this matter and make a clear commitment to ensure that it is rolled out sooner rather than later.</p>

          <p eId="para_647">It sure is a long distance. For our part, Sinn Féin is committed to establishing a healthcare system that is free at the point of delivery and available when people need it. Despite the fact that we put more money per head of population into health services than any other European country, we still have a dysfunctional two-tier system. That is despite the best efforts of the front-line staff. Sinn Féin has a plan to move healthcare away from a system based on what is in one's bank balance or pocket towards a European national NHS-style system where all citizens are guaranteed a world-class service. We all know that this cannot be done overnight but we can make some simple changes to the current system that will make a major difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> In our election manifesto in February, my party committed to two free GP visits per year for everyone who does not have a medical card and a full medical card entitlement for those who have cancer. We know that is not enough but these measures can be done in steps, and that is what we propose, as well as free GP care to all citizens over a five-year term.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> In line with Sinn Féin proposals to move towards a one-tier system in healthcare, we welcome the steps taken in the legislation the Government has brought forward to provide GP care to all children under the age of 12 and to increase the income limits for those over the age of 70. Like the previous speaker, the only concern I would have is the timeframe for that. However, a major problem remains for all those who are working and do not qualify for a medical card. More than 1 million people in this State have no health cover whatsoever. They do not qualify for a medical card and they do not have private health insurance because, very simply, they cannot afford it. I want the Minister to address the case of a couple with two children under 16 years of age. They cannot get a medical card if their income is more than €342 a week. That is an incredibly low figure. A single person living alone loses the medical card if he or she has an income in excess of €184 per week, which is €19 less than what they would get on the dole. Even worse, those thresholds have not been raised since 2006. They need to be changed. I believe the Minister and I could agree on that. Low-paid workers should have medical card cover. The fact that a family of four on more than €342 per week does not have a statutory right to a medical card is a scandal, and we need to address it.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> Parents with two children who are sick are choosing not to go to a GP because they cannot afford for both of them to go. I have come across that, as I am sure has the Minister. That is despite the fact that we spend €4,706 per head of population on healthcare, one third more than the average across the 35 OECD countries. That is according to the recent OECD figures. That €4,706 is far more than what many other European states that have a system that is free at the point of delivery spend. Of course, no system is free because people pay their taxes, including USC and PRSI, into it, but it is free at the point of delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> We have tolerated this for long enough. We have tolerated long waiting lists. We have tolerated a two-tier system. Now is the time to start putting those building blocks in place. We recognise that that has to be done in steps, but we want quick steps and long steps. We want to get there because it is the one mission on which every Member of this House says they are agreed. I have heard the Minister speak eloquently on it many times, and I hope he follows through on it now that he is in a powerful position.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> We need to try to drive forward towards a national health system. We need greater North-South co-operation on health. Some excellent work has been done in that regard. People from the North get heart treatment in the South. People from the South get hip treatments in the North. We need to accelerate that because there are strengths and weaknesses in both systems. We need to strengthen those all-Ireland links, and Sinn Féin will not be found wanting in pushing for that. In the meantime, let us expand the entitlement to medical card cover. I welcome what is happening here in terms of the Bill, but let us address those families and workers I have mentioned. It is a scandal. The figures have not changed since 2006. Let us bring those low-paid workers and families into the medical card net. The thresholds have not changed in 14 years. We need to change it now. If the Minister could start doing that, it would be a great day's work.</p>

          <from>Deputy Alan Kelly<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_653">I want sincerely to wish the Minister the best. I have done so in a private capacity but I want to do so publicly also. We need him to do well, so I ask him, please, to do as well as he physically can. He has inherited a very tough job but he was a spokesperson representing Fianna Fáil for a number of years. I sat with him for many hours in committees and in the Dáil and I heard him speak with great analysis. He studied his subject matters and often put forward solutions, some of which I agreed with and some of which I did not, but he put them forward with an analytic mind. He spoke often of his previous work as a consultant and brought that through in his analysis. I would like to see that coming through again. I respect that. However, there is a big difference between being in opposition and in government, and he will find that out very quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> I analysed many of the Minister's commitments, statements, and what he supports and does not support, some of which I agree with and some of which I do not, and I respectfully say to him that he needs to look at them also to see what is realisable, because he is on the record substantially with regard to many areas of health, and if he is not going to be able to deliver on them, he needs to tell us. Do not tell us in six months or a year. Tell us out straight. I will accept it, but he needs to manage the relationships with others also who have a feeling that he will be able to deliver with regard to their areas. It is important that the Minister sets expectations. I accept that the world has changed, although some of the commitments and commentary he made were with regard to Covid-19 but, by and large, I accept the world has changed. I accept that the position of the Minister for Health is a different one from what it was a few months ago, but the Minister put forward various policies and strategies and made commitments relating to resources. He needs to state his position on them now, what will happen during his term in office and his plan, because people are waiting.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> I also want to say publicly that we need to see a visible Minister for Health. In fairness, the Minister has been reading into his Department brief and his portfolio over recent weeks, but we really need to see more of him. I had many a row, probably more so than most, with the previous Minister, Deputy Harris, but he was very visible. We need to see more visibility from the Minister. I was talking to some people over the weekend and they asked me to share that with the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">In a situation like the Covid-19 pandemic, they want to hear from him as a stabilising voice who can allay their concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> We will support this Bill. I think everybody will do so. However, the Bill does not go far enough. We believe it should cover everyone under 18 years of age. We support the threshold changes. The three-phase structure leaves a bit to be desired. If the Minister was in opposition, he would ask for data to explain why it is being done this way. He would also question the value for money achieved by negotiating with GPs on three separate levels. As such, I need to ask him those questions. Here is a question the Opposition Deputy Stephen Donnelly might have asked the then Minister for Health. Why is this being introduced in three different phases? Are there value-for-money issues with the hop, skip and jump arrangement leading up to the age of 13? The Minister might answer those questions when he gets a chance.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> Covid-19 is the biggest crisis this country has faced in 100 years or more. It is also a disrupter that creates the capacity to change the way we think and the way we do things. It creates opportunity. A window of opportunity is open to the Minister. It will not remain open for long and he needs to act to exploit the opportunity that exists. He has made very quick decisions, such as that relating to private hospitals, which, in my view, was the wrong one. Like my colleagues in this House, I have spent whole days talking about bed capacity. One can see how difficult it will be to pursue construction projects. I have no idea how we will create public bed capacity in the short term without nationalising at least one large hospital. The window of opportunity seems to have closed because of the decisions of this Government. I think that is wrong. We have an opportunity and the public is with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> The public will not tolerate going back to a two-tier health system. Its tolerance for that was ended by Covid-19. The opportunity to make a change arose in the three or four months in which we had a single-tier health system for acute care. That was a missed opportunity which the Minister will regret. The overall bed capacity in our country needs to increase dramatically. We all know the studies. In the coming months and years I will pursue the Minister quite intensely on public bed capacity and his plans to deliver it. I want to know how he will do it. I do not have faith in this Government's initial moves to deliver that.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> I despise the cycle of reliance on the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF. Every year it encourages a dumbing down of the public health system. If we keep going to the private health system to bail us out, we will never sort out the public health system. Fianna Fáil Deputies are the biggest proponents of this approach. They always have been. The party's leader, An Taoiseach, has always supported it. That is not acceptable to me. Running to the NTPF every year is completely and utterly unacceptable. This matter needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> I have several other questions for the Minister. I would like to know what he is going to do about the provision of drugs. We went around the houses quite a bit in discussing how this is dealt with. Our method of procuring various drugs is incoherent. Will the Minister honour what he said in opposition about changing that system? Change is very much needed. A lot of people out there are hopeful and want the Minister to honour what he said in opposition. We need a lot of structural changes and changes to the HSE. We need to ensure that more services are offered in the community and we need to reorganise community structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> There is one pledge which the Minister will have to honour. At what point during this year will he end two-tier pay for new entrant consultants? I will say it straight: the Minister is out on a limb in respect of this matter. He has hitched his wagon to this promise very publicly, more so than anyone else. When will he deliver on it? He has said that solving this problem would unlock a range of other issues. I agree with the Minister to an extent, but I do not feel as strongly as he does. He has to deliver that this year. I do not think he has any choice. If he does not, he will certainly have failed to honour a pledge. The Minister has said that a lot of the issues with the health service emerged from that problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> We are very dependent on bringing in doctors and nurses from outside of Ireland. I do not blame the Minister for that, but we need a plan. How are we going to plan to address this issue? I will work with the Minister on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> I want to highlight several issues not related to Covid-19. The mortality rates relating to non-Covid-19 conditions are now higher than that relating to Covid-19. The resumption of service provision has left a lot to be desired. I refer to mental health services, community services, services delivered in the home and home help hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> The issue relating to disability services is a real bugbear of mine. I will speak a little bit about that issue. People with disabilities are forgotten. I have spoken about adults with intellectual disabilities on two or three occasions in this House. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, replied to me earlier. She indicated that the Minister would bring a memo to the Cabinet next week. The Minister has the budget, by the way, because the Minister of State does not have delegated powers. These people are being left to rot. I have spoken to many of them throughout the country. I spent a couple of evenings talking to their families. Before half past seven this morning, I spoke to a family whose 29 year old son had been up most of the night because he has no routine. He no longer has the will to keep one.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> Resources have been transferred from day services to residential services. As such, those who need day services are effectively being discriminated against. This cannot continue. They need some form of service, even if it is only available two or three days a week. Those people will be outside this House next Wednesday so the Minister can talk to them. This situation is intolerable, upsetting, wrong and immoral. It has to stop. Bringing a memo to the Government which states that there will be some form of service provision throughout Ireland in September will not wash. These people are at the end of their tether. I am pleading with the Minister to ensure the return of services. Just two days a week would be massive.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">They have been locked inside their homes only going out for small occasions and they have no routine, no facilities, no stimulation and very little to look forward to. Every day is Groundhog Day. I have met with them and they are destroyed by what is happening. I keep raising this issue because I got so upset talking to them. This is way beyond politics and I am asking the Minister please to help them.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> John Wall is an amazing human being whom I have got to know quite well over the past number of years. John is terminally ill and is fighting for medical cards for those who have been diagnosed terminally ill. I do not think there is a single person in this House who would oppose the entitlement of those people to a medical card. John's project, as I call it, has been brought to a certain stage and now we are waiting on the sign-off of the Comptroller and Auditor General. John is well at the moment, but as he says in his letter to the Minister of 21 July - I presume the Minister has received and read it; if not, I will text it to him now - he is begging him to push this issue forward and get it implemented. The Minister has dealt with John before. Some of the people John has been campaigning for are no longer with us and the amount of money involved is small. The previous Minister, Deputy Harris, brought the matter to a certain level and I am now asking the Minister to execute it. Again, this is not a political issue and the sums involved are very small. I ask the Minister to engage with John on the matter and to honour the undertaking of the previous Minister in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> I attended Ruth Morrissey's funeral yesterday. Ruth was a national hero who was not only let down by the State but let down in a way that, for me, was unforgivable. She fought the State not once but twice. I know, because I had communications with Ruth and her family, what she wanted her legacy to be. It was not about getting an apology, because it was too late for that. She wanted the Civil Liability Act to be amended so that no more families would have to go through what she and others went through. Together with my colleagues, I am going to bring forward a Bill dealing with this matter in September. I will work with the Minister on it and I want to see it implemented. Ruth also wanted screening to be brought home. In addition, she wanted to ensure that women would never go through anything like she had gone through. We now have a situation where the tribunal is not sitting and two of the judges have gone off to other jobs. It is an adversarial tribunal. The Minister sat beside me in this House for years and he knows what these women went through. He saw the testimony of so many of them. A piece of work needs to be done to deal with this matter and it needs to be done very quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> Last week, I visited St. Gabriel's respite centre in Mungret in Limerick. It is a state-of-the art facility and the best one in Ireland for children with very severe disabilities. It cost €2.9 million to build and is supposed to provide a service for 100 families but it has been sitting idle for two years. It is an absolute scandal. I have never in my career seen a better, more purpose-built building. I am absolutely committed to raising this issue with the Minister. From a funding point of view, the money required is not huge and there are some economies to be made from funding it. A little over €1 million will fund it for 100 families every year. I implore the Minister to look at this issue because the St. Gabriel's facility is the example of what we should be providing for all such families throughout Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> I believe we have a real issue in our acute system when it comes to transport provision. We have a fantastic ambulance service but it is not being ramped up. In the mid-west, which is my area, we have four hospitals all based off University Hospital Limerick and three other hospitals all at the same level, although in different tiers. Transport provision is always delaying how patients are being released from hospital for aftercare or to be taken out of a serious acute setting and into a step-down facility in the other hospitals. It is a ridiculous situation and it is one of a number of reasons that University Hospital Limerick has been left the way it is, because it cannot get people out to St. John's, Ennis and Nenagh hospitals. There is no way of doing it. We need intermediate vehicles and more ambulances. Sorting out that whole system should be a priority because it will unlock certain aspects of the issues with acute services.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> Finally, I really implore the Minister to honour what he said he would do in regard to home help. The provision of home help hours is massively important. It keeps people in their homes, prevents them from ending up in nursing homes and, with a tiered-up provision, prevents them from ending up in acute settings. It actually makes economic sense as much as it makes health sense. The requirement here is considerable, not in money but in hours. However, the savings and the health benefits from keeping people in their homes are huge. I have 18 pages of notes I took of things the Minister has said on the record and he has said some serious things about this issue. Taking action on it is a quick win and it makes sense. We have always agreed on this issue and I ask the Minister to implement the necessary action now. I wish him well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_246">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_673">At the outset, I congratulate the Minister formally on his appointment and wish him well in the job. He certainly has spent a good bit of time studying the area. From the Social Democrats point of view, we will fully support him if he is ambitious for the health service and if he delivers and makes progress on Sláintecare in a reasonable timescale. If not, we will criticise him. I hope it will be the former rather than the latter.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> There are two issues I want to raise before dealing with the Bill. Yesterday, I got figures in regard to what is happening at our ports and airports with tourists coming into the country in the context of Covid. Shockingly, I was told that only 7% of people who arrive here are being followed up with a telephone call and only half of that number, 3.5%, are answering those calls. This is unbelievable when we consider the threat that is posed to the country, all the sacrifices people have made and the absolute priority of protecting people's health, ensuring schools can reopen and seeking to get the domestic economy up and running again. It was made quite clear to me by the Department of Justice and Equality that it is only doing this work on an interim basis and that it is the responsibility of the Department of Health to do it. The latter Department is waiting for the health authorities to take over. This is an absolutely urgent issue. Can the Minister tell me this afternoon, or come back with an answer tomorrow, when his Department will be in a position to ensure there is proper follow-up on these cases? It makes a mockery of all the hard work that has been undertaken over recent months if we are wide open and exposing the Irish people and the Irish economy to this level of threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> The second point I want to mention concerns something that has just come to my attention. The Minister will be aware that €25 million in funding is threatened to be cut from disability services. His predecessor gave an absolute commitment, following meetings with the various organisations working in the area, that this funding would be reinstated. My understanding is that the Minister also gave a commitment, as did his party, that the €25 million provision will be reinstated. My information this afternoon, however, is that one of those organisations has been told by its local community health office, CHO, that the cut is going to be implemented. That cannot happen. We have been talking for some time about the huge pressure on the disability organisations in trying to provide services to people in very difficult circumstances, their fundraising capacity having been hugely reduced. They simply cannot sustain this level of cut and nor can the many vulnerable clients they serve. Will the Minister clarify for us, either this evening or tomorrow at the latest, that this cut will not go forward and that the funding will be reinstated?</p>
          <p eId="para_676">The Social Democrats will not be opposing the Bill. However, it is very underwhelming as an initiative aimed at improving access to healthcare. It completely lacks ambition. In the context of the Sláintecare commitments to which the Minister's party and the other parties in Government signed up, the Bill is desperately disappointing. It falls far short of what they committed to achieving.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> I refer to the issue of eligibility because that is what the Bill is about. I do not know how familiar the Minister is with the fact that Ireland is unusual in that access to healthcare is dealt with as a matter of eligibility rather than entitlement. This issue was teased out in some detail at the Committee on the Future of Healthcare. Access to healthcare is a matter of eligibility rather than entitlement and that is the difficulty. Various legal provisions set out the categories of people who are eligible for access to services, but they are only eligible if those services are actually provided. There is no legal entitlement to healthcare. There is a right of access to social protection and the various schemes thereunder, but there is no similar legal entitlement to healthcare. That is a fundamental problem in the context of how we provide services. It is one of the reasons for there being a postcode lottery when it comes to accessing services. Certain areas operate the schemes differently from other areas, depending on their funding and share of the healthcare budget, which varies significantly. The issue of eligibility and entitlement is at the heart of many of the problems relating to the lack of access to healthcare.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> Eligibility for services is divided into those who have a medical card and those who do not. Those who do not have a medical card are required to pay the full cost of GP care and other primary and community care services, as well as a very significant portion of prescription charges and the cost of prescription medicines. The World Health Organization has called Ireland's approach to determine eligibility for publicly financed health services "unusually complex". It stated that it has led to notable gaps in coverage and inequalities in accessing essential health services. The heavy reliance on the private health insurance market mainly benefits wealthier people and has a negative impact on equity. That is at the heart of the problems in the health service. The lack of equity within the health service is a significant issue. If a person can afford to pay for private health insurance, access is quite good. If a person cannot afford health insurance, he or she may qualify for a medical card which may give eligibility to access services that are not really good enough, but those who are left in the middle must pay for everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> Reference is made in the Sláintecare recommendations relating to universal health access to Ireland still being a far cry from the universal cover enjoyed in most other European countries. Ireland is very unusual in the context of such a large proportion of our population having to fork out for access to primary care. We are on our own in Europe in that regard. There is no other country in Europe in which such a large proportion of the population is charged the full rate to see a GP. It is unheard of. People in other countries would not tolerate it and there is no reason we should tolerate it here.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> The Bill aims to introduce an extension of access to GP care for children in three phases. As Deputies are aware, and as the Minister frequently stated while in opposition, access is the key issue in the context of healthcare. Far too many people do not have access to primary care, which is the most basic level of healthcare. We know that cost is a significant barrier. It makes absolute sense to ensure wider access at primary care level. If cost continues to be a barrier to accessing GP care, we will undoubtedly end up with higher costs overall. We should be encouraging people to get their medical concerns and conditions addressed at the lowest level of complexity. That means people going to or bringing their children to a GP when issues first arise. That is what makes sense. That is how one ensures there is early intervention and early treatment of conditions and, as a result, heads off more serious conditions. If cost continues to be a barrier, people who have developing health conditions will inevitably end up with a more serious condition and may have to attend an accident and emergency department, see a consultant or be admitted to hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> As Members are aware, the health service is overly hospital-centric. Services are provided at the most expensive level rather than ensuring we have preventative medicine, early intervention and early access to care. We are doing the opposite of what we ought to be doing. Not only does that lead to poorer health outcomes, it is a much more expensive system. As the system is so hospital-centric, we are spending more than most other OECD countries - we are very much at the top level of health spend - but we are at the lower level in terms of access. That makes no sense whatsoever. That is why Sláintecare, our agreed plan, is about completely reversing the manner in which we provide care.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> The Bill only takes baby steps. It falls far short of what is required and what was promised. Ireland remains the only European country that does not have universal coverage for primary care. Irish GP payments are the highest formal payments in Europe, with 60% of the population paying non-reimbursable fees of between €50 and €70 per GP visit. That is a significant amount of money, particularly for working and other families who, in the main, have no access to free GP care. Health spending in Ireland is approximately one fifth higher than the EU average, but public funding of health spending is only 73%, 6% lower than the EU average of 79%. Out-of-pocket payments for GP visits are far more significant in Ireland than in other EU states.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> It is important to bear in mind the length of time for which the various parties, including that of the Minister, have been discussing universal healthcare. In 2001, the then national health strategy, entitled Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, made universal coverage a guiding principle for the health service. The Minister's party leader, who is now the Taoiseach, was central to the primary care strategy discussed at that stage. Little or no progress has been made on it since. In 2011, the programme for Government referred to universal primary care which would remove fees for GP care. It stated that would be introduced within the term of that Government. In 2016, A Programme for a Partnership Government referred to extending in phases the introduction of free GP care to all young people under the age of 18. Very slow progress has been made in that regard. We have not got anywhere near that objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">The recent programme for Government refers to extending free GP care to more children. That is really disappointing. On the one hand, it refers to accelerating the implementation of Sláintecare while, on the other, it mentions extending free GP care to more children. Even the Bill before us, which contains a phased measure, deals with children up to 13 years. It is fairly pathetic in the context of all of the commitments that were made. I say that it should be extended to the entire population. That is what Sláintecare is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> On the programme for Government, it is important to bear in mind that earlier commitments never came to fruition in the lifetime of any of the previous Governments dating back to 2000. The level of ambition has regressed since 2011. Universal GP care is not just about providing better access to healthcare, it is also about raising the health status of the whole population. It is also about ensuring better quality of care and longer life free of disability or chronic illness. Further, it is about enhancing economic liberty. If Deputies want to use that argument about the economic impact of universal access to healthcare, we know that the high cost of healthcare is a significant factor in our loss of competitiveness, as are the high costs of housing and childcare.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> There are also very significant GP supply issues that need to be addressed. I am not sure what the Minister is doing in that regard or what his plans are. There are 64.4 GPs per 100,000 people in Ireland, significantly lower than the EU average of 91 GPs per 100,000. In order to support universal healthcare policies, the Government must also support GPs. It is important to listen to what the data are telling us about GPs. We urgently need a new GP contract. The one in place is completely outdated and does not serve the objectives set out in Sláintecare. Nor does it help us in terms of the recruitment of GPs. People spend many years training to be GPs and provide healthcare services. We should not expect them to be businesspeople or to have capital behind them to set up private practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> A great many of our qualifying GPs end up going abroad simply because they cannot work as GPs in this country. They are expected either to have the money to set up private practice or to go as an assistant to somebody else. That is not what they want. Various surveys in recent years show that they want to work as part of a multidisciplinary team. They do not want to be carrying the burden of running a private practice. Nor do they want to be without the benefit and support of a multidisciplinary team which is so essential for the provision of comprehensive healthcare. They also want better work-life balance. None of those things are available to people at the moment. Nor is a sufficient salary or guaranteed secure salary available to them. The previous Government promised to move to a system of salaried GPs. A lot of newly qualifying GPs would be very interested in being employed by the State for a decent salary. I cannot understand why the previous Government did not and this Government will not commit to progressing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> I want to make a point about medical cards for the over 70s. The income limits are being increased to a small extent under this legislation. I have stated previously in the Dáil that the income limits for over 70s are based on gross income. They are extremely low for under 70s but at least there is provision for disregards for particularly high health or living expenses that can be offset against the income limits. In the case of over 70s, only gross income is taken into consideration, irrespective of what a person's outgoings are. It is a fundamental weakness in how we operate the income limits for over 70s. The Minister referred to high-quality care for people in this age category. There is not high-quality care available to people over 70 who desperately need home-care services. I do not know if the Minister is aware that at the moment there are some 6,000 people living at home in difficult circumstances with various medical conditions, who have met the difficult criteria in terms of qualifying for home care and who are on the waiting list for home care because insufficient funding is provided. That makes no sense. It is inevitable that many of them will end up having to go into nursing homes or hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> There is a promise in the programme for Government - it was also made in the context of the budget - to reduce prescription charges. That was to be done by July but I have not heard anything more about it. Has the Minister any information on that? Is the promise going to be upheld? The bottom line is that Ireland lags far behind all of its European neighbours when it comes to access to healthcare, particularly primary healthcare. It makes no sense on any level. It is quite disappointing to see the baby steps that are being taken in this legislation. What is proposed falls far short of what was promised in Sláintecare. This is year three of Sláintecare. Access to free GP care was to be introduced across the population in the first five years of Sláintecare. We are many years behind the commitments that were made. Not only does this deny people access to basic healthcare and impact hugely on their quality of life, ensuring there is a lack of equity in how we provide healthcare; it also means that we are not getting value for money on the significant spend that we have relative to other countries. That needs to be addressed quickly.</p>

          <from>Deputy Verona Murphy<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_693">I am sharing time with Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick. No one could say anything other than that this Bill is welcome, but there are some concerns I wish to raise in order that we might ensure the success of its implementation for all concerned. The Bill provides for free GP care for under 13s on a phased basis. I would like to add a note of caution on its introduction date, phasing in and the balance of availability of services. The issue of availability of GP services is one of grave concern, particularly in Wexford. Evidence-based research from Trinity College shows that an increase of 28% in GP visits occurred with the introduction of free GP care for those under six years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">When he was spokesperson in opposition, the Minister's response was:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_695">This is a crisis. Doctors have been treated with contempt since Fine Gael came into power. It is about time there was meaningful engagement with GPs.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">I am not trying to throw those words in his face. I say that because the situation has not changed. I appreciate that was then and this is now but that is why I remind him.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> Take someone who moves from one part of the country to another, as many people in Wexford have done. Many of my constituents tell my office that they cannot get a GP to take them on. It is not the fault of the patient or the GP but it is something we must deal with urgently. People in Wexford are travelling back to Dublin weekly to get their prescription. The average number of patients per GP practice in Wexford is 1,118 while the national average is 861 so Wexford is over 30% above the national average for most practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> A most concerning aspect for those unable to get on the books of a practice is that no one is collecting the data. We do not know the numbers. All the data is needed for any legislation. This is something that could be a question in the next census. GP practices are under huge strain and struggle to give the current patient list the care and attention required. They have no choice but to close lists to maintain cover and take on no new patients. Their staff are under great pressure to deal with patients requiring medical care, having to tell patients they cannot have an appointment within two weeks, which would have been thought outrageous once upon a time. GP practice staff would be enjoying their jobs were it not for the constant firefighting and telling sick people they cannot have a timely appointment. The lack of new GPs to replace them means doctors are unable to retire from their practices. There is a serious shortage of locums if a doctor cannot attend his or her own practice. The State should consider a pool of locums under the HSE to assist in this, similar to the model used by the NHS in the UK. </p>
          <p eId="para_699"> If Covid has taught us anything, it is that this is a necessity. I encourage the Minister to get this under way as soon as possible. We cannot deliver legislation that looks like window dressing. Something that looks like that to me is the doctor-only GP card for those over 70 years who are not entitled to the full medical card. They are unable to access public health nurse services. Those over 70 years are a vulnerable category. If, say, they only require dressings changed once a week, it is much better that it be done by competent public health nurses than require a GP. It should be expanded because eligibility should be based on need not age. </p>
          <p eId="para_700"> In 2018, the Irish Patients Association said that 1,310 new GPs would be required to keep pace with the expected rise in consultations from the implementation of legislation for those under six years. I have tried to find what stage we are at with implementing that or furthering our GP services, including how many have qualified or are in training. Based on the phased implementation of this for those under 12 years a considerable increase in GPs is needed, rather than continuing with the overwhelmed services which cannot continue. In healthcare patients should receive the care they need. Doctors' primary focus is to deliver timely, high quality care as much as possible for healthy outcomes. </p>
          <p eId="para_701"> I wish to emphasise the cuts to disability services which has already been raised. Some €20 million was cut from the disability budget a year after we adopted the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. I visited the Cumas centre in New Ross. Cumas means ability and capability. Though a disability service, it never uses that word. I was in awe of how it conducted its services during Covid. It never missed one hour of support for its residents. Its service is about providing supports to enable the ability of its residents and clients and that gives them choices in what life has to offer them. I was saddened about the 1% efficiency cut through the HSE that will come into operation in January. Previously, the Minister said that could not happen. I plead with him not to cut funding for these people who do unbelievable work on all our behalf. I ask that he not cut funding which will inhibit their success. </p>
          <p eId="para_702"> Home care services have also been raised today. Wexford is not on the community intervention team, CIT, services and badly needs to be placed on this. It is virtually everywhere else in the country except Wexford and we need it, particularly because our GPs are overwhelmed. The community intervention team provides services, enhancing overall primary care, providing access to nursing and home care supports from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. seven days a week, but the service does not operate in Wexford so its GPs cannot refer people to it. Once again, home care hours cannot be provided unless someone dies. I am ashamed to say that in this day and age. How can we establish eligibility criteria that are not based on need when others cannot be provided the service unless someone dies? I understand the Minister is new in the job but he addressed these issues down through the years in opposition. I ask that he continue to do so now.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> Finally, I commend all the front-line workers in Wexford, including those outside of the public health system, public health nurses, home care workers and everybody who provided services throughout the Covid crisis and who continue to do so. I hope the Minister will fight to ensure the promised increase in their salaries is honoured when the time comes.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterFitzpatrick" eId="spk_250">
          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_704">I welcome the opportunity to take part in today's debate. Access to healthcare should not be based on ability to pay but on medical needs and requirements. Undoubtedly there is a two-tier health system in Ireland. I welcome the Government's commitment to Sláintecare and look forward to seeing it implemented during this Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> The Bill's proposals include the framework for the further phased expansion of GP care without charges for all children ages 12 years and under on a three-phased basis, and an increase to gross income limits for medical card applicants over 70 years. Phase 1 will bring children aged eight years and under into a free care system.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">Phase 2 will bring those aged ten and under into the system and phase 3 will bring those aged 12 and under into the system. While I fully support this move, I do not understand why it is to be done on a phased basis. This is not fair on parents or on their children who urgently need medical help. In my opinion this should be introduced straight away across the board. Why do we need to phase it? This is only adding fear and worry to those parents and children who are affected. We all know that, during the Covid-19 lockdown, many people stayed away from hospitals and doctors' surgeries because of the fear of the virus. Now we have another reason for those parents and children not to attend their GP. It is estimated that more than 300,000 children will ultimately benefit from this change. We must give them the benefit now and not introduce this on a phased basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> In my constituency office in Dundalk we see situations almost daily where parents cannot avail of medical treatment simply because they cannot afford the cost of a doctor’s visit or medicine. In 2020 we cannot let a situation continue where parents of children are unable to access medical treatment. I welcome the changes that the Government are proposing today but I do not agree with the timing or phasing of these changes. We need to implement these changes straight away and not leave parents of sick children unable to access medical care because of financial reasons or fears. Families are struggling and need help. Prevention is the best cure. The Minister has the opportunity here to do something right. I ask him, please, to put all of the children into one phase.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> I support the measure to increase the threshold for medical cards, which it is stated will benefit 56,000 people. All people over 70 years of age should be automatically entitled to a medical card. The Bill before us today proposes that those aged 70 years and single will be entitled to a medical card should their income not exceed €550. This limit is currently €500. Couples aged 70 years or over whose weekly income is below €1,050 will be entitled to a medical card. This limit is currently €900 per week. As already stated, all those 70 years or over should be automatically entitled to a medical card. These people have worked a lifetime, in many cases for 50 years, and have contributed to this country in many different ways, both financially and in other ways. I remember hearing once that a country should be judged on how it treats its elderly. If we are to start putting barriers in place for access to healthcare for the elderly members of our society, then we will have much to answer for. People at this age have enough challenges in life without worrying about access to medical care. In many cases they are among some of the most vulnerable in society who, after having given a lifetime of work and commitment to the State, deserve better. If the recent events in nursing homes during the Covid-19 crisis have taught us anything, it is that we must protect those who need our help, most especially our elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> On the issue of medical cards, there are many situations where a card is cancelled and the person has to make a new application. Many people, particularly those aged 70 years or over, sometimes forget to renew a card, and when the card is cancelled, this causes great stress and anxiety. We need to look at ways of making the renewal of medical cards, especially for those aged 70 and over, more user-friendly and less stressful.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> A further point on medical cards for the over-70s is income limits. For example, a single person over 70 years of age has an income threshold of €550 per week while a couple aged 70 years or over has a threshold of €1,050 per week. This is not fair as a single person, who is more than likely a widow or widower, faces the same utility, gas, electric, coal and house insurance bills as couples, yet he or she has an income threshold half that for couples over 70. This person does not have to pay half the bills. This is simply wrong and unfair to the single person, who as I have already stated, is likely to be either a widow or widower. Having a situation of medical cards for all those aged 70 or over would eliminate this unfairness.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> It is wrong in this day and age for those over 70 to be assessed for medical cards. They should be automatically entitled to one. They have worked long and hard to be entitled at the very least to medical and healthcare in their retirement. I strongly urge the Government to reconsider its position on this and encourage it to look to introducing universal healthcare to all children and to those aged 70 years and over at the very least. While I welcome the changes being made today, they do not go far enough. Healthcare in this country must not depend on one’s financial well-being. Every citizen must be entitled to healthcare regardless of their income. We must not discriminate against any section of society and must protect it when it comes to healthcare. In spite of everything that has happened over the past four months with Covid-19, we now have a great opportunity to invest in our healthcare system and to make it available universally to all citizens. I have a habit of saying that a person's health is a person's wealth, which I strongly believe in.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> The Minister now has an opportunity to look after families, children and the elderly people who have made Ireland a great country. I wish him the best in his new position, and if he works half as hard as he did when he was spokesperson for Fianna Fáil, he will do a good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> I come from Dundalk. We have a fantastic hospital there which is a minor injuries unit, MIU. Back in 2010 it was downgraded, which should never have happened. A great number of people travel daily from the Cooley Peninsula, Omeath and Lordship and pass the Louth County Hospital but cannot use its facilities. They have to go to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, which is another fantastic hospital but which is completely overstretched. I invite the Minister to come to Dundalk to visit our Louth County Hospital and the MIU and see the front-line staff we have there. Our health system needs to be upgraded and looked after and I promise the Minister that when he comes, he will see the services we have and will see the potential we have for going further. I wish Minister the best of luck and look forward to working with him as closely as I can.</p>

          <p eId="para_715">I thank the Cathaoirleach. We are discussing children up to the age of 13 having access to GP and surgical services free of charge. I welcome this. I am sure it is greatly needed, but are we ready for it? I will share a number of conversations with the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> I have a lady in my constituency who has two children who have a complex need and have received cancellations for blood tests in the hospital with no explanations given. The children are on strong medication that requires regular blood tests, and they have not been tested since January. </p>
          <p eId="para_717"> In another case, children who need immediate physiotherapy have been told that the senior physiotherapist, who I am reliably told is the best in Ireland, is working in the Covid-19 swabbing centre in Limerick since March. We have at our fingertips many competent and qualified people who could do this swabbing testing, yet children who need physiotherapy are suffering and one of the best physiotherapists in Ireland is tied up doing swab testing. Who oversees the staff allocations in the centres?</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> I have also been told that some physiotherapists were so concerned about their patients, particularly children, that they got in contact with them by Zoom with parental control. The HSE then told them to cancel the Zoom calls because they were in breach of the GDPR. These are children in desperate situations and, with parental control, the physiotherapists wanted to help, but common sense did not prevail here and they were told that they had to cease making the Zoom calls.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> Children’s surgeries are way behind. Taking the example of where there were once six operations a day, there are now only three. I understand the restrictions around Covid-19 but this is not the reason. It is, it seems, because there are no operating theatres open.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">A parent was looking for a senior management nurse in a well-known hospital. When she was found, she said that she was trying to find an office in the hospital for the consultant to meet the parents. Where is the management? What is going on? Does anyone care about the children and their needs? Another constituent's child is awaiting surgery and it was left for so long that it became a serious operation. This could have been dealt with at an earlier stage and it would have stopped this serious operation from happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> We have qualified staff in our hospitals and front-line workers around the country who are being put into Covid centres to do testing. We also have a list of competent people in the medical profession who came back from abroad looking for work and are being told that no work is available. We could simply remove the people from Covid screening who are needed badly by these children and hire the competent people to do the Covid testing in the interim. This is common sense. Children and parents are suffering because we are not using a common sense approach. I ask the Minister to intervene and help these children and people. I welcome Deputy Donnelly as a Minister because I know he is a good, hard-working person and I believe he will listen to everybody who needs help. These people need his help. I also ask him to look at the management of some hospitals. Many hospitals are run well but in a minority there is a problem in management. I need the Minister's help to sort this out.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelHealyRae" eId="spk_253">
          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_722">I want to address medical cards and the change in legislation about the amount of money allowable. That should be changed as soon as possible because the delay in getting that through is stopping people from qualifying for medical cards currently. I thank the people who work in the medical card processing unit most sincerely. There are many times when urgent cases need to have medical cards processed quickly and I want the Minister, if he has a chance today, to thank those people who work in the medical card processing unit. I believe they give us all a great service. We try to work together on behalf of our constituents.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> Since it would be remiss of me not to do so today, and I said it in the first hour that Deputy Donnelly was Minister for Health, I raise the case of Ronan Foley from Dungeel in Killorglin. He has a 90° curve in his spine. I acknowledge that the Minister is working diligently on his case but I want him to keep working diligently and to stand up here some day and be able to say that he is glad that he is the Minister who ensured that Ronan's operation is performed as soon as is humanly possible. I hate singling out a case on the record of the Dáil like this but I am doing so with the family's full permission because all they want is to get that operation done. I know the Minister is entirely committed to doing that. I am not fighting with him but thanking him.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> Another terribly important issue is the question of why in the name of God we should have people who are in pain waiting to have hip and knee operations or cataracts removed. At the same time, I and others can organise trips to the North and get the State to pay for those operations. It is wrong. We should not have to do that. I am ashamed that that service has to be organised by politicians. I would like Deputy Donnelly to be the Minister who stands up here one day and says that people will no longer have to go to the North to get a cataract removed or to get a hip operation carried out in the North because they are in such pain here. I would like for that to happen in the Minister's term. Will he work to make sure that happens?</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> If we can pay to have it done in the North under the cross-border directive, why can we not get it here? We have excellent operating theatres and surgeons and the capability to do it here. Why can we not organise it? It does not make sense that on a Sunday morning, I can have a team of surgeons that will go into hospital in Belfast and operate on cataracts for as many as 20 people, while if one were to ask for that to be done here, we would be told that it cannot be done. Why can it not? It is like having a digger for hire. It can work as well on a Sunday as on a Monday or a Saturday. It will work as well at 12 o'clock at night as at 12 o'clock in the day. I know there are safety concerns about an operating theatre in a hospital, but things can work safely at odd hours too. If there is a backlog of people waiting, it is like having a crowd waiting for sandwiches, where one would then have a crowd making the sandwiches, not just one person. It is the same thing when it comes to health. We have a crowd of people looking for healthcare and for hip and knee operations. They are in pain and they are waiting.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> I want to be able to stand here and say "Fair dues to Stephen Donnelly, he was the man who came into health, worked with other people, and made sure that we provided the service that we should provide." Enough money is being put into health. Nobody can argue with the amount of money. The staff, managers, people working in catering, nurses and everyone else are excellent. I have told the Minister before, though he has not been doing it, not to praise the people working in our healthcare service but to pay them. Pay the nurses the money owed to them. A payment agreement was in place that has not been honoured. I ask the Minister please to honour it and pay them. The people working in catering sections have not got an increase in 13 years. That is a long time and the cost of living has gone up a lot. I ask the Minister to pay those people. Do not praise them, pay them. That will be Deputy Donnelly's motto as the Minister for Health. We have much work to do with health and many things to get on with. We need to make sure that people who need medical cards urgently get them. When people are over 70, whatever about the little bit of money that they might or might not have, for God's sake give them a medical card because they deserve it. We should treat them with respect for the work that they have done while living here all their lives.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_727">Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis na hAirí, an Teachta Donnelly agus leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Butler. I wish them well and offer to work with them on behalf of our group because, my goodness, there is some work to be done in the HSE. I praise the staff who have always worked hard, especially with Covid. This will have a significant impact on our health service. It was bad enough as it was. The impact on people waiting for cervical smear tests, breast checks, bowel screening or whatever it is is substantial since those have all been put back. Procedures for children requiring orthodontic treatment and children with eye problems have been postponed. Deputy Michael Collins and the Healy-Raes brought busloads of people to Belfast to stop people from going blind with just a simple operation. Our medics go out with NGOs and do it in the deserts, in tents and makeshift hospitals in third world countries, yet we cannot do it at home despite the fact that almost €18 billion or €19 billion goes into the health service every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> I do not know that I welcome the extension to the ages for the medical card because it is a charade. GPs are under enormous pressure. People cannot get a GP. My own daughter got a sting on her hand the other night and there was significant swelling the day after. She tried to get a GP but the GP could not see her, so she was sent to the emergency department. Covid is one thing but we have to treat our people. I have issues with Covid. Everything is about Covid, forgetting about everything else. People get sick. A number of people will die because of neglect, not having appointments and not having checks. It is sad. I relayed some of the cases to the previous Minister relating to people with private health insurance and such. The Ministers have a hard job, including with regard to mental health and older people, but we need fundamental, radical reforms in the HSE and the Department of Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">The Northern Ireland Assembly people recognise the Sabbath more than we do down here. It is anathema to them to work on the Sabbath and yet they can do fleets of operations on a Sunday. It does not make sense that our medical theatres are closed here, south of the Border, for weekends, bank holidays and the whole shebang. During the height of Covid-19 we saw that Enfer Labs in Kildare did not get a test sent into them from 12 o'clock on the Friday of a bank holiday weekend in June to Tuesday morning. They just stopped. Every Christmas, without fail, we see a disaster in January because holidays are taken, places close, people go off and the whole system is shut down. There are front-line nurses and doctors, and attendants and management, who run the hospitals during those times, but the vast majority of people take their holidays. It should be run like a business.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> All of this carry-on with extending the free medical cards to the under-12s is useless because one cannot get a GP or get in. Then there is the poor woman in her madness inside paying €60, if she can get in, but if the GP surgery is overrun, then those people are pushed out of the way. We need to have a fundamental re-examination of this. I believe that every patient should pay something towards a medical card and a prescription. We brought them in some years ago and now there are charges on so many items, it is too much and too high. There needs to be some kind of re-evaluation in that regard. The GPs are under enormous pressure and they can only do so much.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> I brought the previous Minister for Health down, and I invite the current Minister for Health down, to Cloonmanagh in the vale of honey, some day perhaps during the holidays, to visit the Mary Street Medical Centre to see the wonderful scanning equipment they have. They could do ultrasound scans. The then Minister, Deputy Harris, came down. That centre applied for a contract to do this because a person can be waiting six or seven months in the hospital. The Mary Street Medical Centre could do the scan there and connect it on to University Hospital Limerick. The scans could be read by professionals and it would take those people away from accident and emergency departments. It is simple. After I raised this issue in the Dáil day in and day out, and after numerous high-level meetings, including with the Minister, we got a 14-day contract, which is probably the shortest contract ever issued by the HSE. It was then pulled after eight days because there was no funding. Such stopgap measures can provide expertise through the private practices and could be used to help the situation. That has to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> Will the Minister please indicate when we are going to stop the Covid-19 spending? I received a reply to a parliamentary question last week and the spending is just mind-boggling and frightening. Money is being thrown at this, that and the other. This will all have to be paid back. I ask the Minister for Health to put on the brakes and have accountability there.</p>

        <speech by="#DannyHealyRae" eId="spk_255">
          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_733">I am glad to get the opportunity to talk on this important topic. As I have said before, if we are to be relevant at all, we must seek to do our best for vulnerable people, young and old. I will start with the old. Home help hours have been left very short of funding in Kerry. It seems to be a battle to get half an hour or an extra quarter of an hour for older people. I am aware of one 83 year old woman whose home help application was shot down recently. She had been asked if she can get out of bed by herself and the poor woman was honest when she said she could but that there were a lot of other things she could not do. Her application for home help was shot down. Home carers have been totally forgotten about. I know of one man who has been minding his sister for the past 17 or 18 years. It is 24-7 care, for which he gets €219. He is rightfully complaining that he cannot stir or go anywhere. He is doing a massive job in minding his sister. No other person could or would do it. This man does not even know if he is putting up stamps for the contributory pension. He just does not know.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> I turn now to the issue of nursing homes, which I have raised before. I am very concerned that family members still cannot go into nursing homes without savage restrictions. They can barely get as far as the door or must talk through the window. This is not satisfactory. I am aware of one case where an elderly man of 90 went to see his wife in the district hospital. He had to talk to his wife in through the window. This is not good enough. There must be some way it could be done better. These older people will only confide their needs with family members. This must be addressed. We have seen what happened in the case up the country of the poor man who was neglected and died with maggots in him. The fair deal scheme has to change in the way it is brought forward. The family farm cannot be assessed; yes, the residential house but not the family farm.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> I cite the case of Ronan Foley, who is still in pain, and all the other people in pain who are waiting for cancer treatment or who have bowel problems or need hip replacements. We still have to take people up to Belfast for cataract procedures. One woman was told recently that she would be waiting four years to get her cataracts removed in Cork. This is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> I must say to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, that I believe he is going to lose the battle with Covid-19, given what he has done in opening up travel. Should the Minister jeopardise children's chances of going back to school in September, he will pay a very high price. It does not make sense to me that people are allowed out on foreign travel to green list countries. What about the people they will meet there who have come from other places that have a strong showing of the virus? If they meet up, then people can bring back the virus here. Consider the poor man who wants to have a pint in his local village. He will never stir because it is said he is going to be the cause of increasing the virus and would cause us to lose control of it. I believe the Government has lost control with what it has done. I hope I am wrong. I believe the Government has lost considering what it has done to allow this foreign travel. The Government is beholden to the airlines and the likes of Michael O'Leary. We appreciate them in other ways but not for putting pressure on to open up the foreign travel when we are not cleared here.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> I put it to the Minister for Health that people have been waiting here for months for their procedures and it looks as though they will be waiting longer. The Minister must do something about that. The previous speaker said that operations could be done on Sundays as well as on weekdays. The Minister must remember that people get sick on Fridays and on Saturdays and then they must wait until Monday for consultants to come in. That day is gone. The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, must see that it is gone. People cannot organise when they will be sick. It is not fair to do this to them. Many of them are lying there in pain while such-and-such a consultant will not be in until Monday morning or maybe Monday evening. It is not good enough. The Minister must deal with that. They can do it in the North of Ireland and we can see them doing it on Sunday mornings and Sunday evenings. They are working around the clock and making use of the gear they have to ensure people are seen. The Minister will have to ensure this happens down here in the Twenty-six Counties.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_256">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_738">The Minister would have had a hard job ahead of him even without what has happened internationally with the pandemic, which has caused a catastrophe in our health services and across the world. This is mainly because of decades of not mismanagement but an ideological move away from public healthcare and removing money and resources from it while moving towards the private health sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> Today we are looking at a Bill that deals with two aspects of budget 2020 proposals as agreed. These are that the Government is to extend free GP care to children under the age of eight and to provide free dental care to children under the age of six. This was to be brought in by September 2020. Is that free dental care for children under the age of six included or when will it be brought in?</p>
          <p eId="para_740">The budget also proposed to increase the medical card weekly income limit for a single person over 70 by €50 to €550 and by €150 for a couple to €1,050 from July 2020. The prescription charge for medical card holders was to be reduced by 50 cent, bringing the charge to €1.50 per item for those under the age of 70 and to €1 per item for people over the age of 70. This was to be introduced by this month. I have had several people on to me who found this change was not brought in by their pharmacies and they were charged at the current rate. The pharmacists in these cases claimed they were not instructed to make the change. When will this happen?</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> The budget proposed the monthly threshold for the drugs payment scheme would be reduced from €124 to €114 to be brought in by September 2020. Will it still be brought in then? The number of home care hours in 2020 is to increase by 1 million. We were all critical of that figure when it was announced, including the Minister, because it only brings the hours back to where they were before they were cut. How many hours will be provided to meet that increase?</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> The HSE will review and extend arrangements for the provision of the discretionary medical card to those with a terminal illness. Where is that at now? That is a big issue and we have had to deal with several cases of people who were turned down for a medical card when they were terminally ill. What extended arrangements are being put in place for the provision of discretionary medical cards?</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> The budget proposed that, to reduce patient waiting times, funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, would be increased by €25 million to €100 million. In principle I do not agree with the NTPF because we are transferring public money to private hospitals when we should be bolstering our public hospitals to deal with these cases. I understand people will use the NTPF because they have been waiting for so long for treatment. It makes a joke, however, of trying to implement Sláintecare. It is the same with the cross-Border health directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> Many of us, including the Minister, were on the Sláintecare committee. Much time and energy went into that and its proposals were put out three years ago. Deputy Shortall raised the point that free universal GP access was to be brought in by 2025. That is only in two years' time and we are only at this point. A criticism of the previous Government's implementation of Sláintecare was that it was doing so in parts. I raised with the Business Committee before Covid restrictions came in that we should have a review of the Sláintecare programme because matters have moved on so much. We should get the Trinity College Dublin experts in to explain why such-and-such has not happened and how do we move it on. It does not have to be a six-month or eight-month review, just a short one.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> GPs will be asked to take on 300,000 extra children, which is quite a big cohort. I accept they will not be all walking through the door on the same day but it is a big ask. We cannot get definite figures of how many GPs are operating in the country. There are different figures from the Medical Council of Ireland and the Irish College of General Practitioners. A comprehensive register of GPs has to be set up. The previous Minister found it difficult to get the GPs' contract in place. That will be crucial. GPs should be salaried to take the private aspect out of their work and push them into primary care centres. Some 2,498 GPs signed up as family doctors, up seven since the start of 2019, a minuscule increase. There are not enough GPs on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> At the Sláintecare committee several years ago, we were told 666 GPs were due to reach retirement age and 27% of GPs were over 60. We have not seen a targeted campaign to get more people into GP training. That is urgent. We should be promoting GP services, informing doctors that they will get a reasonable salary. I have put in many parliamentary questions on this over the years on finding out GP numbers in training and the increases are not dramatic. Many who come out of training go abroad, which is another issue. Can we think outside the box in this regard? As we are in such a crisis, can we say to students that the State will pay for their training but on the condition that they stay in the country for at least ten years after graduation to pay the State back? Can we point out to them that they will get valuable experience with experts, work in a primary care unit and so forth?</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> I had many contacts from people saying they were breathing a sigh of relief that they could get their hair cut, yet people cannot access vital health services to save lives. I know this is difficult. During Covid, I was amazed at how health service workers working together were able to move mountains. They were able to set up a hospital to deal with a surge which did not happen, thankfully. Those are the people who can tell the Minister and HSE management what needs to be done. The "Prime Time" programme last night highlighted the need for hospitals. We need to prepare for a possible second surge of Covid. We need to be able to expand Covid services again if needed. How, in the meantime, can we utilise our hospitals properly for day-to-day services and surgeries? If we do not do it and get a second Covid wave, it will be another six months that people will not have the services they need. That is not something we want to contemplate.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_257">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_748">I welcome the Minister and the Minister of State to their roles and wish them all the best. The Minister has probably the most difficult job and Department in the Government. He knew that before he took the job, however. It is his own fault whatever happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> In all seriousness, it is a job that could have huge potential and give huge rewards. It can definitely have huge rewards for the citizens, which is most important. If it is tackled in the right way, it can be hugely significant. I hope that is what the Minister intends to do. Unfortunately, past Governments have shown they did not intend to do that, focusing instead on budgets and money. If that is the way the Minister sets out his stall on it now, unfortunately we will lose.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> I welcome the Bill and its criteria will be welcomed by every Member. I do not believe anybody will oppose it. I do not believe it has gone far enough, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">That is hardly surprising to the Minister, but it is the case. As Deputy Joan Collins mentioned, what the Covid crisis has shown is that we can achieve things so long as we stop talking about and strangling ourselves with budgets straight away. The budget for the health service is not enough. It must be increased. There is a great deal of rubbish talked about doing more for less and so on. That is a load of crap. The bottom line is that more funding needs to be invested. It will cost more for 15 or 20 years initially until we have dealt with the waiting lists and other problems, but it will then start to save money and grow cheaper as time goes on. That timeframe is outside of what any politician will spend here or as a Minister. Perhaps that is why nothing ever happens and there is no change. That is a problem, but recent months have shown that the issue can be dealt with and changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> We cannot permit a recurrence of the problems of the past. For example, beds were closed in the 1980s and early 2000s. That pattern cannot continue. If it does, there will still be a crisis in ten years' time and those of us who are still in the Dáil then will be discussing the same issues. We must consider this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> Deputy Joan Collins touched on an issue that I believe can be sorted easily, that being, ensuring that cancer patients get medical cards as a right. The Health Act 1970 sets out that medical cards are awarded based on income, not medical need. My office in Killybegs is regularly attended by cancer patients who are over the income limit and consequently cannot get medical cards. Unfortunately, they must go through the process of income assessment and so on before their medical conditions are considered. That is the problem, and it dates back to the 1970 Act. No Government has been willing to address the Act. To do so would be to open up the criteria for making cards available. However, it must be addressed. Will the Minister ensure that it is? It would make a significant difference in many people's lives. I talk to cancer patients whose diagnoses have not been accepted as conferring an entitlement to a medical card. It is wrong that people still have to go through that. They have the stress of having cancer and, on top of that, the stress of not knowing whether they will be able to access medical services.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> I will pay tribute to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service. The Bills Digest it has prepared for this legislation is useful and has put words to many of my thoughts on the health service. It references what the World Health Organization, WHO, says about our health services: Ireland uses income, age and health status to determine eligibility for publicly financed health services; this unusually complex approach has led to notable gaps in coverage and inequalities in access to essential health services; Ireland is the only country in western Europe that does not offer universal access to primary care; and it also has a large market for private health insurance, which mainly benefits richer people. This sets out in a nutshell the problem with our health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> If we base access to services on people's incomes, it will cause problems. If we base it on private medical insurance, which is essentially for wealthier people, they will get access over and above what others get. How often do we as Deputies hear about someone who has been waiting for a CAT scan or something along those lines being told that there is a two-year HSE waiting list but that he or she could get it the next week if he or she paid for it? That is the reality. If a procedure can be paid for and done next week, then it can be done next week for a medical card patient as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> These are the issues that the Minister must address. I hope he will do so. Unfortunately, history is not on his side. Perhaps we will see changes - I hope we do. If we do, I will support them. However, I will wait to see whether it happens.</p>

          <p eId="para_758">I will take this opportunity to wish the Minister every success in his new portfolio, which will be critical in the period ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> The legislation under debate is one of the public health measures that will make a real difference to countless families. I welcome this Bill, as it benefits both older and younger people by increasing access to free GP care. It removes what can be a significant barrier to people visiting their GPs, namely, cost. I cannot imagine the distress caused to parents who are unsure about bringing their children to the local doctor due to financial constraints.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> The Mayo constituency has approximately 40 GP surgeries serving all parts of the county. They provide an invaluable service to the public and, of most importance, that service is widely trusted by the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> I note the concerns of the Irish Medical Organisation about the additional pressure that will be placed on GPs as a result of increased access to free GP care. Has the Minister or his Department considered developing and making available to the public greater information resources about the correct services to be used when feeling unwell? I make this point because I am familiar with efforts by the NHS in the UK to increase public awareness of what services to attend if people are feeling unwell. The HSE's website has set up a health A to Z link to the website of the NHS, but I feel that the use of posters and infographics similar to those used by the NHS should be further developed and strengthened. In particular, information on what services are appropriate to attend as a result of specific symptoms should be more prominently available to the public. This would provide useful guidance on whether self-care or attending a pharmacist would be more suitable than visiting a GP or emergency department. I must be frank and say that many of my conversations with front-line healthcare workers relate to patients with minor ailments presenting in acute settings. Sometimes, the opposite happens with more serious ailments. Will the Minister ask the HSE to consider a public information campaign to help alleviate the number of people presenting to inappropriate healthcare settings?</p>

          <p eId="para_762">We will turn to the Minister to respond. I understand that he is proposing to share time with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and Deputy O'Connor. Deputy O'Connor will go first.</p>

          <from>Deputy James O'Connor<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_763">This Bill expands eligibility for GP care without charge on a phased basis and increases the gross medical card income limits for persons over 70 years of age, which I welcome. I will take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Cabinet. It is an extraordinarily difficult time for anyone working in the healthcare sector and I am sure he will excel in his portfolio. We are counting on him.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> The Bill is a welcome step towards fairer and more affordable care over the Government's lifetime. It is essential that we continue putting provisions in place to ensure that there is care in the community and that it is at the heart of our health services. Making the vast majority of healthcare services available in the home or close to home rather than in our hospitals is the right step forward. Having care in the community would be a major benefit to people in my constituency of Cork East. During the Covid-19 pandemic when we want to put as little pressure on our hospitals as possible, any step towards providing primary healthcare services makes more sense than ever. I hope that this is the first step on a path to developing community healthcare networks to support the expansion of services based on the need and size of local populations. Increasing the eligibility criteria under the Bill will be helpful in delivering that.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> Places like Youghal are in vital need of primary healthcare centres. It is not right that a town with a population of more than 8,000 and many more living in its catchment area - there was a population increase there of nearly 9% between 2011 and 2016, which was far above the national average of 3.8% - still does not have access to primary healthcare services.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">Short-term emergency measures will be important until such time as the Government can put in place strategies to address the shortfalls in places such as my home town of Youghal. An issue that came up repeatedly during the general election campaign was the lack of access to healthcare services for many new residents living in east Cork. There is enormous pressure on the Government to try address that crisis. I look forward to working with the Minister on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> In recent times there has been a great deal of fear among people accessing their local health services in health centres and hospitals because of the pandemic. It is an understandable fear. It is important that we put in place alternative arrangements for such individuals, for example, telemedicine, by means of which they will be able to have access to medical professionals. We need to look to provide additional services that complement our healthcare services. The World Health Organization defines telemedicine as the delivery of healthcare services, where distance is a critical factor, by all healthcare professionals using information and communication technologies for the exchange of valid information for diagnosis, treatment and the prevention of disease and injuries, research and evaluation and for the continued education of healthcare providers, all in the interest of advancing the health of individuals for their communities. There is huge potential for the application of this across our healthcare service. It would go a long way to ensuring that citizens of this country have access to the medical services they need. In terms of the pandemic, it will dramatically increase the accessibility and safety of care and reduce the use of individual protection equipment and allow doctors under quarantine to continue to work if in a position to do so by expanding the available human resources to our health services. It could also be used as a training tool to ensure that our medical students continue to have access to medical education during the pandemic. Looking to the future, there are advantages in terms of reduced travel costs for the patient and an increase in accessibility for individuals with mobility difficulties and the potential for the globalisation of medicine with patients being able to obtain expert opinions at great distance quickly via virtual means, which is encouraging.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> Across east Cork there is a huge level of research and development ongoing and there is currently much talent and potential. Telemedicine assists in the sharing of this expertise and ensures that it gets to people that are most in need of it. There are some obstacles in regard to telemedicine in the future, such as data privacy and confidentiality, but it would be unwise of this House to not explore such complementary forms of medical provision, especially considering the Covid pandemic in which we currently find ourselves. Affordability is a vital issue when it comes to healthcare provision. I recognise the good work that is being done by way of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> As already stated, we need to look at areas such as east Cork, which I represent, where there are problem areas for people in accessing healthcare services, as well as the issue of affordability. I wish the Minister all the best and I look forward to working with him.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryButler" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_262">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Mary Butler)<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_770">This is my first time speaking since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people. I thank the Taoiseach for the opportunity afforded to me. I congratulate the Minister on his appointment. He and I have worked closely over the past two and a half years and we are continuing that relationship. We are well aware of the many challenges facing us.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, I take this opportunity to warmly welcome the Bill, which provides a very welcome measure for older people in our society. Expanding eligibility for medical cards to this cohort is an important initiative in ensuring better health and active ageing for our older persons. It is my key priority to support older persons to live independently in their homes and communities for as long as possible. This can be made possible only by putting in place real and effective policies that enable older people to access high-quality care close to home, where feasible, to help prevent unnecessary admission to hospital. The correct wraparound supports are essential to enable older people to live at home safely and securely among their families and communities. This will be a key focus for me. This measure, which provides for a welcome increase in the gross income limits for medical card eligibility for persons aged 70 or older, is a key enabler in that regard. It will increase the number of people who can access a wide range of services in the community at no or very low cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> I support the Minister's sincere acknowledgement of the sacrifices made by older persons in our society in response to Covid-19. Earlier today, on behalf of the Minister, I attended the funeral of Dr. Syed Waqqar Ali who lost his life due to Covid-19 while working at the Mater Hospital. He provided selfless emergency care in the accident and emergency department. Unfortunately, he succumbed to Covid and spent 92 days in ICU but, sadly, he lost his battle two days ago. To his wife, his three sons, his two daughters and his extended family I offer my sincerest condolences. This puts into sharp focus the seriousness of Covid-19. Anybody who is in any doubt about that need only look to the absolute grief, hurt and upset it has caused Dr. Syed Waqqar Ali's family. The Minister and I salute him for the work he did. He saved so many lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> Accessing mental health supports will be key to enabling older persons to look after their mental health. Thus, public mental health services will now be more affordable and accessible for a greater proportion of older people as they become eligible for a medical card. As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, I will work hard to support older persons and ensure better health and active ageing for older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> GPs are at the heart of health service delivery in the community and are the gateway to accessing necessary health services. I am, therefore, pleased that the second measure provided for in this Bill is the further phased expansion of free GP care to children of primary school age. I acknowledge the impact of Covid-19 on the mental health of schoolgoing children. I note a recent survey carried out by St. Patrick's mental health services found that 70% of parents are concerned about the impact of Covid-19 on children's mental health. Expanding access to free GP care for children of primary school age will, therefore, be important as GPs will play a pivotal role in terms of identifying mental health issues at an early age and signposting children and their parents to access the most appropriate mental health services in their communities first and foremost. As we all know, early intervention is key.</p>

        <speech by="#StephenDonnelly" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_263">
          <from>Minister for Health (Deputy Stephen Donnelly)<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_775">I thank all of the Deputies for their contributions, many of which were thoughtful and detailed in terms of the specific legislation before us and the two measures it contains. There has been a wider constructive debate around healthcare as well. It is a conversation we need to keep going. I have taken pages of notes. We will find more opportunities for continuing that conversation, including the scheduled statement and question-and-answer session in the House tomorrow on Covid-19. I acknowledge that a lot of work, thought and effort went into Deputies' contributions. I also acknowledge the spirit of solidarity and constructive debate on health. We all disagree with each other on any number of issues. It is part of our job to debate and push and challenge each other's ideas. In healthcare, there has been a lot of solidarity this year with the onset of Covid. I acknowledge that while Deputies will, of course, undoubtedly be holding me to account and pushing me, the Minister of State and the Government hard on various issues, as is right and proper, there is a genuine sense across the House that we are all bought into a single vision, which is Sláintecare, and we are all bought into the fact that we fight and act together on Covid on behalf of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> It might be of use to the Deputies who contributed and to the wider House to point out the three main points of focus that the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler and Feighan, the Department and I are considering. The first is Covid-19 and doing everything we can to protect the country, not only from a health perspective but from a social, mental health and economic perspective. Inevitably, we will get some things wrong and some things right, but there has been a great sense of solidarity. I was talking to a senior figure in the WHO last week and he was highly complimentary of Ireland's response to Covid, notwithstanding that it has not all been perfect. He said that when international experts look around the world, one area where they have said Ireland stands out, and one of the reasons they believe the prevalence rate here is so low, is that the political co-operation has been very impressive and has made it possible for things to happen that in other countries have not happened. They see political parties and politicians in other countries getting into destructive and self-serving debate. The man I was talking to said that one aspect that has marked Ireland out is that while there is, of course, political debate and political challenge, there is a great sense that we are in this together and are trying to find solutions together. I have heard that during this debate and I thank my fellow Deputies for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> The two measures we are bringing forward will benefit the young and people who are older than 70 years old. They will ensure that, irrespective of ability to pay, all children of primary school age will be able to access a GP service without charge when required. This will enable childhood illness to be identified and managed early, which will have a positive impact on children's futures. It is not everything. It is not that all services will be free for everybody; that takes time, money, resources and capacity. Nevertheless, the measures in the Bill will make GP care free for 300,000 additional children. That is something we should be proud of as an Oireachtas because the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will be asking Members of this House for the money to do that. It is a profoundly important step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> The increase in medical card limits will support older people to manage their health needs and will build on the benefit already provided by the GP visit card, which every person over the age of 70 automatically qualifies for. This will ensure they can access a wide range of healthcare services at no cost or low cost to help them achieve healthy ageing. I have gone through the figures with the Department. While the SWITCH model and other models have different estimates as to how many people over the age of 70 this will help, of those who do not have the medical card, it is a lot, while everyone over the age of 70 will already have qualified for the GP visit card. The increase in the threshold is only 10%, or from €500 to €550 for a single person, but the percentage of people over the age of 70 who currently do not have a medical card and will now get one is well in excess of that. It will be of great benefit, therefore, to many people. Most Deputies will have been contacted by people over the age of 70 who are waiting for this to happen, so I am very glad to bring it forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> If the first big task we have is Covid, the second is the resumption of services, winter planning and ensuring we have a comprehensive plan in place that goes beyond anything that has been seen before because the Covid world means we must succeed as the winter approaches.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> The third part is Sláintecare. The Bill is the first item of health legislation we have brought before the Oireachtas and it is not accidental that it concerns Sláintecare. It is a core building block of Sláintecare and I hope the House sees it as a serious statement of intent to progress universal healthcare, which is the core mission of the programme for Government and probably of most of us in the House. We will deliver it through Sláintecare and the very good work that is being done in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> I thank Deputies again for their contributions and for their stated support for the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_784">No. If the Deputy might resume his seat, I will explain. This item of business was ordered to be taken over a three-hour period. I am not responsible for co-ordinating the speakers. There are Whips in all the various groups whose job it is to co-ordinate that, to provide lists of speakers and to ensure that Deputies are here on time. When I came to the Chamber, members of the Rural Independent Group were completing their contributions. The Independent Group made a contribution, as did Deputy Dillon, after which the Minister began the process of wrapping up. Once the Minister has begun to wrap up, nobody else can speak. They are the simple rules of the House, which are available to every Deputy, old or new, through the Whips.</p>

We are passing the Bill today and, as the Minister noted, we have all been contacted by constituents who are watching what is happening. They want to know when this will happen, so the Minister might respond to that.

          <p eId="para_789">This is my first opportunity to wish the Minister and the Minister of State the very best in their new roles. I look forward to working with both of them in this very difficult but important area.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue of amendments that will provide for the expansion of GP care without charge on a phased basis to children of primary school age and that will seek to increase limits for medical card assessment for people aged 70 or over. These are important issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">The medical card issue is very important, as it has been for the past number of years. There have been many difficulties arising from people not qualifying and just being over the limit. People who were very ill lost the chance of getting a medical card. In fairness, I must give credit to the medical card section of the Department, whose staff have been very helpful. Criteria are set and staff must work within them.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> There is a massive problem at Bantry General Hospital and I hope the Minister takes that on board. An endoscopy unit was promised to the people but it has not been delivered. An anaesthetist position also needs to be filled. It is very important. There are 80,000 young people who will come under the scheme being discussed today who must be looked after. Bantry is rural but we need Bantry General Hospital to be able to deliver services. The staff have done their best but there is a need for an anaesthetist.</p>

          <p eId="para_796">That people over 70 will have a better chance of getting a medical card is very important but we must also look at other areas where those over 70 are suffering quite a bit. For example, people in west Cork are seeking cataract procedures and we have taken over 50 bus trips to Belfast because our older people are suffering. They cannot get a cataract procedure in Cork or Kerry. Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I have taken more than 1,500 people to Belfast to take advantage of the cross-border healthcare directive. Although such action is welcome, it should not have to happen. The people who served their people well have not been looked after well themselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_813">Section 2 concerns the income limits for those over 70 who apply for the medical card. I will use this opportunity to respond to Deputy Cullinane and the other Deputies who have, understandably, asked questions about timing. It is a question many people are asking. I will answer a similar question on GP eligibility when we get to that section, seeing as we are strictly adhering to sections and what is in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> This relates to people over 70. This criterion was in the last budget to be implemented this year, as were various other eligibility criteria that various Deputies have raised. The problem is that the eligibility criteria being implemented for this year were contingent on quite significant savings in the health budget. As everyone will appreciate, none of those savings has materialised because of Covid-19 and instead I was before the House two weeks ago asking for an additional €2 billion. I will be back before the House again asking for an additional amount of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> The measure was to come, essentially, from within the existing budget but as I am sure everybody understands, that is not now possible. However, the Government, along with tonight's contributors, recognises this is something that will make a major difference to many people. With this in mind, I will seek a discussion within the Government to see if a way can be found. It is not budgeted for and would require additional funding. It will require agreement of the Government and, ultimately, it would require the agreement of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> I recognise that this is an important measure, which is why it was in the budget and why we are bringing this forward as the first Bill of this Dáil. I would like to be able to revert to the House as soon as possible with progress on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_817">I thank the Minister for his clarification but I am very surprised and disappointed. We all accept we are in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic but I spoke earlier in the debate about money being wasted. People in nursing homes are telling me they cannot deal with the amount of personal protective equipment that is being dumped at their doors. I received a response to a parliamentary question from the Minister last week indicating that millions of euro is being spent on this. It seems there is no shortage of money but there are no tenders or appropriation procedures. We know we are going through an emergency but I asked the Minister earlier to call a halt to the waste. He is now telling us the budget probably will not allow the measure we are discussing.</p>

          <p eId="para_819">I thought the Minister said he would have to come before the House again. I appreciate he has already sought an extra €2 billion. I thought the Minister said he would have to return to the House to seek approval for the budget and that he would fight as part of the Government to find the money to deal with this cohort of people over 70. They have paid their service to the State, with many working for 50 years, paying stamps, PRSI, etc. We thought they got a bit of breathing space in the budget with the change in criteria. The Minister might correct me if I am wrong but I understood from his comments that he does not know if he can do this and it will depend on financial circumstances and his lobbying of the Government. I would be very disappointed if that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> Please rein in some of the spending that goes on every day. The money being thrown at every institution in my county and around the country is mind-boggling. Is there any accountability? Is there any need for such excess, unless we get a massive second wave? I am not saying the need was not there in the initial panic. We supported that spending but it needs to be stopped. Stall the horses now and pull the reins. Stop the mindless spending. It is crazy and there is no accountability. The Minister might clarify if I understood him correctly.</p>

          <p eId="para_821">Going back to the point made by the Minister regarding the timeline, I referenced Mr. Tony McCarthy earlier. He is a cancer sufferer and his wife is seriously ill. He is her carer. When they were assessed, they did not qualify for the medical card. All cancer patients should have medical cards. This new Bill would mean Tony and his wife would get a medical card. We spoke today about the difference it would make to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">I understand that there are serious financial implications ahead for the Government. I want to support the Minister. Where we can, Sinn Féin will work with the Government, especially on health because it is so important, but Tony, his wife and all the other people need timelines as soon as possible. I will write to the Minister to ask if he will consider those cases on compassionate grounds if those timelines are not going to emerge soon enough. We want to support this Bill but we need its measures as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_823">All Opposition parties supported the speedy passage of this legislation because there was an expectancy that its provisions would be implemented very quickly. When the Minister took to his feet to respond to the Second Stage contributions, and in one of his first replies on Committee Stage, he stated that this was the first step from his perspective in implementing Sláintecare and referred to himself and others being contacted by those over the age of 70 and others who want this matter resolved. There was a clear expectancy on the part of those people because when we were being contacted by them, we were telling them that the Bill was coming before the Dail and that we expected that matters would be resolved when it was passed. That does not seem to be the case, however. It is important that those people who were promised that this would be done - and the Minister said that this was a budgetary provision also - are given some certainty and timeframes. In light of the spirit in which the Opposition has approached this, in the context of Covid-19 and taking all Stages in one session, it is important that we get as much information as possible so that we are in a position to communicate with people as to when the legislation will come into effect. If I was asked when I leave this Chamber when this provision will come into effect and when someone will benefit from it, I would have to reply that I do not have the answer. It is incumbent on the Minister to give us that answer. If he cannot provide a definite timeframe, it would be important for him to at least give us an estimate in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_824">I congratulate the Minister on being appointed to his post. I look forward to working with him in a constructive manner over his period in government. I want to refer to timelines also. It was mentioned that any extension of the criteria for eligibility for a medical card for children and older people is very welcome. However, we need a clear and definitive timeline as to when that expansion will be delivered. We are living in uncertain times. People need certainty now. Covid-19 has shown the failures of the health system. I take this opportunity to commend the front-line health workers for all the work they have done and the service they have given to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> We must remove any obstacles in healthcare that hinder people in the context of getting treatment when they need it and where they need it. I support the Bill but I do not believe it goes far enough. It is a start, as the Minister said, but I ask that a clear and definitive timeline for its implementation be given. Otherwise, it will not be worth the paper on which it is written.</p>

          <p eId="para_827">I agree with the Deputies. We are looking to put this together as quickly as possible. What I wanted to clarify for the House is the factual position. This measure was contingent upon savings. Those savings have not materialised. As we all know, the opposite is the case and the healthcare system is looking for significantly more cash to deal with the Covid pandemic. For the information of the House, what I am saying is that we are strongly supportive of this measure. It is the reason it is the first legislative measure we have brought forward. We fully understand how important it is for people over the age of 70. I am simply making the point that there is a process that has to be gone through. There is additional money that has to be agreed. That is a decision for Government. I will get as detailed a timeline as possible for the Deputies as quickly as I can do so. I fully understand and agree with the questions they have asked. I, too, am endeavouring to have the same questions answered.</p>

          <p eId="para_828">This section deals with increasing the age from six to eight. I referred to it on Second Stage, and it is a response that I would like to hear from the Minister also. Notwithstanding the timeframes, I am concerned about the response he just gave. I understand that there is a process but I expected that process would have been well under way before he brought the Bill before the House because expectations have now been raised. The quicker that he can expedite that process and come back with timeframes the better because it is important but the issue in rolling all of this out, including the provisions for those children aged eight, ten, 13 and people over 70, is that we need to expand capacity in GP provision in this State. One of the challenges we face in convincing GPs that this should be rolled out is that they tell us there are not enough GPs. We can pass whatever Bills we want and say that any number of provisions should be implemented. I want universal GP access for everybody and I want it done over a five-year period, but I also recognise that to do that we need more GPs working directly for the HSE. Does the Minister envisage a challenge in these provisions being implemented given that we have already a dire shortage of GPs? In some parts of the country, people cannot access GP services. They have to travel some distance because the GPs nearest to them are overburdened and cannot take on the workload. When he was in opposition, the Minister was one of those who raised that issue many times. What was absent from his Second Stage response was the issue of GP capacity. What additional GP capacity, in addition to the funding that needs to come to provide for this, does the Minister envisage will be put in place to ensure that this section, the previous sections and the next sections of the Bill can be practically delivered by GPs throughout the State?</p>

          <p eId="para_829">I welcome the fact that up to 300,000 children may benefit from this change but, again, I have a concern that we may be putting the cart before the horse in not addressing the other issues and trying to repair the other cracks in our health service. I am aware, for instance, that an agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation on contractual reform, which was concluded last year, was supposed to increase investment in general practice by approximately 40% or €210 million by 2023. I would like to know exactly how much of that expected increase has been delivered. Are we still on track to have a €210 million increase by 2023? Has the figure of €210 million been revised downwards and, if so, by how much? This is vitally important because if those increases do not materialise we will be expecting GPs to deliver a rapidly increasing level of service with a rapidly decreasing level of funding. We need to know where we stand on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> In my constituency of Laois-Offaly we have seen the out-of-hours Midoc service in Birr, which is a town with a growing population, close down because there were not enough GPs to service it.

          <p eId="para_831">I would like to add my voice to what Deputy Cullinane has said regarding the lack of capacity in terms of GP services. While we welcome the changes that are being brought in regarding eligibility and extending the children's eligibility for medical cards, it is vital that we will be able to deliver upon that. We have a bad history in the context of offering primary care services. As a result of that, we have put added pressure on acute hospitals, which has been seen recently during the pandemic. Since 2008, a primary care centre has been promised for Dundalk. This centre would also offer disability services, mental health services, dietary advice and a swathe of other services.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">I call on the Government to begin works like that as soon as possible. Again, this is the sort of necessary work with a definite health impact that we would like to see carried out as part of the July stimulus.</p>

          <p eId="para_833">I welcome this section. I note that there are more than 15,000 children below the age of 12 in Cork city. We welcome this aspect of the Bill. However, in my own area the dental clinic on Harrington Square and the Cope Foundation in Montenotte were recently closed down. Those closures have had a direct impact on 16 primary schools. Parents must now bring their children further afield to get the care they need. We welcome this section, but when children's health is considered, the whole situation must be taken into account. I hope the Minister will take that on board.</p>

          <p eId="para_834">I thank the Deputies for the questions. They are exactly the right questions. I made my position on this very clear in the past; general practice does not have enough capacity. The contract was signed more than 40 years ago and a new one is urgently needed. Some very good work was done to augment the existing contract, including moves towards the management of chronic disease in the community. That was done in consultation with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, and general practitioners. It was a very useful step in the right direction, but it does not take away from the fact that we need a GP contract that is fit for purpose as part of modern universal healthcare. That contract must significantly increase resources for general practice and must increase the role of general practitioners in the community in line with Sláintecare. Sláintecare essentially calls for all possible care to be provided within the community, in or near patients' homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> I fully agree that we need more GPs. We do not have enough. I fully agree that more needs to be done to make the profession more attractive. That must include maternity cover, increases to the rural allowance and other measures, many of which have already been outlined in Sláintecare. The 2019 agreement sets out significant increases in practice implementation. My understanding is that it is on track, as is the increase in funding. We also need to work with the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, to increase the number of available training places. We are engaging with that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> The debate now concerns the next three sections, which essentially concern the expansion of GP care to various age groups. We are meeting with the IMO to address exactly these questions. I do not want to prejudge the conversation but as Deputies know, my previously expressed opinion is that we do not have sufficient capacity. Simply expanding entitlement without expanding capacity does not work. There are no winners with that approach. As such, we are asking the House to pass this Bill so that we have the legislative framework which to date has not been in place. It is hoped it will be passed by this House this evening and by the Seanad tomorrow. Once the legislative framework is in place, we can immediately begin to discuss these capacity constraints with the IMO so they are tackled in a phased manner. That is why this has been structured in three phases. Immediately expanding free GP access from children under six to children under 12 would not be wise from a capacity perspective for the very reasons the Deputies have outlined. That is why we are taking a phased approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> I fully agree with the sentiment expressed by the Deputies. We need to expand resourcing, training, GP numbers and the support available to GPs. We need to introduce a new GP contract at the same time so the reforms are joined up. We also need to be very aware of just how crucial the role of GPs will be this winter. We will need to tease out the additional demands on GP services with the IMO. GPs really stepped up when Covid-19 hit. They went to an awful lot of effort to keep people out of hospitals. Services like e-prescribing were introduced overnight. That was not possible before.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> Regarding winter planning, I note that resuming services and getting through the winter with Covid-19 will require GPs to continue to step up and work as part of an integrated system. This is the joined-up view outlined by Sláintecare. We must keep patients out of hospitals. That will mean working with GPs to find different care referral pathways. That is the approach we will take.</p>

          <p eId="para_839">I thank the Minister for his response. I do not doubt his sincerity for one second or the wisdom of what he has said about taking a phased approach to ensure we have the necessary capacity. However, people listening will be concerned when they hear phrases like "phasing in", "consultation" and "engagement". They will fear that this will take an awfully long time to happen. In his last remarks the Minister referred to the extraordinary job GPs have done in recent months at the front line of Covid-19. I have spoken to many of them. They have undergone sleepless nights, long shifts and huge stresses brought about by all the changes to the testing regime. GPs are under huge pressure. In light of the coming winter surge, the need to roll out flu vaccination, Covid-19 and all of the existing demands on GPs, are we seriously saying this will be done any time soon?</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> Deputy Donnelly is a new Minister, so some of this is the responsibility of the previous Government. A previous speaker asked if we were putting the cart before the horse. We want this done as quickly as possible. I pointed out the fact that the Minister made these points when he was in opposition. The Government is introducing this legislation, making promises and talking about delivery when we all know that the infrastructure simply is not there. GPs are overstretched and overworked and we do not have enough of them, but the Government is saying it will increase their workload but not their capacity. Generous words butter no parsnips for those GPs. This will not solve their problems. I wish the Minister well in his discussions with the IMO but I imagine those discussions will centre on the need for capacity and how the Minister will deliver it. The Minister tells us about plans, timeframes and ambitions. One can have all the vision in the world, but unless we put the actual capacity in place, this is not going to happen any time soon. That is the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> We will have more statements on health tomorrow, as the Minister knows. I may follow up on this issue in that session. I am concerned. We are being asked to pass this Bill in good faith. It has been brought forward because a promise was made, but it cannot just be a promise. This must mean something for the people who will be affected. I spoke about the 300,000 children and the tens of thousands of people over 70 who we hoped would be affected by this. We are now told that there is a new process to determine timeframes for delivery, but the Government has not added the necessary capacity to primary and GP care to make it happen. We are told that there will be a phased approach. I imagine people are saying to themselves that this is more fudge. They will not believe that this will happen any time soon, and it is hard to disagree with that. It is disappointing, given that this was the first Bill the Minister has brought forward. I do not blame the Minister because he has only been in the job for a couple of weeks. The responsibility must be put on the previous Government, which did not put the infrastructure in place before the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure that when we pass this Bill, we will have the capacity to deliver it.</p>

          <p eId="para_842">Deputy Cullinane and I are in danger of vigorously agreeing with each other. I agree with him. He says that we propose to increase the workload without increasing capacity. We do not. I am saying the opposite of that. That is the reason for the phased approach. There are several steps to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">We in this House need to create the legal framework for it, and that is what we are doing tonight. Once we do that, we can sit down with the Irish Medical Organisation, representing general practice, and say that this is the will of the Oireachtas and the Government and we are only going to do it in line with capacity, and we can ask the representatives how it can be done. We want to listen to general practice and my hope is that the GPs listening to this debate will be glad to hear that. I hope they are glad to hear words and phrases like "consultation", "phased approach" and "doing it in line with capacity". As the Deputy correctly says - we are really in agreement here - there is no point, particularly in a Covid world, in increasing workload without putting in place the capacity. We have to do this in a collaborative way, in engagement with general practice, and that is what we want to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> The Deputy asked if we are putting the cart before the horse, to which I would say that maybe we are. Perhaps we could have had those conversations first and then come into the House and looked to get the legislation passed, or maybe we say, "Let us get the legislation through so that we can crack on with the implementation." I am not hung up on which way it is done. We have chosen to bring in the legislation as quickly as we can in this Dáil term to ensure there are no legislative impediments and that we have a framework to engage with general practice and to be able to say it will be done in three phases and let us talk about what GPs need and about the timing.

          <p eId="para_845">We know the Bill is not going to commence any time soon. We want to work with the Minister in delivering all of this. The point I was making earlier around putting more capacity into GP services is that even when we get to the point where we can implement these provisions, I am not convinced the capacity will be there. At a time when we are trying to deliver Sláintecare, increase GP access and convince people that this actually can be done - many people are sceptical that we can deliver universal healthcare given that we do not have the capacity in primary care and we do not have enough GPs, and they are concerned about whether the political will is there to do it - it is really regrettable that we are now talking about going off and engaging in consultation. The point I am making is not that we should engage but that the engagement should have been commenced already and we should have had that work done before the Bill was brought forward. That is the point about putting the cart before the horse, which others have raised. The Government is saying we will set the legislative stage, get the Bill passed and God knows when we will be actually able to deliver the provisions in it. If we are saying that delivery is contingent on having increased capacity, but that increased capacity is not in place quickly enough, then people will ask those in this House who passed this Bill when they are going to see the colour of our money. That is unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> This is the first Bill the Minister has introduced since his appointment. I said in my opening remarks that I wish him well. We want to work with him to get things done. One of the first things we have to do as a new Dáil and as health spokespersons, and which the Minister must do as the new Minister for Health, is to convince people that change in healthcare provision can happen, we are serious about it and that when we say we will deliver universal healthcare and better GP services, we will actually do it. Covid or no Covid, we must commit to that and get it done.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_87">That Dáil Éireann:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_88">notes that:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_89">— over 1,400 workers in Debenhams Ireland faced mass lay-offs when the United Kingdom parent company announced it would no longer support the Irish subsidiary in April of this year;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_90">— the company has not negotiated with the workers’ representatives since and that liquidators have been appointed;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_91">— the workers have a collective agreement with Debenhams that guarantees an enhanced redundancy payment package of two weeks statutory plus two weeks;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_92">— initially workers were informed that the company had liabilities of around €19 million, but this estimate has since been revised upwards to around €225 million;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_93">— Debenhams Ireland had entered an arrangement as co-guarantor of a major debt facility of around £200 million utilised by the UK parent company in 2019;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_94">— the Bank of Ireland is part of the consortium that includes Barclays bank and two United States-based hedge funds that triggered this process and this consortium are now effectively the owners of Debenhams UK; and</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_95">— workers are fearful that the insolvency of their company has all the hallmarks of a tactical insolvency which will leave them as creditors with nothing other than statutory entitlements;</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_96">further notes that:</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_97">— five years ago, Clerys department store closed and its workers were made redundant with no notification by their company;</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_99">— the subsequent ‘Expert Examination and Review of Laws on the Protection of Employee Interests when assets are separated from the operating entity (Duffy-Cahill report)’ made several suggestions for legislative reform to ensure workers would not be abandoned in any subsequent closure or liquidation process; and</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_117">— immediately initiate negotiations with representatives of the Bank of Ireland to ensure the workers receive the full collective redundancy package previously agreed with the Debenhams company.</summary>

            <p eId="para_1278">I thank the Minister for attending today. I want to speak about an urgent, developing situation at Keelbeg Pier in Union Hall in my constituency. Union Hall is a picturesque, beautiful village between Skibbereen and Clonakilty. Keelbeg Pier is the local pier in Union Hall. It would help if I described the pier because I do not expect that the Minister would have been there before, but hopefully he may visit in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1279">On the issue with the pier, Cork County Council is the foremost authority there and is, essentially, shoehorning the installation of a barrier that gives access onto the pier. This barrier will prove disastrous for residents and for most of the pier users in Union Hall.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280"> I shall describe the pier. It is a fantastic facility. It mainly facilitates the fishing community in Union Hall and it is a very important aspect of the activity happening in Union Hall. There is a very vibrant fishing community there. The pier also facilitates many leisure users. The local rowing club uses the slipway, which is also used by the RNLI and other users. There is a beach too. The pier is a fantastic facility. To the west end of the pier is the slipway and to the east end of the pier is the access to the beach used by local residents and by holidaymakers to Union Hall. It is a very popular holiday destination. I hope this gives an outline of how the pier works and the very important facility and amenity it is.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281"> Here is the problem, however. With the installation of the barrier, the people most impacted will be the residents. Adjacent to the pier is a public road. Fronting on to that public road is a row of residential houses. The big issue is that the front doors of these residential houses come straight onto the road. There is not even a footpath between the front doors of the houses and the road. Essentially, these people must cross a road to use a footpath. By installing the barrier on Union Hall pier the local authority will be creating a funnel effect whereby traffic that wishes to access the local beach, which is very popular, will be funnelled one way. Currently the beach users or pier users can use both accesses, which is a one-way system. They can also use parking on the pier and this is a very important issue to remember. If installed, this barrier will create an absolute logjam. This is a cul-de-sac where people will be making efforts to turn. It will create mayhem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282"> There is huge political opposition to the installation of this barrier. The residents are very concerned. Cork County Council, the local authority, says the barrier installation is required from a health and safety point of view. Council staff did visit the pier and they have come up with an alternative solution that suits all, including residents, leisure users and so on. I ask the Minister to trust me that if this barrier is installed it will create an even bigger health and safety nightmare. I am asking for the Minister to reach out to the local authority. I am aware that it is the local authority's remit but the funding for this barrier is under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Minister's Department. I ask that the Minister would reach out to the local authority to ask them at least to pause the installation of the barrier until residents and all stakeholders have been liaised with.</p>

            <p eId="para_1283">I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for raising this matter and for his contact over the past days. As the Deputy has said, the pier in Union Hall is owned by Cork County Council and responsibility for its operation, maintenance and development lies with Cork County Council and its parent Department, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I have, therefore, no direct remit in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284"> As part of our annual fishery, harbour and coastal infrastructure development programme my Department provides limited funding to assist coastal local authorities in carrying out small-scale projects for the development and repair of piers, harbours and slipways in their ownership. Funding of €3.1 million was approved for the local authority element of my Department's 2020 fishery, harbour and coastal infrastructure development programme. Cork County Council secured €394,500 for 13 projects under this year's programme. As Deputy O'Sullivan said, one of those projects under the programme was safety improvement works at Union Hall pier. One of the safety measures proposed by Cork County Council involved the installation of a physical barrier at the pier. The council has said the barrier is required to highlight to the public they are entering a working pier and in the council's view there is currently no means of controlling access to the working pier in times of emergencies or during high risk conditions. The application complied with the terms and conditions of my Department's local authority scheme and it was deemed eligible for funding. Any queries in relation to the barrier are a matter for Cork County Council. I do know, however, from the Deputy's contact, that alternative proposals have been laid and I will certainly inquire from Cork County Council as to why it is not possible to proceed with those alternatives. I will revert to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1285">I am asking the Minister for a bit of compromise and a bit of consultation. I appreciate that it is a Cork County Council pier, but as I stated, it is the Minister's Department's funding. I ask that at the very least the Minister would reach out to the council chief executive or to the western division manager, whoever it may be, to pause the works until consultation happens and we get some compromise. There are some very good viable alternatives that would separate the commercial aspect of the pier, which we understand needs to happen, and would also allow for use of the leisure aspect, most importantly the slipway. The residents who are most impacted are the important factor. I am not sure how much time I have left to speak as the clock is not there. Have I got one minute left?</p>

            <p eId="para_1287">While I am on the subject of piers I will take the opportunity to raise the issue of Dinish pier, which is also in my constituency in Castletownbere. The Minister will be very familiar with it given that fishing is in the Minister's remit. A €20 million extension is under way at the Dinish wharf to allow for larger hauls of fish and so on. It will be a significant improvement but there are fears about the works, including that they may have been paused and that the contractor has not been seen on the site in a while, from what information I have. Will the Minister clarify that? There are smaller contractors there who are concerned that the works have been stopped. They are worried about the future and whether they will have a position when that pier is extended. The most urgent question is whether the extension will proceed.</p>

I met with the various fish processors and fishermen's organisations yesterday.

            <p eId="para_1293">I raise the urgent need for a primary care centre for Finglas. As the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, may be aware, there has been a promise for a number of years to put in place a primary care centre for Finglas, which is also a top priority for the HSE. Some years ago, a previous application for a site for the centre failed. The location that has now been chosen and agreed is on a site of the former Church of the Annunciation in Finglas west. I have real concerns, and many in the community I represent share them, that the overspend on the children's hospital along with the challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic will have an impact on the building of the new primary care centre and that the primary care centre long promised for the people of Finglas and its surrounds may be subject to delays or funding issues. There is more need than ever for a primary care centre in Finglas because of the current lack of medical facilities serving north Finglas and west Finglas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">Finglas is an area neglected for many years and badly served when it comes to health service provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295"> The primary care centres in Ballymun, Cabra and Corduff have proved to be a great asset to the communities in these areas. They have provided their communities with wonderful medical facilities on their doorstep which are non-existent in the areas of Finglas I mentioned. The population of Finglas is increasing and it has a higher percentage of older people than the national average, making the provision of a primary care centre all the more important. It beggars belief that there has not been a single GP in north or west Finglas for more than 20 years. It is, therefore, no surprise that Finglas has been identified as an area of high priority and that has a considerable need for the benefits brought by a primary care centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296"> In addition, a primary care centre in Finglas will take the pressure off local hospitals, such as St. James’s Hospital, Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown and the Mater hospital, in dealing with minor injuries and in the provision of social care services, including mental health services. Other primary care centres, such as the one in Ballymun, have developed invaluable links with local acute hospitals, making it easier for GPs to care for patients at weekends and in the evenings. I envisage the primary care centre in Finglas developing similar links and having similar tangible benefits for the provision of medical services and to the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1297"> However, the communities in Finglas need to be reassured that this project will go ahead and will not face delays. They also need to be reassured that whatever funding is required for the completion of the primary care centre will be made available. Will the Minister of State give me and the community a commitment that this will proceed and that there will be no obstacles to this commitment which was made many years ago? The people of Finglas need this primary care centre. Other primary care centres were built even though our application went in well in advance of any of them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1298">On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, I thank Deputy Ellis for raising the important issue of the provision of a primary care centre in Finglas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1299"> The development of primary care is central to the Government’s objective to deliver a high quality, integrated and cost-effective healthcare system. This involves a move away from the older hospital-centred model to focus on the delivery of care in the community and at home.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300"> Finglas has been identified as a high priority location for the development of a primary care centre. Approval for a HSE direct-build primary care centre was given in 2012 in the context of the HSE’s multi-annual capital plan. Following the review of several sites in the area, the HSE identified a Dublin City Council-owned property on Mellowes Road, Finglas, as the preferred site for the construction of the proposed new Finglas primary care centre. Subject to planning permission, the commercial terms for its sale were agreed with the officials of Dublin City Council and approved by the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1301"> As the Deputy will be aware, the award of planning permission by Dublin City Council was appealed to An Bord Pleanála. Its inspector also recommended the granting of planning permission, upholding the Dublin City Council decision, but in February 2015 An Bord Pleanála took the unexpected decision not to grant planning permission for the Finglas primary care centre due to the loss of informal open space.</p>
            <p eId="para_1302"> Following refusal by An Bord Pleanála, HSE estates, in conjunction with local primary care services teams, reviewed several alternative sites for a new primary care centre in Finglas. An alternative site was identified and discussions with Dublin City Council on purchasing the site were initiated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303"> In recent months, the HSE has been tasked with the delivery of additional capacity - infrastructure and equipment - nationwide in the effort to contain and prevent the spread of Covid-19. Discussions with Dublin City Council on the proposed primary care centre were delayed due to this work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304"> However, these discussions have been recently reconvened in an effort to conclude the site purchase from Dublin City Council on terms agreeable to both parties. Feasibility studies on the site are still progressing. The HSE will be tendering for the services of a design team to progress the proposed project to completion in the near future, subject to an agreeable conclusion to the site's purchase. Finglas south and west remain a priority for the Department and the HSE. It is one of the communities most in need of access to primary care services.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1305">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I am disappointed, however, that we have not been given any timescale. The site has been identified and a deal has been on the table with Dublin City Council, which bought the land from the church. It is ready to go. I was concerned Covid was one of the reasons for the delay. However, we need to advance this. There is no point in continuing the way we are. People in the community have mental health issues, small injuries and need to access a dentist but we have not even had a GP service in that area for the past 20 years. It is a shame that with the large population of this community we have not even got that service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1306"> Obviously, the site is subject to planning. I am hopeful it will prove to be a prime site for a primary care centre. There are many plans for the site including a senior citizens centre, a new church, a Tusla office along with other community facilities. We need definite dates now, however. It is a greenfield site and can be built on without delay. We really need to push this forward. It has been too long in the pipeline and is badly needed by the people. North Finglas has one of the largest populations of older people. We need health facilities for the elderly such as physios, as well as facilities for young people. I am asking that this project be pushed ahead as quickly as possible and pressure put on the HSE to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_1307">I thank Deputy Ellis for raising this issue. As he knows, the development of a primary care centre is a key building block in enabling the vision of Sláintecare and is required to meet growing demands for health and social care services. The Deputy said the centre in question is subject to planning permission and there are many hurdles to be got over yet.</p>
            <p eId="para_1308"> The construction programme for primary care centres will continue through the National Development Plan 2018-2027. The HSE had been successful in developing a network of primary care centres across the country. I have seen at first-hand how important and successful they are. There are now 132 primary care centres operational across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309"> Work will now refocus on this programme following the HSE's work in response to Covid-19. After Covid-19, issues regarding mental health are arising. Now more than ever, it is important we get these primary care centres up and running as a priority. In line with national requirements of appraisal, design, planning, tender and construction, this programme will continue into the future, including the development of a primary care centre in Finglas.</p>

            <p eId="para_1310">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise this important issue which relates to traffic management in north Kildare, in particular in the towns of Naas, Celbridge, Maynooth and Leixlip. The populations of these towns have grown tremendously over the past several years and are still growing. In all the towns concerned, there are large industrial estates which generate a significant amount of traffic. The net result of all of this is that it is necessary to plan ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1311">The previous Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, initiated the plan for Maynooth, which has been advanced considerably and is ready to go to contract. It is important that progress should not only continue apace, it should accelerate in order that the circle be completed. The ring road must be completed in order to siphon the traffic off onto the bypass and leave more space for people to walk, cycle and, where necessary, drive within the circle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1312"> There is a problem in the Celbridge case. The local authority has already tabled and put on display proposals. A video simulation of the proposed plans was also shown. I do not agree with them and they need to be examined as a matter of urgency. During the course of the video, the simulation showed a truck crossing over a car, which was not a great advertisement for the proposal. This issue needs to be looked at in a different light with a view to a different proposal, which is readily available and for which there is space. There would be a road and bridge realignment, an extra bridge would be required and an upstream bridge would be required. Let the traffic from the town centre move out without being impeded, thereby siphoning off the through traffic.</p>
            <p eId="para_1313"> Regarding Naas, one part of the ring road to the north and west has been provided successfully. The remaining section is needed. The local authority made a proposal in that regard in the past 12 months, but it was not agreed by the council members, leaving a considerable amount of confusion and dissatisfaction among some residents. Obviously, they will be the ones affected. The inner relief road was to be provided first, but local people feel that the outer relief road is required first. I am of the view that whatever is the right thing to do should be done and that the outer relief road is the right proposal and should be proceeded with. This situation should be examined as a matter of urgency by the relevant Department with a view to ensuring that whatever is done will be in the best interests of the people who live and work there and who will be affected by these traffic volumes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1314"> It is a tribute to all of the towns concerned, the public representatives and the local authorities that the towns have progressed so well that they have become victims of their own success. Long may that continue, but it means that we must design plans so that the current generation can enjoy amenities that are rightly available in many other places and are especially needed in these towns.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Hildegarde Naughton)<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1315">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I wish to explain that, once funding arrangements have been put in place through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, the planning, design and construction of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Overall, TII is responsible for the delivery of the national roads programme in accordance with Project Ireland 2040 and the national development plan, NDP. In that context, TII provides the Department with regular updates on its delivery of the national roads programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1316"> Within the timeframe given in the lead up to this debate, the following is the most up-to-date information available to me. Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the NDP was developed to underpin the successful implementation of the national planning framework, which provides the strategic and financial framework for the national roads programme for the period 2018 to 2027. The focus of TII's activities in the coming years is accordingly being directed towards the development of the major national road improvement schemes included in the NDP along with the maintenance of the existing national road network.</p>
            <p eId="para_1317"> While it is not clear what specific road project the Deputy is referring to - I will refer to Celbridge at the end - the inner and outer relief roads for Maynooth, Leixlip and Naas in County Kildare are not included among those projects that have been identified for development in the area during the period of the NDP. The M4 and M7 roads already bypass the Maynooth, Leixlip and Naas urban areas. It should be noted that, consistent with the programme for Government, a review of the NDP is proposed, taking account of the Government's priorities set out in the programme. I also wish to take this opportunity to highlight that all projects, including those listed in the NDP or any proposed revision to the plan, require statutory approval and compliance with the public spending code.</p>
            <p eId="para_1318"> I will highlight the following projects that are being progressed and completed for the Kildare region. I understand from TII that work is under way on the M4 Maynooth to Leixlip transportation corridor. Technical advisers were appointed in December 2019 and are working on early stage appraisal and option considerations for the scheme. In parallel, Kildare County Council is progressing a feasibility study on the possibility of advancing a bus corridor on this section of the national route, which will be considered as part of the overall solution. I understand from TII that €1 million has been allocated to the Kildare national roads office, which is working on behalf of Kildare and South Dublin county councils, to progress and complete this study.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319"> Once funding has been assigned to TII, individual payments to local authorities are a matter for TII. It may be contacted directly for further details on this matter. In addition, a brief was developed by Kildare County Council to examine the feasibility of short-term bus priority measures on this route. I understand that there is ongoing co-ordination with the National Transport Authority, NTA, on the public transportation initiatives associated with the delivery of this project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1320"> The M7 Naas-Newbridge bypass upgrade scheme is substantially complete. It involves the widening of the M7 motorway from a two-lane into a three-lane carriageway in each direction. It also includes the removal of the existing on-off access ramps at junction 10 at Naas south and the construction of a new interchange immediately south of the existing junction 10. Some final finishing works and snagging of defects arising from the road safety audit are ongoing. The road was opened to traffic in August 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_1321"> Regarding Celbridge, my understanding is that there is no national road planned there and that it is probably a local or regional roads issue. I will revert to my officials and provide the Deputy with an update on the matter. I will work with him on it.</p>

            <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2020-07-23T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1322">I thank the Minister of State for her reply. In the Maynooth case, funding came from the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. In the other cases, an overall traffic assessment needs to be done again to ensure that the necessity that was identified some years ago is addressed in the shortest possible time. The traffic in Celbridge in particular is serious. It is because there are not enough ingress and egress points in the town. Even if there were no through traffic, roads relief would be needed in any event.</p>
            <p eId="para_1323"> The case of Naas is simple. Work is already in hand. The same situation applies in most towns in north Kildare, including Kilcock and so forth. For example, work is already in hand on the Sallins bypass. These towns are in the pressure area in terms of industrial development and housing. There are more than 20,000 people in each of the main towns. Maynooth is a growing university town and, with the number of students included, its population is heading towards 17,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1324"> The situation requires an update and an assurance that the proposals are progressed as soon as possible and corrected where necessary. It is important that we try to ensure that this vital infrastructure is put in place at the earliest possible date as opposed to waiting until half a generation has passed, which used to be the situation previously. I am not suggesting that it is currently, but it is necessary that we keep a watchful eye on progress to ensure that it is done and this issue is taken up as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <p eId="para_1325">I will explain how national roads projects are identified for development. The NDP identifies two categories of national road improvements. The first includes projects to advance to construction, subject to satisfactory outcomes of the project appraisal and development consent approval processes. The second includes projects at pre-appraisal and early planning stages that are being assessed with a view to developing a pipeline of suitable projects for development. Specific inner and outer relief roads in Maynooth, Leixlip and Naas are not currently within the scope of the NDP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1326">I would also like to explain the approvals requirement associated with national roads projects generally. In line with the requirement of the public spending code and the Department's capital appraisal framework for transport projects and programmes and also planning approvals, two sets of approvals are required in regard to any proposed schemes: approval of the business case and cost-benefit analysis for the project and approval by An Bord Pleanála of an application for development consent. The necessity to meet the requirements of the public spending code and planning consent from An Bord Pleanála, along with an adequate capital budget, are critical to delivering any national road project. All projects under the national development plan or any proposed projects outside of the scope of the national development plan will require all of the approvals that I have outlined. This will also include Government approval in cases where projects are estimated to be above €100 million. The M4 Maynooth to Leixlip transportation corridor is at a very early stage of development and it is not, therefore, possible at this time to indicate the timeframe for the construction of the project, if it is deemed feasible to proceed. However, as I have just outlined, any timeframe is dependent on obtaining the necessary consents at various critical stages, including at the route selection, detailed design and tender stages. Typically, schemes of this size can take of the order of eight to 13 years to advance from the initial proposal to completion of construction.</p>

            <p eId="para_1327">Last week, I raised several issues regarding State borrowing by the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, in circumstances where there are governance questions to be answered. Since then, I have done as the independent chairman of the FAI asked in his late night statement of last week, and checked my facts and find not only that I must stand over my comments but that other serious governance issues and questions arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1328"> On the question of the independent chairman's authority to sign the memorandum of understanding, MOU, my understanding is that the first the board saw of the MOU was a draft sent on the morning it was signed. Despite emails from directors expressing concerns about its terms no board meeting was held to consider or approve the MOU before the independent chairman went ahead and signed it that afternoon. At a later date, despite the expressed reservations of a number of the board members the board approved the document. They had little choice but to do so as it had already been signed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1329"> The second question I raised is the assertion by the independent chairman of the FAI that the required "expressed sanction" under Article 3.8 of the FAI constitution was given by the council for the State borrowings by the FAI. My question is how can the chairman make this claim when, as I understand it, his own board has not received let alone approved any terms and conditions or other legal agreement from the State for these loans. Bizarrely, my understanding is that board members are unaware of any legally binding loan agreement with the State, even now, for the FAI borrowings. The MOU expressly stated that it is not a legally binding document. It seems the State has lent and the FAI has borrowed significant funds already on the strength of no legally binding contract. Perhaps the independent chairman has signed a legally binding loan agreement with the State and intends to seek his board's approval at a later date, as he did with the MOU. If he did, I am sure they will be hearing from him. I am led to understand that the board has approved no legal contract, as required by the MOU. How can the independent chairman claim express sanction from the FAI council for a legally binding State loan agreement that either does not exist or, if it does, has not been shown or explained to or approved by his own board, let alone the council members? He points to a resolution of the council which was approved by council on 16 March last by email as evidence of authority to borrow these State funds on behalf of the association. There was no reference whatsoever in the formal notice of, agenda for or resolution in which he refers the meeting to State borrowings. They all refer exclusively to the Bank of Ireland borrowings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330"> The day before the meeting, due to the Covid crisis, council members were asked to consent to the vote happening by email. The formal request from the interim chief executive office, CEO, of the FAI to council members sets out, with complete clarity, what the council was being asked to vote on. It was sent to all council members and copied to the independent chairman and each board member. In it, the interim CEO says:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1331">Tomorrow's meeting has been called solely to approve the re-financing proposals with Bank of Ireland. There are no other items on the agenda for the council meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">It also says: "In order to proceed on that basis, we require a majority of you to consent to approving the re-financing proposal with Bank of Ireland via email." The council members then consented to authorising Bank of Ireland refinancing being approved by email. There was no mention of borrowings from the State whatsoever and so no consent to voting on it. The council sanction required is an expressed sanction. According to <i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i> this means formal permission for something that is clearly and intentionally stated. There is no wording in the resolution passed which gives any sanction for the State borrowings. Not only is there no amount, no repayment date, no interest rate and no other terms outlined, there is no reference at all to borrowings from the State. How could there be if the FAI board has not approved them? The independent chairman claims to have a resolution, as if by magic, formal permission for something that is clearly and intentionally stated. The independent chairman's proposition is clearly a ridiculous one. The email vote was sanctioned only on the basis that it was for the Bank of Ireland refinancing, nothing more.</p>

            <p eId="para_1333">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Further to the comprehensive statement provided by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, last Thursday on the memorandum of understanding with the FAI, I am pleased to provide additional information in response to the Deputy's query.</p>
            <p eId="para_1334"> At its meeting on 30 January the Government authorised the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross, to enter an agreement with the FAI to provide additional funding support to the association to address its grave financial crisis. This additional funding would be conditional on the FAI implementing reforms to its corporate governance and financial controls on an agreed timeframe. The MOU signed on 30 January by the then Minister, Shane Ross, and the chairperson of the FAI, Mr. Roy Barrett, enables Sport Ireland to restore funding to the FAI of €2.9 million per annum and to provide additional annual funding of €2.9 million for football development up to 2023. It also provides for a repayable grant of just over €7.6 million to the FAI to pay its licence fee for the Aviva Stadium up to 2022.</p>
            <p eId="para_1335"> The MOU sets out broadly the terms upon which funding support can be provided and is to be underpinned by a series of relevant documents which will set out in detail the terms under which funding will be provided. It was agreed that in line with the established grant for sporting bodies, Sport Ireland would oversee the disbursement of funding to the FAI and would enter relevant legal agreements with the association in this regard. In April, a memorandum of agreement was entered into between Sport Ireland, the FAI and New Stadium DAC, the company which operates the Aviva Stadium, for the disbursement of the FAI's licence fee to New Stadium DAC. The agreement outlines that a recoupable grant will be paid in instalments totalling €2,544,600 annually by Sport Ireland directly to New Stadium DAC on behalf of the FAI in each of the years 2020 to 2022. This grant will be recoupable from the FAI from 2024. </p>
            <p eId="para_1336"> Sport Ireland is awaiting confirmation of the implementation of various reforms by the FAI before putting an agreement in place in relation to the remaining funding approved by the Government. At its most recent meeting on Friday, 17 July, the board of Sport Ireland considered the immediate steps necessary towards restoration of funding to the FAI. The board recognised and endorsed recent progress made by the FAI to improve its governance and internal control environment. The board also agreed that the relevant rule and constitutional changes committed to by the FAI are required to be implemented in line with the MOU prior to grant funding being paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1337"> As the Minister, Deputy Ryan, informed the House last week, the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Catherine Martin, and the then Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Calleary, confirmed to the FAI on 9 July that the Government would not reopen for discussion any part of the MOU agreed by the previous Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_1338">I do not wish to cast aspersions on the good name of the independent chairman of the FAI or anyone else but I am bound by my duties to the taxpayer. These are serious issues. Significant State funds are at stake and clearly the independent chairman of the FAI has significant questions to answer and so too does Sport Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1339"> The essence of the independent chairman's role is ensuring that decisions are made in a proper, open and effective way and in accordance with due process and good governance to the exercise of independence. However, the prior association of the independent chairman of the FAI to the interim executive team makes that impossible. A person cannot pretend to be independent. One is either independent or one is not. Further, the independent chairman has made no secret of his desire for the interim CEO to be put forward for a permanent role. How does that affect his independence when he is interviewing other candidates for the role as a member of the nominations committee?</p>
            <p eId="para_1340"> I respectfully suggest to the independent chairman that he is best advised to do two things: he should recheck his facts and, having done so, he should resign. The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, has confirmed to me this evening that the State has, through Sport Ireland, lent to the FAI a total of €1,386,480, paid up to date to New Stadium DAC. That has been done without the express authority of the council and without the approval of the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1341">Have legal documents been executed in respect of these loans? If so, who signed them, what express sanction was provided by the FAI board and its council to sign such documents and when? These are very serious matters of governance. We were promised a new era in the FAI and, frankly, it is appalling. People are not being told what is going on. As far as I am concerned, the State and Sport Ireland are complicit in an effective <i>coup d'état</i> where people at the top - so-called independents - are dictating what is going on without telling their own board. We have lent money, it seems, to an organisation that did not have the express sanction of its council. That is wrong.</p>
            <p eId="para_1342"> It is inconceivable, in the greatest crisis there has ever been in the history of the world since the 1918 Spanish flu, that the Secretary General of our busiest Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, seems to have spare capacity to go off and pad out his own CV for the exit strategy to the private sector and take up a position on that board. If he was working in the private sector, that would be fine, but the reality is it is a clear conflict of interest. He is not our man on the board; he is on it in a private capacity.

            <p eId="para_1345">A nominations committee was formed by the FAI to appoint independent directors to the board of the FAI in line with one of the key recommendations of the governance review group report. Sport Ireland was invited by the FAI to nominate two independent persons to the committee. Its nominees were Olive Loughnane and Peter McLoone. Amrop, a world-leading executive-search firm, was appointed as the search partner to assist with the selection of independent directors. The then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross, and his Department had no role in the nomination of the committee or the selection of the independent directors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1346"> On 8 January, the FAI announced the appointment of three independent directors to the board. Roy Barrett was appointed as the independent chairperson, Catherine Guy and Liz Joyce as independent directors, while Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was appointed by the FAI as the fourth independent director on its board on Tuesday, 21 July. That appointment was made by the FAI in accordance with the association's rule book, memorandum and articles of association. Neither the Minister who now has responsibility for sport, nor the former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, nor their Departments had any role in the appointment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1347"> The FAI announced on 4 July that its AGM has been moved to September and that an extraordinary general meeting, EGM, will take place in the near future to vote on the required changes to the FAI rule book and constitution as the association pushes on with governance reform. While the FAI has not yet announced a date for the EGM, Sport Ireland understands it is most likely to be held in the second week of August. Sport Ireland has not paid out any funding to the FAI in 2020 and no Sport Ireland funding is scheduled to be paid in advance of the FAI's EGM.</p>
