AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Today is Bloomsday. I note that Senator David Norris, a great Joycean scholar, has left the Chamber. I add my voice to that of Senator Alice-Mary Higgins on the status of the arts in Ireland, particularly with their perceived, if not real, downgrading from a Department structure perspective. There is the lack of a Minister of State with responsibility for the arts. One of the Taoiseach's nominees to this House five years ago, former Senator Fiach Mac Conghail, director of the Abbey Theatre, added greatly to the debate on the cultural importance of the arts sector to social and political life.That is also an omission. Will the Leader invite the Minister to come to the House to discuss the issue of arts funding and the importance of the arts? This is the only country in the world that has a musical instrument as its national symbol. While we often view the arts and cultural life as being somewhat of a luxury, from my work in the equality field, I know that those on the edges of society often do not have any other means of expressing the lives they lead and their trials and tribulations. The only way they can do so is through the arts.  Following on from what Senator Catherine Ardagh outlined, there is quite a level of unease and disquiet on the issue of waste charges. I heard on radio this morning that the Minister intended to meet various private sector companies next week to discuss the issue. It would be a good idea to have a calm debate on the floor of the House because when there is a vacuum, fears can be raised. As Senator Catherine Ardagh rightly said, people have fears about how they can meet bills as the situation continues.  I hope we can progress the issue of the arts and their importance to the country. I also hope we can have clarity on the issue of waste charges. To this end, we should invite the relevant Ministers to come to the House to further the debate.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I congratulate the Leas-Chathaoirleach on his elevation to his new role and congratulate the Minister on her appointment. As anybody who has run a primary school will find running a Department to be very easy, I wish the Minister the best of luck. Comments have been made in the Chamber on how, statistically, we have done much better in recent years in bringing down the unemployment rate, which obviously is to be welcomed. In that time the previous Government also managed to provide many protections for workers' rights. It not merely increased the national minimum wage twice, but I also refer to the reintroduction of the joint labour committee, JLC, system, the employment regulation orders, EROs, and collective bargaining legislation. Consequently, a threshold of decency was provided for in the economy. However, I remind the Minister of the Private Members' motion that was passed by Dáil Éireann only two weeks ago. It was in the name of the Labour Party and written by Senator Gerald Nash who did a huge amount of work in the Minister's Department in the previous Government. The motion reads:That Dáil Éireann:affirms that, as economic conditions continue to improve, it will stand up for working people and ensure that employees secure a fair share of growing national prosperity;accordingly calls for a programme of incremental increases to the national minimum wage until it is pegged at 60% of median earnings, and for a living wage of €11.50 per hour to be adopted throughout the public sector;believes that, alongside tackling low pay, we must address the root causes of insecurity at work, commit to further protections for vulnerable workers in precarious employment and bring an end to exploitative employment contracts that foster increased casualisation of workers;calls therefore on the Government to prepare and introduce a legislative package that will protect and enhance workers’ rights by:- ending the abuse of "if and when" contracts;- combating bogus self-employment;- ensuring freelance workers have the right to collectively bargain;- extending the transfer of undertakings regulations, TUPE, to workers in services such as catering and security;- protecting workers in "informal" insolvencies and collective redundancies;- providing statutory redress for the victims of workplace bullying;- promoting employment standards and the living wage in public procurement; and- preventing unilateral reductions in pay;notes in particular the University of Limerick report to the Government, Study on the Prevalence of Zero Hour Contracts among Irish Employers and their Impact on Employees, and, commissioned following the outrageous treatment of Clerys workers in June 2015, the Cahill-Duffy Expert Examination and Review of Laws on the Protection of Employee Interests When Assets are Separated from the Operating Entity; andcommends the recommendations set out in both reports and calls on the Government as an urgent priority to prepare legislation for their implementation.As the Minister is aware, the motion was passed by the Dáil, the main House of the Oireachtas. I would like to hear her comments on it because I may have misheard, but I have been led to believe she is not minded to accept the report from the University of Limerick. If that were the case, it would fly in the face of the expressed will of Dáil Éireann and what is right and just, particularly given that the Clerys workers are this week marking the first anniversary of their disgraceful treatment. I will touch on the issue of dignity of work and how work is so important for those in the vulnerable sectors of society, which is often forgotten about in the economic debate. During the turbulent time when unemployment levels crept up it was often said unemployment cost the Exchequer €27,000 for every person unemployed, including the loss of VAT receipts and welfare payments, but this completely misses the point. It is the loss of dignity and self-worth that is the major deficit caused by unemployment. There are sections of society that are not necessarily benefiting from the Action Plan for Jobs. During the Celtic tiger period more than 100,000 people were in consistent unemployment. Whatever action plan the Government comes up with and whatever efforts are made to reduce unemployment, they do not seem to permeate into every sector of society. The comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities should have been part of the Action Plan for Jobs, but during the tenure of the last Government the Department did not really want to know about the strategy which effectively was run as an equality measure within the Department of Justice and Equality. That is disappointing because if one looks at certain sectors of society such as those living in disadvantaged areas, members of the Traveller community, people with disabilities and migrants, one can see that there are particular barriers and issues that they face in gaining employment, being protected in work and ensuring their employment rights are enhanced. In the context of that comprehensive employment strategy, perhaps the Department might again look at how it can engage with and drive it and be more positive about it because when I was involved in putting it together, I felt the engagement of the Department was less than positive.  I wish the Minister well in what she is trying to do. The threshold of decency is everything. Having statistics that we can roll out and being able to say unemployment has come down are laudable and all very well, but dignity in work and the threshold of decency in the economy are everything. Workers' rights and the sense of dignity a worker has every morning in getting up and going to work are what keeps society together. I reiterate my request to the Minister that she deal in a positive manner with the Labour Party motion that was passed in the Dáil with the support of other parties two weeks ago.
