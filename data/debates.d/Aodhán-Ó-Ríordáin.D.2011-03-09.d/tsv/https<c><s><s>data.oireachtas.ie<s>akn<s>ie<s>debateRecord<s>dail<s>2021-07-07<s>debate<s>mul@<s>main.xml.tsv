AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as a bheith anseo chun éisteacht linn mar gheall ar an mBille seo. This is good legislation which the Labour Party is happy to support. We need to change the conversation around education in its totality. With that in mind, it is beyond time for us to discuss the establishment of a citizens' assembly on education. Seeing as we hope that we are now coming out of this pandemic and given that many fault lines have been exposed by that pandemic and that many power struggles in the area of education have also been identified, it is now time for us to take an entirely new look at the way in which the education system is structured. This is important if we are to put students and parents at the heart of the discussion on education. We know of the pressure that students brought to bear on the system by demanding to be heard with regard to the leaving certificate. In fairness to the Minister, this campaign was met with a listening Minister. The leaving certificate was only changed to a model based on choice because she was willing to listen and took the students' view on board and treated them with respect. Deputy Foley will not always be the Minister for Education, however. That is why we need legislation to underpin that type of understanding and engagement. When I worked in the education sphere, I was always told to look at everything from the perspective of the child or young person. It is rare enough that the child is at the centre of our debates on education. There are any amount of power brokers and power struggles between vested interests, including representative bodies, patron bodies and the Department. It is rare that the child is at the centre of everything we discuss.  I remember taking this to the extreme and, when the children had gone home, sitting in the very chairs in my classroom in which they sat to see how they viewed the education system and what it was physically like. I wanted to see how far they were from the board, the draughty window or the toilets and whether their space was encroached on by the people beside them. It was really instructive. If one physically places oneself in the place of the children, one's mind is opened to their experience. The whole point of education is not to cater for people like the Minister and me or people working within the system but for those whom we are all trying to serve, the children and young people. Having said that, if the teachers, the SNAs and the school community are not empowered, it is very difficult for them to empower the children in turn. With regard to parents and what has been said about voluntary contributions, I can only agree. The Labour Party tabled a Bill which aimed to abolish voluntary contributions because, as the National Parents Council has said, the relationship between many parents and the school system is financial or transactional. It is based on money. Far too many of the conversations parents have with schools, with teachers and with principals are about money. Parents' associations become fundraising bodies. Parents are asked if they have brought in the voluntary contribution, the book money or the swimming money. Are parents of lesser means then less or more likely to hang around the school gate? Are they less or more likely to respond to that type of communication from the school? Are they less or more likely to go to the parent-teacher meeting if they are going to be reminded about the voluntary contribution, the book money or the swimming money? In fairness to the Minister and her Department, they have begun to roll out a scheme of free schoolbooks in a number of schools throughout the State. That is to be welcomed. That is the type of relationship we want to have between parents and schools because it is fundamentally about children and young people rather than about money. In Northern Ireland, one does not pay for schoolbooks. A cultural shift happens within families if they do not have to spend late August or September worrying about the school book list, getting the money to get the books and whether the school has a book rental scheme. All that is done away with because the State has made a decision, based on values, that children should not have to pay for their schoolbooks and are just given them. The Minister has decided to roll out a pilot scheme. That is to be welcomed. We want to work with her to make sure that the families of all the children in the country do not have to put their hands in their pockets to provide schoolbooks because the relationship between too many parents and the education system is about money.  When it comes to parents' associations, what is the first thing on the agenda but the fundraiser? What is the fundraiser for? It may be to keep the lights on or to keep the school running. There is a fundamental inequality in that because there are only so many schools that can raise a certain amount. There are schools in affluent areas that can raise an awful lot more money than those in disadvantaged areas, which are almost completely dependent on the Minister's Department to pay the bills. There is an inequity in that. In Finland, such things are banned but, of course, in Finland everyone has bought into the idea of funding public services properly through a progressive taxation system. In some modern social democratic countries, people think it is appalling that fundraisers are held for schools. We need to change the mentality in Ireland. It is disgusting that schools are forced to hold fundraisers. We all buy into it, turn up and spend money on the advertisements but it is appalling that schools should need fundraisers to keep them going. Parents then feel their role is to raise money for the school rather than to have proper engagement and a proper empowering discussion about the future of the school and how they can help their children, their children's classes and the entire school community to grow together in a learning environment. It comes down to bloody money. This is progressive legislation and a move in the right direction. The Minister is facilitating the voice of students and parents and that is to be welcomed. However, within the broader discussion we hope to have through a citizens' assembly on education, it must be recognised the financial transactional relationship between parents and schools has to go. The Minister can imagine the humiliation if one does not have the money and one's child comes back from school with a voluntary contribution envelope. What does one say to one's child? It is just humiliating. Education is supposed to be the great leveller, the great enabler and the great liberator. How can one be liberated when it feels that whenever one receives a communication from the school one must be embarrassed because one is being asked for money which, because of one's circumstances, whether temporary or permanent, one just does not have?  It is just wrong but we have got it into our heads that this is what we have to do and that we have to raise funds for the local school. It is wrong and we should make a collective political decision that it is wrong. While it cannot happen immediately, we must move to a position where, culturally and politically, we will have got it into our heads that the school system will be funded to such a degree that schools will not have to hold fundraisers and can actually talk about education. Imagine what a mind-blowing experiment it would be to empower parents to talk about education rather than money. I know what it is like to be the person on the far side of the desk. I know what it is like to be the person sending out reminders about the book money or the swimming money. One would rather talk to the parents about anything other than money. Let us go back to the positive elements for a second because it is not good enough for political representatives and Oireachtas Members to come in here pretending that we have all the answers while the Minister is doing nothing, which is what a lot of political over and back is about. What has the Minister done? She has introduced this legislation. She said she would and she is doing it. What else has she done? She has ensured the student voice is at the heart of the leaving certificate process. Not only was the voice there but it was listened to. The students were saying they needed choice and the Minister delivered that, which is to her credit. She has also said that she is serious about the constitutional convention or citizens' assembly on education. Let us work towards that and have a proper discussion about the nature of funding and about where the power lies, because far too much of it lies with the patron bodies. What else has she done? She has worked with us to ensure that a pilot free books scheme will be rolled out. I believe this has been expanded from 51 schools to twice that number. We are moving towards a meeting of minds.When we pass this legislation, which we hope to table amendments to, to force the agenda around voluntary contributions and this transactional relationship, we need to move into the space of having a citizens' assembly. Government and Opposition can collectively come to a conclusion we have to move beyond the hand-in-the-pocket way of running our school system. The conversation should be about the betterment, empowerment and potential of the child and how parents, teachers and school communities can work together to achieve that. We want to work with the Minister and will do our best to enhance the Bill, but we want to see the citizens' assembly happening as soon as possible.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I want to make a general point. I cannot accept what the Minister of State has just said in regard to the amendment, namely, regardless of how justifiable it is or how it will enhance the Bill, he is just not going to accept it because he does not have the time. We have concerns about this legislation contradicting European directives, yet his stock answer to all the amendments is that he does not have the time. We were given a deadline for amendments to this legislation as being the day before the Second Stage debate. We often make this charge about things being rushed through but we have never heard a Minister or Minister of State stand in this House and say they are sorry, but they cannot take an amendment regardless of how well-intentioned it is, regardless of the fact their officials agree it might improve the Bill, or regardless of what the Attorney General says, because they just do not have the time. This is quite unprecedented, in my view.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I accept that the Minister of State's function is to try to pass a Bill he believes will do a lot of good for many companies. I accept that is the reason he is here and why he feels so strongly about the legislation. We have no problem with that. I do not think we in the Opposition have a difficulty with that. He said we need to get this done. That phrase is generally that we need to get it done and that we need to get it done right. We believe this is not compliant with EU Directive 2019/1023. While we need to protect businesses, we also need to protect workers in those businesses. Our primary function, as Deputy Catherine Murphy said, is as legislators. This sometimes surprises people, especially schoolchildren, when they ask what a Deputy's job is. They think it is about being in the media, delivering leaflets or engaging in local activity. The primary function of a Deputy is in this House, passing and, it is hoped, improving legislation. It is just not good enough to produce important legislation and then to inform Deputies that the deadline for tabling amendments is the day before Second Stage. I appreciate the Minister of State said there will be more comprehensive answers about other amendments. His very first answer is that there is no time. He is right that it is important to get this done, but as Deputy O'Reilly has quite rightly said, it is important to get it done right because rushed legislation is bad legislation in far too many cases and does not protect the people whom we are genuinely trying to help. Nobody is trying to do political theatre or to accuse the Minister of State of not coming from a good place or not having bona fides about enhancing protections in the economic whirlwind that people are going through with the pandemic. At the same time, he has to accept our job is being curtailed by what he is saying as a Minister of State.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 16, line 39, after “proceedings” where it secondly occurs to insert the following: “, other than proceedings taken by or on behalf of an employee to the Workplace Relations Commission or the Labour Court,”.The Minister of State will see what we are trying to do in the section on relevant courts powers to stay proceedings or restrain further proceedings is to ensure that those proceedings are not those taken by or on behalf of employees to the Workplace Relations Commission or the Labour Court. While we understand what the Government is trying to achieve with the Bill, with this amendment we are trying to ensure the worker always has recourse regardless of how small the business is. Again, we table these amendments in a constructive fashion because none of us wants to be in a position where people will say to us in six or 12 months' time that we passed a problematic Bill, that workers within this new system we have just legislated and voted for are not protected and how come we did not know that. The amendment addresses that and I will be interested to hear the Minister of State's response.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I noticed the word "typical". The Minister of State's reply indicates this situation is not typical but that does not mean this provision will not necessarily be needed. We want it to be explicit within this legislation that workers will still have the opportunity to take these proceedings as they see fit.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 7:In page 31, line 2, after “be” to insert “other than the employees,”.This is a very straightforward amendment which aims to include in the Bill the amended wording:Where a company is a creditor, any person who is duly authorised under the seal of that company to act generally on behalf of that company at meetings of members and creditors may fill in and sign the instrument of proxy on that company’s behalf and appoint himself or herself to be other than the employees, that company’s proxy.I await the Minister of State's response.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I was going to say that I will revisit the matter and bring forward an amendment on Report Stage but I will not be in a position to do that. I will revisit it.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 8:In page 31, lines 17 and 18, to delete “60 per cent in number representing a majority in value” and substitute “66 and two-thirds per cent in number representing 66 and two-thirds in value”.This amendment is very simple. It aims to increase what is considered to be a majority in the Bill from 60% to 66%. This is two thirds and represents the normal practice.
