AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I have two main topics. I will come to Priory Hall later, but my main question is on variable interest rates versus tracker mortgages. Last April-May the ECB reduced its interest rates, but this was not passed on to customers with variable interest rate mortgages. Then there was a 0.4% increase for AIB customers with variable rate mortgages and a 0.25% increase for those in EBS. I said in the Dáil at the time that there seemed to be a syndication between what the ECB did and what AIB did with its variable interest rate mortgages. The point has already been made that outside the distressed loans category there are quite a number of mortgage holders who are feeding their mortgages possibly before they are feeding their children. They are struggling to pay their mortgages and succeeding, but an interest rate increase could tip them over the edge and then the bank will have to deal with that issue. Every time this happens there is a conversation about passing on interest rate cuts to variable rate customers and it does not happen. The last time there was an increase. It has been suggested to me that the accumulated wisdom among the delegates is that a 5.5% interest rate for variable rate mortgage holders is the most sustainable for the bank to continue in the future and that the current rate is unsustainable. I would like to get AIB's response to this. Is what has been suggested to me wrong?Does Mr. Duffy believe rates can remain at the current level? What does he foresee happening in the future in regard to variable interest rate mortgages and how does he react to the charge that AIB is forcing variable interest rate mortgage holders to pay for tracker mortgage holders remaining as they are?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Has Mr. Byrne calculated within that the damage an interest rate increase of that nature would do to impaired loans or distressed mortgages?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I look forward to quoting that next year, when I hope Mr. Duffy will have been proved right and I will have been proved wrong.With regard to Priory Hall, I reiterate that so many families are clinging to every word that is being said by people in the banks, so I will give the witnesses the opportunity to say what they want to about Priory Hall as carefully as they can. When the residents hear about "new homes" or a "final solution", they want to know what the terms mean. We all know how difficult the position is and I agree with others that there are a number of other issues coming down the tracks for this and other banks because of the mad sellotape-type construction of the past 15 years. The period of "a number of weeks" has been mentioned, along with "positive solutions" and "new homes". These words will be pored over, read and clung to by people in a desperate position, so I would give two minutes to the witnesses to allow them say what they want. That would be very much appreciated by everybody.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Before giving the witness the chance to answer, I make the point that the families have said this bank has been more positive in dealing with this issue than any other. That is not saying much but it is saying something.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Does that include EBS?
