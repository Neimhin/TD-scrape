AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will be brief as I might have to leave. Unfortunately, many meetings take place on a Wednesday.  I have the radical idea about Irish education that children should be taught together. Many people in the education sphere consider that idea incredibly radical and that it could never be achieved. A minority of schools manipulate their admission policies to keep certain children out. For that reason, the suggestion that a cohort of schools be allowed to admit children on the basis that their parents or grandparents are past pupils is not good enough. How can one compete for admission to a school if one's parent did not attend a secondary school, if one's parent attended secondary school but not in Ireland, if one is from outside the State or moved from a different part of the country?That sort of thing must be removed in its entirety. I accept that 25% is a move in that direction but it is not enough.  There are situations where parents with a child with an educational need, from an ethnic background or a Traveller background are told by a principal we would love to take the child but there is a school down the road that has all of the lovely resources and can provide a much better education. There is effective segregation whereby school A is very monocultural and school B, for whatever reason, must face many challenges.  Glacaim go bhfuil ceist ann maidir leis an Ghaeilge. Ar bhonn bunreachtúil, ní féidir iachall a chur ar thuismitheoirí atá ag tógáil a gcuid páistí le Gaeilge na páistí sin a chuir chuig scoil lán-Bhéarla. Glacaim le sin agus sílim go bhfuil argóint láidir ag na finnéithe ansin. At the same time it is important, when using the spirit of the legislation, to be as generous as possible. I do not want people to use that spirit in a wrong or negative manner. We must construct an educational system that does not have an incredible competition to keep certain people out and does not allow other people in. Sin ráite, glacaim leis an méid atá ráite ag na finnéithe agus gabhaim buíochas leo as a bheith anseo. With regard to the broader question of ethos, I have great sympathy with what Atheist Ireland has said. I shall outline an outrageous situation that exists in my constituency and around the country but perhaps it is not as acute in an urban context because people are more mobile and, therefore, have a greater choice. One is confronted with a situation where one is told that if one baptises a child in a faith that one does not share he or she will be allowed into the local school. That is not in keeping with the ethos or vision of a modern republic. That is completely outside of the vision for a modern republic that a parent would and is being told if their child is not baptised it will be organised. As a local Deputy, I have been presented with such a scenario. My response has been to say that at present, unfortunately, the schools have a right to do so.  Let us be honest, most schools work hard to be as inclusive as possible, to care for the children in their care and to give them the best education that they possibly can. However, there are schools who manipulate their admission policies to keep out Traveller children and immigrant children, to keep children with special needs out and to keep children with certain disruptive backgrounds out. We must be sure that when we construct a new admission policy that every school adopts that spirit in the right way and not manipulate it in the wrong way. Go raibh maith agat.
