AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Not agreed.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Statements on higher education are planned for Thursday but we only had statements on an area of higher education last Thursday. We need statements on special education. We are not sitting next week and there is a crisis in special education school places across the country. It is the last day of May and SNA allocations have yet to be published. I understand the warehousing plan of the Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for special education and inclusion has been scrapped. We do not need statements on higher education this Thursday; we need statements on special education and we have written to the Business Committee to seek that. It is important.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is that a "No"?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	If the Ceann Comhairle was an SNA he would think it was damn necessary to have a debate on special education this week-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----or a parent, or somebody seeking a school place. We will be calling a vote on this issue. We demand statements on special education this Thursday to replace the statements on higher education.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Dáil is not sitting next week.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I doubt there is a Deputy in this House who would suggest that statements on higher and further education this Thursday are more pressing than statements on special education.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There is a particular issue in the country that the Ceann Comhairle will appreciate. The issue is that SNA allocations have yet to be announced and I understand that may happen at 3 p.m. today. School places have still not been found and there is an issue around the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion's dealings with this issue. This week is the week for us to deal with it. There will be no sitting next week and waiting two weeks is just not acceptable to us.
