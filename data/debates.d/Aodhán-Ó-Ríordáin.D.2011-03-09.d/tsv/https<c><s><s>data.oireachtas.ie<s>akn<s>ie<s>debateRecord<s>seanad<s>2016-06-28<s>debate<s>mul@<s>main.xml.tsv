AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is the Leas-Chathaoirleach sure?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I join with Senator Ó Clochartaigh on two points. He has previously asked for a debate on the Irish language in this House and that is something we should definitely have in the coming weeks. Will the Leader arrange it? It is an important debate. I say that deliberately in English because it is a debate for all Members of this House. We should be inclusive about the discussion on the status of our native language. I also join with him in congratulating the Irish team which came back from the European Championship yesterday. I am delighted that we are having a debate later today about Brexit because, just when we feel the world is falling apart somewhat, sport can always cheer us up. In particular, the Icelandic football team last night gave us all great reason to cheer another "Brexit" that was perhaps not expected. We should have a debate on sport. It may be that it enters our political consciousness only at times of great competition or achievement, but sport means a huge amount to people throughout the country. It brings people together and provides a fantastic opportunity for communities to come together. It can be an opportunity for those on the edges of society to participate. It reflects well on us. Given the great achievements of the Irish soccer team as well as the Northern Irish soccer team in the European Championship, perhaps now is the time to have cold reflection on the state of the game of football in Ireland, including the League of Ireland, the women's game, the under age game, the game throughout the island, and where we go from here. Participating in sport is about representing one's town, place and parish, and there is an awful lot to be positive about. What can the political circle do in terms of investment or strategy for the next five, ten or 15 years? I am thinking of the volunteers throughout the country who line the pitches, put up the nets and take the training sessions for the under-7s and under-8s. These are the real heroes when it comes to participation in sport in Ireland. Could we have a debate in the coming weeks with either the senior Minister or the junior Minister in the Department to see what support we can give to develop football and other sports in Ireland over the coming years? The potential for an all-Ireland team has been mentioned, which is something I think I would support. There are other strategic things we could do in the short term with regard to an all-Ireland league when comes to progressing football in Ireland. Sport is not an add-on or a luxury. It is integral to the life of people in Ireland. People get excited about it, and if people get excited about it it has to be considered important. I suggest that the House have at an appropriate time a debate on sport and discuss exactly what can be done in the long term and in a strategic fashion to support and promote games of whatever kind in Ireland.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister for this important debate. The vote by the British people is nothing short of an unmitigated disaster. I have not been as depressed about a political event in a considerable time. It proves that if one decides to focus one's attention on a disenfranchised or disconnected group of people and tells them anything one wishes to conjure up in one's head and point at another group of people and say they are the problem, one can secure a political win.I fear for politics internationally. Austria came within an ace of electing a far-right President. We can see in America and even here that the centre ground is being hollowed out and the people and the political discourse are going to the far left and far right. It seems anything can be said and a victimhood mentality rules the day across Europe and in Ireland. Much of the debate centred on immigration. People in this House do not have any right to be sniffy or to pretend that such a debate could not happen here in Ireland. The very first election I ran in was the local election in 2004 which coincided with an unnecessary referendum on citizenship promoted by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats and supported by Fine Gael which brought out some pretty nasty emotions. We have not had any general election centred on the issue of immigration but let us not pretend that cannot happen in the future because it happened on that occasion.  I worry about the European project because it was a collection of European nations standing together to collectively face the issues of the world, issues that affect the global South, climate change and the refugee crisis, for example. The British people have effectively said they want to turn their back on those issues. How can we now face these world issues collectively and effect some change? It is devastating and disappointing that this has come to pass. British politics is in terminal decline. Both mainstream parties are in a massive state of disintegration. Now is the time for us, while talking about commerce, trade, tariffs, exports and imports, and financial considerations to do so on a humanitarian basis. The EU was founded because the people of Europe said they could not let the continent descend into war again but we have returned to a situation where extremist rhetoric is winning the day, where the emotions of people who feel disaffected with mainstream society can be stirred up and a faceless enemy can be identified and becomes the basis for a political win. Victimhood is winning the day. There are very serious questions to be answered and reflection to be had about what we stand for in this Republic. If the only rhetoric we come up with is based on tariffs and trade, economics and money, we have missed the point because the European project was born out of a sense of despair about where humanity was going. I have that sense of despair now so can we please readjust our rhetoric to talk about humanity and our collective response to the global issues of the day and stand up for what is decent and right? Ireland is in a particularly good place to do that.
