AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Labour Party acknowledges the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, in bringing forward a memo to Government on the establishment of a citizens' assembly on drugs. Deputies and Senators from different political groups feel strongly about the citizens' assembly being a real force for change. We want the voice of the service user, the drug user, to be central to the deliberations of the citizens' assembly on drugs. As a matter of course, a special committee will be set up following the deliberations of the citizens' assembly. That is how these matters tend to play out. Will the Taoiseach commit to viewing the deliberations and findings of the citizens' assembly on drugs in good faith and to the Government moving to implement the findings of the citizens' assembly and the special committee because this is a crucial issue for so many people in our country?
