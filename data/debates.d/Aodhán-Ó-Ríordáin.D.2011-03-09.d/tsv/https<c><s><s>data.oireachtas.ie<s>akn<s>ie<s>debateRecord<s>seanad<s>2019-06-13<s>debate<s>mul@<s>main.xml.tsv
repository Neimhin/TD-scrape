AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I support the INTO's call for an increase in the capitation grant for primary schools to pre-2011 levels. We need to constantly remind ourselves of the constitutional right to free primary education which has not been vindicated over the years of this State. The Labour Party has published Bills to abolish the practice of voluntary contributions. We have been told by certain school managers that filling the gap would cost the State €45 million. The reason the capitation payment needs to be increased is that parents are filling that gap through fund-raising. Progressive minded people in Europe, particularly in Scandinavian countries, find it mind-boggling that a parents' group would have to fund-raise for the basic provision of school or educational activities, particularly in primary school. We have also suggested that we should have a free book scheme in the Republic of Ireland, as they have in the North of Ireland. I ask the Leader to facilitate a discussion with the Minister for Education and Skills on how we can access funding to vindicate the right to free primary school education; ensure parents do not have to fund-raise; raise the capitation to such a level that schools can be properly funded; and ensure we have services in the Republic that are taken as a right and taken for granted in the North of Ireland. We have an education budget of approximately €11 billion. If a free primary school book scheme would cost €20 million, and that the shortfall in funding through voluntary contributions to the capitation funding would cost €45 million, it would surely be worth providing the total amount required to vindicate that right. This would ensure that the parental and student relationship with a school is not a financial one but is one based purely on education, growth and development. The Government will find great support from across this Chamber if we were to have such a conversation and vindicate that constitutional right. That is my first point. On a second issue-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I support the comments made by Senator Feighan and what the Government has been saying in response to the rhetoric being used in the Tory leadership contest in Britain. There is an awful lot of buffoonery happening with talk of renegotiation at European level, which will not happen. The backstop is going absolutely nowhere. It is important for all of us was to stand firm with the Government on this to reaffirm that nothing is going to be renegotiated. Anybody with leadership aspirations in the British Tory Party needs to be reminded of that. I fear for the future of politics in Britain and that it will mirror what we have in the United States at the moment if, as is likely, Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister.
