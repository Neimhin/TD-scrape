AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will allow Senator James Reilly to go before me.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is reasonable for Senators to request a debate with the Minister of the day. I was a bit taken aback that a request was made several weeks ago but it was not adhered to.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We do not want to be having votes on the Order of Business to facilitate a debate on an issue and no Minister turns up. Senator Rose Conway-Walsh raised the interview on "Morning Ireland" with Dr. Hickey and what he is projecting for the winter months for Sligo hospital. I found it quite frightening. Regardless of political persuasion, and before we get into arguments about how things should be paid for and using phrases such as "leprechaun economics", we should have a reasoned debate on where the health system is going, particularly over the coming months. In my area, there is a constant strain on the facilities at Beaumont Hospital. There has been a request from the hospital's senior management for a major investment of €45 million for a better accident and emergency department. That is the suggestion from people at the coalface. It is only reasonable that when individual Senators, in good faith, make a request for the Minister of the day, be it for mental health or the overall health system, to come to the House for a debate in a non-partisan fashion, it should be adhered to and facilitated. In fairness, the House, across the board, has worked quite well on the many issues affecting people.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is not true.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That simply is not true.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I can outline-----
