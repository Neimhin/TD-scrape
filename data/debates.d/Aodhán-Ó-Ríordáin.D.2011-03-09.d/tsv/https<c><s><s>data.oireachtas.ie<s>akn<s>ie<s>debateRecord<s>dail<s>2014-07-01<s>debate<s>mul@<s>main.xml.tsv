AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	During the bubble period, when the State was overly reliant on stamp duty and VAT as a source of income, people in Dublin and the commuter belt contributed disproportionately to the coffers of the State. It would be extremely unfair if they emerge from that situation to a new one in which they are doubly punished because of property prices in Dublin and the local property charge. Council services benefit the most vulnerable and poorest in our society, whether through housing, sheltered accommodation, libraries, parks or playgrounds. All of the essential services that councils provide benefit the poorest and most vulnerable, who have the greatest need for public services. The suggestion that central government grants to Dublin City Council or any of the other Dublin councils could be affected because of receipts from the local property tax is patently unfair. Given the historical context of what happened during the bubble period, the bankrupt nature of the funding mechanism and the fact that Dubliners were unfairly treated during that period, to disadvantage those living in the Dublin region by cutting central government funds is doubly unfair. Dublin has a higher proportion of marginalised and disadvantaged communities who depend on council services for their very survival. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, to ensure they are not cut off from central government.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Last year, Dublin City Council scraped its budget through and last minute proposals from city management in regard to cutting homelessness services and adaptation grants for the disabled and potential increases of 14% in local authority rents were avoided because of an intervention from the Government. Without ongoing and sustainable intervention by the Government, the services that protect the most vulnerable in Dublin will not survive. This is a matter of equality and social solidarity.It is important to underpin the essential services of housing, community infrastructure, library services, etc., with sustainable funding. This should come from the local property tax, which I support, and also from the central government to ensure such services can continue in future without a threat hanging over them from year to year.
