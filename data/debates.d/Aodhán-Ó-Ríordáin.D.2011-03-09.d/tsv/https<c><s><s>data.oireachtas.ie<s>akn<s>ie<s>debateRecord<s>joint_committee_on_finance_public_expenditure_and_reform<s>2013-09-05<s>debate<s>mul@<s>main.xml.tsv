AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	All of the other banks have made clear their positions on Priory Hall. Allied Irish Bank was the most positive; Bank of Ireland stated it would be led by other banks, while Ulster Bank was less than positive. Perhaps Mr. Masding might set out what he believes PTSB can do for its mortgage holders of properties in Priory Hall.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I have a final question. Mr. Duffy has said this is happening over the next number of weeks so can that commitment be given as well?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is contact being made with the individuals involved?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Will there be a resolution in the foreseeable future?
