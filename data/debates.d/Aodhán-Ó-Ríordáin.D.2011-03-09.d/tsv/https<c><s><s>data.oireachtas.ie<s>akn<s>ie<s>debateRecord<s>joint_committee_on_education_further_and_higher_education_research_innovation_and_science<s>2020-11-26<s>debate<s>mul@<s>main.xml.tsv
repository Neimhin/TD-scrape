AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for their attendance and their statements, which were interesting. I thank them also for keeping our schools open. The effort to keep schools open is shared among boards of management, school principals, teachers, special needs assistants, school secretaries, school caretakers, school wardens, and, obviously, the parent body and student body. Without their co-operation and their rowing in, it would not work. I have a few questions. I will ask Mr. Murray to start. The issue of over-assessment has been raised by a colleague of mine, Senator Wall. A number of sixth year students have said that in the absence of a clear statement from Government, teachers are in a position where they need back-up material to assess their students on, in the event of an assessed grade for 2021, which, to be honest, none of us wants to see. I was one of those who believed we should have gone ahead with the written exam in 2020, rather than going down the assessed grade route. What type of language would Mr. Murray like to hear from the Department? What type of statement would he like to hear from the Minister and the Department in relation to the certainty he or teachers need to ensure this over-assessment can stop? My second question, and I ask this of the National Parents Council Post-Primary as well, is on what type of acknowledgement the leaving certificate class of 2021 should get, considering there was a break in March, April and May of 2020. What would the witnesses like to see from the Department in acknowledging that break in tuition when assessing the leaving certificate class of 2021? Those questions are for Mr. Murray and Ms Fanning.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Murray is looking for clear guidance from the Department, such as a circular or something to stating it is aware that over-assessment could be taking place for sixth year students and clear guidelines. I appreciate the Department will be reluctant to categorically state there will be a written exam. We understand that is a difficult thing to say in any given year but that is the type of reassurance Mr. Murray would like.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	What acknowledgement does Mr. Murray believe the Department should give for those lost months?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will spend my remaining time asking Ms Lynch about the lessons that can be learned from this. Initially when the crisis hit, there was much speculation around whether parents would have to start fundraising for personal protective equipment, PPE, where schools would get resources for what they would need to have and on the question of the underfunding of education. Ms Lynch has spoken eloquently in the past about how the relationship that parents have with schools is too often a financial one. It restricts the capacity of parents to go to the school gate or to a parent-teacher meeting if they are constantly being asked about money. Parents associations are often fundraising committees, or they feel like they are. Does Ms Lynch feel we can come out of this crisis with a better relationship between parents and schools that is not based on fundraising and finance?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	She thinks we should, though.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is the National Parents Council Primary being asked by parents about fundraising for PPE?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I assume so because my time is up.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	She might have a comment on the financial relationship as well.
