AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentations. I have to leave at 12 noon so I hope they do not mind if I move on. I have a brief question on the submission by Mr. Arkins. One paragraph in it states: "It is our understanding that those on freelance contracts are not covered by the legislation [I believe he is referring to the 1997 Act] and do not meet the definition of "worker" under any of the various pieces of employment legislation." We passed legislation last year on the collective bargaining rights of freelance workers. Would that legislation have dealt with the issue Mr. Arkins referred to in his submission? He said it was his understanding, but has he looked at that legislation and does it cover the type of vicarious work to which he referred? Is it something that is still finding its feet, so to speak, in terms of the industry in which he is working?
