AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The words "social welfare" and "fraud" tend to be linked in the common consciousness.  There is any amount of fraud throughout society, however, including tax evasion.  It should not be automatically assumed, therefore, that there is widespread fraudulent behaviour among social welfare recipients.The Department stated there was an increase in claimants for the back to school allowance this year.  Can the witnesses give an exact figure for this?  Are the parents of two and three year old children eligible for the allowance?  If so, how much is this costing?  It does seem somewhat strange considering two and three year olds do not attend primary school.Regarding the tackling of welfare fraud in other industries, the committee met recently with representatives from the taxi industry.  They pointed out how checkpoints targeting the social welfare status of taxi drivers were set up by the Department and the Garda several weeks ago.  These were well received and the word went around, making it easier for full-time taxi drivers to ply their trade.  Are there any plans to extend such checkpoints to ensure full-time taxi drivers are the main beneficiaries of the trade and not those engaged in fraudulent behaviour?
