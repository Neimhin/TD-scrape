AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am disappointed with the proceedings today, they have been pathetic. What normally happens is that there is a level of political grandstanding. That takes place on the political scene and everyone understands that there is an element of drama and theatrics. However, normally when one comes into these chambers the jackets are taken off, the sleeves are rolled up and we dig deep into the situation that the Government presents and try to find solutions and some costed alternatives. What occurred today was done purely for cameras, for notice, and for political grandstanding reasons. It is the very reason the people have turned away from a connection with the political process and the very reason the people are tired of the political system. It makes the people and those new to these Houses wonder whether we will ever get out of this mess when the best thing some people can hope to get out of today is a headline, a newspaper clip or a piece in "Oireachtas Report" of themselves walking out. There is one party that got us into this mess and another party that does not even have the sense to get its proposals costed. There is someone else who is more interested in writing newspaper columns than finding costed alternatives. It is pathetic and I am embarrassed to be sitting here today as an Irish parliamentarian.
