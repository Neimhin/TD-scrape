AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Cuirim fáilte roimh gach duine, go háirithe Tomás Ó Ruairc.  Tá sean-aithne agam air agus tá sé go deas é a fheiceáil anseo inniu.The PR problem has been articulated widely, as has the fact that only 8% of teachers participated in the last election to the Teaching Council.  Reference was made to the fact that the council hopes to address this.  Mr. O'Dea talked about the fee so I will not talk about it again.The stated purpose of the council is to promote teaching as a profession.  How is this being achieved?  The second stated purpose is to ensure the continuing professional development of teachers.  How is this achieved?On entry-level requirements for teacher training, particularly at primary level, there is a conversation on the need for higher-level mathematics.  Higher-level Irish is currently required.  Does the Teaching Council believe this is still necessary?  Is it, as I believe, a barrier to the entry to the teaching profession of disadvantaged students?  Should we not place more emphasis on the capability of teachers as they leave teacher training than on their attainments on entry?   I would have major qualms about a stipulation requiring teachers to have higher-level mathematics.  What matters is what teachers deliver in the classroom, not what they get in their leaving certificate examinations, considering that points are so high in any event.With regard to teacher training, particularly at primary level, there is considerable emphasis on Irish and religion.  In the study on the practices in Mary Immaculate College, it was discovered that four times more time is spent on religion than science and technology.  How does the Teaching Council hope to address that?  The president of the college, in his opening remarks, made it quite clear he had no intention of addressing the imbalance.The role of the principal in the probation of teachers is controversial.  I do not have an issue with it but wonder how the Teaching Council believes it will address it.  How can we address homophobic bullying and LGTB issues?Reference was made to the fact that there will be an entire strand on special needs and education for the disadvantaged.  This is very welcome.  Traditionally, many teachers who entered disadvantaged schools or dealt with special needs children were completely unprepared.  In future, circumstances will be different, which is very welcome.Does the Teaching Council believe it is realistic, particularly at primary level, to expect somebody to enter a college of education at 18 years of age, completely separated from all other strands of education, as occurs at present?  Trainee teachers are in a cocoon separating them from university life.  They study for three or four years – it will soon be four – and then, at the age of 21 or 22, land in a classroom of children of various backgrounds and expect to be capable, for the next 35 or 40 years, of demonstrating life experience and being an effective teacher.  If one is trying to be a teacher in a classroom, having been cocooned for three or four years does not result in adequate preparation.  I would like to hear the Teaching Council's response to that.How does the Teaching Council believe its role in the handling of complaints against teachers will marry with section 24(3) of the Education Act and circular 60/2009 on the suspension and dismissal of teachers and principals?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I was trying to suggest that in any other degree course, people mix with others doing agriculture, architecture, arts etc. but in teacher training, people are on their own and surrounded only by people doing teacher training.  In embedding the classroom in students, I am not sure that is the best process of teacher training.
