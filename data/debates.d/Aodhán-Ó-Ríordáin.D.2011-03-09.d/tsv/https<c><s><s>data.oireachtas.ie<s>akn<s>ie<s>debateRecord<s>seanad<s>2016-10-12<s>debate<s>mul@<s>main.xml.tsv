AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I suppose in the aftermath of a budget, perhaps it is easy to don the political jersey and find everything that is negative in it, but I do not think that it is necessarily fair or adds anything to the political debate in this country. There are good things in the budget and anybody with a fair mind would acknowledge that. However, I would like the Leader to address two issues which concern children. These are two issues in which we expected the advancements of the past few years would have been built on. One is the issue of class sizes and the second is the issue of free GP care for those under 12 years. When an improvement is made over a number of years, it is a reasonable expectation that this improvement would be continued.  In the past few years class sizes in primary schools have not been made worse. They have not been increased. In budget 2016 the pupil-teacher ratio was decreased at primary and secondary level. It was reduced by one point at primary level where the issue is acute. The expectation was that over a number of years, it would gradually be brought down. That did not happen in yesterday's budget. I am a little disturbed by that because surely when we now have resources to invest in areas that are clearly crying out for investment, class size is one of those issues that affects every school-going child in primary school and their parents. Many children in large classes will do fine because they can achieve in any circumstances but children with special educational needs or behavioural difficulties are the ones who will benefit from smaller class sizes. The vision of going from having the largest class sizes in Europe to progressively bringing down that pupil-teacher ratio is something I thought would continue from last year but it has not happened. I think we should have a discussion on that in this Chamber.  Again, we made a huge advance on the issue of free GP care for children under the age of six years. I felt at the time it was a major advance that also would be continued. Again, for some reason, free GP care for those under 12 years has slipped below the radar. The children of Ireland who had a reasonable expectation that their class sizes would have come down and that free GP care for those under 12 years would also have been introduced will be a bit surprised. Where is the Government's vision for those two areas?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	When it comes to the issue of Seanad reform, there have been a number of reports, commissions and referenda. Much is said about the eighth amendment to the Constitution and the damage it has done to Irish women over the years, but the seventh amendment to the Constitution is another interesting one that rarely raises any comment. The interesting thing about the seventh amendment to the Constitution is that it was never legislated for. It was an attempt to widen the franchise for voters in Seanad elections. In the almost 40 years since there have been quite a number of commissions and reports. There was a referendum a number of years ago to abolish this Chamber, which I supported at that point. I remember debating with Senator Michael McDowell at the time at an event where we took opposing views on it. Both our positions have changed over the years. It was my interaction with this Chamber as Minister of State that changed my view on its validity and what it has to offer. There comes a stage where we have to put an end to the endless round of commissions and reports and actually do something. The issue with this Chamber is the perceived or otherwise disconnect between it and the electorate. This Bill tries to address that in many ways. There is potential in the Chamber to give a voice to people in society who do not often get a chance to have their voices heard. Much has been said about the diaspora and Irish citizens in the North of Ireland, but I am thinking also of groups such as Travellers and others who would benefit greatly from having representation in this Chamber on matters that concern them. One issue that concerns me in the Bill is the ability of an Oireachtas Member to be also a member of a local authority. Often in this Chamber Members speak about their constituency. Technically we do not have a constituency because we come into the Chamber as national politicians. We do not have a geographical constituency. If we were to go back to the situation where local authority members could run for the Seanad and have a dual mandate, we would dilute the national focus of the Chamber. Inevitably county council and city council issues would be brought to the floor of the Seanad. That happens anyway but it would be compounded by a situation where there is not that separation. One of the positive moves of the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, former Deputy Noel Dempsey, was to propose the abolition of the dual mandate, which eventually became law in 2003. It provided that one could not be a Member of the national Parliament and a local authority member. It was very controversial at the time for people who were in that position and did not like it. It separated various areas of local administration and public representation. Council work was taken up by councillors and national work and national legislation were taken on by Oireachtas Members. I would have to be convinced that to go back to a situation where Senators could be local authority members is a positive move. In terms of what we are trying to achieve in the House, we work quite well together when we speak with one voice. I am keenly aware that politics is under more international pressure now. There is more pressure now on the validity of public life, the ability to make a case, and the ability to believe in something and stand for something than there has been ever before. Looking at what is happening in the United States, the United Kingdom and throughout Europe, it appears to me that politics is in a complete mess. The fault for that lies with politicians and the political system. If we lose faith in the institutions of our political system, we are in a very dangerous position. We can see what is happening in the United Kingdom, where a very nasty scenario has arisen. I mentioned the United States and Europe also. When we change the way we do business in the Oireachtas, we have to proceed with caution, although there has been so much caution around this Chamber that it has led to nothing happening. I suggest the Minister of State, the Acting Chairman and Senators take this Bill in good faith. We can work on its various elements as we proceed. If the Chamber is to have any validity in the future, its connectivity with the public has to be reinforced. I question the ability of a Senator in this House to have a dual function in a local authority because, if we are to be serious about national politics and talk about national issues, having a focus on the local authority area would not be a good move.
