AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I agree with the Minister. Our country is heartbroken this morning. More will be said about that later but I join with the Minister in his condolences with the family of the lost soldier. Will the Minister make a statement on the ways in which the ongoing review in energy security will integrate sectoral emissions ceiling and carbon budget obligations, his plans to ensure that as-demand reduction measures are prioritised in the review, and the ways in which the principles of a just transition will be integrated into the review?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Labour Party has concerns partly because briefing documents prepared for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, which were obtained under freedom of information, reported in The Business Post at the weekend, stated it is not feasible for Ireland to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030. We are particularly concerned to see this concession made by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Agricultural methane emissions from livestock account for 95% of Ireland's methane emissions overall. Methane emissions from livestock have increased in recent years, not reduced. The briefing document stated the pledge to cut methane emissions allows for individual countries to pledge lower amounts. What is the Minister's view of these briefing documents prepared for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and do they speak for the Government?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister knows, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has made it clear a methane emissions reduction of almost 30% is required to achieve a 22% reduction in agricultural emissions, and we all remember the row over the summer in regard to emissions savings. We would have liked to have seen a commitment closer to a 30% reduction. The lower ceiling which is in place instead was accepted on the basis that it could not be exceeded. However, going by this report in the newspaper at the weekend, no credible pathway has been established by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to achieve the less ambitious commitment it made. Is it not concerning for the Minister not just that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine clearly is not on board but, potentially, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is not on board?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	What are the Minister's plans to ensure confirmed data centres connections will not increase emissions? What are his plans to ensure that such connections do not lock in higher gas demands?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Ireland could have 146 data centres if all approved projects and projects seeking planning permission go ahead. If all of these projects are completed, the power demand capacity will triple. The disorganised nature of this rapid growth in the sector is problematic for our climate ambitions and for families who are worried about the lights and heat going off this cold and dark winter. The Government needs to institute a moratorium on new connections until it gets to grips with what is happening. Those making these proposals have been labelled as too drastic but power outages and climate chaos are drastic outcomes. It is not just those on the Opposition benches who have been raising these concerns. We hear it privately from Government representatives as well. Indeed, a Government backbencher was making these very same points on national radio during the week.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister knows, demand for gas for electricity generation, heating and other uses must fall by 40% this decade and by a further 80% in the 2030s if we are to meet our climate commitments. Despite this, we continue to prepare to build new gas-fuelled electricity generation plants. Even if all future data centres were to run on renewable energy, it would leave shortages of clean energy for other sectors. Gas is wrongly being peddled as a silver-bullet transition fuel. As the Minister knows, the effect of carbon emissions is cumulative. Is it not fair to say that we are locking in this infrastructure without a national plan?
