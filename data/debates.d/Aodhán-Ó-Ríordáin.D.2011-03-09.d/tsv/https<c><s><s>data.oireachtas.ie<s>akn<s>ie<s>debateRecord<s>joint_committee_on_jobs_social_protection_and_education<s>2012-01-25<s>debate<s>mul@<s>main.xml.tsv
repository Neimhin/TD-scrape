AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry I missed the presentation but I am familiar with the document.  The issue with Hibernia College and others is that there is a flooding of teachers into the system at a time when positions are few and far between.  Further to Deputy Conaghan's point, my experience of teacher training colleges is that they are already slightly removed from the wider university system.  Teachers are training in a very isolated situation and in the modern day it is not really realistic that they are not mixing with students in other disciplines, which is not a good policy for those who will be educating people in the classroom.  A college such as Hibernia College removes them even more given that they are effectively being trained from behind a computer screen.  Have departmental officials taken that into account?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On the literacy question, I am encouraged by the Minister's presentation.  An education psychologist based in West Dunbartonshire in Glasgow speaks about the total eradication of illiteracy.  Unfortunately, in Ireland we only speak about tacking illiteracy and, therefore, what the Minister is doing is encouraging.  The statistics for adult illiteracy are stark, showing 24% in that category; often that is assumed to be an elderly population but that is not so.  We have spoken previously about the importance of adult literacy policies throughout the education system and in every training board and educational outlet.A recent presentation from NALA outlined to us how FÁS, in its previous existence, had not had an adult literacy policy which seems to be a huge omission.  I am delighted to note that what the Minister is proposing will address that issue.  I would hope, in time, that this policy driven approach would percolate right down through the education system in order that anybody who comes in contact with anybody in the education system or retraining would have a high level of literacy component to it.  Literacy has to be tackled at both ends.  It cannot be focused solely on the child but on his or her family.  A literacy issue in the home has long lasting effects.  Is that something that should happen over a period, given that literacy is a foremost component of training and retraining in our education institutions?  Should checks balances be in place to assess how the policies have worked?   Adult literary is difficult to gauge.  It is positive that more people are engaging in adult literacy programmes, but it can be difficult for a person to admit to literacy problems as it is easy to hide them.  Over a period, will it be possible to assess whether we have been successful in tackling this most debilitating of educational disadvantage issues?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I do not know if I am permitted to give a list of schools which are thankful for the Minister's announcement re DEIS.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is refreshing, given that cuts in previous Administrations are not up for discussion, that we have a new way of dealing with situations.  On the issue of the 70,000 new students within the system, how does the Minister envisage the system absorbing such a large intake right across the board?  I refer to the issue of guidance counsellors and chaplains for which there is an allocation of €9 million as stated in a reply to a parliamentary question I tabled.  As Deputy Anthony Lawlor has indicated, there is an issue about the deeds of trust within community and comprehensive schools.  How does the Minister feel that could be unpicked or is it a necessity that we would unpick it?
