AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I congratulate the Chairman on his election and I thank Deputy Tuffy for all her work.  I am a Dublin based TD and I cannot pretend to know a whole lot about the situation in Northern Ireland, although I am trying to learn.  It would appear to me that the economy is disproportionately reliant on the public sector.  There has been a huge amount of public sector investment as part of the peace process.  Austerity and the shrinkage of the purchasing power of individuals are having a disproportionate effect on Northern Ireland when compared with anywhere else in the UK.  Can the witnesses comment on that public sector and private sector balance?  How is it a challenge?  Where is the growth potential in Northern Ireland for the private sector?  I have always worked in the public sector as a teacher, and now as a public representative.  I have since learned more about the demands, constraints and challenges of business than I ever had before.  Employment is something that we all worry about.  Do the witnesses feel that the balance in Northern Ireland towards the public sector is evening out in a more positive way?
