AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We are all allowed to change our minds on that one.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I want to be associated with the good wishes to Deputy Enda Kenny as he resigns as Taoiseach today. However, I am filled with nervousness about what is coming next for two main reasons. I join Senator McDowell in requesting the new Taoiseach's presence in this Chamber. Yesterday, we learnt that this new Government arrangement will be supported by Deputy Michael Lowry, an individual who will be up in court in April accused of-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is a known fact and it is on the record of this House that the reputation of this individual-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Okay. This individual has accepted in the past to have used the tax amnesty facility-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Okay. I will make the point in a different way, if I might. It is already interesting to see the measures that have been taken by the incoming Taoiseach as to who he seeks support from. Deputy Leo Varadkar accused the now Senator James Reilly, who was then a Deputy and a Minister, of doing something that looked like a stroke in his constituency. There was an announcement today that the Garda station in Stepaside will be reopened. This is from the Minister, Deputy Ross, who apparently came into politics to get rid of stroke politics, wants an independent Judiciary and does not want to have any political interference in the judicial system, yet he is now able to announce, just as the new Cabinet is going to be announced, that he himself has got his Garda station reopened. The new Administration is supported by Deputy Lowry and also by someone who has got a nice little Garda station open for himself in his own constituency. Is this the new politics that we can expect from the new Taoiseach?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The new Taoiseach has built his reputation on a welfare fraud campaign. It is remarkable how tough he is on those who are weak and how weak he is on those who are tough.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I look forward to raising these issues with him when he arrives in this Chamber.
