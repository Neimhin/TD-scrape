AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the last hour of the debate on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 be substituted with a debate on crime and that the Minister for Justice and Equality be summoned to the House to discuss the issue of crime. I made comments yesterday on a murder that took place at the beginning of this week. That was the fifth such murder in seven months on the north side of Dublin. The situation is clearly out of control. If this had occurred in any other area of the country, the political system would have screeched to a halt and every available Minister would be seated around a table talking about it. That has not happened with regard to Coolock and that needs to change. We are asking for an amendment to the Order of Business to provide that the last hour of the scheduled debate on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017 be substituted with a one-hour discussion on the issue of crime in Dublin and around the country, in light of the most recent murder at the beginning of this week.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is the proposal.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I would like to explain why I am not pressing it. I will take the Leader's goodwill at face value. Nobody wants to play politics with murder.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We want a substantial debate and a substantial statement from the Minister about the issue on Thursday week. I do not want to have a pre-written script that could have been read out last month or in the previous months. I want the Minister to come in here and accept the need for a commission and a task force on the north side of Dublin, as was done in the north inner city. If it takes the Minister a week to get his act together and to deliver that, I am happy to delay the debate.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am genuine about this. I am trying to be constructive.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	If a week is needed to be constructive about it, I am happy to wait for a week.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Leader can use his influence.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There was a debate on crime two weeks ago, but there has been a murder since then. I will withdraw the amendment to the Order of Business in good faith on the basis that we have a real and substantive debate on crime, gangland crime, murder and drugs in this House next week.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We want some action taken as a result of that debate because it is life and death stuff.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	If it happened in any other part of the State, the ministerial wheels would be screeching.
