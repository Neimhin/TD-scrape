AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The cost of living is the dominant political issue at present. The package announced last week is a sticking plaster for the problems families and workers are facing. The private sector committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions met last week and recommended that unions seek pay rises in the range of 2.5% to 5.5%. Does the Taoiseach agree with workers seeking pay rises? The committee also sought to change the small benefits exemption rule to increase the limit from €500 to €1,000 for those earning up to €1,462 per week and for the values to be spread over multiple payments, for example, €100 per month. Has the Government ruled that out or is it under consideration? There should also be a way to encourage private sector employers to reward front-line workers in retail, social care and other sectors who kept our country running during Covid-19 to benefit from a bonus for their work. The Government Bill on the right to request remote working is at pre-legislative scrutiny stage. Will the Government ensure that every worker who was allowed to work remotely during the pandemic will be given the right to continue to access flexible working arrangements?
