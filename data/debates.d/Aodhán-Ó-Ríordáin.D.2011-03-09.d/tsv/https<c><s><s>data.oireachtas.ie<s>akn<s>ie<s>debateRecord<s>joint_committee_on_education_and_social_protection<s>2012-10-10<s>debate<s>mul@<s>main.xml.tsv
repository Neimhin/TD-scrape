AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for attending to discuss this issue.  The premise is that we want to come up with solutions and work together.  This is not a finger-pointing exercise but a collaborative approach to finding solutions.  The suggestions made have been practical and positive.  On the issue of books, DEIS primary schools receive €21 per student and non-DEIS schools receive €11 per student.  Some 25% of schools are not running book rental schemes.  Can the patron bodies give me an indication of why that is the case?   I am interested to hear about the Educate Together policy of no uniforms in schools.  Do other patron bodies provide direction, make suggestions or have policies on the issue of crested jumpers, jackets and tracksuits?  Has a policy framework been devised to encourage and direct schools in respect of uniform policy, as Educate Together has done?  I am a former school principal and I am a believer in school uniforms for various reasons. They reduce peer pressure. My personal opinion is that there is also a health and safety aspect to the wearing of uniforms. As has been outlined, some parents must go to a particular store to buy a designated jumper. That puts a cost on the uniform, which is not necessarily fair in any circumstance, particularly not in the current circumstances. On the question of voluntary contribution, everybody present admits that schools are, and always have been, chronically underfunded. I do not believe anybody will deny that. The manner in which voluntary contributions are collected is the issue. If somebody has the means and wants to contribute to the school and wants to contribute to a fund-raiser, be it that we should not be required to have fund-raisers, that is all very well, but there have been suggestions and indications given to public representatives that schools are being quite aggressive in targeting certain students and parents telling them they have not returned their "voluntary contribution". Will the patron bodies give a direction to the schools as to how that should be done properly? It may sound silly to raise the issue of Christmas presents. Every year it comes up it is suggested to parents to give a present to teacher. Can we give directions to our schools to stamp out that unnecessary practice? There are the small little pressures that come up every year or at the end of year. The witnesses have made very practical suggestions on public procurement and workbooks, on capitation payment at the end of August and September and on bulk buying. Deputy Jonathan O'Brien made a suggestion in regard to VAT on energy consumption and I believe that is an issue we can work on. We have benefited from this conversation and I appreciate the contributions.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We have moved towards discussing the cost of running schools.  I understand the progression in this regard but we are trying to focus on the costs parents incur when their children return to school.  Many speakers have indicated that this is a local issue, particularly in the context of schools' policies on uniforms, etc.  However, members would be encouraged if our guests took a leadership role in respect of this matter and sent out some guidelines to schools with regard to what might be considered appropriate for investigation at local level.  I understand that our guests' hands are tied but their showing some leadership on this matter would have an impact at local level in the context of policies relating to school uniforms, the giving of presents to teachers, etc.  Children giving presents to their teachers might be regarded as being no big deal or even frivolous but it has an impact on families at various times throughout the school year.  If we state that this should be decided at local level, then we are not showing enough leadership.  I am of the view that guests should take the lead and issue some guidelines.  However, it is entirely up to them to decide what they wish to do.
