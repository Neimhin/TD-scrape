AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I am taking this topical issue debate on behalf of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, who is in Armagh attending a North-South Ministerial Council meeting with his counterpart from Northern Ireland. Cuan Álainn, situated in Tallaght, is a refuge for women and children who are fleeing domestic violence. Since the centre opened in 2012, a total of 55 women and 82 children have accessed its services. Respond! has provided €350,000 in funding to the centre. The Child and Family Agency does not fund Respond!'s Cuan Álainn refuge through its domestic sexual and gender-based violence services programme. The agency has advised that a meeting is planned with Respond! next week to discuss the services provided. It might be helpful for members of the House if I share some background to the arrangements for dealing with this issue at a strategic level. Due to the complex nature of the issues involved in domestic and sexual violence, and the need for a co-ordinated and effective response to these issues, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic Sexual and Gender-Based Violence, Cosc, was established as an executive office in the Department of Justice and Equality in 2007 and that Department currently has overall policy responsibility in this area. Cosc formulated a comprehensive cross-Government strategy, which combines the efforts of a very broad range of organisations and individuals, to combat all forms of domestic, sexual and gender based violence. This strategy runs to 2014. Cosc is in the process of preparing a new cross-sectoral strategy from 2015 onwards. With regard to service delivery, the new Child and Family Agency has since its establishment on 1 January this year, taken on responsibility for the provision of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services previously funded by the Health Service Executive, HSE. Specialist domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services are primarily provided through a large number of non-governmental organisations. In 2014, some €19 million in funding is being provided by the Child and Family Agency by way of grant aid to 62 specialist domestic violence and sexual violence services. These include 16 rape crisis centres and sexual violence services; 44 domestic violence services, including 20 refuges; two national networks, the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI, and Safe Ireland. For the first time, this area is under national direction. We now have a single line of accountability and a consolidated national budget which is reserved for allocation to these particular services. Domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services can now be delivered within a broad child and family support framework and this represents a significant change to the previous service delivery model. In recognition of the policy priority which the agency is attaching to this issue, a dedicated position of programme manager for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence was created within the agency and the post holder took up the position earlier this year. This will help to bring greater cohesion to service delivery. A review of domestic sexual and gender-based violence services has been under way in recent months to get an in-depth understanding of current service provision and identify priorities for developments in these services. The findings of this review will be used in planning for future developments in service provision. A roadmap setting out strategic priorities for domestic sexual and gender-based violence service provision over the next three years is due to be completed shortly. While the emphasis is on front-line services, issues such as training support, quality assurance and preventative measures are also being considered. Through this process the Child and Family Agency is engaged in ongoing consultation with domestic violence and sexual violence services about planned developments. I am pleased to say that the consultative process has been very positive. The discussions will have regard to key aspects of planned developments and a commissioning approach for 2015 service provision will be established. The new Child and Family Agency is committed to working in partnership with domestic violence services and other services providing support to women and children experiencing domestic abuse and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is awaiting the outcome of the agency's discussions with Respond!
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and will raise his concerns again with the Minister upon his return. The Child and Family Agency is a major reform and has been welcomed across this House. The issue in the Deputy's constituency will be the subject of a meeting next week and we will follow up with discussions after that.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I genuinely appreciate the opportunity to discuss this crucial issue with the Deputy. In effect, the life expectancy of certain people in certain parts of Ireland is lessened. We need to take this serious issue on board. I will present the reply from the Department of Health to the House on behalf of the Minister and we can expand on it. As we have been making progress with cancer control over recent years, we have focused on improving the quality and equity of cancer services through reorganisation and expansion. We have moved from a fragmented system of care to one that consolidates cancer treatment in larger centres, with multidisciplinary care and decision-making. The national cancer control programme has reorganised cancer surgery into eight designated cancer centres and ensured these centres have sufficient activity to provide and maintain ongoing surgical expertise. The programme has also established symptomatic breast disease clinics and rapid access clinics for lung and prostate cancer at the designated centres. These clinics are available to all patients, regardless of income. The HSE also provides free screening for breast, cervical and bowel cancer. The Government recently announced the extension of the BreastCheck screening programme, which offers women between the ages of 50 and 64 a free mammogram every two years, to women between the ages of 65 and 69. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 30% of cancer deaths could be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk factors. Tobacco use is considered to be the single most important risk factor for cancer. The Department of Health and the HSE are promoting healthier lifestyles to reduce the risk of many chronic diseases, including cancer. Policies include the achievement of a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025. The National Cancer Registry, which publishes data on cancer incidence, treatment and survival in Ireland, has presented figures to demonstrate that regional variations in survival patterns are not statistically different. Long-term survival from cancer has greatly increased in the past decade. Survival at five years from diagnosis among men increased from 42% in the 1994-99 period to 60% in the 2005-09 period. The increase among women over the same period was from 52% to 62%. It is estimated that the five-year survival rate for people diagnosed with breast cancer between 2005 and 2009 was 84.9%, which represented an increase on the rate of 75.1% for people diagnosed between 1994 and 1999. It is expected that survival rates will increase further due to the combined approach of prevention screening, early detection and improved treatment. The issue of health inequalities, as well as prevention, will be examined as part of the development next year of the next cancer strategy, which will run from 2016. Of course much of this is about the treatment of illnesses in certain areas. I feel quite strongly about the issue of life expectancy. The Government has adopted an area-based approach to tackling child poverty and disadvantage, using models like Young Ballymun, the Tallaght child development initiative and the Preparing for Life programme in Darndale. These models focus on parental empowerment, for example. Issues of maternal depression are becoming quite acute in certain disadvantaged areas. If mothers become isolated from the rest of the community, it can lead to destructive patterns of behaviour. When one focuses on the geographical dimension to the blackspots of disadvantage in this State, it is clear that the potential exists for different agencies to work together collectively. Often in disadvantaged areas, many people who are doing fantastic work are not in communication with each other. Models like Young Ballymun, the Tallaght child development initiative and the Preparing for Life programme in Darndale have broken down many of those entrenched positions. We are rolling out more of those area-based approaches. They might form part of the solution to tackling the issue that has quite rightly been raised by Deputy Kelleher today.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the raising of this equality issue by the Deputy. I agree with what he has said about the schools system. Children do not live in schools. They are influenced by many things outside the school system. They start school at the age of four or five when so many things have already happened to them and influenced their lives. They key to this is empowering the parents in terms of diet and lifestyle in the home. If one comes from an area that is steeped in disillusionment, one can be sucked into a pattern of addiction in which one is attracted by vices like alcohol and substance abuse. Obviously, that has knock-on effects on the wider community. It is about empowerment and prevention. As the Deputy quite rightly said, it is also about providing services and resources to those who are suffering from cancer-related illnesses. A wider societal approach is necessary here. As I have said previously, if we take an area-based approach, if we ask agencies to interlock with each other and - fundamentally - if we empower people, particularly young mothers, to think differently about diet, oral language and literacy skills and lifestyle and to take a fresh approach to parenting, it can be a starting point that leads to a long-term change in the life expectancy of people in certain disadvantaged areas. A report like this is a wake-up call for everybody. It is refreshing to have a discussion like this in the House because it is the real stuff of equality. It is an area in which policies and politicians can make a real difference. I appreciate the raising of this topic by the Deputy. I will personally raise it with the Minister when he returns. I think that, collectively, we can make some real differences in this area. It is not just a health issue. Many different strands are involved in it. Unfortunately, in government and in policy formation we sometimes tend to compartmentalise these areas far too much.However, we are in broad agreement as to the strategy we should take. We should have a continuing discussion on this matter.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Timmins for raising this important matter. The national clinical programme for acute coronary syndrome aims to increase the percentage of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, STEMI, patients who get PPCIs by ensuring that patients are being taken to the right place, their treatment is standardised and processes are in place to ensure prompt investigation of all acute coronary syndrome patients. Under this programme, St. Vincent's University Hospital, St. James's Hospital and the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital operate as designated PPCI centres for the greater Dublin area on a 24-hour, seven-day per week basis. The HSE has advised the Department that, unfortunately, a premature decision was taken last week to withdraw St. Vincent's University Hospital as a 24-7 PPCI centre without the normal notifications to relevant stakeholders. This resulted in a temporary suspension over last weekend of ambulance transfers to St. Vincent's for patients suspected of having STEMI. From 4 p.m. last Friday until 8 a.m. on yesterday, ambulances were instructed to take confirmed STEMI patients in the greater Dublin area to either of the other two 24-7 PPCI centres - St. James's Hospital and Mater Misericordiae University Hospital. The HSE has confirmed that three patients suspected of having STEMI who would have been brought by ambulance to St. Vincent's over the weekend and Monday were transported by ambulance to St. James's Hospital for appropriate treatment. All patients who presented directly to St. Vincent's with suspected STEMI were able to avail of PPCI in St. Vincent's 24-7, if deemed clinically necessary. I am happy to report that St. Vincent's resumed its 24-7 PPCI service at 8 a.m. on Tuesday, 11 November. A redesign of the PPCI programme, particularly the out-of-hours service, is under way within the HSE. The HSE acute hospitals division, in collaboration with the acute coronary syndrome programme and the National Ambulance Service, will enter into discussions with all Dublin hospitals currently delivering PPCI with a view to devising the most effective and sustainable model of care for PPCI in the region.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy raises a valid point. I will be sure to relay to the Minister his concerns as well as Deputy Kelleher's two points about health issues in his constituency and those disadvantaged areas nationally with a higher proportion of people who suffer cancer. Deputy Timmins has raised issues and deserves a comprehensive response from the Minister concerned. I will endeavour to ensure that he receives it.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	Ba mhaith liom a rá i dtús báire go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go dtuigfeadh gach éinne anseo i dTeach Laighean agus ar fud na tíre go bhfuil sé thar a bheith éasca seasamh ar son ceart, ar son comhionannais agus ar son chearta daonna nuair atá sé éasca. Tá sé i bhfad níos deacra é a dhéanamh nuair atá sé deacair agus nuair a chuireann sé isteach ort féin, ar do ghluaiseacht nó ar do pháirtí. Níl sé ceart ná cóir an milleán a chur ar éinne eile, ar nós na meáin chumarsáide nó na páirtithe polaitíochta eile. Tá sé níos tábhachtaí - i mo thuairim, tá sé ríthábhachtach - ceisteanna móra trioblóideacha a chur ort féin nuair a tharlaíonn eachtraí ar nós an cháis atá os ár gcomhair inniu. I have a deep respect for many members of the Sinn Féin Party. Many of the stances they have taken have been quite brave. The spokesperson on justice and equality has campaigned for the rights of Travellers, as has Deputy Dessie Ellis, and this has been quite admirable and inspirational. However, it is easy to stand for the rights of people when there are no consequences. It is much more difficult to stand for the rights of people when there are consequences. It is easy to blame everybody else. I found it quite troubling that a man for whom I have deep personal and political respect, Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, in his contribution could not even mention Maíria Cahill's name. He could not bring himself to mention her name. Rape has been a deeply troubling issue in Ireland for a very long time. It is not just about the republican movement, the Catholic Church or any church, sporting organisations here or the entertainment industry in Britain. It is everywhere and one is far more likely to be abused by a member of one's own family than anybody else. We cannot have a culture of "yes, but", which is the problem with the issue in Ireland. We have had a culture of "yes, but": "Yes, you say you were abused and yes, you say you were raped, but". This is what caused the problem in the church, swimming organisations, other sporting organisations, entertainment organisations and families which have had to deal with this problem. What we are getting on the airwaves from people I genuinely respect is, again, this attitude of "yes, but".I am not a victim of rape or child abuse, but if I was, the debate in recent weeks and months on this issue would suggest that Ireland is again saying to me, "yes, but". It is saying: "Keep quiet and shut up because there are more important things at stake here." I fully agree with what Deputy Conway said earlier. What is more important than the dignity of a victim of child rape? Getting a history lesson of the reality in the Six Counties of Northern Ireland insults the intelligence of every Member of this House and insults the intelligence of every Irish person, North and South, because it again goes to the culture of "yes, but". It is not correct that it is a media conspiracy or that the party political system is terrified of Sinn Féin and therefore that is the only reason these issues are being raised. This country has a deeply troubling history on this issue and we want to rebuild a country where we can talk openly about our problem in this area in order that young girls and boys will not have the culture of "yes, but". I wish to make three final points. I think the first has already been alluded to. Will those who have information come forward with that information and not keep asking others to do it because that has fallen on deaf ears in the past? Will Sinn Féin call off its hounds on social media because what they are doing is despicable? Can Sinn Féin assure everybody in the House that if in the future somebody is raped or sexually assaulted by a Sinn Féin member or supporter, it will defend the victim's rights to the end or will it again say "yes, but"?
