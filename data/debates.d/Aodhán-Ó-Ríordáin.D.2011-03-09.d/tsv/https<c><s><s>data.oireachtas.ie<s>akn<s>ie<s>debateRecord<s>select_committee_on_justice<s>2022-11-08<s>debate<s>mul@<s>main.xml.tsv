AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Thank you. I know it is my first day at school but I wish to raise one point. I took the opportunity on the Order of Business in the Dáil to raise an issue around the Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill. Second Stage is to be taken tomorrow but the deadline for amendments is tomorrow morning, before the Second Stage debate. The Minister said she would look at that. I know it probably falls under the offices of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who was in the Chair, said it needed to be changed. I want to put on the record of the committee that we hope that timeline might be altered to facilitate the Second Stage debate taking place first, before amendments are submitted on the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 5:In page 8, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:
“Administering a substance with intent (“spiking”)
11. The Act of 1997 is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 12:“12A. (1) A person who administers to or causes to be taken by another person (‘C’) a drug or other substance—(a) knowing that C does not consent to what is being done, and(b) with intent thereby to stupefy or overpower C so as to enable himself or herself or any other person to engage in sexual activity with or involving C,is guilty of an offence.(2) A person guilty of an offence under subsection (1) is liable—(a) on summary conviction, to a Class A fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both, or(b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to both.(3) In subsection (1), ‘sexual activity’ has the meaning assigned to it by section 2 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.”.”. I thank the Minister and her officials. This amendment aims to provide for a specific offence of "spiking", that is, "administering a substance with intent". The amendment states:The Act of 1997 is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 12:“12A. (1) A person who administers to or causes to be taken by another person ... a drug or other substance—(a) knowing that ... [that person] does not consent to what is being done, and(b) with intent thereby to stupefy or overpower ... [that person] so as to enable himself or herself or any other person to engage in sexual activity with or involving ... [that person],is guilty of an offence.The Minister will be aware of this activity. People on nights out are conscious of it, and many sexual assaults and rapes occur following the action of spiking. What we intend with this amendment is to provide for a specific offence of the spiking of a substance, that is, a drink, that a person may be consuming.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for her engagement. I am happy to withdraw my amendment to allow the Minister to reassess the situation and come back, certainly on the sentencing guidelines. We suggested ten years, but I suppose there is a difference between poisoning with the intent of making someone unwell and spiking with the intent of committing a sexual assault or rape, based on the fact that the person would be unconscious. I suggest there is a nuance in this regard which is separate. If an individual is trying to poison someone, trying to do them harm, that would be like a common assault in respect of trying to debilitate a person by poisoning them. Spiking a drink is an attempt to temporarily make that person lose their functions so an individual could commit a sexual assault or rape. It is a separate offence. I refer to trying to charge someone who had committed a spiking offence under poisoning legislation, which has a three-year potential penalty. I think it is a separate offence we are talking about in this case. I am happy to withdraw the amendment and to resubmit it on Report Stage, based on the Minister working with her officials and reflecting on the sentencing guidelines in this context. I again submit for her consideration, however, that there is a difference between poisoning and spiking. I know it may be subtle and the Minister may feel it is already covered, but I still contend there is a difference. As a committee and an Oireachtas, we must be quite sure that in our legislation anybody intending to spike a drink is looking at a sentence of ten years. I say this because it is more than poisoning. It is debilitating somebody's bodily functions for the intent of sexual assault or rape.
