AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Connaughton for raising this very important issue. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is unfortunately not available to take the Topical Issue but I am responding in his place. Prior to November 2010 member states were obliged under EU legislation to publish information - names, addresses and amounts received - on recipients of amounts paid out of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, EAGF, or European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD, CAP funds. This information was made available on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine website and, in line with EU requirements, included a search engine to permit users to search the database using different criteria.  On 9 November 2010, following its judgment in a case taken by German CAP beneficiaries, the European Court of Justice found that aspects of EU legislation requiring the publication of information on beneficiaries of CAP funds, who are natural persons, were invalid. On the day that the judgment was delivered the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine took down the CAP beneficiaries' database from its website. Following that judgment and pending the adoption of new rules taking account of the objections expressed by the court, the EU Commission adopted amending legislation in order to lay down explicitly that the obligation to publish the information on the beneficiaries does not apply to natural persons. However, they instructed member states to continue to publish information on legal persons and the Department has done so on an annual basis. Following the extensive analysis and the consultation with the stakeholders, the EU Commission determined that it was critical that any new proposal must observe a balance between the pursued objective of the public control of the use of the money from the EAGF and the EAFRD on the one hand, and the beneficiaries' right to respect for their private life in general and to protection of their personal data on the other. In September 2012 the Commission made a proposal on the publication of data on amounts received by all beneficiaries - natural and legal persons - that was intended to take account of the European Court of Justice judgment. The Commission's basic rationale was that it considered it vital to inform citizens how Union funds are being spent and that the new rules are based on a justification centred on the need for public control over the use of funds. The proposals were the subject of intensive discussion at Council meetings and subsequently in the formal discussions with the EU Commission and the European Parliament which led to the adoption of the new CAP and the legislation which underpins it. In accordance with EU legislation the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is obliged to ensure annual ex-post publication of all of the beneficiaries of CAP funding including both legal and non-legal persons. In accordance with regulations the Department must publish the name of the beneficiary, unless the amount of payment under CAP funds is less than €1,250 in which case the individual will be identified by a code; the municipality where the beneficiary is resident; the amount of payment corresponding to each measure received by a beneficiary; and the nature and description of each measure. In accordance with the regulation the Department will publish such information by the 31 May 2015 deadline. Work is currently ongoing within the Department on this issue.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy makes a fair comment about what are effectively security concerns. It is reasonable that he would make his concerns known in the House. I will convey them to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and we will see if we can make some progress.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Stanley for raising this issue and I welcome the opportunity to clarify the Government's approach to the funding of domestic violence services around the country and in the Deputy's constituency of County Laois. For the first time, with the establishment of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, domestic, sexual and gender-based violence service provision is under one body with clear national direction. Services can now be delivered within a wide child and family support framework and this represents a significant change to the previous service delivery model. In 2014, €17 million in funding was provided by the Child and Family Agency by way of grant aid to 62 specialist domestic violence and sexual violence services. These include 16 rape crisis centres-sexual violence services; 44 domestic violence services, including 20 refuges; and two national networks. In addition, funding of €2.54 million has transferred to the Department of Children and Youth Affair's Vote from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government which, in turn, has been transferred to Tusla. This funding was previously distributed under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 and is for domestic violence refuge services. The purpose of this funding transfer is to ensure that the State's relationship with the domestic violence services is managed in a manner which is more coherent and adapted to the needs of service users, that is, victims of domestic violence. In 2014, Tusla funded specialist domestic violence services in County Laois provided by Laois Domestic Abuse Services in Portlaoise. The service received €64,900 in funding from Tusla last year. As the Deputy outlined, the service involves the provision of domestic violence supports, including information, advocacy and counselling services to women experiencing, or who have experienced, domestic violence. The work of Laois Domestic Abuse Services and other community-based domestic violence services is recognised and absolutely valued. Tusla has recently completed an initial review of domestic violence and sexual violence services in order to identify strategic priorities and set out a Tusla roadmap for sexual violence and domestic violence services. There is for the first time a consolidated national budget for these services and an opportunity for more co-ordinated and equitable provision of sexual and domestic violence services across the country. Tusla will communicate with funded services shortly to advise on the Tusla budget and funding for 2015. Individual domestic violence service provider organisations, including Laois Domestic Abuse Service, will be contacted about their specific funding and service arrangements. Future planning for domestic violence and sexual violence services will seek to address gaps, avoid duplication and support effective delivery of front-line services nationally. Developments for domestic violence services in County Laois will be considered as part of Tusla's future commissioning processes. The agency has advised that population size will be one of the factors that will inform this process. Services responding to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence are being given a high priority by Government and Tusla will work closely with service providers, giving particular priority to supporting front-line services.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy made some very constructive comments and I appreciate his positivity towards what we are trying to do. His comments on the population question are appreciated. I take on board the Deputy's comments on the individual service and the need for clarity, certainty and to plan for the future. I do not think any service, in particular one that deals with such a sensitive issue as domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, should be insecure as to its future. I will take on board the Deputy's questions and get working on them to ensure the service is more confident, as it is providing an excellent service. Again, I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.
