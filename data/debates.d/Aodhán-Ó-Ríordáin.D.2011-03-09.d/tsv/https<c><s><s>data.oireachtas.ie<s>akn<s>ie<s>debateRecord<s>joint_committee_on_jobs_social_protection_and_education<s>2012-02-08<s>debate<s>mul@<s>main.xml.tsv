AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We have a quorum.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh and the Chairman, Deputy Damien English.  I remind members to switch off their mobile phones for the duration of the meeting.  Members agreed to do so at our first meeting but unfortunately not everyone adhered to it since and it has resulted in significant problems broadcasting the meetings.  I appeal to everyone to take a second to turn off their mobile phones.  We will go into private session to deal with correspondence and other housekeeping matters.The joint committee went into private session at 9.40 a.m. and resumed in public session at 9.47 a.m.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the following: Mr. Ciaran Phelan, chief executive, Irish Brokers Association; Mr. Aidan McLoughlin, managing director of the Independent Trustee Company and chairman of the Irish Brokers Association's pensions committee; Ms Linda Gallagher, First Ireland; Mr. Tom Berrigan, Davy; Mr. Gavin Howlin, Willis; and Mr. Frank Lahiffe, Lahiffe & Associates Public Affairs & Political Communications.  They are present to discuss issues and initiatives associated with private pensions.Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I thank the delegates and I invite questions.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Is there not an inherent contradiction in what the witnesses are saying?  They indicated that the average fund is €100,000, which is insufficient over a longer retirement period, yet they also advocate the reduction of restrictions on access to funds.  The result may be a reduction in the safeguards on funds which they have already accepted is not sufficient for retirement.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	How will investors be protected against making short-term decisions that have long-term consequences?  Is 25% too much?
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	What kind of restrictions does Mr. McLoughlin envisage?
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	In what way would the advice be independent?
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Phelan and his colleagues for appearing before the committee today.  One Deputy has already indicated her intention to follow this up by means of a parliamentary question and other members might do likewise in order to ascertain the Minister's thoughts on the matter.  I thank the witnesses for their contribution.  I am sure we will return to the subject again.
