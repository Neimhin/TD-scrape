AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yesterday, I wrote to the Minister for Education about the leaving certificate, asking her to clarify two matters. The first was what would happen if a student contracted Covid-19 during exam time and what contingencies are in place for that. I also asked her to waive the exam fee, which is €116 for the leaving certificate and €109 for the junior certificate, and I understand there may be some good news in that regard for the thousands of families expected to pay it. Will the Tánaiste confirm it is the intention of the Government to waive the fee for junior and leaving certificate examination students this year?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Labour Party supports Ireland's opt-in to the 2021-2027 asylum, migration and integration fund. We take issue, however, with some of the on-the-ground reality within the European Union towards refugees. Statistics released by the Greek Government and confirmed by the UNHCR set the total number of arrivals to Greece in 2021 at 8,000, of which roughly half arrived by sea. The Greek ministry for maritime affairs, however, reports more than 29,000 rescues by the Hellenic Coast Guard in the same period, with just 25,000 people remaining unaccounted for. The reality of the EU's hostility towards migrants and asylum seekers was brought into sharp focus when Irish citizen, Seán Binder, was arrested and charged for crimes carrying up to a 25-year sentence for joining other activists and NGO workers in rescuing African migrants who had got into difficulty in the Aegean Sea. There is a clear issue within the European Union with pushbacks and with migration and integration in practice. Each one of these figures is a human life, yet there are ministers in European governments parroting that it is positive to have low migration flows into Europe. This is true only if refugees are not fleeing; it is an overwhelming negative if refugees are seeking asylum but numbers remain low or decrease. It means that Europe is an unwelcome place that does not believe that desperate people deserve refuge. Ireland is not an outlier in this regard and we must do far more before we can accuse others of not pulling their weight. We in the Labour Party welcome the regularisation programme for undocumented people living in Ireland announced by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, this week. We also welcome the parallel programme being opened for people in Ireland's asylum system. Regarding the regularisation scheme, however, my colleague, Deputy Bacik, has been critical of the decision to discount time spent in the asylum system when calculating an applicant's time spent living in Ireland. Many people will find they are eligible for neither scheme as a result.We in Labour see this as punishing people for being trapped in a system which this State has acknowledged is inefficient. While the scheme is welcome and is a tribute to the work of the Green Party in government, it could have been much more generous. Last year my colleague Deputy Duncan Smith questioned the Department of Justice regarding the status of refugees and asylum seekers in direct provision and raised the potential for an amnesty to give these applicants citizenship in order to alleviate many of the very serious issues they face and enable those people to find and obtain accommodation where they could live safely during this unprecedented pandemic. We cannot allow human beings to be treated as lesser people. We must completely overhaul our asylum system and we must grant a citizenship amnesty to all asylum seekers and refugees currently resident in Ireland. We must treat all people of Ireland with dignity and respect. I support the programme announced by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and any such move is definitely progress. Why could this program not be broadened to capture more people who are living and working in Ireland in circumstances of great uncertainty? Someone who is living here, working here, paying tax here and contributing to Irish society belongs here. They are one of us; they are us. The country of céad míle fáilte has a long way to go to live up to that ethos and it begins with conversations like this. When we see these positive moves, why do we need to ask why it is limited? Every week I deal with people who are in these exact scenarios. They work in our communities and contribute to our society. Their kids play on our sports teams and are involved in local community groups. We are all richer for them. We must show basic reality and humanity and be sure we never tell somebody they do not belong. I draw the Minister's attention to a piece published in the Dublin Inquirer this week from Shamim Malekmian. Her piece highlights the ongoing failure to provide long-promised immigration detention centres. In 2021 people who were refused entry to Ireland at our borders were forced to await deportation in prisons. There is sparse information on the numbers of people who are detained in prison for this reason because data are not collected in the absence of a dedicated immigration detention facility. Such a facility was to have been opened in 2020. It is inhumane to detain people in Garda stations and prisons. Another EU directive, the return directive to which Ireland is not a signatory, requires that immigration detention must take place in a specialised facility and that all those detained should have access to legal experts and free legal aid. This is not currently in place. People detained include those seeking asylum. Seeking asylum is not a crime. It is a fundamental human right to be respected by states. Ireland should move immediately to correct this alarming situation.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 suspended a worker's right to seek redundancy payments when laid off or put on short-time work due to the pandemic. Deputy Nash of the Labour Party tabled an amendment that would have dealt with this issue at the start of the pandemic and, perhaps, saved the State some share of the burden that may now be necessarily placed upon it. At the time, we agreed not to pursue the amendment as we were assured that the issue would be dealt with and we did not wish to delay emergency legislation. The unamended Covid legislation meant that any employee who ended up being made redundant would have had time during the pandemic excluded from any calculated period of redundancy if time spent laid off or on short-time work in the final three years of redundancy was not included in the original legislation. This Bill is being introduced to ensure there is a scheme to provide a State payment to make up for any time not counted because of time spent laid off during the pandemic. The fact that workers' minimum statutory payments will be made up by the State through a payment from the Social Insurance Fund in such cases should ensure that the worker will not be out of pocket with regard to their minimum payments in the event of being made redundant having been laid off during the pandemic. This is to be welcomed. Normally, under the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, when a redundancy payment is made from the Social Insurance Fund to an employee on an employer's behalf, a debt is raised against that employer. The Department of Social Protection is legally obliged to recover such debts from the employer. If this remains the case, the State will be able to pursue solvent employers. If there is an exemption, we will unfortunately have to put an extra burden on the State, which would not have been needed if this problem had been fixed immediately. In supporting the legislation as outlined, we appreciate that, at the time, the legislation was put forward because of the need for emergency measures. However, through Deputy Nash, we made an attempt to improve the original legislation. We feel that, if we had been listened to, there would not be a need for this measure now. Perhaps in future discussions between those of us in the Opposition and the Government, the Government will appreciate that the Labour Party and other parties in the Oireachtas come to this space with the best of intentions and from a place of knowledge. That is particularly true of my colleague, Deputy Nash. In that regard, while we support the Bill, we would encourage the Government to understand that many of us in this House are genuinely here to try to improve the lot of the worker and not to cause the Government unnecessary difficulty. We support the Bill and will be making further contributions as it goes through the Houses.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is sometimes very hard to know how to articulate something that I have been campaigning on for almost seven years. Along with others, I have been convinced for a long time of the necessity for Ireland to change its drug policy. I have been working with others in other political parties, movements, lobby groups and community groups to try to get Ireland to change its view of the drug user. In all that, there is now space for us to talk as a country about the treatment we have handed down to those who have used drugs, who use drugs and who are in addiction services. There is a significant misunderstanding of the nature of drug use. We have attempted over the course of the history of the State to shame those who take drugs as much as we possibly can, and to criminalise them in an attempt to get them to stop, but that has been the most catastrophic policy failure on any level. It is an expensive disaster that causes misery, pain and death. The people who are most affected by it are the most vulnerable and powerless in Irish society. When we criminalise people for their addiction or drug use, we are actually criminalising marginalisation and disconnection because, disproportionately, the people who come into the criminal justice system as a result of being caught with something in their possession for their own personal use are from areas of disadvantage, are members of the Travelling community, are migrants or are people with disabilities. They are often people who are self-medicating trauma and pain and are trying to seek a connection. Irish society, the Irish Legislature and this State have decided to criminalise that disconnection and marginalisation in an attempt to correct that individual. It does not work. Some 70% of drug cases in front of the courts concern possession for personal use. It is a complete and utter waste of time, money and energy and it does not work.  We are waiting for the Minister of State. I and others in different parties in this Oireachtas have given him time, space and latitude to step up and be the advocate for a citizens' assembly on drugs. It would be easy for us in the Opposition to dismiss the idea of a citizens' assembly on drugs as being a mere talking shop, but my party and I decided that we had to come from a good and fair place to allow such an assembly to be established and advocate within it for what we are trying to advocate for, which is a radical overhaul of drug policy in Ireland. We are still waiting for the Minister of State and the Government to commit to establishing a citizens' assembly on drugs where we can start a proper national conversation on a failed policy and to replace it with something new. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There is a fantastic opportunity for this Oireachtas to achieve something. In recent years, a justice committee report on decriminalisation of drug users received the support of every political party. We passed radical legislation on the provision of an injecting centre. While it has been objected to, it remains law that we can establish an injecting facility in Ireland. That legislation was passed without a single objection from any Member of in this House. No one in these Houses is standing on a war-on-drugs platform or saying we need to have zero tolerance. Every Member of the Oireachtas, from what I can see, is talking about the humane treatment of the person who is addicted to drugs because of the nature of that person's struggle to overcome the reasons he or she got into addiction and the pathway that person needs to get out of it. I take great comfort from the Minister of State's answer because he is saying we will have a decision on the citizens' assembly on drugs in the coming weeks. Until this point, I have heard so many reasons we cannot have the citizens' assembly. I understand we have Covid and people want citizens' assemblies on other areas, including biodiversity and education. I understand all that. The problem here is that the people who are most acutely affected by this are probably the most powerless people in the State. There is a sense that their addiction is their own fault and there is a significant level of victim blaming. They are probably the only cohort in this land whom people can use a derogatory term to describe on any radio or television programme at any hour of the day or night and get away with it. This is why this is so important. I appreciate the Minister of State's answer, but can we get movement on this in a short time? Can we have the citizens' assembly established before the summer so that we can at least offer those who feel as if they have no voice a process to begin healing and take a new approach to drug use in Ireland?
