AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We have come a long way from the story of Anne Lovett, a girl of 15 years who died in her school uniform while giving birth to a child in 1984.  We have come a long way since a member of my own family was refused re-entry to her secondary school 20 years ago on becoming pregnant at 17 years.  Irish society has moved on, but our legislation has not.  It is important to recognise in this House that there are many schools around the country which deal with this situation every day in a compassionate, caring and understanding manner.  If we bring ourselves back to the days of Anne Lovett, we are back to a situation where we isolate and condemn and push teenage parents out of the education system.Pending the introduction of legislation, the Minister should ask the Department to issue a circular immediately to all secondary schools to advise them how to deal with such cases.  They are doing so under their own policies.  They need guidance and policy advice from the Department.  I recognise that the Minister has pre-empted this discussion by  creating a working group on admissions policies and indicating that the legislation is pending.  However, in this case, we need a circular immediately from the Department.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There are fantastic models of practice, as we have heard.  Two months ago, the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education visited a project in Tallaght which is run by Frances Chance on behalf of Barnados.  It also deals with student fathers, whose emotions also need to be cared for.  As was suggested when we visited the project, leadership is taking place within communities and schools, but it is not coming from the Department.  We are waiting for legislation on enrolment, which is fair enough.  However, we need an immediate communication from the Department to all second level schools giving policy advice on how to deal with a young student who finds herself pregnant or with a young father who may be going through emotional turmoil.  It is important we take that leadership.  I suggest the Minister of State talk to his officials and ensure it takes place.
