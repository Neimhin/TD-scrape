AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I thank Senator Darragh O'Brien. Section 1(4) applies with equal force to all four Houses of the Oireachtas officer posts under consideration in the Bill. In taking this approach the Government has in mind that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, under the chairmanship of the Ceann Comhairle, would have the latitude in the future to take decisions on the tenure of the relevant postholders which would be in the best interests of an effective and efficient Oireachtas Service. It does not see any justification for making a distinction between the Clerk of the Dáil and the other three posts. It is very conscious that if the amendment were to be accepted, there would be an anomalous position, whereby the occupant of the Clerk of the Dáil post would have a seven-year tenure, while those appointed to the other three posts after the departure of the existing occupants would potentially have a much longer tenure, until they reached normal retirement age. The Government strongly believes this would lead to much inflexibility in the management of the staff resources of the Oireachtas. It would also be at odds with practice in the public service generally. The Government and its predecessor are on record as wishing to afford the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission the opportunity to operate an homogenised management structure in the service. Explicitly mentioning in legislation the authority of the commission to specify lengths of tenure for the four main officer of the Houses posts is a significant step in this direction. The Government believes its proposals will amount to a significant transfer of power from the Executive to the Legislature, as in the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. The Taoiseach is heavily involved in the process. The commission is representative of parliamentarians and will be fully attuned to their needs and demands. I draw Senators' attention to the fact that under the terms of the proposed legislation successful nominees for the posts of Clerk of the Seanad, Clerk Assistant of the Dáil and Clerk Assistant of the Seanad will be confined to serving members of the Oireachtas Service. This gives me very solid grounds for expecting that the successful candidates will have a wide experience of parliamentary and electoral procedure and the work of the various commissions such as the SIPO and the Referendum Commission, with which they are associated. The Government does not share the concerns expressed about adverse consequences for the work of these commissions or the conduct of elections. When the tenure of the holder of any of the three posts I have mentioned ends, the commission will be at liberty to decide whether to maintain the postholder in his or her posting or transfer him or her to a post in the Oireachtas. A significant number of posts in the service are of equivalent rank such as principal officer or assistant principal officer. In the light of the points I have made, the Government is not prepared to accept the amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank Senators for their contributions. I appreciate where people are coming from in respect of this issue.  Senator Darragh O'Brien mentioned the Ceann Comhairle. The Ceann Comhairle is the chairman of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, not just the Dáil, and the commission is representative of parliamentarians. This Government and the previous one are anxious to give the commission maximum flexibility. That is the motivation behind the Bill. As in every other facet of the public service, flexibility is required, and we are trying to ensure we can maximise the potential for flexibility. In terms of the points being made about fixed terms - I did give the example of seven years - Secretaries General of Departments are also appointed for fixed terms; therefore, there is a precedent for this within the public service.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I would like to respond to the reasonable questions asked about the office of the Clerk of the Seanad. Under the Bill, there are positions in the Oireachtas to which the Clerk of the Seanad could be transferred. While I appreciate that the Opposition amendment is intended to be constructive, its effect would be to leave officers in office for life without that mobility. It would leave the Clerk of the Seanad, for example, in office for life. I do not think that is necessarily the intention of the amendment, but it would be its effect.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is my understanding, based on the advice we have been given, that it is not unusual for principal officers in the public service to have fixed terms.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I reiterate that it is the intention to fill the posts from within the Oireachtas. The main reason I do not propose to accept the amendment is that the proposal, if implemented, would leave officers in situ for life.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Senator and I will not agree on this issue. To be constructive, I will repeat the advice available to me. The current arrangement under the 1959 Act is left in place, which means that the Clerk of the Seanad can remain until the age of 65 years.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank Senator Darragh O'Brien and the Leader of the House for coming to an accommodation on the previous amendment. I remind Senators that it is always a benefit to everyone if the hyperbole is kept to a minimum. To suggest this will rock the very foundations of the entire public service is stretching it seeing as the legislation only affects the Oireachtas. On the matter raised by Senator Paul Bradford, it was discussed when the Bill was proceeding through the Dáil. The Government was not prepared to accept the amendment proposed in that Chamber and is not prepared to do so now. It is because it is not believed there is any justification for transferring responsibility for this matter to the Secretary General. The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has a statutory function in preparing guidelines for Members in the use of accommodation following dissolutions. The office of the superintendent supports the commission in carrying out its statutory function. Following on from this, the matter of accommodation is for the Chief Whip and the other Whips. In the event of difficulties, the matter is decided upon by the Ceann Comhairle in his capacity as chairperson of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. The Ceann Comhairle's decision is final. The proposed amendment will reduce the powers of the Ceann Comhairle and the commission and the Government would be unwilling to become involved in the matter which is for the Legislature to deal with. In addition, implementation of the proposal would lead to the Secretary General and Clerk of the Dáil being caught up in a political matter.My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, stated in the Dáil:[T]he proposed amendment would, in my judgment, ultimately reduce the powers of the independently elected Chair of Dáil Éireann to make decisions in the event of disagreements or disputes. My honest view of what is right is this is a better way than giving it to any administrator who would be caught in a political controversy ... and this is not a fair or reasonable place to put any administrator in the House.This remains the Government view and, accordingly, I am not prepared to accept the amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	In accordance with Standing Order 136, I wish to direct the Clerk to make a number of minor drafting corrections to the text of the Bill. They are corrections of a verbal or formal nature which are being made in the interests of textual clarity and do not result in any change to the substantive meaning of that text. The changes are as follows: in page 3 of the Bill, line 26, to delete the comma after "respects"; in page 3 of the Bill, line 27, to delete the comma after "insolvent debtors"; in page 24 of the Bill, line 8, to delete "the" where it secondly occurs; in page 33 of the Bill, line 28, to delete the colon after "modifications" and replace it with a dash; in page 33 of the Bill, line 31, to delete the semicolon after "arrangement" and replace it with a comma; in page 33 of the Bill, line 33, to delete the semicolon after "section" and replace it with a comma; and in page 34 of the Bill, line 1, to delete "the" where it secondly occurs.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No; the amendments concern different lines in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	They were actually notified to the Bills Office.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We can make copies available.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I can clarify.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 1 seeks to delete text from an amendment to section 91 of the principal Act. The effect of the Senators' amendment is to remove the reference in the principal Act to co-operation with the MARP before a borrower makes a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement. I thank the Senators for their amendment, but I cannot accept it. Under the existing section 91(1), a borrower must first co-operate with the mortgage lender under the MARP approved by the Central Bank, before he or she can make a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement. If the borrower does so, but is not able to agree a restructure with the mortgage lender, he or she is then eligible to propose a personal insolvency arrangement. The current provision does not address the situation of a borrower who has been in mortgage arrears on his or her home, has co-operated with the MARP and has subsequently entered a restructure, whether MARP or non-MARP, but the restructure has failed, or is unsustainable, and the borrower remains insolvent. It is important that a borrower in this situation should be eligible to make a PIA proposal. This section of the Bill is designed to expand the categories of person who can apply under section 91 and to ensure there is no bar to an insolvent borrower in such a restructured mortgage situation being eligible to make a PIA proposal. This section, therefore, already seeks to significantly enlarge the categories of persons who may apply for a personal insolvency arrangement and to ensure a person in a restructured home mortgage will be able to do so. To remove the link to co-operation with the MARP for any borrower wishing to propose a PIA goes well beyond the scope of the amendment and would require very full policy consideration, not least due to its possible negative effects on incentives for borrowers to engage as early as possible with their lenders regarding any repayment difficulties.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I can confirm that.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 2 seeks to delete section 21(18) of the Bill, which defines "relevant debt" for the purpose of a court review. The effect of the Senator's amendment would be to remove the definition of the type of debt that may be the subject of an application for the new court review. I thank the Senator for his amendment, but I cannot accept it. First, this amendment risks creating legal uncertainty. Subsection (1) already provides that the new court review refers to a person with a relevant debt. Removing the definition would risk leaving it unclear who could apply for a review. This uncertainty has to be avoided, particularly given the urgency of making the review available to borrowers in long-term arrears who urgently need solutions. Second, the definition of "relevant debt" in subsection (18) targets the review at those who are most in need - people who are in mortgage arrears on their home or in a restructure of such arrears which has not returned them to solvency. It is the Government's policy to prioritise this group. Removing the definition could open up the review to any person proposing a personal insolvency arrangement, including a person whose difficulties relate, for example, to five buy-to-let properties. This may seem superficially attractive. However, it would carry a risk of legal uncertainty.  I strongly underline that the Government's proposal has been very carefully designed and balanced to take full account of the very difficult legal territory of potentially providing for imposed solutions which could impinge on the property rights of secured lenders. Following extensive deliberation and legal advice, the Government believes the Bill is constitutionally robust. An important element, however, is that the Bill concentrates on risk to the borrower’s home where the social policy justification for Government intervention, both regarding the borrower and the implications for public housing and other public policies, is at its strongest. To make the changes proposed by the Senators would disturb this careful balance and risk opening up the Bill to legal challenges. That would be extremely damaging to the situation of homeowners in serious mortgage arrears who are in urgent need of solutions. For these reasons, the Government cannot accept the proposed amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Senator for his contribution. I am advised that the review is limited to arrears before January 2015 or restructures of such arrears to prevent negative implications for new mortgage lending. Extending the new review to arrears built up from this year onwards would risk increasing mortgage interest rates on new lending, something we are determined to avoid.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I will stick to my speaking note, even though I am very tempted to move off script. I understand Senators are opposing this section. I understand they are ideologically opposed to the provisions of the Bill which deal with attachment of earnings and deductions from social welfare payments. I will briefly outline the purpose of section 1. Section 1 is the definitions section of the Bill. Among the terms defined is "net scheme payments", which is required for the purposes of dealing with deductions from certain social welfare payments. "Debt" is defined as not including debts arising from the repayment of loans to a debtor made by a bank, credit union, moneylender or credit card debt. It is important to note that "net scheme payments" is a definition which protects those on social welfare because it ensures the deductions from a social welfare recipient's payments do not dip below the basic social welfare rate.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I note that Senators are also opposed to section 2. Section 2 is a standard provision relating to the making of regulations under the Bill when enacted. The Minister for Justice and Equality will be making a commencement order under the provisions of section 27. Under section 7(4), the Minister for Social Protection may, by regulations, prescribe the verifying certificate. In sections 24(1) and (2) the Minister for Social Protection, with the consent of the Minister for Justice and Equality, may, by regulations, prescribe a social welfare scheme for the purposes of deductions under this legislation.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I understand Senators are opposed to the section which deals with the statement of the debtor’s means. I appreciate that they are trying to be as constructive as possible. Section 7 sets out the requirements in relation to the information to be provided to the court by the judgment debtor on his or her financial circumstances. In order for the court to establish the debtor’s capacity to pay, it must have sufficient information on the debtor’s circumstances, including his or her financial circumstances. The judgment debtor, on receipt of a notice under section 6, is required to complete a statement of means providing details of his or her income and financial commitments. Where the debtor is a social protection recipient, he or she will be required to request a certificate from the Department of Social Protection verifying his or her payments. This ensures the court has accurate information on the debtor’s social protection payments to assist it in coming to a view on affordability. This certificate will outline, in particular, what portion of the payment is personal to the debtor, what portion is in respect of his or her dependants, and whether there are any deductions being made from the social protection payment. The certificate will not be disclosed by the court to the judgment creditor. The court is empowered to request further supporting documentation from the debtor, or his or her employer, if so required. The statement of means provided for the court and the verifying certificate from the Department of Social Protection shall be admissible in evidence. Senators also referred to the statement of means.The statement of means will be drawn up under rules of court. It will be along the lines of the forms in use in family maintenance cases and those which will be introduced in the context of attachment of earnings orders for the payment of criminal fines. The debtor’s personal public service number, PPSN, will not be shared with the creditor or the court. This was made clear in the amendments the Minister tabled on Report Stage in the Dáil. It is not possible for these matters to be dealt with in camera. The legal system operates on the basis that justice must be seen to be done in public. Accordingly, there are limited circumstances in which court hearings may be held in camera. It is not the case that an employer will see all of a debtor’s private financial information. The employer will be served with the court order by the creditor. It will set out what deductions must be made over a specified period, as set out in section 10(6). It will not give the debtor’s financial information. Is the debtor having to provide a copy of his or her completed statement of means to the creditor, as well as to the court, a breach of the debtor’s privacy? It is normal in civil cases to have an exchange of documents between the parties concerned. However, the statement of means which is to be prescribed under the rules of court and the verifying certificate which is to be prescribed by the Minister for Social Protection will have to be drawn up carefully in order that sensitive information on the debtor is not disclosed. I appreciate the sensitivity of these issues and hope I have clarified matters for the Senators.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Section 9 provides that an attachment of earnings order and a deduction from social welfare payments order cannot be run concurrently in respect of the same judgment debt. In the event that a debtor is in receipt of a social welfare payment and earnings, the court can only make an order in respect of one income stream.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Before I deal with section 10, I understand a correction by the Clerk is required under Standing Order 136. On page 12, line 9, paragraph (f) of section 10(6), as it stands, contains an incorrect cross-reference to paragraph (c). It should, of course, be paragraph (d). I would be grateful, therefore, if this typographical error could be corrected by the Clerk. Amendment No. 1 seeks the deletion of the existing subsection 10(3) and its substitution with new text which seeks to provide that the court shall be guided by the Insolvency Service of Ireland's reasonable living expenses guidelines when making an attachment of earnings order. I can understand the Senators' concerns around this issue. As I said on Second Stage, there is nothing to prevent the court from having regard to those guidelines if they so wish, but there is no need to make such a provision in the Bill. When I spoke about this matter on Second Stage, I said I thought it was preferable to allow the court full discretion in assessing a debtor's capacity to repay a debt. Individual circumstances will vary from debtor to debtor, and the court should be allowed to make its own decision relating to these matters. While I understand the motivation of the Senators who have proposed the amendment, they may well find that the court has more latitude in determining living expenses and may be more generous to debtors if it is not obliged to have regard to the Insolvency Service of Ireland's guidelines.  As I said during the Second stage debate, reasonable living expenses have a different context in respect of personal insolvency. The Bill deals with the debtor's capacity to pay money that he or she owes to a creditor. Its provisions ensure the court will have sufficient information available to it relating to the person's financial circumstances. The court is also obliged to take into account any representations the debtor may make in relation to his or her circumstances. It is important to remember that the courts already have a body of expertise relating to this matter and they will approach it in a sensible manner. There is nothing to prevent a court from having regard to the Insolvency Service of Ireland's guidelines, if it so wishes. There is simply no need to make an explicit provision for this in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	While I appreciate that the Senators are coming at this from the point of view of being constructive, we will have to agree to disagree.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the motivation of Senators in tabling the amendments. It is fair enough and these issues should be examined in detail when dealing with legislation of this nature. I have no difficulty with this whatsoever. The section deals with compliance with an attachment order. The employer is required to comply with the order but is not liable for non-compliance during the first ten days. This is to allow for a situation where the person served with the order is not the person's employer, in which case the person concerned is required to notify the court accordingly. Provision is also made in subsection (4) for a situation where the debtor changes employment. Subsection (5) provides that the lapse of an order under subsection (4) does not prevent it remaining in force for other purposes. With regard to employer and employee relations, employees are protected by unfair dismissal legislation and other employment law. The Attorney General has advised that unfair dismissal issues are already covered in Irish law and protections are adequate to deal with any issues which might arise regarding any attempt to discriminate against somebody solely on the basis of being the subject of an attachment of earnings order or, as the Senators mentioned, the possibility that a prospective employer might not employ someone because he or she is subject to an attachment of earnings order. We will monitor the situation very closely because we appreciate the statements made by Senators. Should any difficulties of this nature emerge we will take action to ensure it does not continue. It is important to say attachment of earnings orders are common in other countries such as the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, and Australia. Irish employers are already required to implement attachment of earnings orders for family maintenance and recovery of social protection overpayments. This is not necessarily new ground.
