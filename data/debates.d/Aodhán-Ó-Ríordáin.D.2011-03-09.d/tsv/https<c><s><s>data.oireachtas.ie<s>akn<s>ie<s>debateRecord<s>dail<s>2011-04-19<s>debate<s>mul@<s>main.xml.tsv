AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I note the programme for Government states that people of non-faith or minority religious backgrounds and publicly identified lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual people should not be deterred from training or taking up employment as teachers in the State. This is a clear reference to section 37 of the Equality Act. When will an amendment to that legislation come before the House so that the discriminatory practices of some schools can be outlawed?
