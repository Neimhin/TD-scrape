AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I do not intend to go over too many points which have already been well made.  As a country, Ireland has a unique opportunity to view what is happening in the Arab states and the north African countries which have been to the forefront of media commentary and international events in the past while.  As a widely respected voice in international affairs, Ireland can comment and it is important that we make our voice known in the unfolding events.  This reminds me very much of what happened in the late 1980s and early 1990s in eastern Europe, and as Deputy Costello has correctly stated, there is something of an Arab spring about what is happening in Tunisia, Egypt and now in Libya.I have no difficulty in supporting Resolution 1970 or Resolution 1973 and I am quite happy there is a UN mandate for the actions taking place.  The key word is proportionality, and everything that we are seen to support as a country should be done in a measured fashion.  There is a danger in the perception that the international community only intervenes when an oil-rich country is at stake.  If we are intent on supporting those at risk of genocide, will we always act in such a way in every country where there is such a risk?  We know that the international community has been very slow in making interventions when they were needed.In supporting Resolution 1973 the proportionality aspect is absolutely key.  We must be seen to protect those under threat and to prevent the excesses of the Gadaffi regime.  We should not be seen to support any attempt at regime change, which is not what the resolution is about.  It would be very easy for somebody with non-Western sympathies to get the idea that a force led by France, the UK, the US and others would have the intention of regime change but we do not want to support the idea.  There should be a key message from this House that proportionality is everything and the protection of those at risk of genocide is absolutely everything, although we are not into regime change or forcing our will as an international community on anybody.Russia and China are very unhappy with the implementation of this resolution, although those countries have human rights records which are nothing to shout about either.  The Arab League is now also uneasy, and a number of African nations — South Africa in particular — have issues with how the resolution has come into effect.Our history in international relations is proud and our ability to comment is without any stain of colonialism but we must be careful.  While we commend the actions of the international community, protecting the most vulnerable and ensuring nothing happens on our watch that we have influence to stop, we should ensure that everything is done with proportionality and that we are never seen to impose our will or try to influence internal matters of another country.  It is an exciting time to be involved in politics and see what people power can achieve but proportionality is key to what is happening with this resolution.Deputy Costello has already mentioned the humanitarian aid we are affording to the Libyan cause.  It is right and we should carry on with it.  We must know checks and balances exist in the system and that the claim made by British Prime Minister David Cameron can be backed up.  He argued that the action in Libya by the UK and others is legal, necessary and right.We are happy to support Resolution 1973, as I am sure other Government colleagues will.  We must consider how to move on from this and if there is an endgame.  Have we considered what will happen when the current period of conflict finishes?  Is there any potential for those who want the excesses of Gadaffi stopped to be open to an accusation that his excesses will be replaced by those of Western military forces?  The key to the issue is proportionality and how we use our international voice to ensure we make points forcibly.
