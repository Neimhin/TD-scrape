AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  It is great to see Mr. David Connolly, in particular, at a meeting of this nature.  The witnesses referred to the need for meaningful engagement on this issue.  What engagement has there been until now and what would they consider to be meaningful engagement that might lead to a resolution of the problem?
