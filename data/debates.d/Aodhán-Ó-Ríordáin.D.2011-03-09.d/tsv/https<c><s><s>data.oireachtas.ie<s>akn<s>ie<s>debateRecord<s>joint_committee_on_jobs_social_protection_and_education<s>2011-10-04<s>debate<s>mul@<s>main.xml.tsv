AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for their interesting presentations.  The points system is horrendous, as it kills creativity, abolishes all need for independent thought and has created a scenario in second level schools whereby people scramble around for the requisite points to enter into whatever third level courses they want.  Students are pressured by parents and teachers to get grinds, eat up notes and spit them out onto a page.  However, the system is fair, transparent and trusted.  In a country like Ireland where there is a whiff of corruption around pretty much everything, it is nice to know that we have a system in which people have faith.  The 1999 points commission was referred to, but it did not devise an option that was viable at the time.  If we are to change the system, can we be sure that people's faith in it will be retained?  Will the witnesses expand on the suggestion that, in terms of literacy and numeracy, English and mathematics should be mandatory for the calculation of points and qualification for third level?Professor Scott asked about ICT in third level.  I would be interested in hearing more on this matter, as I have strong opinions on the level of technology and science tuition in primary school teaching colleges.  That level may have changed since I attended college, but not radically so.  Heavy emphasis is placed on Irish and religion much to the detriment of English and science.  Will the witnesses comment on this matter?
