AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I congratulate the Government and the Taoiseach and, in particular, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton. Last night's events in Leinster House were particularly emotional, particularly for anybody who witnessed what happened in the Dáil. After years of people complaining, the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government and the State, formally recognised the ethnicity of the Traveller community. What happened is great credit to a number of people in this House. In particular, I want to mention Senator Mac Lochlainn who, along with me and others, pursued this issue through the offices of what was then the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in recent years. The Senator produced a report for the committee which advocated in favour of ethnicity being recognised. The report in question enjoyed cross-party support. What was wonderful about last night, and many here might agree, was that a debate on any Traveller issue in this House or in the Lower House 20 years ago would not necessarily have involved people speaking with one voice. However, last night every political leader from every political party was absolutely in agreement with the statement that was made. It was incredibly emotional. I want to pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton. Senator Kelleher, Senator Mac Lochlainn and I have been meeting the Minister of State regularly over the past year, encouraging him and getting updates on progress in respect of what he was trying to achieve, and he did it. He is to be commended for that. For those who may have had an academic argument or discussion as to the reason for recognition of ethnicity, if they could see the emotion from the Traveller groups last night in the Gallery, the standing ovation they got from Members of Dáil Éireann, the tears that were shed and the hugs and embraces that were engaged in - it was quite remarkable. Sometimes in this House we might lose faith in politics. I know that the Traveller groups had their faith in the political system sorely tested over the past number of years. They have experienced tragedies, as we all know. I am of the view that yesterday was a start of a new engagement and provides a positive platform to engage on a number of issues over the coming years. I want to put on the record of the House my congratulations to the Government, to the Taoiseach - who spoke so beautifully, including a phrase in Cant - but particularly to the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton. When someone does the work and makes the difference, he or she is to be commended and I want to do that today.
