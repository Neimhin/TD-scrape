AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister and Ministers of State for their attendance.  Will the Minister comment on attempts to combat the black economy and the effect of the black economy on compliant small-time builders and tradespeople?  With regard to last week's judgment on JLCs, will the Minister comment on his contact with the social partners?  Has contact intensified as a result of the judgment?  The impact of large multiples on the outskirts of towns has been raised.  Will the Minister also comment on the groceries order and the impact of below-cost selling of alcohol on small-scale off-licences?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	My point is that the abolition of the groceries order is being used to drive come people out of business.  Has the Minister considered investigating this issue?  I used the sale of alcohol as an example.  It is not the issue itself.
