AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I, too, welcome Mr. Clark and wish him every success in his new role.  I urge him to use the resource of this committee if it can be of benefit to him in his new role.  If he wishes to discuss elements of the challenges that face him, we would be happy to do that.  This forum tends to be non-party-political.  Every member of the committee is committed to education and, as Deputy McConalogue said, we are trying to get through a huge body of reform.  Often the challenge is to bring people with us and to face up to accusations of reform for the sake of reform.  When one considers what is happening at primary and second levels and the Bill going through the House at present, there is a huge amount of change and there is much concern surrounding that change.  If this committee can be of benefit to Mr. Clark, engagement such as this would be very important.
