AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I can speak to amendments Nos. 10, 36, 39, 49 and 215. I will first make some general comments about some of the contributions that have been made. I have to concur with much of what Senator Ivana Bacik said. This legislation is trying to clean up an area of public policy that has robustly failed over quite a prolonged period. We have had a Bill kicking around the place for 12 to 15 years. Finally, we have taken the protection piece out of that legislation in order to ensure new applicants have a more transparent and quicker protection process. The biggest problem with our system has been identified. Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh seems to be confusing this Bill with a direct provision Bill. This is not a direct provision Bill. Last week he wanted to abolish direct provision, with no sense of how he was going to house thousands of asylum seekers. He would just leave them go homeless and put them on the housing lists, I suppose, with no provision whatsoever for them. Now he is trying to conflate the two issues again. I stand over absolutely everything I said that the Senator has just quoted back to me, and more. This protection Bill is an effort to ensure we do not have people languishing in direct provision for years on end, or children growing up in it. That is the whole point of the exercise. I will attest to the recommendations of the working group on the protection system, which reported not just on direct provision but on the whole system. That was the whole point of the working group. I hate to remind Senators, but about 4,000 people who are seeking asylum here are not in direct provision. "The early enactment and implementation of a single procedure by way of the International Protection Bill as a matter of urgency" is one recommendation made in the report. Another is: "As an additional safeguard, an annual review of the system with a view to making recommendations to guard against any future backlogs...". Both recommendations are covered in the general aims of the Bill. The report also states: "The review should also look at the option of reducing the five year mark in future years as appropriate." That is in the general aims of the Bill. It also states: "Where the State does not opt-in to an instrument for discrete reasons [...], the State should give full effect to the remaining provisions in order to safeguard important common standards and to promote consistency in the application of protection procedures and standards across the EU". Again, that is in the Bill. "The International Protection Bill 2015 should reflect the general principle contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child"; that is outlined also. "The International Protection Bill should clearly provide that all children have the right to lodge an application for international protection"; that is provided for in sections 14, 15, 34, 35 and 57. "In relation to separated children, work should be undertaken to clarify the position with regard to access to the protection process in practice and age assessment procedures"; that is provided for in sections 14, 24 and 57. I can go on if the Senators wish me to do so. "The International Protection Bill 2015 should be further scrutinised to ensure the rights of the child to be heard are given sufficient expression and protection"; that is provided for in sections 14, 15, 24, 34, 35 and 57. These are all recommendations from the working group report which are dealt with in the Bill. Remarkably, some NGOs and others have contacted me to say the working group report is on a shelf somewhere and is not being implemented. It is the only game and the only document in town. There is no other document or piece of paper from which anybody in the Department, including me and the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is working. That is the document we are using to drive though reforms in this area. "The International Protection Bill 2015 should contain a provision requiring decision-makers who take decisions in relation to children and those who interview them to have received and continue to receive appropriate procedural and substantive training"; that is provided for in sections 34 and 35. More of the recommendations are included in sections 15, 34, 35, 47, 57, 61, 62, 64, 72 and so on. Twenty-six of the recommendations are provided for. I might also say some of these recommendations will make other recommendations null and void.This is because if one gets people out of the system within six months, the entire idea of having access to the labour market after nine months will no longer be relevant, because everyone will have gone through the system by then. The entire point of what the Government is trying to achieve with this legislation is to ensure the avoidance of the inhumane reality of people living in centres for years on end. That is the entire point of this protection Bill because, as Members will be aware, the numbers are increasing. That is a fact, not a value judgment. While it used to be the case that Ireland dealt with numbers in the hundreds, it now is dealing with numbers in the thousands. This is simply what is being dealt with and is the way it is. This year, the number should be something greater than 3,500. That is not a value judgment; it is simply a statement of fact. The Government is trying to clean up the system under which there are 34 asylum centres nationwide, and has acknowledged that Ireland must opt into a system from which we previously had an opt-out clause. We must opt in and accept 4,000 refugees into Ireland because that is the humane thing to do, and meanwhile, an increasing number of people are coming here to claim asylum. The Bill will enable the Government to deal with that situation in a much more humane and compassionate fashion than has been the case in the past. I ask the Senator to not confuse the two issues - direct provision and the protection Bill. I am talking about what the Government is trying to do. The assumption is that somehow, within this legislation, the Government can deal with the system of direct provision. The entire point of this legislation is that people can be assessed quickly, humanely and transparently within a short time in order that they are not obliged to spend endless years in direct provision centres. I might also note that it does not matter what conditions are available in direct provision - I absolutely agree they must be robustly changed and improved in many of the centres - because people do not wish to live in them; they want to get a decision on their application. This is what they seek. The last point I will make, because the suggestion was that the Government is somehow keeping from people these recommendations and their effect on the Bill, is that officials from the Department worked on that document over the weekend to ensure it was available for Senators today. The documents were sitting in a pile outside the Chamber when I came in, which some Senators obviously did not notice on their way into the Chamber.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On amendment No. 10-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On amendment No. 10, I unfortunately cannot agree with Senator Jillian van Turnhout’s proposed amendment, which links with the recommendations of the working group. While the recommendation is desirable and I fully support its intent, the working group did not consider the potential impact on other areas of this Bill, including the fact that the Bill refers to the protection process and certain immigration provisions. Following extensive legal advice, I am satisfied the provisions in the Bill both ensure the intent of the recommendations and fulfil the policy of a Government that enabled such a protection to be included in the Constitution, as the Senator mentioned. The Senator’s amendments do not legally satisfy the advices the Government has been given and would have unintended consequences beyond the scope intended, which the Government cannot resolve at this Stage. The Government will continue to explore avenues to reassure all those who rightfully advocate for children’s rights that this Bill will ensure the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in the Irish protection process, ensuring that the best practice followed in our process will be embedded in the practices that result from the enactment of the Bill. While the Government was minded to accept this amendment and wished to so do, the advice of the Attorney General was to the contrary. However, the Government will not leave matters there and will work collectively with the Senator and others to ensure it can go some way towards what Senator Jillian van Turnhout is trying to achieve at a further Stage of the Bill. I cannot agree with amendment No. 36. Accompanied children are in the care of an adult who is taking responsibility for their care and protection, while unaccompanied children are in the care of the Child and Family Agency which has adequate safeguards for the best interests of the child.  I cannot agree with amendment No. 39, as it is appropriate that this legislation provide for the taking of such fingerprints, if necessary, under appropriate supervision. Unfortunately, I cannot agree to the proposed amendment No. 49. The appropriate safeguards in this regard already are in place and if there are doubts with regard to the age of an applicant, the Child and Family Agency is contacted immediately. Members of An Garda Síochána and immigration officers are well trained in this area and can be expected to err on the side of caution in dealing with matters in this regard.  I, unfortunately, cannot agree with amendment No. 215, as to include a general omnibus provision as suggested would amount to partial incorporation in the State of Article 33(1) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.This would give rise to potentially discriminatory aspects in respect of Article 8 ECHR decision-making.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Not at all.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Senator cannot do that.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	If Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh spoke to the Bill-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Senator clearly does not understand what he is talking about. I am embarrassed for him.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am embarrassed for him. He does not know what he is talking about.I cannot debate an issue with a Senator who does not know what he is talking about.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Senator does not have a clue what he is talking about.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This is the International Protection Bill. It is not a Bill that deals with the direct provision system. I will try to explain it to the Senator in the simplest possible terms. The direct provision system is one in which a person resides while awaiting a decision. The International Protection Bill is about the system through which the person can get that decision. They are two very separate issues. If the Senator does not understand that then-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment as the Bill already provides for the service of documents to legal representatives where appropriate.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This is a minor amendment which deals with the revocation of the list of statutory instruments which are part of the existing legal framework for international protection. An additional four statutory instruments are added to the list by the amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I totally understand the motivation behind these amendments. I do not, however, agree with them. In respect of amendments Nos. 13 and 14 this section of the Bill is in line with the EU qualifications directive. The list contained in section 7 is not exhaustive. Amendments Nos. 201, 203, 204, 211 and 212 relate to permissions given to family members of qualified persons. The category of person referred to in the proposed amendments has other remedies available, either by changing his or her residency permission or under the Immigration Act 1999. In respect of amendment No. 214 the list contained in this section is not exhaustive. Other forms of violence or abuse will be taken into account when dealing with international protection applications from vulnerable persons. I can appreciate the sentiment behind the amendments but cannot accept them.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will not accept the amendment, although I appreciate the sentiment behind it because the list provided for in the Bill is not exhaustive and is in line with the European Union asylum qualification directive.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Bill is in line with the European Union asylum qualification directive. Whatever is in it, we are in line with. The list as provided for in the Bill is not exhaustive and, therefore, it can be used a defence or a ground for asylum application.It is not listed because having a list of such groups would indicate that any element that was omitted would not be grounds for such an application. The point is that the list in the Bill is not exhaustive, but we are in line with the European Union asylum qualification directive.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We are not accepting the amendment, as all applicants are entitled to legal assistance within the meaning of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	These are largely technical and drafting amendments. There are some differences between each one, which I can go through in detail, if Senators require. In general, these amendments are technical in nature and their purpose is more appropriate drafting.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I can speak to amendment Nos. 22 to 25, inclusive, together?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We cannot accept the proposed amendment as we are concerned that the suggested amendment is too narrow. A child may be accompanied by a responsible person not covered in the text of the suggested amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I, unfortunately, cannot accept the proposed amendment. The purpose of this provision is to stop applicants making claims on behalf of their children in their own right after their own cases have been completed, in an effort to frustrate the process and delay their removal from the State.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will not agree to the amendment as a person arriving at the frontier of the State who is an unaccompanied minor will be referred to the Child and Family Agency which will decide what is in his or her best interests. It will make a decision on his or her behalf based on the information and legal advice available to it.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I have huge sympathy with the amendment as laid down. With all the groups I deal with in regard to my equality brief, be they Travellers, migrants or in the gender equality or LGBT sphere, the issue of work is central to people's sense of self-worth and I agree that we are out of step with international best practice when it comes to allowing asylum seekers access to the labour market. This has led to misinformation and to a misunderstanding within the wider Irish public of the rights and entitlements of those who come to Ireland seeking protection. When they are not seen to be working and actively engaged in the labour market, there is an assumption that they are not willing to work. This is an issue we need to address. Unfortunately, the amendments will not be accepted today because they are linked to recommendations in the working group report. An analysis of the recommendations contained in the report of the working group has been prepared for the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Sector Reform but no decision has been made on the issue. There are economic and social implications to the provision that extend outside the remit of the Bill, so we are waiting for the Cabinet committee decision on the matter. I understand the Senator's reasons for pushing this amendment and would do the same in his position. However, the issue is not dead, it is for consideration. If we are successful in the implementation of this Bill and if we succeed in bringing about a system where people do not remain in it for more than six months, the recommendations set out in the amendment for access to the labour market within nine months would automatically follow.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I do not.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I do not.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will speak to the amendment again. On the one hand, there is a suggestion that we have not done anything while, on the other, there is a suggestion this is being rushed through. As Senators have said, I assumed this position in July 2014. Since then, regardless of the number of visits I have made to individual centres, we made two cast-iron commitments in the statement of Government priorities at the time. One was the enactment of a protection Bill. Time is running out for the Oireachtas. We could easily say we have a range of other things we need to work on and this is something we just have to leave. That would not be the responsible thing to do. I completely accept that people may be frustrated by the length of time and the number of amendments we have to go through on a Monday in the Seanad before the Bill goes to the Dáil. However, as a person with responsibility in this area, I feel keenly that we should do it, take responsibility for it and ensure this Government does it. I hope we will be in a position to form a Government in the next Oireachtas, but I cannot be sure about that. While the Minister and I have responsibility for this area, it is our duty to oversee legislation that will take a much more humane approach to people who come to this land and seek protection. The second point relates to the absolute commitment we made in terms of direct provision. People are again suggesting that the direct provision report on the protection process is on a shelf somewhere. It is being implemented. In respect of the quote that the more conservative recommendations are being implemented-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----we do not have hierarchies of recommendations. We go through recommendations and take every single one of them very seriously and-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We are implementing the report and its recommendations.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	If Senators want to join me in visiting the centres I visit, they will see the difference that is being made, the percentage of applications that are being processed in a favourable manner, the number of deportation orders that have been quashed and the fact the implementation of the working group's report is being felt in centres throughout the country by people affected by this. There has been a 60% increase in the number of applicants getting leave to remain since July while more than 80 deportation orders have been revoked. The implementation of the working group report is a priority for the Government. It is the only game in town and it would be a derogation of duty if we did not oversee the implementation of the Bill which will ensure we do not have people languishing in centres such as direct provision centres because their applications will be processed in a speedy fashion. On the amendment, I completely accept and understand where Senators are coming from. This is an issue I will pursue, not in the context of the Bill but outside it. I appreciate the sentiments that have been expressed. We are outside the European norm when it comes to workplace rights in terms of those seeking protection in this country. To suggest that by voting down the amendment, we are somehow rejecting the right to work does not stand up.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There is more than just this Bill when it comes to the working group's report.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am pre-empting the Senator's-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I have a good guess.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In response to Senator David Norris, the rights of the child are implicit and explicit throughout this Bill. As for amendment No. 31, I again revert to the entire point of the Bill, which is that someone who is seeking asylum in this country, be that an asylum seeker or someone seeking protection, will, as a result of the Bill, be in the system for six months. Therefore, all these reasonable issues that have been raised will only be for a relatively short time and not the years and years as in the current position.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Members are giving examples from the current position which is not working, as opposed to the position the Government hopes and expects will work when somebody is in the system for a number of months only. I also note it is very seldom that an applicant is made subject to reporting requirements and there normally is a good reason for this. In practice, An Garda Síochána already takes account of the person's circumstances in this regard.  The Government cannot agree to the Senator's amendment as the existing provision adequately balances the needs of the State and the circumstances of the individual. However, to again underline the point, in the Bill the Government seeks to ensure the avoidance of people spending years in the system. Instead, they will spend six months in the system and, therefore, all those other circumstances being raised by Members will not be as big an issue because the length of time will be reduced greatly.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In effect.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is not specified in the Bill that applications will be processed within six months. There is no specific timeline in the Bill but the entire intent of the Bill is to ensure the putting in place of a single procedure to avoid a repeat of what I might suggest is the current chaotic system.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The intent is for six months. I totally accept the Senator's point that the system of direct provision, for example, was supposed to be a six-month holding measure, but it has turned into a long-term solution, if one likes. It is just like how, when rent allowance initially was brought in, it was meant to be an emergency payment for people at risk of homelessness but has turned into a 12 year or 15 year social housing provision. The intent is that a new application will be processed in the first instance within six months and then processed to finality within 12 months. As that is the intent, we no longer will have these six, seven, eight, nine or ten year scenarios. The entire purpose of the Bill is to ensure the provision of a much faster and more transparent process. People have suggested unfairly that the Government's intention is that it will be quicker to deport somebody. As for asylum applications, asylum is a sacred status that is afforded to an individual when given by any country. If a person is awarded asylum status in Ireland or any other country, it is an internationally-recognised sacred status. Consequently, it is not something that is given out lightly. However, in any application process, some people succeed and others do not. That is the system as it will be anywhere in the world and it will be the same system here in Ireland. Some people will be successful and others will not. However, the intention of the Bill is that an application will be processed in the first instance within six months and to finality within 12 months in order that people will not be languishing in a centre or within the system for a prolonged time. I also remind Members that while approximately half of those who seek asylum in Ireland are in direct provision centres, approximately half are not. While Members keep returning again and again to the issue of direct provision, and I understand the issues are linked, it is not central to the Bill, which is dealing with a new application process. Approximately 4,000 of those people are outside the direct provision system in Ireland and, therefore, one must be aware this legislation is for every applicant who comes into Ireland and it will be a much more speedy process, which is what the single procedure is all about.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will not be responding further.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is not usual in legislation of this nature to have timelines installed.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is not what is generally done. That is the whole point of the Bill. There would be no point in having a Bill with a single procedure unless we were trying to speed up the entire process and make the system work an awful lot better. The biggest problem that people come back to us with repeatedly is the length of time. The whole point of this Bill is the length of time; therefore, to suggest we include a definite timeline in the Bill is wrong because that is not how legislation works. The purpose of the Bill is to deal with the length of time issue. Of the 173 recommendations in the working group report, 78 relate to the protection process, 26 of which are dealt with in the Bill, 51 relate to the system of direct provision and 44 relate to other supports. We are implementing the direct provision report on the protection process.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I cannot agree with the Senators’ amendment as all applicants have access to legal assistance within the meaning of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I cannot agree to the proposed changes as section 20 clearly provides for the circumstances in which an applicant can be detained. Section 20(1) states:(a) poses a threat to public security or public order in the State,(b) has committed a serious non-political crime outside the State,(c) has not made reasonable efforts to establish his or her identity,(d) intends to leave the State and without lawful authority enter another state, or(e) without reasonable cause—(i) has destroyed his or her identity or travel document, or(ii) is or has been in possession of a forged, altered or substituted identity document.The section makes it clear that a person cannot be detained for the sole reason that he or she is an applicant for international protection. Specific reasons are laid out in section 20 on page 22, as I have outlined. A person cannot be arrested for the sole reason that he or she is an applicant for protection. It is not provided for in the Bill, nor should it be.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The garda or immigration officer has to comply with one of the reasons as stated in the Bill. The very suggestion somebody would be arrested for the sole reason of seeking asylum is preposterous.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is the determination that we give the garda to make a reasonable case in that regard.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In all these cases, gardaí will have to show reasonable cause. This is what happens in all these instances. They cannot arrest somebody without reasonable cause whereby one of the listed criteria is met. Without reasonable cause, they would be outside the remit of the Bill. They have to establish reasonable cause.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	With regard to amendment No. 42, I cannot agree to the deletion of the reference to “arrest without warrant” at the start of section 20. This is a necessary first step and provision is also made for a person having been so detained to be brought before the District Court as soon as is practicable. The court would have to be satisfied as to the justification of the detention. I cannot agree to amendment No. 43. The use of the words “him or her” is fine in this instance and avoids repetition.I cannot agree to the proposed amendment to section 20.  In respect of amendment No. 44, I cannot agree to the removal of the words “altered or substituted” or to the removal of the words “or substituted” from section 20(1)(e) as suggested in Senator O'Donovan’s amendment No. 45. These issues that can arise in the context of travel documentation need to be comprehended by the Bill. I could continue but essentially I am not agreeing to amendments Nos. 46 and 47.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This is a minor amendment to subsection (14) to effectively replace the term "solicitor" with the term "legal representative". The term "legal representative" is preferred because it is defined in the interpretation section of the Bill as meaning a practising solicitor or barrister.
