AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Cathaoirleach for the indulgence of the House for an amendment to the Order of Business to take No. 12 before No. 1.

AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Next Tuesday. Can I say a few short words on it?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am sure that the Minister will agree that in the political sphere we operate it is time to move beyond business as usual when it comes to political barbs, finger-pointing and point-scoring. The issue at hand is far too serious. The Labour Party absolutely stands with the Minister and accepts his bona fides. In his efforts to deal with this matter his interaction with our party and with other parties has been to his credit. Nobody could suggest that he does not treat this with the absolutely seriousness it deserves, as he is doing his absolute best to ensure this does not happen again. The Labour Party has been quite strong on the need for a commission of investigation, and I believe the Minister has moved his own position towards that. That is to be welcomed. We feel strongly that no woman affected by this issue should in any way be liable for any medical costs whatsoever, and that no woman involved in this situation should have to put her hand in her pocket, nor should her family have to put their hands into their pockets.  On the overall structure of the HSE, it was suggested last night in the media that part of the problem with the HSE currently is that, in the effort by the last Government - which I was a part of - to abolish the HSE, the board was dispensed with. As a result of the board not being in place, one of the obvious corporate governance checks and balances that would be expected in an institution such as the HSE is no longer there. Subsequently, when the CEO of the HSE is going about his or her daily business, the lack of a board being there as a check and balance in that institution is a glaring omission. I am asking that the Minister discusses that with us this evening. When the HSE was established it was said that politics provides the policy and the HSE deals with the delivery. In the delivery there must be political accountability.  I would appreciate if the Minister would address those points.
