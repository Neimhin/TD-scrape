AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank Ms McVeigh and her colleagues for their presentation. A financial transaction tax or Tobin tax is something everybody instinctively supports and considers a good idea. However, when one examines the potential ramifications in terms of costs to customers, job losses at the IFSC and so on, it becomes a little more complicated. Is the Department's position essentially that Ireland will stay out of a financial transaction tax arrangement so long as the United Kingdom does the same?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is Ms McVeigh saying that it is not necessarily the Department's fixed position?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	My understanding of the UK position is that it is not simply a case of Government versus Opposition. In fact, both of the main parties are opposed to an FTT on the basis of what might happen in New York as a consequence of its introduction. Would Ms McVeigh agree that there is a range of interdependent issues to consider?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I would like some clarity on what seems to be the evolving opinion or consensus on this issue. The Governor of the Central Bank made a speech some 18 months ago in which he was very critical of the proposal for a financial transaction tax. He placed heavy emphasis in that speech on potential jobs losses and the disproportionate impact on the Irish financial sector. However, when he attended a meeting of this committee more recently - not last week but on the occasion prior to that - and I asked him his current view on an FTT, it seemed his position had softened somewhat. I do not have the transcript of that meeting to hand, but his position certainly seemed to have shifted. Is Ms McVeigh aware of that shift in the Governor's view? Is there regular liaison between the Department and the Central Bank on this issue?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am interested in the evolution of thinking on this issue and how views can change within the Irish and European contexts. Are the Department and the Central Bank in regular contact on the issue or is it something on which the Department has already made a determination without any expectation that the position is likely to change significantly?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Ms McVeigh spoke earlier about the cost to customers and potential job losses arising out of the introduction of an FTT. Will she expand on that? Can she indicate, for instance, in a worst case scenario, where such a tax were imposed on us - I realise it would not actually happen that way - what level of job losses could we potentially see?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am sure Ms McVeigh understands that we are concerned here with trying to weigh up the rationale for the introduction of a financial transaction tax. We would like to be able to quantify the number of jobs that could potentially be at risk versus the potential gains. Every move one makes in any budgetary situation has pros and cons. It is a question of weighing them up and making a value judgment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is there a variance among the 11 member states in which an FTT is already in operation in terms of the types of institutions covered?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am asking that question in reference to the 11 countries which have already introduced an FTT. Is there a variance between what is happening in France and Italy, for example?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is it the intention to analyse that data when they become available?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We are trying to obtain a sense of the validity or otherwise of imposing such a tax and the likely impact on different member states. If we were in possession of that data, perhaps we might arrive at a better judgment in respect of this matter. Will the Department and the Revenue Commissioners be analysing the data on a member state basis to obtain a comparison? If the answer is in the affirmative, perhaps our guests might return to the committee with the relevant data in order that we might engage in a more informed discussion on the matter.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It would be useful for the committee to revisit this evolving issue.
