AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I know the Tánaiste has referred to this in a previous answer but I ask him when the right to flexible working Bill will be published; the legal protections that are currently in place to support workers who are asked to return to the workplace but who would prefer to remain working remotely; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Within the legislation, is it envisaged there will be a right for workers to switch off? If a person is working remotely, there can be a sense of soft pressure for him or her to remain constantly on, with emails and communications from the employer. I can appreciate this may very well suit the lifestyle of somebody in settled domestic circumstances, with a spare room, an office or whatever, but for a younger worker who may not have that facility, can we within the legislation ensure there will be a responsibility on employers to care for younger workers in particular, who may have only their own bedroom to work from? Will employers be required to provide a certain standard of work station within the space? As the Tánaiste will appreciate, it can be difficult for younger workers to make such demands when they are just starting off in the workplace.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that the legislation is still being drafted and the Tánaiste is still welcoming submissions but I would impress on him the importance of the younger, more vulnerable worker. As I said, there may be soft pressure on younger workers to work from home. If people are 20, 21 or 22 years of age and starting off in the workforce, they would not necessarily have that type of space, if they still live in the family home, to allow them to be as productive as they might like to be, and they might not have the self-confidence to make the case for the company or employer to provide basic provisions to allow for effective working from home. Within the legislation, therefore, the Tánaiste might consider the reality of that younger person, or that person starting off in the workforce, who does not yet have the capability to move out of the family home but needs some basic provision of support from the employer in order that he or she can be effective. It is a reasonable suggestion and it would be relevant to the legislation.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I would like to ask the Tánaiste if time spent on the pandemic unemployment payment will count towards redundancy entitlements, if he plans to bring forward legislation on this matter, if the suspension of redundancy rights will be lifted at the end of September 2021 and if he will make a statement on the matter.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Tánaiste’s response. It is clear that this is something that is on his agenda. He is engaging with the Minister for Social Protection on it. He is due to make a statement on the matter in a number of weeks' time. That is welcome. I note that ICTU has encouraged the Government to reform employment law in order to deal with this issue. The Tánaiste can appreciate that if you were in receipt of the PUP, you were, by Government mandate, taken out of the workplace. We in the Labour Party appreciate that this is a very unusual situation. It is a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. Government has been forced to respond and not every response will be perfect. I accept the Tánaiste’s bona fides, and the fact that he is dealing and engaging with the other Department on that. Can the Tánaiste give a more detailed timescale than that? Does he envisage that primary legislation may be necessary?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the Tánaiste’s remarks and that the Government is coming from the right place on this. We look forward to seeing the proposals from Government and, hopefully, to being in a position to support the Tánaiste's efforts in this regard.
