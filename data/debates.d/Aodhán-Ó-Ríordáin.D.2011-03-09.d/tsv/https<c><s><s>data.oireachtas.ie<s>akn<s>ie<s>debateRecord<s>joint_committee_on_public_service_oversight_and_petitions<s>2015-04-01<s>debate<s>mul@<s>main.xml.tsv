AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chairman and members for inviting me to speak today on the direct provision system for accommodating applicants for international protection.I have been to the forefront in seeking reform of this system and, to that end, I very much welcome the committee's interest in this matter. It is my wish that this engagement today helps, not hinders, the ongoing consultative process which I will explain in more detail in a few moments. The direct provision system came about in the context of an unprecedented increase in the numbers of asylum seekers coming into the country in the late 1990s. At that time, the majority of protection seekers lived in Dublin and were treated as homeless, which involved emergency accommodation and local authority housing. The shortage of accommodation reached crisis point and the then Eastern Health Board understandably could not cope. There were reports of protection seeker families sleeping in parks. In November 1999, the Government resolved the crisis by having the needs of protection seekers met by a system of direct provision which involved the dispersal of protection seekers throughout the country. It is 15 years later and more than 4,400 persons live in 34 asylum accommodation centres throughout the State, which is a reduction from 60 centres in 2008. That is a simple statistic. If one drills down further, one will see the human element involved. Of these residents, approximately one third are adult males, one third are adult females and one third are children. Drilling down further, 36% of residents have been in the overall system for up to three years, 43% for between three and seven years and 21% for seven years or more. Everyone living in direct provision has his or her own story to tell. People may be at different stages of the protection determination process or may even have taken a legal challenge against a negative decision made in respect of them. Indeed, they may be at the end of the process but cannot move on. For example, more than 500 of the residents in the direct provision system have permission to remain in the State but cannot move on because of difficulties sourcing private accommodation. Almost 600 residents have deportation orders outstanding against them, the vast majority of which issued over a year ago. They are required to report periodically to the Garda National Immigration Bureau. There are many reasons orders are not or cannot be enforced, including the issuing of legal actions, the making of sequential protection applications for members within a family group, the absence of the travel documents required for the return to the country of origin and so on. Members of the committee have visited centres to see for themselves the conditions in which residents live. I have done so too. I have visited a centre in Sligo, two in Waterford, two in Limerick, one each in Galway, Laois and Clare, three in Dublin and also Mosney. Members will have seen, as have I, that all residents share the common experience of a life revolving around waiting and hoping. Residents cannot cook for themselves, engage in work or otherwise gainfully occupy themselves during the day. It has to be said that the direct provision system does not exist in a vacuum. It has to be seen in the context of the overarching international protection processing system of which direct provision is but one element, albeit a very important one to those who have to avail of its services. To make progress on direct provision, it is necessary to address both it and the protection system itself in a coherent, thought-out fashion. This is what the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 commits us to do. In terms of processing, last week the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, published the general scheme of the international protection Bill, the aim of which is to reduce waiting times for asylum applicants. The key purpose of the Bill is to replace the existing multi-layered protection determination system with a single procedure, the aim of which is to enable timely and efficient protection decisions to be made. This single procedure will identify at a much earlier stage those who are in need of international protection and will be granted status and those who have no entitlement to stay in the State and who can safely return to their countries of origin. The single procedure has been requested for many years by many NGOs and others. The intention is for the Bill to deal with as many of those who are currently in the system as possible. A practical approach is envisaged with those who have reached a certain point in the existing process continuing along their current path while others at earlier stages of the process will be brought within the single procedure. In addition to committing to legislative change in this area, the Government has set up an independent working group to report to it on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers. It is chaired by the former High Court judge, Dr. Bryan McMahon, and comprises senior officials from all relevant Departments, the UNHCR, representatives of academia and various NGOs who have a long-standing interest in this area and other representatives of civil society. The working group developed a work programme early on and established three subgroups to deal with the following themes. The first deals with conditions in centres, the second deals with supports for asylum seekers and the third deals with improving the processing of protection claims, essentially the long stay problem. Almost 40 meetings at plenary and subgroup level have taken place since the first meeting of the working group on 11 November 2014. The working group has taken evidence directly from residents in the direct provision system both in writing and orally, visited centres around the country and spoken directly to residents. It has engaged with particular groups of applicants including children, victims of torture, victims of trafficking and sexual violence, members of the LGBTI community and has taken oral and written submissions from a number of experts in this field, including the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the special rapporteur on child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon. The chairman of the group has publicly stated that these contributions have informed the sense of urgency that has underpinned its work. He has gone on to say that all of its members are genuinely engaged in the task at hand, namely, to identify a set of recommendations to Government for improvements that will bring tangible benefits to existing and future applicants. The chairman says that the deliberations of the working group are at a crucial stage with each of the subgroups developing their proposals for submission to the plenary group over the next number of weeks. The Government recognises that the issues to be examined by the working group are complex and require thorough consideration to ensure that recommendations are practical and sustainable from a budgetary perspective and do not undermine existing border controls and immigration policies. When I wrote to the committee on 21 October 2014, I said that I hoped to be in a position to brief members on the first stages of the working group's work. At that time, I anticipated that the working group would issue an interim report. However, as is the right of the independent group, it decided not to issue an interim report and proceeded with its work on the basis that it would issue a singular report. While the agreed terms of reference do not indicate a timeframe for the working group's deliberations, I understand that it will be only a matter of weeks after Easter when the report will be ready. The working group published its work programme in November 2014 fleshing out the issues to be discussed by each of the three themed subgroups to which I referred earlier. I arranged for the work programme to be circulated to the committee before this meeting. From my own perspective, some of the key issues relate to the scope for residents to prepare their own meals within existing or new physical structures; limitations on the length of time persons spend in the direct provision system; financial supports; and improved processing times. It would be futile and damaging at this crucial stage of its proceedings to second guess the work of the group. We have to allow it to complete its work. I do not propose to engage in any detailed discussion on any of the issues in the work programme on which the working group may make recommendations. That is the group's job. I have every confidence in the capacity of the chairman and members of the working group to do their work. This is a difficult subject. I have no doubt that there have been robust discussions within the working group. As practising politicians, we know that negotiations and discussions are sometimes hard and that there are varying shades among the membership of any group engaged in such discussions. We all recognise the importance of working together to achieve real, tangible change. I am firmly of the belief that more can be achieved within the working group than outside it. I know the committee will allow the process to continue and to give it a fair wind. As part of its deliberations, I had arranged for the working group to be provided with a transcript of the proceedings on this subject at this committee on 22 October 2014. Similarly, I will arrange for a transcript of today's proceedings to be provided also. I look forward to hearing the views of members on this matter.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I have visited a number of centres. They vary in their standards. Some are excellent. Some are much less so. I could envisage staying in some, but there are some in which I would not spend a night. No matter what the standard of accommodation is, those who are seeking asylum do not want to live in direct provision centres. I cannot stand over a system in which the issues that the Senator has outlined continue, that belittles people, in which people live hopeless, unproductive lives and where they stay for a number of years. I could stand over a system where there was a number of excellent centres in which people lived fulfilling lives and engaged in training, education and more, where they stayed for just a number of months, not years, and where the issues outlined by the Senator no longer existed. I cannot stand over a system in which the institutionalisation of families becomes a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly reality. Initially, I was reluctant to engage with the committee on this issue because of the nature of the work that was being undertaken by the working group. In my personal opinion, we could have a system of direct provision that afforded people their dignity, but that would only be possible if people living in centres had excellent facilities and a meaningful existence, were rooted in the hearts of their communities with all of the essential links, had genuine family lives and their stays were short, by which I mean six months and no longer.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is the reason the issue is being discussed by the working group. It is also the reason that the group comprises people from the Children's Rights Alliance who have child protection expertise. I am sure that they are making their opinions robustly known and that the recommendations will be at the forefront of the report whenever it arrives on my desk.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is the Senator asking whether the directive will form part of the protection Bill?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Senator is right, in that the IRP Bill was wide, large legislation and had been going around the Houses for a number of years. It made sense for the Minister to remove from that Bill the protection Bill, the general scheme of which has only just been published. The intention is for the latter to undergo the pre-legislative stage before a committee. It is within that process that Members can make their opinions on the EU directive known. The working group will also have opinions in that regard. I am not trying to be evasive, but I am minded of the fact that we established a working group that people were determined to keep independent. It is for a deliberate reason that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I have not been involved in the group, namely, we did not want a perception of political overtones in or unwarranted political influence over its work. We wanted to ensure that people could make their comments or representations or do their work without involvement from or interference by practising politicians. I expect that the members of the working group have made the Senator's points. I expect that those issues will be to the forefront of their minds as they compile their final report, which is due a number of weeks after Easter. I also expect that members of the justice committee will make the same recommendations during the pre-legislative stage of the protection Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The IRC and Ms Conlan can speak for themselves.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I can only speak from my perception of how the group is working. As I have outlined in my statement, I firmly believe that, if one wants to get solutions, the best place to be is in a room with people who are determined to find them. I am committed to finding a way forward and want to turn the page on the current system. Many people in the Houses of the Oireachtas have raised deep concerns about the system. From the first moments I walked into this House people from all parties have raised concerns about the process and direct provision, in particular. We have had quite a number of robust exchanges in the Seanad on the matter. It is to the credit of Seanad Éireann, in particular, for taking on the issue. It has raised issues and concerns about direct provision with me for quite a while. I know that the place for improvements and changes in the system is within the working group. I know that the people in the subgroups have remained with the process and are determined to be part of something that will deliver real change. This is a once in a generation opportunity, after 15 years of overseeing the system, to deliver something that will lead to change. My decision to not be involved with the group in a hands-on manner was deliberate. I trust the people engaged in the process and know them to be people of integrity, both within the Department and the various NGOs. We have talked about direct provision for a number of years. For many of the people involved this has been a 15-year campaign. My involvement has been shorter and dates from my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality. We are so close to getting a report that will deliver change that I am willing to wait until I see it. I believe the chairman and members of the group will be proud of their work and that we will, collectively, be proud of the report when published. I have anticipated the recommendations and am sure that we will collectively look back on this period saying it was a job well done.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I shall ask Mr. Noel Dowling to relay the factual position, from the Department's point of view, and shall give my own personal perspective afterwards.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I agree with Senator Ó Clochartaigh that, if one is a victim of rape, sexual violence or torture, one needs to have care that is better than can be provided by somebody who is running a dry cleaning company.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will give my initial response to that. I do not know if Mr. Dowling or Mr. Kelly want to come in on that. On the people who are still in direct provision when they do not have to be there, I think there is a challenge for us in the future to find a step-down facility or a halfway situation because I think it would be unreasonable to expect somebody to go from a long period of living in a direct provision centre to trying to access essential services such as housing or social protection and not to have some kind of halfway situation. I do not know what that would look like but certainly the figures would suggest that people are finding it difficult to transition from direct provision into community living or independent living and it is their own decision to stay within direct provision. Certainly it is a challenge for us to find a resolution to that. I assume in the most recent past that the housing issue generally in the country was part of the problem. Does Mr. Dowling want to provide more context to that?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The other issue is that if one has been in a centre for a number of years, if one's children attend the local school, if there is some kind of community linkage, or if one is doing some voluntary work in the community, then one probably wants to stay close to that general community in the short term. That can also be a factor in people staying in the centre beyond the period when they have to stay.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There has been a level of heightened expectation because the work of the working group has been ongoing and there have been a number of visits to different centres. Members are aware of the centres and I have also been visiting centres. There will be a report to Government and the Government will decide to publish or not. It is my expectation that it will be published and it should be published. I agree with the Deputy there will likely be short-term and immediate fixes that could be introduced immediately and others are longer-term aspects. The report is the beginning rather than the end of the process.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is the Deputy referring to the average stay?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I remember travelling to Genoa in 2001. I remember the people I travelled over with and I remember not travelling back with them. I involved myself in a few protests and then joined Oxfam in not protesting on the second day because of the type of activity some people were engaging in at the time. I remember getting tear gas for my troubles but that is a trip down memory lane.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On the working group, people are in politics if they want to achieve things. If they believe something is wrong and must be remedied, fixed or reformed, the job is to find some way to do it. People in the working group have been working incredibly hard and have been campaigning on the issue for quite some time, as have politicians in the House. I give credit to some sections of the media. We can be critical of them in the political system but I have great respect for a number of campaigning journalists. They have given the human dimension and stories behind the reality of direct provision. How do we come to a conclusion? What is the best way of advancing the cause of those within direct provision sectors who want a life? The determination of Government was to assemble a group of people who are experts in the field. We could have been accused of having a working group made up of people who have a particular perspective but we invited people who know the system inside out from the advocacy point of view and asked them to play their part in finding a solution. This involves people who are campaigners on the asylum system, the protection system, campaigners for children, academics, people with a trade union background and those with a history of finding solutions to real problems. I want conclusion brought to their deliberations but nothing is ever simple in life. I wish it were so. In trying to find a solution, we must find something that will last and work. We have inherited something I cannot stand over and I have made my language as clear and forthright as I can. I am quite sure people in the Department of Justice and Equality do not like me saying things with such forthright language because it is a system they have been trying to deal with over a period of time.What is more important than my position or the positions of those on the working group, is what will happen when that report is published and how it will affect the lives of people in the system. I go to these centres and see the children there, and I consider their lives and futures. I meet people, the same age as myself, who have literally been broken by the system. I met a man in Limerick who was in a bad way when he got here, but the system we have has compounded his misery.  I see children who do not have the basic family-based type of modelling for food preparation that every other child takes for granted. It is very much a human reaction to a system. It is not a black and white report. We are dealing with human beings and their aspirations and dreams, which we have in our hands. So what do we do with that? We are charged with that awesome responsibility. The best thing to do is to get in with like-minded people who are charged with looking after the system, to try to find a better one.  The Deputy may have already rejected what the working group is doing. He may have already rejected what the report says, even before he sees it, but I will not do so because I trust the people who are doing the work. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy asked two straight questions. The Irish Refugee Council can speak for itself, but the best place to be is making these points within the working group. That is my answer to the Deputy's first question. Second, I want this working group to succeed. From its very beginning most people were willing to give the group a fair wind. A minority were willing it to fail and tried to find reasons to pick holes in it. Hand on heart, however, I am impressed by the composition of the working group, the issues it is addressing and the way it has set about its work. The number of meetings it has had, including the establishment of various sub-groups, are also impressive.  If the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and I had been attending every single meeting of the working group, we would be accused of political interference. In addition, people would say the group was not independent and its members could not speak openly. However, the working group has rightly gone out of its way to hear as many testimonies of the realities of living in direct provision as it possibly could. We have a short time in politics and my time in this Department will most likely be short as well, with possibly a year to go. In that time, more than anything, I want to achieve reform in this area. I know that the working group will deliver that. The Deputy may not have the same faith as I do, but I have it. I trust that when the report comes out, and hopefully the Government will agree to publish it - I expect so - it will be the beginning of a whole new start for people in the protection system. Their faith in the working group will have been justified.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I shall respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett and you, Chairman. I have two brief points. First, the assumption that some things are off limits to the working group is incorrect. There are no limits to what can be discussed by it. The right to work is being openly discussed. I believe we are practically the only country in the European Union to have a limitation on allowing refugee applicants to work. My views on the matter remain the same. Assumptions have been made about the working group which do not stand up to scrutiny. I welcome your suggestion, Chairman. Every political system across Europe has been strangled with immigration. We in this Parliament are spending time in the Seanad and in the Dáil responding to oral questions and written parliamentary questions on trying to improve the situation for people who come to this country seeking protection. That is a credit to these Houses and to the committee and other committees that wish to debate the issue. I agree with your suggestion, Chairman.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Again, the Deputy is pre-empting the report.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There are no limits to anything anybody wants to discuss. The Deputy can list 47 different things he wants to know are being discussed.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	To my knowledge, all issues are being discussed. Nothing is off limits, but I have not been at a working group meeting. I am allowing the group to have the independence it sought. The group is an independent working group outside of political interference. I know the members are discussing all the issues the people in this room, those outside it and those who are in direct provision centres feel passionately about.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The overarching question is that of "when" with respect to people in the system. As the Deputy has quite rightly said, we do not want a report, with recommended actions and Government support, but no timeline for those actions to be taken. It is not my decision as to whether the report will be published but I assume it will. On receipt of the report we can collectively ensure that whatever actions are recommended can be seen to be enacted. The people in the centres and the system deserve and need that. They need us. People often correctly diminish politics in many circumstances but we are genuinely charged with the responsibility of looking after the interests of possibly the most vulnerable people in our country. If a report comes in that again heightens expectations and people finally believe - after years and possibly a decade or more of being in the system - that there is finally a breakthrough, the last thing they want is a report that is put on the long finger or not implemented as a matter of urgency. I accept the invitation to return if we can view it as a collective effort, across parties and non-partisan, to put our efforts behind ensuring that recommendations can be driven forward if they are accepted by the committee. We have seen that done in the Seanad before.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The issues raised are at the forefront of the matters engaged by the working group. I may be giving a similar answer about not impeding the work or being seen to interfere too much. The Chairman mentioned parenting and modelling food preparation. That can sometimes be overlooked as a minor issue but it is not as we are talking about people's childhood. Some people in 50 or 60 years will be saying that they spent their formative years in a direct provision centre. That is strong in my mind in dealing with the issue. Some staff in these centres work really hard and care passionately about people under their care. They make the same comments to me, the others present today and people in the system. Every day, they see the humanity and family life with which they engage. A child playing with a kitchen may not know what it feels like to pour something and may not know how to ask for juice because they are not used to that model of parenting. It has a long-lasting effect when we consider the responsibility that we have to try to change this system. All these issues arise from a sense of care and what family life, human life and connectedness should be like. Deputy Nolan's point is important as asylum is a sacred international status. It is something that is very serious and important. We are mindful of that but life is short, and childhood is particularly short. When we composed the working group and gave out invitations, we wanted to have people with a child focus and understanding at the heart of deliberations. I know that is the case so I look forward to the report being published and discussed here further.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	As the working group is so close to its final determination, it is realistic to wait until it has concluded. Both the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children have been in touch with the Chairman and had robust discussions. The Chairman is clear about their opinions on the matters, as I am. We will await the report.
