AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The amendment speaks for itself. It proposes to insert the words "adult learners" in subsection (1)(b) on line 15. Paragraph (b) would read "to consult with the Minister for Social Protection, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, adult learners and employers from time to time for the purpose of determining which, or which classes of, further education and training programmes should be the subject of advances...". The purpose of the amendment is to provide that if employers are to be consulted - the Minister is obviously to be consulted - service users should also be consulted to ensure there was a full circle of engagement. If employers are to be specifically included, as they should be, surely adult learners should also be included. If we are to have an approach which is generous, open-minded and inclusive, the inclusion of adult learners should be obvious in the subsection.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am happy to withdraw my amendment on the proviso that we return to the issue before Report Stage. As Deputy O'Brien has said, I do not see why adult learners should be passive anywhere throughout the Bill. They have to be consulted and have to be an integral part of it. If we are mentioning employers in the Bill, that would imply employer organisations, adult learners and those who speak for them and those who know what is best for them, as these are integral to what we are trying to achieve and should be included. I will withdraw the amendment and await a further discussion on the matter. I appreciate the Minister of State's sentiments.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Amendments No. 34 and 37 are similar to the ones we moved in the previous section about bodies representative of adult learners and community and voluntary bodies, so hopefully their spirit will be accepted and we will return to it on Report Stage as needs be. On amendment No. 30, which I have jointly submitted with Deputy McConalogue, the service would have to "prepare and submit to the Minister a strategy to raise adult literacy and numeracy levels in accordance with section 9". The issue here with adult literacy is that 23% of the adult population of Ireland are functionally illiterate. As a Government and as a society we have to realise that fact in everything we do and every strategy we come up with, and knit into every piece of legislation that goes thorough our hands a strategy to tackle that. We cannot address this problem until we admit there is a problem. I vividly remember that when I was in opposition and there was controversy over FÁS, the current Minister - then the Labour spokesperson on education - proposed this very thing and it was not accepted by the Government. Now is the time for us to be generous again with our legislation and accept the fact that we do not have an adult literacy strategy in this country. We have an adult literacy crisis. It is not refuted by anybody that 23% of our adult population are functionally illiterate and cannot read this legislation, site notices or instructions on medicine bottles. These are very basic functions that they cannot engage with in their lives. We have consistently, over decades, failed them. Previously FÁS had no adult literacy policy, which was absolutely flabbergasting. We now have the potential to knit into this legislation the construction and submission of an adult literacy policy and this is the time for us to take up that challenge and run with it. I feel very strongly about this and I hope the Minister takes the spirit of the amendment on board and that together, across parties, we can come to terms with the challenges ahead of us and put into this legislation, finally, a strategy to combat this crisis in Irish society.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I understand the Minister's concerns. If the only way for me to advance this is to withdraw the amendment, I will do so and discuss it before Report Stage. If we do not prescribe functions in legislation, however, then they just do not happen. There was much good work done by FÁS and decent people doing a good job on the ground, but there were other services and undertakings that the agency should have been charged with that just did not happen. The very idea that the fundamental further training agency of the State did not have an adult literacy policy was just bizarre, as has been pointed out by the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA. Now that we are radically reforming the delivery of further training programmes, not to knit a provision on adult literacy into this legislation is a lost opportunity. We have to state boldly in the legislation that we have an adult literacy problem and that SOLAS will be charged with developing, preparing and submitting to the Minister a strategy to raise adult literacy and numeracy levels. That is not too much to ask. This should be a box-ticking exercise in any sort of legislation of this nature. I understand the argument that such an inclusion may be over-prescriptive, and one wants legislation to be as fluid as possible. However, this is a wonderful opportunity for us to acknowledge and tackle the crisis in adult literacy, a crisis about which no one really wants to talk. Who wants to admit that 23% of our adult population are functionally illiterate? We have to admit to this and find a solution for it. This Bill provides the opportunity to do so. The spirit of the debate around this Bill has been generous and inclusive. If the Minister can commit to us that we will return to this matter before Report Stage, I will accept the request to withdraw the amendment. However, I do not want him to underestimate how passionate I and other members feel about this issue.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We have a way forward, which I accept. While symbolism is important, these amendments are not about symbolism. The wording of the amendment states “to prepare and submit to the Minister a strategy to raise adult literacy and numeracy levels.” That is not symbolic. That is a statement of intent and a reasonable objective. There have been plenty of tokenistic symbolic insertions into legislation in the past which have gone nowhere. I am not a fan of them as they do nothing.However, this is not symbolic, because it asks that the service prepare and submit a strategy to raise adult literacy and numeracy. This seems to me a reasonable objective to insert. If the Minister of State feels it cannot be done today, I will be happy to accept his suggestion that we work together on it for Report Stage. I also question the suggestion that it would be necessary to list every other one also, but we can discuss that. The Minister of State has given us a way forward and I am happy to accept that.
