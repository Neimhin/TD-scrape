AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the representatives of the TUI and NALA for being here today.  The TUI submission is remarkably extensive and it will probably take some time to digest the variety of issues addressed.  Due to time constraints the delegation was not in a position to go through them in greater detail.  Nevertheless, I understand the sentiments expressed.  I welcome the representatives from NALA.  I will be tabling an amendment to get an adult learner on the ETBs.  Literacy is a civil right and it is one of the greatest issues in our country at the moment.  We must complete the circle but we have no real potential to tackle the issue of literacy from all stages of education and the life cycle unless we get the life experience of an adult learner who has dealt with the issues so eloquently outlined by the NALA delegation today.  I will table an amendment and I hope it will be accepted and that NALA will have an adult learner on the ETBs.  I believe that is justified.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I happened to be knocking on doors when this announcement was made.  When I arrived at the doorstep of an individual who worked for DIT and gave her the good news, she hugged me.  That was the first hug I got since I became a Deputy.  I thank the Grangegorman Development Agency for arranging that.  I formerly represented the Grangegorman area on Dublin City Council at a time when a considerable number of development projects were being planned for O’Devaney Gardens and elsewhere.  Many of these projects never came to fruition, with the result that a level of cynicism had developed within the local community.  Around the same time, a major redevelopment of Phibsborough shopping centre was proposed, which gave rise to concerns about the impact on traffic and transport.    It is an exciting prospect that all DIT’s different educational centres, which are currently dotted around the city, will be moving to a central location on the northside.  I ask, however, that the agency bring the local community with it because it has already experienced disappointments with previous projects.  We will do what we can as local representatives to ease the process.  I ask the witnesses not to be strangers to this committee because we want to engage and provide whatever support we can.
