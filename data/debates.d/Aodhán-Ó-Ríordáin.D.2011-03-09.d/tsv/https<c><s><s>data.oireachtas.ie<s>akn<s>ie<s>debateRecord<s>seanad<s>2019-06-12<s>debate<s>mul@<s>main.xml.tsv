AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the debate on Committee Stage of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 conclude at 6 p.m.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	To be adjourned. The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Government are to be commended for their action in respect of the availability of Spinraza, on which we have made many contributions in this House. The Health Service Executive, HSE, has now announced that it will fund it. The decision made by the United Kingdom in recent weeks to change its position was welcome and probably led to the decision made here this week. I think, in particular, of Sam Bailey and his family who have been campaigning with others throughout the country to reach this day. I commend the Government for what it has done. It is a life-changing moment for many children. I congratulate, in particular, the Minister for Health and his officials on doing the right thing.  It has been announced that Philomena Lynott has passed away at the age of 88 years. She was the mother of Phil Lynnott and worked so hard to keep his legacy alive. Her love for him is a great Irish story. I offer my condolences and those of the Labour Party to her family and those who loved Philomena and Phil.

AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
