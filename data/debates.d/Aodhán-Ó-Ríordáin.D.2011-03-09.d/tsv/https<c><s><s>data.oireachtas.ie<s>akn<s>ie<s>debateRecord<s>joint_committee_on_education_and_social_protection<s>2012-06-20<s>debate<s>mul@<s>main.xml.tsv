AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I enjoyed my time as Vice Chairman of the previous committee and look forward to working with the Chair and other members.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The previous committee had this conversation at length and came to the conclusion that 9.30 a.m. was a suitable time.  It would allow us to meet for an hour before business commences in the Houses.  Even though it initially proved difficult to get people in at 9.30 a.m., it eventually worked to good effect.  It is not an unreasonable time to expect members to be here and I suggest it as a starting time.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I suggest that 9.30 a.m. is a viable option that should be considered.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Some members of this committee were not members of the previous committee and I understand that people have different points of view.  In the previous committee, the meeting was at 9.30 a.m.  We got used to that time and it worked.  If we are going to work, the morning is the best time.  Attendance at committees can be a problem at every committee.  I do not say that I am better than anyone else.  If we are trying to get work done, 9.30 a.m. is one hour before the Houses sit and it worked best for the previous committee.  I do not really see the reason to move from 9.30 a.m to 10 a.m., notwithstanding the difficulties Deputy Butler is having.  A half hour at that time can make all the difference.
