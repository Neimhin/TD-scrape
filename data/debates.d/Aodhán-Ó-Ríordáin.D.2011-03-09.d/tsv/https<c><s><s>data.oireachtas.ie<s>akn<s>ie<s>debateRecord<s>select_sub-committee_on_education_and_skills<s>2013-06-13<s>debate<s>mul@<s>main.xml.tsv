AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In regard to the context and impact indicators, the number of international students in the higher education institutions increased from 25,000 in 2010 to 30,000 in 2012. Can I assume that this is a deliberate act in cross-departmental initiatives to encourage more international students to come to our higher education institutions?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Given that the intention is to double the number of students in the coming years, is there a target date?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No.
