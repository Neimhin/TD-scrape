AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will make a brief reference to the success of the Irish team last night in getting into the World Cup. That success was built on a level of trade unionism that stood with those women five years ago when they threatened strike action. That is what the trade union movement does. When it sees injustice in the workplace or anywhere else, it stands beside those affected and seeks to platform that injustice. It is on the shoulders of SIPTU that the Irish team is heading to the World Cup next year. That needs to be acknowledged. I acknowledge the other trade unions represented here this morning as we speak to our motion. The Minister has acknowledged our motion and thanked us for it. We get one motion every six weeks. That is how important the issue of section 39, section 56 and section 10 workers is to us as a party. I will speak a little bit about the drugs area. With regard to addiction and those working in addiction services, despite hiding behind a promised citizens' assembly on drugs, this Government has been the most absent and uninterested I have ever known when it comes to the drugs crisis. Something was said at the SIPTU briefing yesterday that I thought was very interesting. Section 39 workers do not want to be public servants because those people whom they work with do not trust the State.If someone is in addiction and powering their way through that scenario, if they find themselves down an alleyway injecting something into themselves or if they find themselves stained and soiled because of the disconnection in their life and the various troubles or difficulties they have had, the last person they are going to engage with is somebody from the State. We need these section 39 workers and agencies. What they are saying to us is that many of the projects they currently have are threatened. It is hard to get people to maintain their work within this sector. It is hard to attract people into the sector. In an environment where drug-taking and the manner of addiction changes all the time, it is hard to start new initiatives because they do not have the security. That security has to come from the Minister and, I would suggest, from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, whose absence this morning is a disappointment to us in the Labour Party. He is the person with control of the purse strings. It is often said to us that the Labour Party is trying to nationalise these services or wants all these workers to be public servants. That is not the case. However, we want them to be treated with the same terms and conditions as public servants, including those working with the HSE. It has been said that the HSE is sometimes like an oil tanker and those working in these section 39 organisations are much more nimble and can adapt to situations more quickly. The fundamental issue here is that these workers are not just changing lives; they are saving lives. It undermines the work they do when they are treated so unfairly and not treated with the same basic respect as other workers. How do you attract somebody into the service? How do you change the way of interacting with people who are so in need of a helping hand and of care and compassion? That is something they have never felt from the State because in their lives, the State has at every juncture treated them with a lack of respect. That can come from the school system, the courts system, the Garda or social workers. We all may find this hard to accept but it can come from politicians. That is the day-to-day reality these people are working with. Let us dispense with this myth that we are trying to fundamentally change the structure of these organisations. What we are trying to do is provide that helping hand that shows respect to people who find themselves in addiction and are trying to power their way through this heroic path to a new future. The person helping those people should also be dealt with with respect because respect goes so many different ways. Those are the main points the Labour Party is trying to make. There are question marks over this €100 million figure that keeps being bandied around the place. It was mentioned on Thursday by the Tánaiste and yesterday by the Taoiseach. It was mentioned by the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth during last night's debate on disability, which was brought forward by my colleagues in Sinn Féin, and it was again referenced by the Minister for Health today. That is a cost-of-living €100 million. That is a "keep the lights on" €100 million. It is not to be confused with what these workers are seeking. The Government needs to be an awful lot clearer as to what the proposals are for pay parity and basic respect for workers in these sectors. The Labour Party says to those section 39 workers, section 56 workers and section 10 workers that we value what they are doing. We only get time to propose motions once every six weeks. This is how important this issue is to us and we need it to be important to the Minister as well. We thank the trade union movement for its ongoing campaigns. If it was not for these workers, more lives would be lost and that would be on us.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am sure the Minister will join me in congratulating the Irish women's football team on qualifying last night for next year's World Cup. Five years ago, many of these women had to threaten strike action in order to get basic respect within the FAI. I put it to the Minister that Irish soccer and Irish women's soccer, in particular, has not got enough support or respect from Irish politics. A woman in Ireland cannot be a professional footballer. Young girls who dream of becoming professional footballers have to go to England; many of them are doing that. Last year, the Government gave €95 million to the horse and greyhound fund. This is a direct fund paid for through a levy on betting. No other sport benefits from it. I suggest to the Minister, and I know the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Chambers, is quite committed to Irish football, that we find pathways for young women to keep playing in Ireland and should not say to them that they have to go abroad in order to fulfil their footballing ambitions. We should build on the legacy of what was achieved last night for future generations of Irish footballing women.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister of State and commend this legislation. My colleague, Senator Sherlock, who sits on the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, informed me that quite a number of recommendations that came from the committee were not adopted by Government when it came to this Bill. It makes us wonder why we have cross-party pre-legislative scrutiny. To be honest, committee rooms are where this Oireachtas works best. Often, when visitors come into the Gallery, they see the back-and-forth drama and theatre that goes on in the Chamber and hear the one-liners for clips on Facebook. All the real work happens in the committee rooms, where people generally try to work on a cross-party basis to improve legislation, which is the point of the exercise. Therefore, when a group of Deputies and Senators who are Oireachtas Members from different political parties collectively come together to make recommendations to Government on what they feel, having dispassionately, if you like, scrutinised legislation, one would hope that what they say would make its way into the Government's Bill considering that those who signed up to these recommendations include members of the Minister of State's party and other Government parties. I will shortly give a reminder of these recommendations. Some of the flags raised about this Bill came from the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, MRCI. I remind the Minister of State that the MRCI is a highly responsible NGO that works with those who have been described as the most vulnerable workers in our economy. It has had endless successes in these Houses for promoting, amending or suggesting legislation. It works with Government in order to improve things and it has been endlessly successful because of the manner in which it carries out its business. Therefore, when the MRCI flags something, it is because it is genuinely concerned. We know in our political lives that when we get comments on legislation, we must make sure the representation is on the money. When a representation comes from the MRCI, however, we must take it seriously. As was said, migrant workers in this country are disproportionately exploited and poorly paid. They are disproportionately women and, as I said, on a lower pay scale. Therefore, when legislation like this comes across our desks to be debated in the Chamber and passed into law, we must keep them to the forefront our minds. The committee's report on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill states:The Committee recommends that workers with General Employment Permits are provided the same rights as those employed with Critical Skills Permits. A holder of a General Employment Permit should have the right to gain access to the labour market after two years instead of five, which would make it easier for them to challenge exploitation and substandard conditions.The Committee recommends that holders of General Employment Permits should be given improved rights in relation to family reunion and the access of family members to the labour market, and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Justice should address this matter in conjunction with this Bill. It goes on to state that:The Committee has not seen sufficient evidence to support the proposed introduction of a Seasonal Employment Permit, [which is a key issue] and it is also concerned about the lack of detail in the proposal. The Committee recommends that instead of introducing the Seasonal Employment Permit, the scope and terms of the General Employment Permit be adapted to meet the need for seasonal employment. The protections and provisions under the existing General Employment Permit scheme must not be diminished, and workers’ rights must not be undermined.  What has been said, and what my colleague, Senator Sherlock, told me is that these recommendations of the committee are effectively being ignored in this Bill. The "bias" within this Bill, if we can use that word, is with the employer and to allow flexibility for the employer and not to protect the employee. The Minister of State graciously said with an open heart and with generosity, as he always does, that he will work with Members on Committee Stage.It is my experience, and others will agree with me, that it has been possible to work with the Minister of State on Committee Stage. However, it does not augur well when at this early stage of the passage of this Bill the recommendations put down by those who are tasked with doing pre-legislative scrutiny and trying to work best across parties to give the Minister of State advice on this have been ignored. It also does not augur well that agencies such as the MRCI are so worried about the balance of this Bill being about what is in the best interests of an employer and not in the best interests of protecting the most vulnerable of workers. I suggest to the Minister of State that we are working with him and that we will be seeking amendments to this Bill in order to redress that balance. In all these conversations we tend to have, the balance of conversation in these Chambers seems to be about what is most important for the employer. Whenever we have a conversation about sick pay it always comes down to what will be best for the employer and the same goes for wage structures etc. When it comes to the energy crisis we are facing into this winter and what companies, businesses and small enterprises will go through, that struggle for the employer to keep the lights on is always mentioned but not enough of this discussion is focused on the potential for employees to lose their jobs or be on reduced wages. We need to rebalance that. While taking the Minister of State's comments at face value and while we want to work with him on it, I ask him to reflect on the fact that those who in good faith made recommendations to him during pre-legislative scrutiny in the committee, from the Government benches and from the Opposition benches, particularly around the seasonal employment permit, were ignored or feel they were ignored. I ask him also to reflect on the fact that an agency such as the MRCI, which I have worked with closely and which I hold in huge regard, is also saying it is deeply concerned about what the Government is proposing. This is Second Stage of a Bill so anything can happen and we can make changes but the Labour Party asks that at this early stage in the passage of this Bill the Minister of State would reflect on the comments I have made.
