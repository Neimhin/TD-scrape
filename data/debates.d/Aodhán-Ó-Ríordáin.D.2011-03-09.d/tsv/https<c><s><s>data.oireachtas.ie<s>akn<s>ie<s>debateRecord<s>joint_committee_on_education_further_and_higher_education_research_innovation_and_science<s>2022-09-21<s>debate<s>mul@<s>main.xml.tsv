AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister and her officials. She is going to have to accept that this was grossly mishandled and an apology from her to those who have been affected would go a long way. She said apologies have been issued by Bus Éireann, but she has to take responsibility for how this has been handled. How much is the new initiative costing?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We are dealing with an extra €40 million. I imagine that, when the Minister makes an announcement in July that is going to cost €40 million, she would do a little bit of homework and make sure that it works correctly. Bus Éireann management say that the first time they heard about an entirely free scheme was after the Cabinet decision. The Minister is suggesting that consultations were taking place beforehand. Bus Éireann says those were not in the context of an entirely free scheme and that it was about driving down the cost for individual parents and families. That is what Bus Éireann management are saying. What does the Minister say to that?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In terms of an entirely free scheme?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is not what I am asking. My problem with the Minister's answers is that she does not answer the question I am asking her. There is a very important-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is not answering the question I am asking.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I have only got a certain amount of time.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Okay. Were the discussions with Bus Éireann prior to the decision being made by Cabinet on the basis of an entirely free scheme?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I find myself unconvinced by the Minister's answer. I was unconvinced by her presentation last night as well, because Bus Éireann seemed to be slightly surprised by this announcement made in July. Be that as it may-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I can only go by the evidence that is front of me and by the evidence that is given by Bus Éireann.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for that clarification. I will ask about the roll-out of the scheme. What type of intensive conversations took place in the month of August between the Minister, her officials, her Department and Bus Éireann to ensure that this €40 million scheme would be rolled out successfully?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I know and many people are not.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	These are young people who have been on the bus for the previous three or four years and now because of the Minister's new €40 million scheme, which was not properly prepared, they are now on the side of the road. The Minister is not in a position to apologise to those families for what is clearly a failing by her Department.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No, I would prefer that the people who were previously-------
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No I would prefer-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has asked me a question.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is in the interest of this committee-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	What about those who were previously on the bus, who are now not on the bus?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Will that be a comfort to them?
