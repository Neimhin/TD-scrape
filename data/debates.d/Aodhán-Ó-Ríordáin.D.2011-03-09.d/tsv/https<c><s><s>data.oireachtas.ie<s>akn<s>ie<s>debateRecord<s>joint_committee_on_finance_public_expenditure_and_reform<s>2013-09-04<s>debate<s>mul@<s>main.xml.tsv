AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the witnesses. I will focus on three elements, namely, the performing loan book, Priory Hall and Bank of Ireland's branch consolidation or opening of new branches. In a point I also raised yesterday regarding the performing loan book, I note Bank of Ireland's statement that 89% of loans are performing. In a way, that tells a lie because many people in that category are struggling each month to pay their mortgage. As I stated yesterday, they probably are feeding the mortgage before feeding their children. Do the witnesses have to hand analysis as to how anyone in that performing book may dip into arrears or be part of Bank of Ireland's arrears problem in the coming years? In particular, I am thinking about variable interest rates and note Bank of Ireland increased its variable interest rate by 0.5% last year. There is a feeling among mortgage holders that those who are on variable interest rates are being played off against those who are on tracker rates. What are Bank of Ireland's projections over perhaps five years, as to how it will protect those people or ensure those who are "performing" do not dip into arrears? While the bank may consider them to be performing, many of them are struggling.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will come back to the other ones.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I have not yet asked a question on Priory Hall. However, on the variable interest rate, yesterday AIB stated it did not envisage any increase in the next 12 months. Can Bank of Ireland also give that assurance?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes, on variable interest rates.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Members had a reasonably constructive conversation about Priory Hall with AIB yesterday. I made the point yesterday that while this is not saying much, its residents state that AIB is the better of the banks with which to deal. AIB spoke about positive solutions, new homes and dealing with each individual resident on its books in the next number of weeks. What is Bank of Ireland's position in respect of Priory Hall?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Bank of Ireland has made contact with these eight account holders. How frequently has it made contact with them?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Were Bank of Ireland to contact them with the type of language used by AIB yesterday, they might be more willing to talk to the bank because AIB is now talking about positive solutions and new homes in the next number of weeks.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Which will lead to what?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I refer to the resolution of what is a particularly unusual situation.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	With respect, considering what members were told yesterday and the "generosity" then on offer regarding this particular situation, yesterday they were given a sense of hope, vision and understanding as to how quickly and positively this situation can be resolved.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I hope Bank of Ireland does. However, if I may finish the question, I am not getting any sense from Mr. Boucher that Bank of Ireland has any solution, positive or negative, in mind. Mr. Boucher is just talking about a process and while everyone knows there is a process, I wish to ascertain what Bank of Ireland considers to be a reasonable outcome for these families who obviously are under considerable stress, considering that the bank still is accumulating interest on the loans they have with it.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Boucher already stated that. However, I wish to know to what is Bank of Ireland open.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am a little disappointed with the vagueness of Mr. Boucher's responses. I do not get any sense of imagination as to how he thinks he can give a sense of hope, considering what the joint committee heard yesterday.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	While not much time remains to me, my last point pertains to branches.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The witnesses' bank, albeit not the gentlemen who are present in particular, has caused an incredible amount of pain to this country and to people living in this country, as have other banks. This era in our history will be spoken of for ten, 20, 30,100 or 200 years to come. I refer to the former site of the Irish Parliament at College Green, which is currently in the bank's hands. Given recent events within Bank of Ireland, do the witnesses not think it would be a reasonable suggestion for the bank to do what the Government has suggested should be done and as a gesture to the Irish people, give that site back to them?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In fairness, the Minister and others have suggested in the past that considering its historical significance, it would be a symbolic gesture for that to be transferred into the hands of the State. Mr. Boucher's gratitude is nice, but pretty meaningless. In terms of a physical transfer of an iconic building, would that be a lasting gesture on the bank's behalf to the Irish people that would be seen as something that would be welcome, and one could look to the future with confidence?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I meant-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I said Mr. Boucher's gratitude was meaningless.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In terms of the tangible material of the College Green bank-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	So it is a "No".
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In summary, I am not getting a significant amount of comfort from Mr. Boucher's strategic plan for those 89% in performing loans and some of those within that group of customers who may be in distress in the coming years. For those Priory Hall residents, although there are only eight, I am getting very little positivity. In terms of the gesture that might be given in terms of the Irish Parliament building in College Green, I am getting nothing at all. However, I appreciate Mr. Boucher's responding to my question.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Ulster Bank representatives to the committee. Representatives from Bank of Ireland stated here earlier that the majority of distressed mortgages in their bank are tracker mortgages. Is that the position in Ulster Bank's case?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is Ulster Bank working proactively or has it a policy to get more of its customer base off tracker mortgages? Are they dragging the bank down?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	If tracker mortgages are, in Mr. Brown's words, a drag on the industry, does that mean there is extra pain being front-loaded on those on different types of mortgage?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I got two very different answers from AIB and Bank of Ireland when I asked about the potential for an increase in the variable interest rate in the next year. The AIB representative stated he could not really foresee it and the Bank of Ireland representative stated he would not rule it out. What is Mr. Brown's view?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Will the bank be engaging with those on tracker mortgages and can they expect contact from the bank with a range of products that the bank thinks may be more favourable to them?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On strategic defaulters, it is a little like when people talk about social welfare where the word "fraud" is always included. Sometimes I wonder whether this is part of the policy in the banking system where the banks talk about defaulters, the word "strategic" gets in there and, before one knows it, that seems to be all we talk about. I am not necessarily suggesting that the Ulster Bank representatives are doing that. Those are merely my own thoughts. AIB's representatives told the committee that they felt 20% of those with distressed mortgages were strategic defaulters. I apologise if Mr. Brown has already answered this question. Would the position be similar at Ulster Bank? Did Mr. Brown give a different figure?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In Mr. Brown's experience, are these mainly buy-to-let properties or are they owner-occupiers?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Why would somebody want to strategically default on a property that is their only property that they are living in?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Surely someone who is a strategic defaulter, in Mr. Brown's terms, of an owner-occupied home, is not somebody who is being devious. It is somebody who needs help.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Would they be frightened? Is that the reason?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	If strategic defaulting is a problem as identified by Mr. Brown and if somebody is frightened to deal with a bank and is an owner-occupier, surely the bank would have imaginative ways of dealing with that situation.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The reason I am saying this is because when people start throwing out terminology such as "strategic defaulters", what forms in somebody's mind is an image of somebody who has a broad portfolio, is merely playing the system, is trying to out-fox the bank and is not playing ball whereas what we possibly have is somebody who is terrified of hearing the telephone ring.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Okay. I have two quick questions. The first is on the link between mortgage arrears and unemployment. Would Mr. Brown accept that many mortgages should not have been given out?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Given the financial situation of the families and individuals involved and their income at that time, would he accept they should not have been given those mortgages?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In my mind, it is the same question.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am sure that experience will teach Mr. Brown as to how to manage the bank's affairs in the future and the bank would never go back to that kind of practice ever again.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I would assume these things are written up in 9 ft. letters on the side of a wall somewhere in Ulster Bank?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I would hope so. I know Mr. Brown has already made some comments about Priory Hall. The families involved in Priory Hall are clinging to every sentence from Mr. Brown. We had two different responses. The response from AIB was reasonably positive and said it would deal individually with families and that in a number of weeks it should have positive solutions for these families. It was disregarding the court case and everything else and said it would be generous, open and honest and try to find a solution for these families in the short term. This was welcomed by the families. The response heard earlier today was not as encouraging. We can easily say it can be done on a case-by-case basis and use the proper formal language or Ulster Bank can say that it is aware that the situation is unique and that it can find imaginative and positive solutions to it. Mr. Brown can give me the coal-face, strait-laced banker answer or he can give me something that the families will respond more positively to but it is over to him.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Does Ulster Bank feel it can be imaginative?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Does Ulster Bank think it will be led by what other banks do?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will conclude with this. We got a positive answer from AIB but did not get a great response from Bank of Ireland but at least it said it might be influenced by what other banks might do in that regard. What I am getting from Mr. Brown is that Ulster Bank will approach it on a case-by-case basis and will not be influenced by any other factors.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Let me assure the Deputy that there is nothing wrong with a bit of good left-wing rhetoric.
