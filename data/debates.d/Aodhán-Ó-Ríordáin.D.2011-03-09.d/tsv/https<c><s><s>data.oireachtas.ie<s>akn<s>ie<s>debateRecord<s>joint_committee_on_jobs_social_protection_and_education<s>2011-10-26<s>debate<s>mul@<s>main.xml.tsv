AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I will call Deputy Seán Crowe, Senator John Kelly and Deputy Michael Conaghan.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We may have to suspend the sitting for a few minutes because a vote has been called in the Dáil Chamber.  It has been suggested to me that at our next meeting we discuss in private session the possibility of a delegation approaching the Ministers for the Environment, Community and Local Government and Social Protection.  Is it agreed to discuss that suggestion at the next meeting of the joint committee?  It is a good suggestion.  Perhaps we will suspend the sitting now to allow members to vote in the Chamber.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I am conscious of time pressures.  I ask the delegation to wait until Deputies return from the Dáil before giving further answers.  We will suspend the sitting briefly to accommodate Deputies' participation in the division.
