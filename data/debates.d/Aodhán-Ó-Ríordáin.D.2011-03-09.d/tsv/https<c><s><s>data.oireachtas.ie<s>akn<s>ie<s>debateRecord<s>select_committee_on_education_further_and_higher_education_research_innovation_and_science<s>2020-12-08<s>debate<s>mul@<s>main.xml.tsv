AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for being here. When the announcement was made that the Department of Education of Skills was to be split up and that the Department in which the Minister of State now serves was to be established, I was not convinced. I did not make any public comment at the time because I was interested to see how it would work out. I am, however, genuinely enthused as to how it has worked out. It was a good move. We are now putting an emphasis on this aspect of education, which was previously swamped in the larger Department. The traditional Department of Education can now focus on the primary and secondary sectors and on other bits under its remit while we can speak to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and to the Minister of State regarding this specific area. I believe he acknowledged in his contribution that a number of policy areas had been allowed to drag and had not really been tackled. The funding issue is central to that. While I appreciate the reason we are here, I might ask the Minister of State a general question or probe him a little bit more. He has mentioned the Cassells report. Did he say that it had gone to the European Commission?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is due back. I do not want to put the Minister of State in the position of making predictions with regard to how we should proceed but there are certainly a number of pinch points in the system. Every single third level institution and college of further education says that it is underfunded. Meanwhile, there is a feeling that there is too great a burden on the individual student or on his or her family. As was alluded to earlier, those of our political persuasion have a vision of free education or education funded exclusively by the taxpayer. The previous Government ruled out any sort of student loans scheme quite strongly. I do not mean to put the Minister of State on the spot but can he give us a sense of how we could work together as a committee to tease through these solutions? There is no quick fix or easy answer. It is not as simple as saying that a given ideological position is much better than any other. I remember when this idea first came to the fore, which I myself benefited from, the argument was made that families who would have spent money on third level education would spend it instead on fee-paying schools to which they would not previously have had access. The argument was that it would only benefit the middle class and that it would not open third level education up to a whole cohort of students who had previously been locked out. It is arguable whether that was actually the case.  As to the future funding of third level education generally, will the Minister of State comment as to how effective this new Department will be in driving that debate? Will he give us some indication as to where he feels we need to go?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I knew I was straying. That is why I was trying to be nice.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	What are the demographic pressures on the Department? Does the Minister of State have a sense of how many more young people, or people in any other age bracket, will be entering third level education? Will more strain be put on the system?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The issue is that the numbers do not stand still.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that.
