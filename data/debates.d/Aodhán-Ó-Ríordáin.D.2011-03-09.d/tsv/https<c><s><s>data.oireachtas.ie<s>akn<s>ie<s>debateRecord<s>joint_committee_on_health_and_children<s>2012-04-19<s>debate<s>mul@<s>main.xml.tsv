AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chairman for giving me an opportunity to speak even though I am not a member of the committee.  I appreciate the opportunity as someone who has an interest in this area and as Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education.  Perhaps the witnesses would be interested in making a presentation at that forum at some stage.I was seven years of age when Senator Coghlan won his gold medal in Helsinki.  It was the first time I remember my father shouting at the television.  I also remember him telling me to look at John Treacy's white cap in Los Angeles the following year.  After that, I assumed Ireland would win medals at every major championship.  It never worked out that way.  I never get embarrassed or shy when I meet famous politicians, but I always get a bit embarrassed when I met the sporting heroes of my childhood.  I ask them to forgive me.Like others who have spoken, I am a former primary school teacher.  I am excited about the proposed initiative.  When I read Born to Run by Christopher McDougall recently, it struck me that we need to facilitate the instinctive nature of children, which is to run and be active.  If one speaks to a yoga teacher, he or she will tell one to breathe in the instinctive manner in which children breathe.  Similarly, we should focus on the instinctive manner in which children run.  Our primary school system puts children in uniforms and subjects the time that they get to be active to a compartmentalised half an hour or hour each week.  In some cases, children are not allowed to run during break time because of insurance issues.Leadership is needed from the Department of Education and Skills - during teacher training, for example - if these problems are to be tackled head-on.  I emphasise that children do not live in schools.  One of the points I made when I was involved in the national literacy strategy was that we cannot expect schools to have all the answers to the literacy problem because children do not live in schools.  The same thing applies to numeracy, educational disadvantage and the initiative we are discussing.  There must be a level of co-ordination between the HSE, public health nurses, local authorities and those engaged with parents from the early stages, because a child can present at school at the age of four with the problem already evident.  It can be more challenging then for the school to intervene, when it already has so many other issues to attend to.I fully agree with regard to subject choice at second level.  Recently I attended a presentation in a secondary school in my constituency in which physical education is only an option for pupils in the senior stream.  This is a concern, particularly in the case of girls with body image and other issues.  Another problem is the competitive nature of sport.  Some schools put a lot of emphasis on team sports, on the football, hockey or rugby team, and if a pupil is not on those teams, he or she is not involved and gets turned off.  We would all like to be an Eamonn Coghlan, a John Treacy or whoever, but what we are really aiming for is for people to be able to enjoy going out for a walk or a run and battling against themselves.  We are not trying to produce superstars, but trying to create a level of internal competition.  This element has been lost and we need to re-understand what sport is all about.  This is key in the context of teacher training and understanding.  Sports teams are great for school morale and identity, but leaving a child standing on the sideline who has been told he or she is not good enough at age 11, does more damage to that child than the good that comes from having a sports team.With regard to funding, forthcoming legislation will place a levy on online betting.  Currently, the total betting levy in Ireland goes to the horse and greyhound fund.  This is justifiable because of the importance of the industry.  However, it is suggested the new levy could raise between €30 million and €90 million.  There is potential to look at that funding stream and to target it at the obesity crisis and to having a more integrated approach towards sport and exercise.  I congratulate the council on its initiative and, perhaps, the education committee will support it.
