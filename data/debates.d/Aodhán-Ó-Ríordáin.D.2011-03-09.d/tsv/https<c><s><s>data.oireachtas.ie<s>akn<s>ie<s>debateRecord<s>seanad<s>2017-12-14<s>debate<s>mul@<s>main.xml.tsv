AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I join everybody else in wishing staff and Members a happy Christmas and others in wishing the Leader all the best for his wedding. I was in a school this morning, Pobalscoil Neasáin in Baldoyle. It is interesting that we had a short discussion about the sexual orientation of various different political leaders and it was of absolutely no interest to them. It was wonderful in the presence of young people that such issues were of no interest.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I remarked to them that when I was a child it would have been almost impossible but now, thanks to the leadership of people like Senator Buttimer, my own colleague, former Deputy John Lyons, the Minister, Deputy Zappone, the Taoiseach and so many others, we can stand in the House like this and wish our good friend and colleague all the best and it is no big deal. I will raise two issues quickly.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In regard to the trade union rights issue, we had a good day here yesterday in terms of having a motion on SNA rights passed with support from the Civil Engagement group, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin. That was brought to the fore because of the actions of IMPACT trade union. The comments that have been made in regard to Ryanair are valid. This is a 30-year issue coming to bite Michael O'Leary quite hard. The message has to go out to the people of Ireland that there are good decent trade unions that one can be a member of that will fight for one's workplace rights and that membership of that union will always be a good thing and money well spent in terms of being part of that. I congratulate all the members of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, many of whom feel strongly on this issue in many directions. My party would call on the Government to move quickly. We hope that no political party, regardless of its reservations, would stop the people from having a say on this issue. We have had the Citizens' Assembly and now the deliberations of the joint committee. We need a referendum now. I hope that no party in the Oireachtas would stop that from happening. I also make a call in regard to the campaign - many of us are anxious about its tone - that on this occasion the erection of posters is something that might be reconsidered on both sides. If we are to have a calm debate, if we are to have something on which people can reflect and analyse, the sloganeering and images that could potentially be erected on posters around the country are things that could be re-examined in terms of their appropriateness in this situation.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I think "dear Leader" is a bit much.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Remember the McFeely guy?
