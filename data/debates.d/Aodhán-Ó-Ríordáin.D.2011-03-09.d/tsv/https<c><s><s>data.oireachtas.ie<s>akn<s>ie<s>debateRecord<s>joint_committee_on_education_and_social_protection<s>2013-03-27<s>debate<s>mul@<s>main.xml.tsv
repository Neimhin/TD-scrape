AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I will now call the meeting to order. Apologies have been received from Deputy Joanna Tuffy. At the request of the broadcasting unit, can members please ensure that their mobile phones are turned off completely for the duration of the meeting and not just left in silent mode. For the information of members, the broadcasting unit will broadcast the public session of this meeting live. The proceedings will be carried on UPC channel 207. We will now go into private session to deal with correspondence and other housekeeping matters.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We are resuming in public session and I am conscious of the time. I once heard a story about a fellow who, when he was told during a public meeting that the Deputies had to go to the Dáil Chamber to vote, said "We did not vote for you to be in the Dáil voting". It is part of the job. I apologise for the delay. We welcome the officials from the Department of Education and Skills to discuss whole school approaches to mental health and bullying. The Children's Mental Health Coalition will give a presentation on these two topics. I welcome the following: Margaret Grogan, regional director of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, who will give a presentation on mental health; Deirdre McDonnell, principal officer, central policy unit, who will give a presentation on bullying; Doreen McMorris, assistant chief inspector; Frances Shearer, national co-ordinator social and personal health education support services; and Hubert Loftus, responsible for teacher allocation and school governance policies. I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. The opening statements the witnesses have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting. Members are reminded of the same parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make changes against a person outside the Houses, or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I invite Ms McDonnell and Ms Grogan to make their opening remarks.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Due to time constraints I might bank some questions. I call Deputy O'Brien followed by Deputy Bannon.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Can we focus on questions, please?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Interagency collaboration was mentioned. What has been the input of the Special Education Support Service and CAMHS to the various guidelines produced recently on bullying and mental health strategies? Continuous professional development for teachers was touched upon by Senator Moran. With regard to NEPS, a number of schools have access to private assessments. How is NEPS focusing on the schools that do not? Is there a policy in this regard? What I experienced, which may have changed in the two years since I was in the classroom, was that clinical assessments in respect of behavioural problems were not offered through NEPS. Is there a policy to change that such that children with behavioural problems may be assessed? Senator Moran referred to the new four-year Bachelor of Education qualification and the two-year higher diploma qualification. Is there capacity in teacher training for greater emphasis on anti-bullying and mental health strategies?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We have that question.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I am conscious of time and that two more speakers want to come in. However, I want to get more clarity on my question concerning clinical assessments. If, after a school goes through every possible intervention to benefit a child's needs, they are crying out for a clinical assessment, would NEPS provide that?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Does anyone wish to comment before I bring in the final two speakers?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	In fairness, I did interject. I am sorry.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We have three minutes. I know that Deputy McConalogue and Deputy Jonathan O'Brien will keep their comments brief if they can.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I do not wish to cut across the Deputy but I am conscious of time.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	In fairness, Deputy, I am conscious of time. It is 2.10 p.m.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Witnesses should be brief in reply. If they wish, they may forward replies in written form.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I am conscious that Deputy Butler asked about boards of management. Can that be touched on?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I am very conscious of time. We have gone way over.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	If the Deputy gives the witnesses an opportunity to speak, he might get an answer.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I must put my foot down. We have all had an opportunity to ask questions.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I will ask the guests to conclude.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Members are anxious to continue this discussion and flesh out the issues. We will try to invite the witnesses back at the earliest opportunity. Unfortunately, we have three different presentations from three different groups today and our time is short. I thank the witnesses for their presentations. Before they leave, I acknowledge Daniel and Donald from Drimnagh Castle who are leaving the room. They have been heavily involved in setting up an anti-cyberbullying website in their school. I welcome the representatives of the Children's Mental Health Coalition. I look forward to their presentation.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We have three presentations today and I wish to conclude this section of the meeting at 3 p.m. We want to get the maximum out of the encounter. I urge members to be mindful that they should ask questions rather than make statements. A variety of people are present with different expertise to respond to questions.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	That is more of a statement than a question.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Okay, but quickly.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Ms Leydon was asked specifically about the mental health issues in the teaching body, and Ms Clarke was asked about the area-based approach and the strategy in Ballymun. Does Ms Leydon want to respond to that?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I am conscious of time.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I will come back to the Senator when Ms McClorey has responded.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We agreed earlier to finish this section at 3 p.m. There are people outside who have been waiting two hours to come in. I must be fair to everybody. I call Ms McClorey.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	The next speaker is Deputy Jim Daly, followed by Senator Moloney. I ask members to be brief.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps the delegates would respond to Deputy Daly's questions on the teacher training colleges and children in care.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Who wants to take that question? I call Deputy Butler but he must be very brief.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for attending. This is an issue we will have to come back to. From a school perspective, the various agencies they must deal with and the responsibilities that come under Departments, be it Health, Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs or whatever, is frustrating. We will send on the presentations to the Minister for Education and Skills but we will ask Department of Health officials to appear before the committee to give us more insight into how we can overcome the difficulties. I thank the witnesses for their excellent presentations. I am sorry the time was short but we got a huge amount from the presentations. We will suspend briefly while the next witnesses come in. I ask members to remain if they possibly can do so because those making the next presentation have been waiting two hours.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I welcome Dr. Don Thornhill, Mr. John Church, Professor Oliver FitzGerald and Dr. Robert Ryan. I also welcome officials from Arthritis Ireland to discuss with us the costs of absenteeism in the workplace arising from musculoskeletal disorders. By virtue of section 17(2)(l ) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I also advise that the opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I invite Mr. John Church to make his opening remarks. I apologise for the delay in taking the presentation.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I fully agree with Dr. Thornhill.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I am quite stunned by the figures Dr. Ryan has cited. Committee members will pose questions, but there are no representatives of Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin or the Technical Group here. How were the figures of €750 million a year for 7 million lost working days and €280 million spent on illness benefit arrived at?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Are we talking about a recurring illness - not something that will go away overnight, but one that will dog somebody for a considerable period of time?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Is it the single biggest cause of absenteeism through sickness in the workplace?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	A Seanad vote has been called. The delegation has outlined a particular problem and the figures are very stark. I am impressed by the wide coalition of employers, unions, experts, patient organisations, etc. Has the potential solution been costed? Knowing the cost could determine policymakers' reaction to it.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Is there potential to go from public sector department to public sector department initially? It was stated large corporations might be better resourced to roll out the model before the establishment of a national plan. Could this approach be considered first?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	This is a cross-party committee of the Oireachtas that invites witnesses to discuss subjects such as that under discussion. Has Mr. Church had any face-to-face contact with departmental officials or Ministers with regard to his body of work and research?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	It can be a difficult challenge for something like this because the committee structure here is so compartmentalised. Even the previous presentation would have gone between committees dealing with health, children and education. However, Mr. Church is here from the social protection viewpoint and is focusing on those savings. Are there any further comments in summary?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	What helps Dr. Thornhill's case is that he has identified the problem. If this is the No. 1 reason why people are missing work, then obviously it is something that has to be corrected. All of us on this committee believe that early intervention is the key in most areas of policy. Dr. Thornhill has identified the costs. In his initial presentation he said he was looking for champions in this regard. A champion will always be asked the hard questions - for example, if one has a model for intervention how much will it cost? That body of work will have to be done in order to get the cost structure fine-tuned.  The suggestion of going Department by Department, sector by sector or through larger private sector entities first, is a good one. Dr. Thornhill said that having 50% of employees in small or medium-sized businesses might not necessarily be the way to go yet. I certainly think we should keep in contact with each other. We often have presentations here with a good engagement, but the relationship may not be built up or we do not come back to see where it has gone. After Dr. Thornhill has met the Minister and the conference has been held, perhaps he could communicate again with the committee. We will certainly circulate the presentation and post it on our website.  Anyone who has heard today's presentations will certainly be convinced by the validity of Dr. Thornhill's argument. I thank him and his colleagues for attending the committee. 
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	In conclusion, I wish to thank our guests for having briefed us so comprehensively. We will send their presentations to the Minister for a written response on the issues that have been raised. I wish all members of the committee a happy Easter. The committee now stands adjourned until 1 p.m. on Wednesday, 17 April 2013.
