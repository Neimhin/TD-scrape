AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister of State for taking this debate. It relates to the Killester-Raheny-Clontarf Educate Together school, which has been given sanction for opening in September of this year after a long campaign. In fact, it is a year since I held a public meeting in Clontarf trying to get a campaign going. As a result of the patronage competition, shall we call it, Educate Together came out on top and an announcement was made that the school would open in September of this year. Many parents are delighted to hear that. However, I am slightly perturbed by the news that it will be a one-stream school as opposed to a two-stream Educate Together school, which is also sanctioned for Dublin 13 in Howth. In that period of time around and after the campaign, parents have been asking where the school will be located. The catchment area for the school is quite defined. It borders the Malahide Road, the Clontarf Road, the Tonlegee Road and the Kilbarrack Road. We were assuming that the school would be housed within that section, but what has actually happened is that two solutions have been found in the one area. Both new Educate Together primary schools are going to be housed together in the Suttonians Rugby Football Club, outside the catchment area. This smacks to me of a lazy decision by the Department. It is understandable to find one solution for the Dublin 13 Educate Together, and put it in Suttonians temporarily, but to lump the other Educate Together in there, outside of its catchment area, does not make any sense at all to me. What has happened now is that the momentum behind the school has been undermined. Parents who live in Clontarf, Raheny or Killester, who were intending to send their children to this school, do not really fancy the idea of going all the way out to Sutton and back, and have since withdrawn their children's' names from the enrolment in the school. I would like to give some background on this. There have been numerous attempts to establish a multidenominational school in the Clontarf area and the communities around Clontarf going back probably 30 years, and they have all been unsuccessful. Schools have ended up in Glasnevin, Marino or North Bay in Kilbarrack. There has never been a successful campaign until this one, and now we find that the very location of the school is going to be outside the catchment area. The Department needs to re-engage with the process to find a temporary location within the catchment area, which should not be that difficult. It has made a lazy decision in order to locate the school in Suttonians Rugby Football Club, alongside the other Educate Together school. The starting up of a school and the ethos and momentum that surrounds it is so important in the early days, and now we find a number of parents who are very disappointed. First, it is a one-stream school, so it is difficult to get into in the first place.Second, if a child is offered a place, he or she will, as we have discovered, have to travel all the way to Sutton and back. A return trip from Clontarf to Sutton is about 14 km. It is not reasonable for parents to drive infants to Sutton and back just so they can access multidenominational education. I ask the Minister of State to engage with his Department to reconsider the final decision to use Suttonians Rugby Football Club as the temporary location of Killester-Raheny-Clontarf Educate Together school, re-engage in the process to find a temporary location within the catchment area and ensure this school gets off to the best possible start.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This is probably one of the most disappointing responses I have received. I have raised a number of issues concerning education with Ministers and I generally have reasonable interaction but this is probably the most disappointing response. I have a two-page answer, of which only the following sentence sheds any light on the issue: "Numerous locations in the school planning area were considered in regard to the interim accommodation for the school but could not be secured due to the lack of suitability or availability, or prohibitive zoning issues.” Is the Minister of State saying the residents who have engaged in this process, campaigned and pre-enrolled their children are stuck with Sutton for the coming years? Is that how it is to be? Is this the end of the matter? Can the matter be reopened? I am not overly enthusiastic about the response I got. I want to know whether the Minister of State can impress on the Minister and the Department that they are completely undermining the validity of this entire project by insisting on parents taking a 14 km round trip to Sutton and back. Sutton is outside the catchment area of the school. I do not accept that the Department has gone out of its way to find suitable accommodation but could not do so due to the lack of suitability or availability, or prohibitive zoning issues. It seems it found one answer for Dublin 13 and made the same decision for Killester-Raheny-Clontarf. This is a lazy decision which needs to be revisited. I would expect a much better response from a Department if it were genuinely taking this matter seriously.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	One cuts a ribbon, I suppose.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I propose an amendment to the Order of Business: that the debate on the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 should not proceed past 6 p.m. and that Private Members' time commence upon the adjournment of that Bill. I believe the Bill has been given adequate time.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am proposing that the debate on the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016, which the Leader has suggested will conclude at 7.30 p.m., be adjourned at 6 p.m., if not previously concluded.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Order of Business would remain as it stands. The Leader is seriously eating into my time, but-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Leader has suggested the debate end at 7.30 p.m. and I am suggesting that it should conclude at 6 p.m.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	A journalist, Ms Sarah Jane Murphy, has highlighted the issue of anti-social behaviour on the DART. This matter has been raised on numerous occasions in the House. The Labour Party has made a practical suggestion in respect of it and our spokesperson, Senator Humphreys, has been quite vocal about the need for a dedicated transport police or a division of An Garda Síochána to be used to help protect commuters who use the DART. There is a fear that this much needed transport system will be undermined by reports of anti-social behaviour. I often hear about anti social behaviour at the stations in Bayside, Clongriffin and Howth Junction, which are all in my part of the world. The removal of staff from the stations, ticket machines being broken and glass panelling being cracked are just some of the issues that have arisen. I would appreciate a debate on that issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross. When those in Fianna Fáil use words such as "scandal" and "underhand", as was the case following the announcement of the broadband scheme yesterday, it is really the worst of politics. I want to quote into the record of the House the comments of the economist, David McWilliams, who tweeted, "One bidder, astronomical cost, [Department of Finance] against it, yet State forks out €3 billion weeks before an election and will give asset back to consortium who [paid] to build it. This is children's hospital territory. Fianna Fáil gotta to [sic] pull the plug!". If Fianna Fáil was in government and acting in this way, Fine Gael would be the first party to cry foul. Just before an election, an announcement has been made regarding a contract relating to rural Ireland and worth €3 billion.Fine Gael may not, for ideological reasons, realise that the real killer for people is that €3 billion of State funding is going into an entity which will then be handed over in its entirety to a private operator. If Fine Gael had the guts, it would not have stood over a situation where the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, was organising and attending dinners with Mr. David McCourt, together with the former Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten. The Minister of State got away with that scot free. Any other Minister of State involved in such a scenario would have resigned on the day it was discovered. Fianna Fáil let it go because it is more interested in retaining its arrangement with the Government until it has improved its poll ratings. For that party's Members to stand up now and talk about scandal and underhandedness is way out of line.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I did. It was enlightening.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Labour Party would never stand over this and the Leader knows it.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Leader knows it. It is €3 billion worth being given over to a private entity.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Leader knows I am right. That is the problem. He actually agrees with me.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There are lots of problems with the Labour Party.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, to the Chamber. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which we first proposed a year ago, and I am delighted the Labour Party group has facilitated its Second Stage. It is a free education Bill. What is there to oppose about that? Many Senators would not necessarily understand the importance of free education. For some people in society and in these Houses, education is something that can be bought but it should not be that way. Our Constitution specifically states primary education is free as a constitutional right but we have not vindicated that right. We in the Labour Party have outlined a number of initiatives about how that right should be vindicated. We have proposed a free book scheme, where children in the Republic of Ireland would be able to avail of schoolbooks just as children in Northern Ireland avail of them for free. Remarkably, we are the ones who are supposed to live in a Republic, as opposed to the children in Northern Ireland, but we do not have free education. The point of the Bill is to remind all of us that the relationship between a parent or child and the school the child attends should not be financial. It should be one of growth, beauty, education and learning, which should be all one speaks about in the corridors of a school with a parent, student or child. Far too often, however, the letters that are sent home from a school to a parent via a student request a voluntary contribution. If the parent is not in a position to provide the so-called voluntary contribution, the interaction between that parent and the school will become financial, while the likelihood that he or she will engage in school activities will be inhibited. If one feels one does not have the money to give a voluntary contribution, is one less or more likely to attend the parent-teacher meeting, where one will be reminded of that fact? Is one less or more likely to attend a football match or a school concert, or to engage at the school gate with a teacher or a principal who will tell the parents, "By the way, I hope you saw that note we sent home about the voluntary contribution." In a fully functioning democracy that values education, we would not have voluntary contributions. There are many countries in Europe, particularly in Scandinavia, which consider it unbelievable there would be a fundraiser for a school. Is that not what taxes are for? Many will say that without voluntary contributions, the lights cannot be kept on, the school cannot be heated and school activities cannot function properly. Is that not the conversation we should have, namely, about the proper State funding of our school system? Some say the Bill will cost €45 million. Let us find the €45 million, in that case. Let us not speak in terms of tax cuts but rather about proper provision of education for children. As many people may know, I used to teach and was principal of a school in a disadvantaged part of this city. We were not in the position to ask anybody for a voluntary contribution, nor to ask anybody for a contribution at all. We were not in the position to hold fundraisers that would raise between €40,000 and €50,000, as happens in other parts of the city, because the parents did not have the money. Is that the kind of education system we want to stand over, where those who can provide more receive more, where their children receive more, where their schools receive more, while those who cannot provide the same do not receive the same? Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools, DEIS, does not plug the gap. The Bill is not trying to prevent fundraisers. They will still be able to be held, with the morale-boosting cake sale and the table quiz, where funds can be raised for general school activities if the school so wishes. A contribution, however, will not be able to be linked to a school activity. The school will not be able to say that if parents do not give money, their children cannot participate, have a locker, take part in a school trip, or avail of whatever resources should be available to every child. We have tried, as have many Governments, to work with school patrons and boards of management to lessen the practice of sending voluntary contribution letters, but it is not working. We have to ban them, therefore, by bringing in legislation that bans the linkage of contributions to school activities. I return to the conversations that parents and students will have about their relationship with the school. How humiliating is it for a child if a teacher or principal surreptitiously identifies him or her in a class and gives the child a little note for his or her mammy? The child will know, as will the parent, that the reason the note has been given to him or her is that the parent has not had the capability to give the voluntary contribution, which can be anything in the region of €85, €150 or €200. The school will say that without the voluntary contribution, the school cannot be kept alive. That is the conversation the school needs to have with the State and the Department of Education and Skills, which need to be real about the day-to-day running of schools. The Department does not want to have that conversation, however, and it would prefer if it was not its responsibility at all. It would prefer the school managers to run the schools and the boards of management to do what they will, while the Department merely provides the curriculum and pays the teachers. I do not agree with that. We need a State education system which we need the Department to take seriously and fund. That is why we pay our taxes. That is what a fair, transparent and progressive taxation system is all about, and schools should not ask for parents to foot the bill a second time. Fundamentally, what we are trying to achieve is not to stop fundraising or contributions if somebody wants to contribute to a school. Rather, it is intended to stop the practice of linking financial contributions to school activities and of so-called voluntary contributions because they are not voluntary.What does the aspiration or vision of free education mean? Free education means one does not have to pay for one's books. Free education means one does not have to pay for the school trip. Free education means one is not asked repeatedly for money for arts supplies. Free education means one does not have to pay for the school meal. Free education means one does not have to pay for school transport. This stuff has to be paid for but this is the choice that we have to make in Irish society. Do we believe in a tax cutting regime which individualises everything, which benefits the rich more and which entrenches inequality or do we believe in the provision of public services for everybody? Please do not tell me about the schemes we have in disadvantaged schools, etc. More than one disadvantaged child will be found in every single school in this land as will overlapping, entrenched, intergenerational disadvantage and these are still the children who get the letter home asking for a so called voluntary contribution. It is humiliating, it is undermining, it is embarrassing and it is completely unnecessary in one of the richest countries in Europe. I appreciate the Government is not opposing the Bill. What we can achieve this evening is that we stand fast to that republican ideal of free education. It is not something I just came up with, it is entrenched in the Constitution of the land. Let us vindicate that right, let us make education free and let us break this chain that drags down so many parents at the school gate, that they will not go past it because they do not have the money. It is not because there is a fee involved in sending one's child to a school in the vast majority of cases. They will not pass the school gate because somebody will ask them an awkward question about the voluntary contribution and the few quid. They will ask parents what is €85 when they are providing education but education is the great leveller and the great liberator. It is the one thing that frees more people from poverty than anything else, not because it turns people into economic units so they can compete in the job market but because it frees the mind. It opens people up to beauty, to poetry and to language and to know the value of love and interpersonal relationships. Education is everything and a price tag cannot be put on it but in far too many circumstances, there are far too many families who have an envelope in September that they cannot fill. Let us take away that conversation. Let us make the conversations at the school gate about education and about beauty, language, poetry, aspiration and the matters that make the hair stand on the back of the neck. Let us not make it about an envelope and a contribution. Let us make it purely and simply about education.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Sometimes in this House we introduce legislation and are not sure how far it will go, what it will inspire, whether it will be viewed in a particular way or become a political football, or whether we are all just playing games here. Notwithstanding the contributions of Senators Byrne and Horkan, I find myself humbled to be in a room having listened to what Senators Gavan and Ruane had to say about this legislation. Perhaps it will not get very far and maybe the Government will not accord to it the respect it deserves. Perhaps it will fall on the next Stage, maybe it will be amended to death, or maybe the House will fall before it gets any further but, that said, it was worth listening to what Senator Gavan said about moving from the United Kingdom to Ireland, the necessity of buying books and the ideological reality of the choices voters can make. Having heard Senator Gavan, I am reflecting on the question of what in God's name the Senator and I are doing in different political parties. This Bill is about the power of the State to deliver equality. The market cannot be trusted to deliver equality because it has no conscience. One cannot depend on the private pocket to deliver what are fundamental State services that will lift people out of poverty. I listened to Senator Ruane outline her real-life experience and to her powerful words.Her note of caution to Senators speaks to the real, lived experience of those we are trying to serve. Schools are not about boards of management. As a former teacher and school principal, I venture to suggest that schools are in fact not even about teachers. The best advice I got when I became a school principal was to put the child at the centre of every decision I made. I took that to the extreme and at the end of the school day I used to sit in their seats to see what they saw, how far they were from the blackboards we had in those days and from the windows and toilets. It was to see how cramped they were. One began to realise that the complaints children sometimes had in class were real. They do not just complain for the sake of it, these are real experiences for them. One does not know what the experience of a child is if one is a teacher sitting at a teacher's desk. As Senator Ruane stated, the board of management runs the school but the whole point of the education exercise is to inspire people in kitchens and sitting rooms across the land to feel that schools are on their side completely. People should feel that the school and the teacher support them every step of the way and that schools, teachers and principals are singing from the same hymn sheet completely to inspire, drive and help children to grow in a way that, perhaps, their parents did not get a chance to. There is then an envelope and a request for a voluntary contribution because something must be paid for and the books must balance. We all live in the real world. I know we have to heat schools. They must be lit and they must function. However, that is a broader question for the State. There should be no humiliation and any possible circumstance of humiliation a child might feel must be eliminated. Humiliation is not something that happens on the day a child goes to school and has to say his or her mother, father or grandparent will give the money when they can. It sticks with one for life. It is not a temporary thing. It does not stick with one for a day or a week. One remembers for the rest of one's life how one felt when one did not have the money and that gets passed to the next generation. If it has achieved anything, the Bill has at least allowed us to trade comments and experiences and to discuss the beauty of education and the need to ensure that it is there for everyone and does not come with a price tag. If there is any barrier whatsoever to someone's engagement with a school community, it must be removed. If it costs €45 million to deliver free education or €100 million to deliver the school books scheme, that is a small price to pay. In the context of other conversations we are having on broadband and the children's hospital, €100 million is nothing. What a small price to pay when the cost of not doing it is so great. The cost in humiliation and shame is intergenerational and lasts a lifetime. I appreciate that the Government is not opposing the Bill. I appreciate that Governments and civil servants must make arguments about why things cannot, should not or may not be able to be done. I get all that, but we have opened a conversation for all of us within our various political parties to reassess the value of education, school life, vision, beauty, love, poetry and all the things we say we believe in. When it comes to election time, we can prioritise the public good, public need and public service above the private tax cut. That is what the children and families of Ireland need. There is no price we should consider too costly if it is to eliminate the possibility of any child or parent feeling humiliation.
