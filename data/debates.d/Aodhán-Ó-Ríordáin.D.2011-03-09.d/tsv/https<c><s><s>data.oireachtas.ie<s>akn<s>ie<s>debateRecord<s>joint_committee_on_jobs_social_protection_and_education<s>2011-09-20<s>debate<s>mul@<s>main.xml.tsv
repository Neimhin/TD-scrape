AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for the presentation, which I read earlier.  I apologise for being late.  I have a simple question regarding policies and procedures.  The witnesses touched on some of the issues regarding skill sets, and it has been mentioned that it is a great new opportunity with the new agency being set up to replace FÁS.  My understanding is that FÁS as it is currently does not have an adult literacy policy, for example.  When almost 23% of the adult population are functionally illiterate, with a high level of those early school leavers or people involved in the construction industry trying to upskill, not having an adult literacy strategy within FÁS seems to be strange, at best, or completely irresponsible at worst.Can we be absolutely sure that the new agency and agencies dealing with adult education or further retraining will have a component to ensure literacy standards of those who are coming under the new agency's umbrella will be addressed?  Will there be knowledge as to where such people stand in the world?  If a person does not have the fundamental ability to read, the chances of maximising employment potential is fairly low.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	My point is whether it is a matter of policy or is it just an action the FÁS personnel would carry out?  I would rather have it as a matter of policy than depend on the goodwill of those working in FÁS.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Mulligan agree that it should be done as a matter of policy?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the delegates for their presentation.  I will make three quick comments, one on the community primary school, one on the literacy strategy and one on the overall structure.When I listened to Deputy Conaghan talking about the waning influence of the Catholic Church on education, I was reminded of a phrase uttered by someone else in a different context: "They haven't gone away, you know."  I was going to ask the delegates for their views on the VECs' involvement at community national school level, but as they have already answered the question, I will not pursue it.I appreciate the comments the delegates made on the literacy strategy.  They pre-empted some of what I was going to say.  They had obviously listened to my comments and questions to the previous panel.  I understand absolutely what the VECs are doing on literacy.  Many VECs, including the one in Dublin, which I represent, are located in areas of social disadvantage with high levels of adult illiteracy.  My point is that we need a policy framework to be embedded in every education institution in order that when we deal with adults, parents and the community at large, there is an understanding of the levels of illiteracy.  We need to work beyond the current frameworks.  At primary level, there are five policies that every primary school has to have, but a literacy policy is not one of them.  I am not talking about a subject on the curriculum but about the way in which a school engages with the wider community.  There should be a policy framework in place for this.The third item I want to mention is the overall structure of the VECs and political involvement.  I make this point with the greatest respect to the president.  I am on the board of management of a VEC, not as a councillor, which I was in my previous political existence, but as the principal of a primary school, and the structure strikes me as a little odd.  Will the delegates comment on the level of political involvement by councillors and the fact that they are, in effect, the chairpersons of the boards of management?  Does this structure offer the best way forward and is this the way it should be from now on?  Does it need examination?  Is there a danger of conflicts of interest all over the place?  Various health boards were dismantled or changed as a result of accusations of local political interference.  I am not suggesting anyone on a board anywhere in the country is doing this, but I have questions on the issue.  If a chairperson is trying to drive a board of management and maximise the education potential of the student body, should they be unconcerned with matters political?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Not at all.  I did not mean any disrespect to anyone.  I asked the question to see what the reaction would be.
