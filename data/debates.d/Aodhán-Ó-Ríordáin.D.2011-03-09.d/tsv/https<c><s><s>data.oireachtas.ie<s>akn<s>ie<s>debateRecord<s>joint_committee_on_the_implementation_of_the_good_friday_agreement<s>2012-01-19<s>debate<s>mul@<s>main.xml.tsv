AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chair and apologise for not being here for the start of the meeting.  I had to attend a presentation on another matter in which I have a particular interest.  I welcome the witnesses.Following on from what Deputy Crowe said, I am the grandson of an ex-prisoner who fought in the Civil War.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes.  He escaped from jail and was on the run during the last the week of it and was then put back in.  He became a customs officer, bizarrely, having being an anti-treaty prisoner.  I always thought that was kind of funny.  Our family has always had a romantic view of that period.  What has come across in many of our discussions at this committee is the new generation and their romantic view of the Troubles, the murals and the stories.  Some of that has come from the tales of what happened inside prison.  I remember watching a documentary once because coming from Dublin I feel very removed from what happened in Northern Ireland in that period.  In that documentary one ex-prisoner said he missed being in prison because of the comradery, togetherness and sense of identity and that he was lost on the outside.I have two questions for the witnesses.  What can ex-prisoners do to guide the new generation who are becoming as entrenched and as sectarian in their views as possibly any generation previously?  That has come across at every meeting we have had with any group anywhere, that the new generation of 16 and 17 year olds are just as entrenched in these views as any generation previously and there is a sense that they missed out.  There seems to be a conflict in that there is a sense of identity in the context that there was a turf war and something in which they could have been engaged but they missed out on that period and they are almost trying to relive it.  How can ex-prisoners be part of the process to ensure that there is a level of understanding that it was not so glorious and that being in prison is not so romantic and there is a huge price to be paid?I was not here for the first part of the meeting to hear the witnesses' presentation  I accept that being in prison is a part of somebody's life and it does not contextualise the rest of their existence.  I hope to God that my five years' here will not contextualise the rest of my existence and that I will be able to go back into normal society and live a normal life at some stage.  This place, Dáil Éireann, has been described as an open prison.  The question is how we reconcile what we are all trying to achieve for ex-prisoners with how the victims' families feel.  Their emotions can still be raw.  It is difficult to marry these two expectations.  Families of victims feel they are still imprisoned to some extent, given that family members are missing.  This must be balanced with the justified expectation that someone can move on, gain employment and live a proper and fulfilled life in society.
