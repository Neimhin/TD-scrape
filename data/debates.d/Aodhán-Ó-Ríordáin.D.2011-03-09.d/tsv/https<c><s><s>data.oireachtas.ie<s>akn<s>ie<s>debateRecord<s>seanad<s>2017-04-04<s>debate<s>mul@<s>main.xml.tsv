AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I very much appreciate the Minister being here in person to address this issue. He will be well aware of the geographical area related to this issue as it is in his constituency. I was involved in a campaign to establish an Educate Together school in the Drumcondra area, and one of the first actions the Minister took on taking office was to sanction the approval of that Educate Together primary school in Dublin 3 in the Marino-Drumcondra area. The campaign to establish that school was elongated and it took a long time to get it off the ground but it was successful. There are some long-established Educate Together schools in the more northern end of the constituency, which the Minister knows very well, in an area where a major degree of construction is taking place and where there has been major growth in the population. The people in that area will need a number of facilities, including school facilities. In terms of Educate Together schooling, in line with the vision of the previous Government and, I hope, with that of the Minister, he will be familiar with the Educate Together schools in Kilbarrack and in Belmayne. We are asking that there would be a logical continuum of that ethos of education for the children who attend those schools. There has been a metamorphosis in the ethos of one second level school, Clonturk community college, into a new type of school with joint patronage. What we hope to achieve in Dublin 13, which covers a number of areas, including Clongriffin, Belmayne, Donaghmede, Baldoyle and Sutton, is that a new Educate Together would be established to facilitate those children, living in the area of rapid population, who attend an Educate Together school to have a continuum of that ethos of education, which is available to every other schoolchild attending other schools in the area. No other children in that area attending another school is asked to change the ethos of his or her schooling when he or she moves from primary to second level. If a child attends a Gaelscoil, there is a facility for him or her to attend a second level Gaelscoil. If a child attends a Catholic ethos school, he or she can continue that ethos at second level. That is not available to children who attend an Educate Together primary school.  While it is appreciated that the Department of Education and Skills has made great strides in recent years in increasing the number of Educate Together schools that are available for parents who want that ethos for their children's education, it does not make any sense for that to stop once a child reaches sixth class. While the growth in this type of education is greatly appreciated, the parents and members of the committee involved, some of whom are in the Public Gallery, want to know what process they can pursue and how they can work with Government and the Department to make this a reality. This campaign does not necessarily need to be fractious or full of tension or friction. We want to achieve the establishment of an educational institution that the children can have to continue their education in the ethos chosen - as is a constitutional right - by their parents. I ask the Minister to outline where those involved in the campaign are to go next. These children attend an Educate Together school at primary level, or some of them do not. They live in an area that is under major development. They need a process whereby they can work with the Minister and his Department to arrive at a stage where they will be able to have a new education facility available to them. Nobody can convince me, and I am sure the Minister would agree with me, that this area will not need extra school places in the years to come. What we want is fair play. There have been moves across the city and the country with respect to the opening up of second level education. Often it is easier to open up a primary school rather than a second level school, but in areas of north County Dublin there are various different models, including community school models. I am mindful of the Malahide area where the Educate Together model has been approved by the Department because it is seen as providing a continuum of education which is necessary for the children concerned.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I respectfully ask the Minister for a positive response to this issue.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for his response. The Minister is very familiar with the area. It does not take too much effort to appreciate that population pressure is only a number of years away given the incredible intensity of building work and apartment building in the area. Could the Minister at least commit that he or his Department officials will work with the campaigning group, which is open to all sorts of options, including a similar type of arrangement to that in Clonturk, in order to facilitate children to have a continuum of education? I do not think the Malahide and Portmarnock option will fly when one has such a large geographical area that is in need of this facility and considering that the vast majority of those places will be taken up by people living in the area. I say that with the greatest respect to the Minister. I appreciate him being here in person and his comprehensive reply. I also appreciate the constraints under which he is operating as Minister.Could the Minister give a commitment that his officials will sit down with the campaigning group and outline how best this campaign can proceed, what type of information it needs, what type of population figures will help the case and give realistic projections of what the population growth will be? As the Minister knows, it is only a matter of time until-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----there is a campaign for second level schools to facilitate the population numbers.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In this House we are well used to hearing congratulatory statements from all quarters about the achievements of our sporting sides who wear the green. I am a particular fan of ladies football, soccer, Gaelic and rugby. I spend a good bit of my time supporting my local team, Shelbourne Ladies FC, which tends to win various domestic titles, as well as in its previous guise as Raheny United. What happened this morning at a press conference in Liberty Hall should appal every sports fan in this country. It is not just an issue of gender equality; it is more an issue of workers' rights and representative rights than anything else. Effectively, the entire Irish senior women's soccer team was forced into a situation where the players had to hold a press conference at 10.30 a.m. at Liberty Hall to demand action on their rights as individuals. They are simply demanding they should have representative rights from the Professional Footballers Association of Ireland, which League of Ireland players have and which the senior men's team have but the FAI is not allowing this.  Some of the instances they outlined today were quite simply appalling. These are people who wear the green of this country in stadiums all over the world. They are not even allowed to have their own tracksuits. They have to share the tracksuits with the under-19s so they have to assemble at Dublin Airport to go abroad to play for their country and they have to change into their tracksuits in the public toilets. This is unbelievable.  I respectfully suggest that the Minister come in here and address this issue. In fairness to him, he is somebody who has spoken out of the need for gender equality on sporting boards. He is somebody who has a very deep interest in gender equality. This is not just a case of gender equality; this is about representation of a bunch of elite sportspeople who want to represent their country and are out of pocket because in Ireland, a person who is not a professional footballer because he or she plays in the domestic league here will lose a day's pay by going to play for his or her country. It is unbelievable that after many years of having behind-the-scenes grumbling about the situation, they were obliged to come together this morning in Liberty Hall to speak about their grievances. If we in this House are serious about congratulating our Irish men and women who go across the world and wear the green with pride, we should all collectively be embarrassed that an Irish team would have to change in the public toilets of Dublin Airport to get into tracksuits which are not even their own.I ask respectfully if we could ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come into the House because we give these people money. It is State funding - taxpayers' money - that funds the FAI and if it is not going to properly look after elite sports people in that organisation, then we have to seriously reassess our relationship with that body. I am appalled and I ask that the Leader facilitates that debate.
