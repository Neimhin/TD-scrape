AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I congratulate Deputy Tuffy on her election to the Chair.  I commend her predecessor, Deputy Hannigan, on a successful year as Chairman.  I welcome our guest, the Secretary of State and pay tribute to his Government's response to Bloody Sunday and the apology his Prime Minister gave in the House of Commons.  That meant a lot to the people of Derry.We were struck on our visits to Northern Ireland by the ongoing problem of sectarianism.  Although sectarianism is classless, its most overt and violent interfaces are in areas of social disadvantage.  In regard to the poverty alleviation measures being considered for Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State spoke about public housing and education.  It is believed that sectarianism is hardening among younger people who never witnessed the Troubles, feel they missed out and are looking for a sense of empowerment.  How is the UK Government engaging with the authorities in Northern Ireland in this regard and what role can integrated education play?We recently met the families bereaved by the Monaghan bombings.  We met some brave, articulate and inspirational people but they feel let down by successive British Governments over the past 40 years.  The Oireachtas is powerless to assist them without co-operation from the Secretary of State's Government.  They want access to State papers and information on the background to the events that led to the death of their loved ones.  Those wounds will never heal unless co-operation is forthcoming from the British authorities.  We have come very far in terms of relations between North and South, among the various communities in the North and between this country and Britain but a number of issues remain outstanding.  Much has been done to heal the wounds of Bloody Sunday but this is an ongoing issue for those affected by the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, who believe there is an unnecessary obstacle in the way of their healing.
