AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for taking this debate on anti-social behaviour in the Beaumont area. I am always reluctant to discuss matters of anti-social behaviour in a public forum because it does not necessarily lead to a good outcome and can stigmatise an area if not done sensitively, but the issues at hand have got to such a degree that I feel my hand has been forced. There is an estate called Collinswood, and in that estate is a laneway that leads to the main Beaumont Road. In that laneway, a number of incidents have happened, including multiple muggings, and there is a general sense of danger and intimidation. A number of individuals have been intimidated in the wider estate and a gang seems to be going around the place causing havoc. After a public meeting that I organised, a number of other people from around the area have contacted me. One told me that her son had been the subject of a 45-minute mugging in August. There was the well publicised case of a 13 year old boy who was assaulted and had his bike taken from him just outside Beaumont Hospital. Another individual contacted me to say that his wife, when intervening alongside their daughter in a mugging in the same area, had her shoulder broken. There seems to have been an escalation in anti-social behaviour in and around the Beaumont area in recent months. I have met senior Garda management, which is familiar with the issues and is trying in whatever way it can to respond to them. I have no issue with the response or determination of the Garda to sort out the problem, but the question inevitably comes back to the resources the Garda in that area has, be it at Raheny Garda station, Clontarf Garda station or Santry Garda station. A point raised by a resident is that Santry Garda station closes at 7.30 p.m. A large amount of Government time, energy and resources have been put into the reopening of Stepaside Garda station. I do not know what kind of criminality or anti-social behaviour is happening in Stepaside to warrant that amount of resources and political attention, but the area I am discussing, which I live near and which I am trying to represent to the best of my ability, is in need of special attention to root out this problem and ensure people can live quiet lives without a sense of intimidation hanging over them and the area in which they live. It is a proud and good area with decent people who are just trying to live their lives. If it were not for the seriousness of the issues and the fact that they are being raised time and again, I would not necessarily be standing here and talking about them, as I am often reluctant to go public with an issue and name a particular district. I want the Minister of State to respond positively to what I am outlining and commit to providing more resources so that gardaí can patrol the area better and give a sense of security to people living locally, allowing them to go about their daily business without the threat of intimidation or assault hanging over them.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Unfortunately, I am not overly impressed by the Minister of State's response. An Garda Síochána says it needs more resources and that this requires political decision but when one raises the issue with political masters they say it is an issue for the Garda Commissioner. The assistant Garda commissioner said Stepaside Garda station was not a priority, yet the Government is proceeding to reopen it. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, to impress on the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, the seriousness of what is happening in this area in terms of the number of muggings and assaults on young people, leaving them traumatised. I recently sat in the kitchen of the home of one young man traumatised by the ordeal he had to endure, which was a 45 minute assault. It is appalling that the Minister of State's response is that it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to decide where policing resources are allocated. I suggest that greater emphasis needs to be put on policing in the north Dublin area, with less obsession on the reopening of Stepaside Garda station.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I genuinely want to ask the Leader for a debate with anybody in government who can justify the new confidence and supply agreement. It reminds me of when a mother used to come home having left her child to tidy up the house. Nothing would have been cleaned up and she would ask, "What have you been doing for the last number of hours?" We have had high level negotiations between two crack teams from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil for six weeks-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Two crack teams. Two teams of the highest calibre.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The best negotiators they could find, three from each side, in secret negotiations over a period of months-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	They came out with not even a sheet of paper between them.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The frustrating thing, as the Leader will agree, is that this country faces a huge number of challenges - Brexit, homelessness, housing and the health crisis, which have all been mentioned today.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is it not unbelievable that the two main parties in the Oireachtas could have six weeks of negotiations and not come up with a single sheet of paper with a single word written on it? If they had a single sheet of paper with the word "homelessness" written on it, at least we could have an argument over and back as to the importance of that word or what they are going to do about it. However, they literally came up with nothing. We are being governed on the basis of nothing. We had an agreement that went up to the budget last year. Water was the most important issue two and a half years ago and it took up the vast bulk of that agreement. Now, we have a crisis of homelessness and, after six weeks of negotiations, not even a sheet of paper emerges. It is unbelievable. Somebody from the Government should come in here to account for it. On a more positive note, I would like to debate in this House the nature of female participation in sport by girls and women. Anybody who observed the RTÉ sports awards at the weekend will see that massive advances are being made in female participation in sport, which is to be remarked upon and encouraged. There is a campaign, 20x20, which is seeking a 20% increase in funding, a 20% increase in participation and a 20% increase in coverage of women's sport by 2020. It would be a good idea to have the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in the House to discuss the issue and the 20x20 campaign and to see what politics can do to help that agenda for female participation in sport by girls and women.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is that what the Senator was shouting at me?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Was he shouting that at me earlier? I could not really make out what he was saying.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
