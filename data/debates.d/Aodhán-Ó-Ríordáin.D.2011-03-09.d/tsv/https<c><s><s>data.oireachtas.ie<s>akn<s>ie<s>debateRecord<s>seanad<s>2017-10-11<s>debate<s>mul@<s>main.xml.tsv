AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for Education and Skills for taking the time to be here in person. In another circumstance, I would picture the many crushing disappointments of yesterday's budget announcement but I will save that for another time and just speak about one issue involving Gaeltacht courses that primary teachers in training are expected to attend. I raise the issue because of a letter Deputy Jan O'Sullivan received from a constituent and passed on to me. I will give the Minister a flavour of what the student, whom I will not name, was saying. The student mentioned the cost of mandatory Gaeltacht courses incurred by primary school teachers and said that they sought Deputy O'Sullivan's support for a reinstatement of Government support for these courses in budget 2018. The student wrote that since 2012, due to cutbacks, students have had to pay for attending two courses in the Gaeltacht, each of two weeks' duration. The student wrote that although she believed it was necessary for students to attend these courses, the cost is around €1,400 per student, which she believed was too much for students to bear. She wrote that this does not include transport costs and living expenses. The student also makes the case that while they are two weeks away from home, teachers are missing out on the part-time job income they get during that time. She wrote that up until 2012, the cost of these courses was subsidised by the Government and that for an average student to save for one Gaeltacht placement now, they must work two eight-hour shifts every weekend for ten weeks and save all earnings.As a result they have no money left to pay for living expenses each week. The student asked that the matter be brought to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, and requested that in budget 2018 he reinstate the subsidies for these courses, which would help to alleviate the burden of these expenses on students.  The Minister will probably elaborate on what has been done in budget 2018 to deal with this issue; however, I wish to make a further point. I think the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, also called in its pre-budget submission for a restoration of the grants for student teachers attending mandatory Gaeltacht courses. Nobody is suggesting the courses should be stopped in any way as they are very important for student teachers in brushing up on their Irish language competence. I was involved with the Marino Institute of Education in setting up a local initiative where students attending second level DEIS schools with an interest in becoming primary schoolteachers did grinds and received tuition after school in order to attain the standard required. I would be worried if disadvantaged students involved in teacher training had to fork out a significant amount of money at their own expense to go to the Gaeltacht. Now that we are in a better position in terms of the economic projections and that we have more money at our disposal, what the individual student and the USI are calling for is an opportunity to go back to where we were in 2012 for students attending Gaeltacht courses which I attended as a trainee primary schoolteacher and for the courses to be subsidised. If that has not happened in the budget, rather than turning it into a party-political point-scoring exercise, will the Minister examine the issue and restore the support in the coming year?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I find the Minister's reply disappointing. The announcement made by him yesterday was that the overall budget for the Department of Education and Skills was in the region of €9 billion. It would cost €1 million to resolve the issue I have outlined. We all know the background to it and I fully accept that we were in an economic crisis. We have all heard that 1,000 times, but we have also heard that the recovery is happening, that things are better now, that we have more money and that there are chances to repair the cutbacks and reductions that took place in recent years. That would be a reasonable expectation on the part of those in society who have endured huge pain. It appears that yesterday's budgetary announcement did not really do a huge amount for those studying at third level or training in various colleges. This is one such measure which would cost €1 million out of the €9 billion at the Minister's disposal. While I appreciate that he is not in a position to change the decisions made yesterday, I urge him to give some indication that he has a vision for the future - to paraphrase him - in rowing back on the difficult decisions made and that we can look forward to this type of measure being somewhere near the top of his priority list when trying to reverse the cutbacks introduced in the past.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I wish to raise two issues. First, I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to discuss education. I am a little perturbed by yesterday's budget in terms of what it does for education. It is quite clear that many of the opportunities that were open to the Government were not taken. Clearly, the Minister has shown in the recent past that he has no interest in equality when it comes to teachers' pay. He also has no interest in free education, which is quite clear from the budget announcements that were made yesterday. There has been no effort to reduce the cost of going to school, no interest in raising the capitation that schools receive and no interest in alleviating the cost of going to college for students. I would appreciate an opportunity to have a conversation with the Minister on these matters. It is quite depressing that the new communications unit will receive €5 million. That amount of money would have done a huge amount to pay for schoolbook rental schemes in primary schools in this country. Second, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to debate the status of a Government document launched four years ago, entitled the Right to Read campaign. The campaign focuses on literacy and achieving literacy excellence in every local authority in the State. The document acknowledges the fact the library system, the housing stock and the environment in which children are raised have a huge influence over educational attainment. The document is called the Right to Read campaign because the State has acknowledged that every child has a right to read. I raise this matter because there is the possibility that a library in Donaghmede in my constituency will close in June 2019. I understand that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government pays for half of the rental cost for the library currently and that when the lease ends such funding will no longer be available. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to come to the House to discuss the status of this Government document that was launched in 2014. I want to know whether he still believes in the Right to Read campaign, if the State is still willing to fund local libraries and if he will ensure that the library in Donaghmede will not close due to a lack of funding from central government.
