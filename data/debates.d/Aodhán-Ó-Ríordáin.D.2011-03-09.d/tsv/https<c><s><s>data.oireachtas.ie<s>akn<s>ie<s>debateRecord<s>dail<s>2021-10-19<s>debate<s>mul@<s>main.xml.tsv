AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Labour Party has tabled a priority question on the decriminalisation of drug users for answer on Thursday. The Department of Justice has told us it is a matter for the Department of Health and, as a result, this priority question will not be answered by the Minister for Justice. The reason our courts are full of people with drug addictions is that this is a justice issue. It is dealt with by the Department of Justice and falls under the legislation that the Minister for Justice oversees. If we are to have this conversation about the decriminalisation of drug users, I have to ask the Minister for Justice about it. My priority question on Thursday has been disallowed and I have been told it will be put in front of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, in two weeks’ time. I ask the Ceann Comhairle's office to intervene-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----because Members of this House and those we are trying to represent are not well served by Departments and Ministers who are ducking issues that affect very vulnerable people.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Taoiseach.
