AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I want to discuss the proposal to move the Members of the Seanad to the National Museum of Ireland. I have been contacted by people who work in the museum who referred to the lack of communication on the future plans for this Chamber. They are aggrieved that requests for finance in previous years in order to upgrade the facilities in the National Museum of Ireland were put to one side. They believe the cultural heritage and arts communities have been affected disproportionately by the downturn in the economy and the decisions made by various Governments. Now they are aggrieved that investment in the museum is being made to benefit the Houses of the Oireachtas, not the museum.There is a great deal of misinformation on whether this House will decamp to the National Museum of Ireland for one year, two years or three years and on what curtailment there will inevitably be of the exhibitions that can be held and outreach programmes undertaken by the museum. If this House is to move, as proposed, the communication lines need to be better. Perhaps the Leader might ask the Minister with responsibility for this area, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to come to the House for a debate on the issue which I am sure is of interest to most Senators. We do not want to be encroaching on another part of the wider campus, uninvited and unwelcome, without ensuring the transition is as smooth as possible and will not overly inhibit the facilities already in place. There is a wider discussion to be had about the stature of the arts, culture and heritage. This would be an opportune time for the Leader to invite the Minister to the Seanad for a debate on the future plans for sittings of this House.
