AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On the floor of this House last week, I raised the issue of religious orders selling off to private developers lands forming part of school properties, with boards of management in certain parts of this city being abolished as a result. The Cathaoirleach facilitated a debate during Commencement matters between the Minister and me to discuss the issue in some depth. I would like to put a letter I have received from a developer on the record of the House. It is quite disturbing. Developers in this country used to own people in the Oireachtas and councillors up and down this land. They used to stuff envelopes full of cash. They now send what I would consider to be threatening letters to people who want to defend the rights of communities to engage in the planning process, and to object or give observations on planning applications. I will read one paragraph, if I might. It states:I am prompted to write to you following remarks you made in Seanad Éireann on January 30th in relation to our proposal to deliver 536 housing units on lands at St Paul's School, Raheny.You stated that our proposed development would "destroy St. Anne's Park" and would result in a loss of playing pitches and community facilities. Your remarks are fundamentally inaccurate and are the latest example of a catalogue of misinformation being dispersed through various mediums and by various people about our development. As you may appreciate, if such inaccurate and flawed information is not corrected in the same public manner in which it was transmitted, it is likely to have a negative impact on our development, which, in turn, will have ramifications for those responsible.I would like the Leader of the House to restate in the strongest terms the following: that Members of this Oireachtas are not to receive threatening letters from developers; that those days are gone; that no-one in this House is beholden to a developer any more; that in a republic, one is quite entitled to stand up for one's local community; and that for any developer to send any Member of the Oireachtas, councillor or public representative a letter threatening "ramifications" is bang out of order. 
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Here we go again with all of these rural people.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the comprehensive nature of the Minister's speech. This is a lengthy Bill. It will take some time to digest the Bill and the Minister's speech. I was quite impressed by the Minister's stamina and ability to get through it in the manner in which he did. This is a terrifying area, which the Minister and his officials appreciate. No matter how we try to legislate for this area, the fear is that in five years' time whatever we have on the Statute Book will be out of date. Those who are engaged in this sphere in a malevolent and dangerous way are trying to work their way around national and European legislation and will spend whatever money they can to stay ahead of the game.The danger is not only that privacy rights, which are central to what we are trying to achieve, will be lost but also that the protection of children will be undermined. We are in a dangerous area and I expect the legislation will touch on everything we do from here onwards in all spheres, whether transport, education, health, foreign affairs or another area. When I was the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs, we found that regardless of what we sought to do on the drugs issue, fashions and the ability to manipulate things changed, which meant we struggled to keep ahead of the game. I appreciate what the Minister is trying to achieve and the Labour Party will not be obstructive in seeking to achieve our aims. We will introduce amendments to strengthen and improve the Bill. We appreciate that the Minister is doing his best to do the right thing.  The issues as they relate to children frighten all of us. While most people will have questions about setting the age of consent at 13 years, from listening to media reports and the Minister's comments on the offices and bona fides of those who arrived at this age threshold, I believe it is difficult to argue with their rationale. We will also focus on this area. On the political aspects of the issue, if we were honest about the way we use data, we could have a highly illuminating conversation. Reference was made to the marked register, which is data that all politicians who have their heads screwed on use to their benefit. The register shows who has voted and in which election or referendum they voted. When we visit a house we then know that X, Y or Z person registered at the address voted in the previous election or referendum. The data and knowledge available to people in authority and those with influence must be regulated. We need to be comfortable with this and people need to know that this information is readily available. However, we are in the middle of a digital age which will only gather pace. It will be a serious challenge for parliamentarians and legislators to keep up with it. The Labour Party will do its best to be of assistance with the legislation. I genuinely appreciate the efforts the Minister and his officials are making. In the years ahead, it will be necessary to amend the legislation many times to make it more relevant. Éamon De Valera once spoke of being terrified by the advent of television. I am genuinely terrified by technology, even though I use it every day and it offers the potential to make much money. However, children can also be damaged, hurt, humiliated and worse because of the age in which we live. I know the Minister appreciates that. With the support of Senators from across the House, we will get the best possible legislation for the citizens of this country.
