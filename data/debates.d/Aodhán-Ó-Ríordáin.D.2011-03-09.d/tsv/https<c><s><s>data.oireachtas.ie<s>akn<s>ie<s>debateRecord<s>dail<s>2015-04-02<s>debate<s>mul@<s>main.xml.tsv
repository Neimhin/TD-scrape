AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	The Government is firmly committed to combatting and challenging any and all manifestations of racism. Ireland was one of the first states in the world to develop a national action plan against racism. When the National Action Plan against Racism 2005-2008 was launched, it was conceived as a four-year programme to run until the end of 2008. It was designed to provide strategic direction towards developing a more intercultural and inclusive society in Ireland, and was integration-driven. Under the plan, support was provided towards the development of a number of national and local strategies, including greater integration in key role model profession workplaces such as An Garda Síochána, the health service, the education system, the arts and sports sectors and within our local authorities.  The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration in my Department is the focal point for the Government's commitment on anti-racism as a key aspect of integration, diversity management and broader national social policy. The office continues to work with all the relevant sectors to further progress the integration and diversity management agenda. Many of the initiatives which were instigated through the National Action Plan against Racism 2005-2008 continue to be developed and progressed through the support and work of the office. A review of our approach to the integration of migrants was launched last year. This review will provide the basis for a new and updated migrant integration strategy. Work on the integration strategy is ongoing and a draft will be sent to key stakeholders for their observations before the summer with a view to publication as soon as possible thereafter. I expect that the integration strategy, when developed, will include a strong anti-racism component.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from. Last night in the Seanad I said that we should be reasonably satisfied, without being complacent in any way, that the political system and political debate in this country have not been strangled by the issue of immigration. If one looks at what is happening in the UK and across Europe at the moment, one can see that xenophobic tendencies are getting into the mainstream and immigration is at the heart of political debate in election campaigns. We have to tackle the issue of racism, but the issue of integration is, to my mind, closely associated with it. We have asked sports clubs to have anti-racism strategies when applying for sports capital grants. That is not enough any more. Sports clubs, and all those in society, need to find strategies to positively interact and reach out, and they need to have integration strategies. Having reactions to particular negative incidents is fine and well and important. However, it is much more challenging for Irish society or aspects of Irish society to reach out. That is why having people of different ethnic backgrounds in key role model professions is also very important.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the Deputy's comments. Work is ongoing in respect of Traveller ethnicity, direct provision, integration and interaction. Yesterday there was positive interaction with the Deputy's committee.One of the points I am quite keen to pursue under the integration strategy relates to young people. Obviously, a number of young people are between two identities at the moment. They might have come here as migrants or might be the children of migrants. They are now trying to come to terms with being between two identities. I am keen to use that as a positive factor in society in order that people are comfortable with being Irish-Nigerian, Irish-Polish or Irish-Moldovan. We need to ensure we do not make the mistakes made by other countries 50 years ago when they had their first influx of migrants. For example, we can galvanise what is best about the identities of young people who often feel alienated from the mainstream of society and move forward from there. If we make mistakes now, we will reap a whirlwind of discontent for years to come. The needs of the education sector are at the heart of the integration strategy. The challenges faced by young people are of key importance in that context.
