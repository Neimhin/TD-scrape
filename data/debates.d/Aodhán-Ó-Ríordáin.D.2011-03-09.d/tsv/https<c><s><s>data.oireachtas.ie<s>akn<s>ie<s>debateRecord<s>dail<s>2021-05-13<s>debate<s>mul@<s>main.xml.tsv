AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is very welcome. I thank her for producing legislation to underpin this process. It is timely and important. We worked together to waive the necessity for pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, which was a good sign that we would work on this together. Respectfully I have to disagree with my Sinn Féin colleague on the issue of canvassing. The Labour Party is quite comfortable with these elements of the Bill. The message must be sent out to the entire education community that one cannot talk to a teacher about a particular student's accredited grade for the leaving certificate. That is just a no-go area on every level. If one does this, one may potentially impact negatively on a young person's future. That is strong message which should not be diluted. We know that people will find loopholes and mechanisms to-----

AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This is quite unusual.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is quite unusual for a contribution to be interrupted in that manner but, obviously, ordinary rules do not apply in certain circumstances. I hope my time can be replenished. My point is that, regardless of the very unusual circumstances, we have to send out a message that strictly no canvassing can take place on any level whether the student is aware of such canvassing. If we dilute this element of the Bill or dilute the sanction, people will find loopholes, as they always do in Irish society. We have seen that time and time again. While this measure is strict and tough, and potentially very difficult for students, this Bill must be clear that absolutely no canvassing on any level will be tolerated. We should proceed on that basis. It is a very important message, albeit a difficult one for young people to have to consider. There needs to be a sacred space for teachers to do their work without interference from anybody, whether this interference is known to the student or otherwise. The Minister made reference to school profiling, which is not part of this Bill or the accredited grades system. That is to be welcomed. I reiterate that it was the Minister who took out the school profiling last year following a campaign. She listened to people who had difficulties with it and she is to be commended on that. Again, as has already been stated, it was the advocacy and the campaigning zeal of young people and their ability to stay around the table with the Minister and her officials that got us to this point, at which young people have a choice. If young people are ever wondering about their power or potential to affect change, they should look at what happened throughout this entire process. It is there that the fruits of this power or potential can be seen. While we are supporting the Bill, I feel we have not yet learned the lessons of the 2020 leaving certificate. We are still awaiting an independent review of what happened last year. If that review had been completed, many of those lessons could have been learned and it would have impacted on the Bill. That is a shame. We certainly want to work with the Minister in the future to try to find a form of leaving certificate that adequately reflects the capabilities and potential of all students. Many people are particularly critical of the leaving certificate. While it is transparent and while people have a great level of faith in it and believe that it is fair, to a degree, there is also a sense that the leaving certificate makes one good at doing the leaving certificate rather than allowing young people to maximise their potential. There is a sense that many young people are losing out on their chances in life because they have to jump over the hurdle of the leaving certificate in the first instance. In general, the Labour Party is supportive of the Bill. We do not take lightly the canvassing element within the Bill. We feel that, while it is a tough measure, it is necessary. I can understand where the Minister is coming from with it and I will support her on it. We feel strongly about the review of last year's leaving certificate. I made points about the school profiling.  I know that the Minister agrees with me on my last point and that the Tánaiste has made similar points. It is an important point to make in respect of the pandemic and what we have gone through over the last year. This year has done damage to young people and it has left scars. A year of their school lives has been stolen, along with the socialisation and interaction they would have had. Teachers and special needs assistants were working all the while but remote working can never replace the school experience. While the Minister has made an announcement about summer programmes which may hope to repair some of that damage, the last year cannot be replaced or repaired over the course of a summer. We strongly suggest that we have potentially lost a generation of young people because, as we constantly say, people over 16 years of age are not required to be in school and many young people were lost to the system. Young people who are due to sit the leaving certificate next year are clinging on by their fingertips.School teachers and principals are trying hard to keep young people engaged in school and school learning. It has been challenging. In order to ensure that we do not lose a third generation, as it were, or year or cohort of young people to disengagement and choices that they may regret in later life, we must invest properly in a catch-up fund for young people akin to what has been done in the UK. Its fund is £1 billion. While its population is obviously larger than ours, something comparable would be of benefit in Ireland. Instead of trying to tackle the issue over the course of the summer, a fund would allow us to consider class sizes and investigate the damage that has been done and how we can repair the scarring, trauma and heightened anxiety of the past year. I do not just mean academic work, but other issues as well. This would be important. As the Minister knows, if there was a proposal for a road costing €150 million, any number of Government and Opposition Deputies would be jumping up and down saying that we could not but spend that €150 million on the road. When it comes to young people and children, however, the suggestion that €150 million would go a long way towards repairing the damage caused by a pandemic, people would scratch their heads and chins and say that that would be expensive and it could surely be spent on something else. This is the one chance that these young people will get, though. Unfortunately, they will have to tell their children and grandchildren for the rest of their lives how, when they were in school, there was a pandemic, as a result of which they lost out on in-class teaching. We will have a chance next year to try to repair that damage. The one mechanism we can use to do that is to invest in the expertise of our teachers and special needs assistants and listen to what they and school communities have to say. Repairing the damage may not be possible. For example, it may not be possible for infants to recover what they have lost. It will take a long time, but we have to try at least. We support the Bill, accept what the Minister is saying about canvassing and understand the necessity for a legislative underpinning of what she is doing. We have worked with her so as to forgo pre-legislative scrutiny, even though that is not something that should happen too often. We are still waiting on the review of what happened in 2020. Let us learn the lessons of 2020 and 2021 and ensure that if students of the leaving certificate class of 2022 are going to be in class all the time, which is our hope, proper resources are made available not just for them, but for every school group, school year, class group and class year at primary and secondary levels so that the scarring and difficulties they have experienced are recognised by the State and, at the very least, we can cling on to some of the young people who have been disconnected and discommoded and who are wondering whether they will return in September. That is a choice that young people are making right now. If there are 17-year-olds who are considering not going back to school in September, it poses a difficulty that they may regret for the rest of their lives. This is the one chance we have and we should grasp it collectively. On that basis, we support the legislation.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I apologise for my late arrival. I appreciate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has facilitated my speaking slot. Deputy Richmond decided to walk to the convention centre rather get a lift with me, which would probably be illegal anyway, so he was here before me. This Bill is welcomed by the Labour Party. We can all appreciate the burden carried by the events industry and the workers in it, particularly those involved in music, arts, cultural festivals and large sporting events over the last 14 months. If we are lucky and reach a high vaccination rate, I hope we will see a return to being able to go to gigs, matches, shows and theatres, which we have missed so much, as soon as we possibly can. The human need to get together in celebration of life itself through events of all shapes and sizes, whether these are sport, music, art, performance or festivals, has never been more apparent. We miss it and its value has never been more keenly felt.  In that context, this Bill is as important as ever. The Bill looks to address the blatant exploitation by ticket touts, middle men and online scalpers of the huge demand for sporting, artistic and cultural events to drive huge profits into their own pockets well beyond any work they have done to earn the money.It is a classic example of where unfettered market rules disadvantage ordinary people, act as a drain on society and need to be curtailed for the common good. The pre-Internet days were bad enough for ordinary fans who could not get tickets, often being priced out of the chance of getting a second-hand ticket by the huge mark-ups charged by professional touts. Anyone who goes regularly to gigs or matches will know the feeling of being left with a spare ticket or multiple spare tickets due to the last minute backing out of a friend or group of friends from an event. You used to have to go to the ground and hope you could tell the difference between a genuine fan looking to see a match and a scalper looking to make a margin. It was a badge of honour for ordinary fans not to sell to ticket touts but with the advent of online selling, more and more people have been sucked into the idea that buying tickets for a big event is an opportunity to make a few quid. A larger and larger proportion of tickets seem to end up being bought at a price far higher than face value. Online ticket bots and sites have become an ever larger problem with orchestrated attempts to corner whole events and then drip feed the tickets out to genuine fans, to try to extract the last penny of cash far above the face value of the ticket. This is unbridled capitalism in its most naked expression and I welcome the Bill from the Government. It follows on from Bills from former Deputy Noel Rock and the now Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and from Deputy Quinlivan, all of whom should be congratulated for ensuring the issue became highlighted and is now being addressed. The other industry where we have an orchestrated drip feed of supply into a market of unsustainable prices by profit-driven monopolists is the property market. Some of the principles of fairness and capping sales prices at a sustainable level might be applied to try to solve the ongoing housing crisis in the country and to allow the property market to become one where builders are incentivised to create and build affordable homes for people and families, rather than one where speculators drive and create shortages and bubbles to exploit for maximum gain. On the detail of the Bill, I note the Department said it had been intended to tackle the use of bot software to purchase tickets but that it now plans to implement that as part of a Bill to implement EU Directive No. 2019/2161 on the better enforcement and modernisation of Union consumer protection rules, to be submitted to Government early next year. The delay concerns me as the bot issue should be addressed urgently and to pass a Bill without bot provision could conceivably leave us longer than necessary without appropriate protection. Within the Bill there are specific provisions for Euro 2020. Given that we are no longer hosting matches, do we need such specific provision in the legislation in the pandemic? The Bill also includes for secondary ticket markets the defence that they were providing an online service for others to comply with Directive No. 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce in the Internal Market. The concern I have is that the defence could be exploited to allow the profit of secondary platforms from this now illegal activity, based on them only supplying an information service to the people committing the crime. While it would be difficult to prevent private conversations through online and social media platforms like email, Facebook, Instagram or other services, platforms and actors could build a business model explicitly on the sale of tickets while turning a blind eye to lawbreaking and over-face-value sales and would be able to use section 26 as a defence to render the Bill ineffective and flout the law.  Many of the other provisions of the Bill seemed straightforward mechanisms for application for registration of venues and events. These designations seem reasonable, as do the provisions for arrest and the penalties. I look forward to a constructive debate and may submit amendments as needed.
