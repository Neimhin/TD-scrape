AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I do not know what to say after the previous contribution. I seem to remember the very same voice in this Chamber on the day after the American presidential election saying we needed to get used to the new world order and that the era of political correctness was over. A congratulatory message was sent from the same individual to the newly elected President. I am delighted we have had such a Pauline conversion to the realities of the new regime in America. That is not the reason I am contributing. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, on her achievement yesterday in getting the medically supervised injection centre proposal through the Cabinet.This incredibly important legislation being shepherded by the Minister of State ill save lives. Often in the Chamber we debate health and public policy issues, but, as this legislation comes to the House, I appeal to all parties that I know support the legislation to do so robustly and without fear because the issue of street heroin injection means we are dealing with the most vulnerable of citizens. I was involved in the formulation of the legislation in the previous Government and I am delighted to see the Government has taken it on. It is in the programme for Government and being delivered. It is not the role of people in opposition to pick holes in Government policy all the time. We will oppose when necessary, but we will also support when necessary. The Minister of State is to be congratulated. It is a proud day for her and the Oireachtas that our drug policy is becoming much more enlightened. She is doing an excellent job in that regard. I hope to stand in the Chamber and see the legislation go through the House in the coming weeks.
