AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I raise the issue of the potential establishment of a transport police.  The Leader will be aware of a number of unsavoury incidents on the north side DART line.  A recent stabbing incident happened between Killester and Harmonstown stations.  Earlier this year a DART service was stalled while a gang of youths tried to spray-paint the outside of the carriage between Bayside and Howth Junction stations.  There are ongoing vandalism and other issues at Clongriffin station.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has said he is open to the idea of having a transport police.  I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on the potential of establishing such a force from within An Garda Síochána to ensure that those who work on, and use, our train services feel safe and secure as they go about their daily business.  Those who believe in public transport, as I do, need to feel safe and secure while accessing that service.  This House should react positively to the initiatives taken by Councillor Rebecca Moynihan on Dublin City Council and Councillor Deirdre Kingston on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  They have secured funding to roll out pilot schemes to provide free sanitary products in their council areas.  An initiative by Councillor Moynihan on Dublin City Council was successful a number of months ago.  At last night's Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council budget meeting, Councillor Kingston secured funding for a pilot scheme to provide free sanitary products in libraries.  A Plan International Ireland survey has found that more than 50% of girls aged from 12 to 19 are unable to afford sanitary products.  We could tackle period poverty if we were to provide free products in our primary and secondary schools.  It is not a radical proposal; it has been done in Scotland.  We believe it would cost about €5 million.  It would be useful to have a debate on period poverty in the House and I call on the Leader to facilitate that.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I join with others in congratulating the Social Democrats on bringing forward this Bill. As Senator Ruane has said, the provision in the Bill is for unpaid leave because introducing paid parental leave would create a cost on the Exchequer. I also congratulate the Fianna Fáil group on taking on the mantle and bringing it to the House during its Private Members' time. It is a little disquieting that some of the Government representatives in this House speak to the concerns of the employers first and foremost
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The reality from my perspective if I am to get a grip is that the balance of conversation in this House never seems to go to the worker. It is the stress and strain on workers and the young parent who is at work which is the motivation behind this Bill. I understand that the employer has to make money but a worker is trying to raise a family. Acting Chairman, there is a conversation happening to my left.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The point I am trying to make is that the balance of conversation on this issue is always lopsided in favour of the employer. Scandinavian democracies such as Sweden, Iceland and Finland place a great emphasis on gender equality. I believe Iceland makes an entire year of parental leave available to parents. The aim of this is to ensure becoming a parent does not automatically lead to many stressful conversations among couples about who will take time off, or whether they can afford to have the child. If we fully believe that bringing a child into the world is one of the most wonderful experiences a family can have, such conversations would not happen. This type of legislation should be welcomed by employers on the basis that an employee who is happy at home and feels that he or she is making a contribution to family life will be happy in the workplace as well. This approach works. Many employers' organisations have finally embraced the idea of gender equality in workplaces. Workers work best in that environment. Employers are ensuring they have LGBT-friendly workplaces because they know LGBT workers work better in that kind of environment. It is clear to those with a cold and calculated capitalist mindset that workers are more productive if they are happier. Employers should embrace the idea that when their younger employees become parents, the worry and stress associated with trying to balance work and life will probably make them less productive in the workplace. When one becomes a parent, it should not be a time of stress about money or one's work-life balance. One should be supported by the State in any way it can. In Iceland, paid parental leave can be shared between both parents, both partners or whoever is at home over the course of a year. We should have this type of vision for the first year of a child's life. Both parents - or whichever one of them is in a position to raise the child - should not be burdened by this kind of worry or stress. It is inevitable that the mentality of the child is affected by what is going on. All the research that has been conducted around the world proves that being in a stressed environment affects a child's mindset from a young age. We should be mindful of the ability of children to feel the anxiety of others. I welcome this legislation. It is great to have this conversation. It is to be welcomed that the debate in this House has been facilitated by the Social Democrats and Fianna Fáil. When I held the position currently held by the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, I worked hard to secure two weeks of paid paternity leave. It was a good move. A wider vision is needed. I reiterate that there needs to be a focus on what is good for workers and families. Employers should embrace that conversation and be part of it. They need to realise that happy people are happier and more productive workers.
