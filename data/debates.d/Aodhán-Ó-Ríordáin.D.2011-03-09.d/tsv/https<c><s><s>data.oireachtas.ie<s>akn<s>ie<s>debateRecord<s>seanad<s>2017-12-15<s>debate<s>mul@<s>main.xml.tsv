AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Sometimes in Irish politics one can become very cynical and wonder if anything ever gets achieved. Today, there is magic in the air because of the campaigning zeal of the Irish Deaf Society, which pursued the issue of sign language for a long time. As I said to a group of secondary school students yesterday, if one believes in something, and believes that it is just and right and are willing to pursue it, one will always win. It helps when one gets a decent politician on one's side. That decent politician is Senator Mark Daly. I think he is to be commended by everybody across the House on his zeal in pursuing this issue. At a time when the Department of Justice and Equality is receiving much criticism, and many feel justifiably so, I recognise the work of Deaglán Ó Briain, a person with whom I worked, who is a committed and extremely professional civil servant and I think his fingerprints are clearly to be seen in the Bill. It would be appropriate for all Irish schoolchildren to be in a position to learn Irish Sign Language in order to communicate with fellow citizens. Surely that would be the next step in this regard. I congratulate the campaigners, Senator Mark Daly, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and his officials. Today, I think all Members feel that little bit of magic that politics can sometimes bring.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This morning, we saw the best of Irish politics in the passing of the Recognition of Irish Sign Language for the Deaf Community Bill 2016. In this issue, we see the worst of Irish politics. Everybody knows the damage alcohol and addiction cause in this country. I was moved by the contribution of Senator Black. She has exposed the influence that special interests and lobbyists have had on the Houses of the Oireachtas concerning this legislation, which is why we are debating these amendments. Two people die each week as a result of fatal overdoses of alcohol. These are not people who fall in front of vehicles or down stairs. They drink so much that they die. Approximately 100 die in this way every year. It is remarkable that whenever legislation relating to drink-driving or public health alcohol measures comes before the House, the political system still cannot step up to the mark and deliver it in an unamended form that will actually help to save lives. There always seems to be a way for people to wriggle out of the attempt at legislating. In a huge number of other areas of public policy that affect peoples lives, this does not happen. Remarkably, the Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Bill 2017, which will also save lives, went through the Oireachtas without amendment. When it comes to alcohol, we all say the right things. We say that alcohol is bad and that young people do not know what they are doing. By the way, I must respond to that. To suggest that young people are the only individuals in the country who drink to excess is to completely miss the point. Young people have learned their behaviour from their parents, who, in turn, learned their behaviour from their own parents. The country in which we live has a completely dysfunctional relationship with alcohol. However, whenever legislation is introduced, we find ways around doing the right thing. I will say this much. I was so proud to be a member of the Oireachtas today because of the efforts of Senator Mark Daly, along with the Irish Deaf Society, in bringing forward legislation that we all applauded. This afternoon, however, I am ashamed to be a member of this Oireachtas because-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I remind colleagues that if they took this issue as it deserves to be taken, they would not just agree with every single word of what Senator Black has said, they would do exactly what she is advocating that we do. There always seems to be a way around doing the right thing when it comes to alcohol in this country. We have made progress, but it is not in any way the progress that we should be making.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	How many Fine Gael Senators were present on Wednesday night?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There was one. All the Fine Gael Senators are lining up in the Chamber to talk about the impact of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill on shopkeepers. There was only one Fine Gael Senator present when we were discussing the motion on special needs assistants. Such hypocrisy. I did not have a clue what she was discussing.
