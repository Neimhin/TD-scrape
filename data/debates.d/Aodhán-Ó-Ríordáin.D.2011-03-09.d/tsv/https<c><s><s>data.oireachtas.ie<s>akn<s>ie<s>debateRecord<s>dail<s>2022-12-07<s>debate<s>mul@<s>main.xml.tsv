AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The members of the Government have surpassed themselves today. I was speaking to somebody in the education sphere last week. Our conversation turned to teacher shortages and the person said to me that whatever those in government come up with, we can be sure their plan will put the blame on teachers. Sure enough, as if by magic, just as they are scrambling around to try to find answers to come up with some sort of a response to the excellent motion tabled by my colleague, Deputy Gary Gannon, and the Social Democrats, they have done it again. It reminds me of the time during the pandemic when the schools were closed because that was the medical advice, and there was controversy over how we could reopen schools. Despite the fact that the Government was not listening to school leaders, was not prioritising air filtration systems in schools, was not investing in schools and was not providing support for teachers, at the end of the day, when it came down to it, what the Government wanted the parents’ conversations at dinner tables and on WhatsApp groups to be about was that this was not really about Government inaction or about failures of Government, and was not even about the virus, it was about teachers. Then, when it came to the spectacular failure of the Government to find school places last September for children with additional needs, despite the fact it had to ram through emergency legislation at the end of June and it was about Government inaction in that space, what it also managed to do as a Government was to blame individual schools, and teachers and principals in those schools, with one Minister naming four schools. Again, what they were hoping would be said on the WhatsApp groups, at the school gates and at dinner tables was that it was not about Government inaction and it was about these teachers and principals, and, in fact, it was about those four individual schools that were named by that Minister. Again, it was the teachers' fault. Then, today, in spectacular fashion, when every teacher, principal and SNA we speak to refers to the housing crisis when it comes to the teacher supply problem, the Minister of State comes in and reads out a 15-page speech, one page of which is about housing. Then, the Government manages through leaks from Cabinet discussions to put the blame on those pesky teachers and their career breaks. Once again, the teacher supply problem is not about Government inaction or about housing, it is about teachers again. What the Government wants to have in all these debates about school reopening during Covid is that it is kind of the teachers’ fault; or regarding lack of places for children with additional needs, again, it is the teachers’ fault; and now, the fact we cannot get teachers is the teachers’ fault. It is unbelievable. I will tell the Minister of State, flatly and plainly, that the only reason the education system has not completely and utterly collapsed is because of the goodwill and the professionalism of the teachers that the Government seems determined to malign, along with SNAs and the wider school community. Let us talk plainly about what the problem is: it is a housing problem. I do not want to have a debate that pits rural against urban Ireland but let us be frank. The Government is allowing Dublin to die on its watch. We cannot get teachers, nurses or gardaí to live in the capital city and to serve it. Our schools are being bled of talent that could teach these children, and the children feel it and know it because it is they are in classrooms without a teacher, or with a substitute teacher, or else they have a succession of teachers. They know there is something wrong. By the way, oftentimes these teachers, if they happen to have a chance to teach, are teaching children who are also affected by the homelessness crisis and the housing crisis, living with their parents in their grandparents’ house. I know of a particular school, with which I have a personal relationship, where I was told the situation has completely changed over the past 12 years and that 24% of the children are now in homelessness. Yet, when the Government has a chance to respond to today's motion, what does it do? It wants those of us in opposition who are talking about teacher supply to have to talk about career breaks, not about housing. It is unbelievable that it has constructed a narrative today where we are talking about career breaks for teachers, not about housing. I feel that the city I love, the city I grew up in, the city I live in and the city I care about, is dying on this Government’s watch fundamentally because we cannot get nurses because they say they cannot live in Dublin. The Tánaiste seems to think that what gardaí need is a gun rather than a gaff. Teachers are being priced out of the city. We need to talk seriously about a Dublin allowance. It is going to get people in the Rural Independent Group very excited when a Deputy stands up and says that. That is fair enough. They have this in London. When they had a teacher shortage issue in London, they recognised that the cost of living issue in the city was serious and because they needed teachers to teach London kids, it was seen as that important, given the particular pressures in London. Let us talk seriously about it here in Dublin as well. Let us talk seriously about providing a standard of living for teachers in Dublin so it should not be an aspiration for someone to be a teacher and to live and work in Dublin. That should not be outside the capacity of a teacher. The State needs to recognise that and introduce a Dublin allowance. That is a much more constructive idea for the Government to toss around the place, rather than having an onslaught once again on teachers' pay and conditions. I swear to God that if any of those in government, whether in Cabinet or on the backbenches, spent five minutes in a school classroom, they would not be able to survive because of the number of skills and competencies they would need. They should back off from the teachers and their terms and conditions, and realise that what they are doing is overseeing a housing crisis that is pushing teachers out of Dublin and affecting the children of the city. It is not good enough and they need to sort it out.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The purpose of this instruction is to allow the Minister to extend the scope of the existing provisions of the Bill. An increasing trend of the Government is to bring forward new and substantial amendments to Bills going through the Houses unrelated to the original purpose of the proposed legislation. It is not good practice and it hinders our ability to scrutinise legislation. It was used extensively on the Electoral Reform Act earlier this year. This week we have also seen a similar approach to the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is ramming through a planning Bill this week and next. In effect, the Government and the permanent Civil Service are regularly using Standing Order 187 to undermine the legislative process and turn the House into a rubber stamp. According to the motion, the Minister will make a series of legislative changes related to the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, and Tusla. A further series of substantial amendments to the right to request remote work are not mentioned in the motion so while the Bill is recommitted for what we might term "a mini-Second Stage debate on specified grounds", it does not include the right to request remote work. By tabling these unscrutinised amendments on Report Stage, the Government has bypassed Second and Committee Stages, therefore, depriving Deputies of the opportunity to address in detail the impact of these proposals. It robs us of time to table substantial amendments to new proposals in this House, which are changed from the original draft law published in January. The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment has published its scrutiny of the original Right to Request Remote Work Bill 2021 in July. It is only now in December that a new Bill is in effect being parachuted into this one and it differs from the original proposals in many ways. Since the start of the year we have called for a right to flexible work for all workers. The Labour Party published its own legislation and tabled a motion in the House in our Private Members' time in March where we called for flexible work to be the default option rather than giving employers the right to refuse requests. Results of an Ireland Thinks poll commissioned by the Labour Party showed an overwhelming demand from workers for this right. Some 71% of people believe in the right to flexible work; instead we are getting a right to request it. To take one example, according to the Minister's amendment, someone still must be an employee for six months before they can request a remote working arrangement. It is a key recommendation of the committee that this be removed and that there should be an automatic right to request. Our motion which passed this House in spring called on the Government to ensure its legislative proposals provided that any reason for refusal of flexible work relied upon by an employer must be objectively justifiable, appropriate and proportion. The original Bill included 13 grounds for refusal but instead the Government is now replacing that with an elevating code of practice to be agreed later. Our understanding now is that the employer grounds for refusing flexible work will not be rooted in the primary legislation. We know the gains made by workers during the pandemic on flexible work are being eroded and employers are more frequently demanding that employees return to the office. Measure of this nature require substantially more debate and scrutiny. Watered-down rights for workers should not be slipped in through late Stage amendments. Only 60 minutes have been provided later on Report Stage for more than 20 pages of amendments and the Minister and the Government should not rush this through in such a manner. On Committee Stage, the Minister also said he hoped to introduce provisions to provide for maternity leave for Oireachtas Members. Will he indicate what his plans are for that now?
