AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I want to ask the Minister about the strategic housing development Act brought in by the previous Government and if he is conducting a review of that Act. I understand that Act and its provisions are to continue until mid-2022.It is controversial legislation. It overrides local authorities and their planning processes and has led to much upset and controversy in local communities. I want to get a sense from the Minister of the plan of the Government to renew the terms of the Act.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am glad to hear the Minister say that because he was quite vocal in his constituency on this matter. Fianna Fáil representatives in my constituency were very concerned about this legislation on the basis that it was not doing what it was designed to do because a number of planning cases ended up in the High Court and it was overriding the powers of the local authority. When something overrides a local authority, it overrides the democratically constituted development plan of the city. As people know, councillors have limited powers but one of the powers they do have is to put together a development plan, which includes zonings. If legislation can override that and people can go directly to An Bord Pleanála for developments comprising more than 100 units, this means that An Bord Pleanála does not have to be bound as rigidly by the zonings, which has led to a lot of controversy about certain lands which are zoned in a particular way. I know the Minister will appreciate that. I want him to reaffirm his commitment that he will not extend SHD legislation beyond the date he has indicated.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is crucially important for local democracy that people elect their local councillors and that those councillors oversee the development plan, the running of the city and zonings. The latter are there for particular reasons, namely, to protect open spaces and build communities which can thrive into the future and which people can live in and enjoy. Councillors and council planners are there to oversee a city, county or area that works. The legislation to which I refer is particularly destructive in that regard. I am glad the Minister has recognised that and that we can work together to ensure that it will not be renewed. We will hold the Minister to that commitment because we do not want him to change his mind six months or a year from now.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister set out his views on shared housing, which is another controversial scheme initiated by the previous Government? Is there a review of that scheme under way, particularly in light of the fact that Covid-19 means that such accommodation will be completely inappropriate into the future?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In many aspects of Irish life, Covid-19 has ripped off the plaster. If it has particularly exposed any one issue in Irish society, it has been in regard to housing and how people are living. If we ask people to stay at home as a national call, then we have to be mindful of how people live. If they are living in overcrowded accommodation, if three generations are living in the one house, if people do not have access to a back garden, then all of the things for which people have been criticised for campaigning on over the years are now seen to have been valid complaints. The Minister says that no co-living accommodation has been built and that may be true, but he must be aware that planning permissions have been granted for such accommodation. What is his and his Department's intention in regard to this reality?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We do not want to have death by review.What is the timescale for the completion of the review? All the while, planning applications are being submitted and permission is being granted, which leads to a bigger problem. If the review and Government action are swift, we will avoid the construction of a significant number of co-living accommodation units with which we would then have to contend. In light of the possibility of a second wave or having to deal with Covid for several years, it would be absolutely irresponsible to suggest that anybody should live in this way. It was a bad idea before Covid because it is not an ethical housing policy. There is no dignity attached to it. It makes money for some people but it is not the way we should be building communities. I think the Minister agrees with me in that regard. When will the review be completed? If the Government is serious about doing something on this issue, when will it act?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	For the information of the House, I tabled these questions in conjunction with Senator Moynihan, the Labour Party spokesperson on housing. I ask the Minister to provide details of the land transferred to the Land Development Agency, LDA, for the development of residential units; and the projects it is considering for development, including details of the partners involved, the number of expected units, the stage of the process and the target completion dates.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for his detailed reply. I appreciate that he will circulate the tabular information. I refer to the potential for different housing models. I made reference to this issue while speaking to the Sinn Féin motion on affordable housing. I acknowledge that the Minster spoke about affordable purchase previously. We previously discussed the idea of a rent-to-buy scheme and the Minister stated he would look into it. There is potential within the LDA model for that type of scheme to be pursued. We previously discussed the scheme that was abandoned ten years ago when the crash came but which had helped certain families. The current situation is that couples and individuals in Dublin and elsewhere cannot rent and save at the same time. If they are renting, that uses up all their disposable income and they cannot save for a deposit. Is there potential within the LDA model for a rent-to-buy scheme? I previously discussed the details of such a scheme. It could involve three years of rental, after which one would have a chance to put the rent paid towards a deposit, to keep renting or to leave the scheme. Is that type of model something the Minister could consider within the framework of his proposals?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Can we weave that sort of model into the LDA legislation or should it be provided for in stand-alone legislation that allows for various models to be pursued? It is a model that worked in the past. It will deal with a particular issue. As I previously mentioned, throughout the country there are several generations living in the same house. Part of the problem is the lost generation of people in their 20s or 30s who are living at home. They cannot afford to rent because they are saving to get onto the property ladder. Is it possible to be prescriptive within the LDA legislation in the context of dealing with this issue? Can the legislation provide for dealing with various housing schemes that we wish for the LDA to pursue or is it just going to be enabling legislation which will allow us latitude to pursue various housing models such as the rent-to-buy scheme about which we are so passionate?
