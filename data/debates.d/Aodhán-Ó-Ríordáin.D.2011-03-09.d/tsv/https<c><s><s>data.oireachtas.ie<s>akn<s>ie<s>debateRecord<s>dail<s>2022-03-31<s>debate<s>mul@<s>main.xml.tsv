AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister mentioned that he met the energy regulator last week. That is welcome. I encourage the Minister to meet representatives of the regulator - the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU - again to suggest the regulator does what is being done in the UK where demands have been made of energy suppliers to put every customer on the beneficial packages available to a new customer. The Labour Party introduced legislation in December 2020 to ensure no existing customer is left at a disadvantage because of new offers available for new customers. That is what is happening in the UK. Will the Minister meet the CRU again in the coming days and impress on it the necessity for every energy customer to be able to avail of those beneficial packages available to new customers? That is a simple request. It is an achievable win for the Government. We would support the Government in that regard.
