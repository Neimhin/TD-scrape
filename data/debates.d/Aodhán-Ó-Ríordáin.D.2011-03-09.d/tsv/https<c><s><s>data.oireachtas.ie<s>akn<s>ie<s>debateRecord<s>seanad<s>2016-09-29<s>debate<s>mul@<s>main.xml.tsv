AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Taoiseach. In fairness to the Leader, Senator Jerry Buttimer, it is incumbent on us in this House to work together to try to solve problems, a few of which I want to raise with the Taoiseach in my short contribution.  Senator Lynn Ruane and I work in the drugs area and want to have good engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne. Senators Colette Kelleher and Pádraig Mac Lochlainn and I who work on the Traveller ethnicity issue hope to receive good co-operation from the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton. However, I must ask the Taoiseach about the issue of direct provision and my contribution will be solely on that issue. In this House, when I was Minister of State, there was uniformity of opinion on the issue of direct provision. I see Senator Martin Conway who is one of the most vocal on it in front of me. We came to speak with one voice and the need for action on it. A report was commissioned. At the time the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and I worked very hard to commission that report and worked to implement it. It was said on national radio last week that of the 2,000 people in direct provision accommodation over five years, as a direct result of that report, 1,500 are no longer in it, which is a good day's work. However, the draft programme for Government that was released contained a commitment to implement the McMahon report, which took nine months to put together. It was compiled by NGOs and departmental officials and when it was signed off on, the assumption was that it would be implemented. To my horror and that of others, that sentence regarding the implementation of the McMahon report was dropped from the actual programme for Government. I, therefore, ask the Taoiseach, because of the nature of the vulnerability of the families and children living in direct provision accommodation, that we implement the report. We are not asking for a new report. We are not asking for action to be taken which has not been already cited. We are asking that the Taoiseach give a commitment to implement the report which was commissioned by the Department with officials from many Departments and NGOs in good faith and which has been published and was being implemented. The Minister of State was here and was not in a position to give at commitment that it would be implemented. The Minister for Justice and Equality is not in a position to say she will implement it. I would love if the Taoiseach could stand in this House and make such a commitment to the Members who collectively, in a cross-party manner - this is not a divisive issue in this House - are all committed to implementation of the report. The Taoiseach stood as a proud Irishman in the Dáil and spoke in a tearful way on the issue of the Magdalen women and was commended for doing so. I commended him - we all did - because it was an emotional day for everybody in the Oireachtas. However, I am fully convinced there will be a Taoiseach in 20 or 30 years' time who will have to make a similar apology on the issue of direct provision. It is within the Taoiseach's gift today to stand in front of us as a collective and say: "I, as Taoiseach, will oversee or ensure that the McMahon report will be implemented."
