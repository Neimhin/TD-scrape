AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I wish to raise the issue of policing and anti-social behaviour on the north side of Dublin. I am getting increasing exasperated with the failure to get any answers in this Chamber. I tabled a Commencement matter on anti-social behaviour issues, muggings and the escalation of violence in the Dublin 9 area and the Minister who replied to the matter told me that the Minister had no direct responsibility for the area and that it was an issue for the Garda Commissioner. I then raised in another debate the potential for the opening of a Garda station in the expanding Clongriffin-Balmayne area, which will have 50,000 residents in a number of years, and again I was told it was an issue for the Garda Commissioner. Now I have asked this week for a debate after a pipe bomb incident in Edenmore last Sunday, following a gun attack in a pizza parlour in Edenmore on New Year's eve, only to be told by the Leas-Chathaoirleach that I cannot have it because the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter. I am getting sick and tired of this kind of response. We all hear from a Minister in government in Stepaside who tells every resident that can hear him that it was his intervention that opened up a Garda station in that plush affluent suburb-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----against the express advice of an assistant Garda commissioner. Yet when we have had a pipe bomb incident and an attempted murder in a pizza parlour in Edenmore, I am told by the Leas-Chathaoirleach's office that the Garda Commissioner is the person responsible and the Minister for Justice and Equality has no responsibility for it.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am damn sure that if there was a pipe bomb in Laois or in south Dublin, the Minister would be all over it.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am sick and tired of getting answers-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----from the Minister for Justice and Equality stating that this is not his responsibility.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I do not make a northside-southside point very often but I am sick of being told-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----that the Garda Commissioner is the person who is responsible for resources, not the Minister for Justice and Equality. This letter is a disgrace. How am I supposed to go back-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----to the people we represent and say they are getting-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This letter that I got from you is a disgrace.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is an absolute disgrace-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I say once more that I am demanding-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I do not give a fiddler's; I want a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality in here about Garda-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----resources on the northside of Dublin.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is unbelievable that you would send me a letter-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----advising me that the Minister has no responsibility in this area.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	If there was a pipe bomb in any other area of the city-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----I am quite sure we would get major political responsibility for it.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This is a disgrace.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Chair can understand why certain communities feel they will get no representation from this Government. It is a disgrace.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Give it a rest.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No one is in charge of anything. The Minister for Justice and Equality-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Senator is doing well so far.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No. The Senator is doing pretty well so far.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Leader for that.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
