AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for their excellent presentations. I am particularly interested in the draft Bill presented by Dr. Mills. In regard to section 9 which deals with termination of pregnancy in cases of lethal foetal abnormality, my concern is that legislators will be asked to differentiate between an unsustainable pregnancy and a pregnancy which will lead to the birth of a baby who may survive for moments outside the womb. In the latter case is Dr. Mills of the view that a constitutional referendum would be necessary? It is important to clarify this unfortunate determination which legislators may face. In regard to the conscientious objection clause in section 13, is it normal practice to include such a clause within legal frameworks?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank both witnesses for their presentations. I have been an admirer of Mrs. Justice McGuinness for a long time. I particularly admire Professor Binchy's stance in the 2004 citizenship referendum. Article 34.4.6° of the Constitution states, "The decision of the Supreme Court shall in all cases be final and conclusive." How does this relate to the legal certainty of how we operate here? Is it not the fact that abortion is legal in this country under the ground of the risk to the mother in terms of her mental health and suicide? I ask the witnesses to comment on the draft Bill submitted by a previous witness, Dr. Simon Mills, on the point of lethal foetal abnormality. He contends that a foetus without any prospect of life was not protected under the Constitution.
