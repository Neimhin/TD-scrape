AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Mulkerrins and his committee for the presentation.  I am reminded of a comment made by the Minister for Justice and Equality at the UN to the effect that Ireland may move to having a special ethnic designation for Travellers.  I wonder if this will have an impact on the education system and the provision of education for Travellers.The delegates indicated that the National Educational Welfare Board has come under the aegis of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  What is their view on the fact that there is currently no requirement on parents to send their children to school until they are six years of age?  As such, there is little the board can do in respect of enforcing attendance for four and five years olds.I am a long-time critic of the general allocation model to the extent that it favours larger schools over smaller schools.  For example, a child attending a small, disadvantaged school who is in the 40th or 50th percentile for reading - 30% of children are below that level - will not be entitled to resource hours, while the same child, if he or she is enrolled in a larger, middle-class school, will receive that benefit.  There is an inequality built into the system which does not target the areas of greatest need.  I understand a review of the general allocation model is ongoing, but I ask the delegates to comment on this aspect.In regard to special needs assistants, will the delegates comment on the availability of private psychological assessments to some schools?  I do not wish to cast aspersions on the professionalism of educational psychologists, but it has been proven that schools which are totally dependent on the National Educational Psychological Service receive a lesser allocation of resources compared with those which can avail of private psychological assessments.  Will the delegates comment on that?Do the delegates have a figure for expenditure on taxi transport for pupils with special educational needs?  If they do not, I will submit a parliamentary question seeking that information.On admission policies under the general allocation model, will the delegates comment on the policies of certain schools which restrict access for children with special educational needs?  The reality is that some schools have a high proportion of such children, because they do not practise restrictive access policies, while others have a disproportionately low cohort of such students as a consequence of their restrictive policies.  What can be done to equalise the system so that every school in receipt of State moneys takes its fair share of children who require additional supports?In regard to low or high-incidence designations and so on, is it possible for the Department to consider a separate designation entirely for Down's syndrome children and their particular special educational needs?  What is the likelihood of thinking outside the box in that regard?  I have asked a great number of specific questions and I look forward to the replies.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	To clarify, the general allocation model benefits children attending larger schools.  This means that a child who is in the 40th percentile for reading and who is attending a small school with a high percentage of children with special educational needs will not receive the resources available to his or her counterpart attending a larger school where there is not the same level of special educational need.  In other words, where there are two children with the same level of educational disadvantage, the child attending a larger school will benefit from resource services simply because the allocation is done in terms of enrolment, while the child attending a smaller school will miss out.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is fine.
