AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the delegations for attending.  Focusing in on the ESRI prediction of an increase of 16% in third level numbers by 2020, how does the HEA intend to meet that challenge?  Has the authority any comparative figures on the higher demand for university places from international students?  Our seven universities are in the top 500 in the world.  It is often suggested each individual university is fighting its own corner rather than collaborating together.  If Harvard and various other universities in the United States can collaborate, why can more of our own not do the same?  Has the HEA concerns about standards in distance and online learning?  There is a concern within the third level sector that we are churning out a large number of trainee teachers who are swamping the system but there are no posts for them.  Is there a danger this might also happen with the roll-out of online learning?  How can we maintain a standard and proper inspection system around that?  There is an obsession with league tables and The Irish Times recently had an article about which schools are more successful, allegedly, than others.  The number of clarifications and corrections subsequently printed by the newspaper since that article has been alarming, with many schools bending over backwards to inform The Irish Times about what really happens in their own individual schools.  Do we leave access initiatives to individual colleges?  Has the Department and the HEA a centralised approach as to how we can encourage those from more disadvantaged backgrounds to enter access programmes?  Is it recognised that some schools find it more difficult than others in this area and that in some schools to get a student through the leaving certificate is a greater achievement than getting a doctorate?  Is there a centralised policy with access or is it left to the individual colleges and the goodness of their own hearts?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is it possible to get those figures?
