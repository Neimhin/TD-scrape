AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Without wishing to restate the case, I agree completely with the points made by Deputy Brendan Ryan.  For the sake of brevity, I simply wish to add my voice to the points made.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I wish to return to the Minister of State's response to Deputy Brendan Ryan and other Deputies on the establishment of the Bill and the review process.  May I have further clarification on how he considers it will take place and the mechanisms surrounding it and if he will incorporate some of the suggestions made by Deputies?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	With regard to the establishment of the Bill and fund, the committee could work with the Minister and have a certain scope to address some of the issues that have been discussed here today.  Is there a potential for that?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Will a review take place every year?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister will deal with the amendments, and amendment No. 35, which is along similar lines.  A strong message must go out from across this committee expressing our disappointment at the reaction of the religious orders and congregations and that we have received only €21 million at this juncture.  We are talking about a fund of €110 million and every member of this committee believes more has to be done, but stitching amendments into the Bill in terms of six months, interest and so on is unrealistic at this stage.  However, we can at least agree that the responsibilities of the religious orders leave a lot to be desired.
