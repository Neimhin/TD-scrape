AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There are very few issues in public policy that I feel more strongly about than this. I was in the position of the Minister of State not that long ago. In public life, it is very rare to come to the conclusion that everything we are doing is wrong. We have come to the conclusion that the issue with drugs lies with the substances and that if we just control them, everything will be fine. Addiction, however, is not just about the substance, it is about circumstances, disconnection and marginalisation. For the life of me, I cannot understand why we still think it is a good idea to effectively criminalise marginalisation and addiction.What my amendment is trying to achieve - it is very similar to Senator Ruane's amendment - is to stand by what the programme for Government said that drug policy would take a health-centred approach and not a criminal justice one. It makes absolutely no sense to try to dissuade somebody from a life of addiction by criminalising him or her for his or her drug use. My amendment clearly states that it should be a defence for anybody caught in possession of an illegal substance to argue that it was for his or her own personal use. As Senator Ruane has quite correctly said, Ireland could follow the example of Portugal by saying to individuals that we understand they are addicted, they have a medical need and that they need help and compassion and that we are not going to blame the victim. What happens in this Republic is that we blame the victim and all the resources that could be spent dealing with the pushers and the trade are being spent on the victims of the trade. There are silent victims of this industry who nobody ever hears about. I mentioned in the House a couple of weeks ago that in March of this year two people were found dead on the streets of our capital city from heroin overdoses but that never made it into the newspapers. One gentleman was found dead in the public toilet of Connolly Station and another gentleman was found dead after two nights in the open air in Foley Street. The stories did not make it into any newspaper, there was no protest and there was no political comment about it because on some level, in this society, we have decided that these people are to blame for their own addiction. We blame the victim and criminalise the victim. If one speaks to any group from the equality sector, whether the LGBT community, the Traveller community, people with disabilities or migrants, they will all say that there is disproportionate drug usage issue in these communities because of disconnection and marginalisation. When a person falls into addiction, surely our response should not be a criminal justice one but a health one. I am not sure if the Minister of State has been to the Drug Treatment Court, which is an initiative to try to keep people away from the criminal justice system, but all one sees there is a bunch of sick people sitting in a court room. It makes no sense whatsoever. Fundamentally, what we are trying to achieve here is to ensure the victim of this trade, the addict or the drug user, is not a criminal because of his or her drug use. The people who sell, trade in and profit from drugs should be criminalised. They should be taken out of circulation and we should use the criminal justice system to do that. However, the victim, the addict or the user, should not be criminalised because of his or her medical need or medical condition. What we propose is common sense. It would shift the whole drugs issue away from a moralising pathetic attempt to say Ireland is black and white to actually humanise the individual who is affected by this. I refer to our friends in the media. We, in Ireland, constantly use terminology that dehumanises people who need services and resources, and the media is culpable in this. We call them names; we call them junk. When we do that it inevitably results in the public consciousness believing that, in some way, these people are less worthy of resources. Let us take a course of action that might actually work because what we are doing at the moment is not working. We should look at what they do in Portugal and we should say to citizens that they have an addiction and they are not criminals but that they are patients with a medical need and we will treat them as such.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I understand that we are taking Report Stage tomorrow. I withdraw my amendment on the basis that I shall resubmit it tomorrow on Report Stage. Therefore, I give the Minister of State 24 hours to consider my amendment. I am a bit taken aback by Fianna Fáil's suggestion that unnamed community groups are jumping up and down because they have been upset by this proposal. That is not the case for the groups that I have dealt with such as Citywide, the USI and Peter McVerry. The political parties in both Houses have changed their position all of the time such as the Green Party, People Before Profit and AAA. Also, the justice committee of these Houses, as indicated by the Minister of State herself, also supports this position.I am not convinced that we will have this conversation at a later stage because the legislation was also supposed to include the provision for medically-supervised injection centres and that measure has been separated from the Bill. I do not accept the suggestion either that the Bill is a response to what is happening in the north inner city because the Bill before us is a reaction a year later to the High Court case of March 2015. I do not accept the suggestion that the Bill is motivated by the recent murder spree in the north inner city because it is a response to a legislative need arising, as I indicated, from a High Court ruling. It is not acceptable to constantly state we can have the conversation some other time. I got support from the Minister of State’s colleagues in Cabinet in the previous Government. The Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, was very supportive of the idea to have injection centres. The initiative was passed by the Cabinet and was to be included in the Bill before the House but it has been separated and we will have to deal with it another time. The Minister of State indicated the Bill would be likely to come before us in the autumn. She said we would deal with decriminalisation at some other stage. There were 679 drug and alcohol-related deaths in 2013. Addicts have very limited access in terms of having a voice. What Senator Ruane, Senator Black and others have said is that it is surely a humane approach - that in the cold light of day in a courtroom situation, it should be a defence for somebody to admit to being an addict and that he or she is in possession of drugs because of the addiction. I am sure any prosecuting garda, judge or jury would be able to make a determination that the nature of the addiction is a reasonable defence for the individual. To reinforce what we have always done because we have always done it does not stand up to scrutiny. I will press the amendment on Report Stage tomorrow. I urge the Minister of State to reflect on her position between now and then. I also ask those Members who have spoken against the amendment to think again about it and perhaps to re-engage with people who know what they are talking about. I mentioned the CityWide Drugs Crisis Campaign, Fr. Peter McVerry, and the report that was done by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. USI has again come out in favour of the decriminalisation of drug use. We are not resiling from the ideal of a drug-free society. That is absolutely not the case, but what we want is for it to be realised that somebody with an addiction needs help, support, compassion and medical attention, and does not need to be sitting in a courtroom or have a criminal conviction because of the nature of his or her medical need.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will resubmit it tomorrow.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 5, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:
“Possession of controlled drugs for personal use
8. Notwithstanding anything in the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 to 2015, in any proceedings for an offence under those Acts it shall be a defence to prove that the defendant had in his or her possession a controlled drug for his or her personal use and for no other purpose.”.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No. I will withdraw it with a view to resubmitting it on Report Stage.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister of State. I am genuinely delighted by his appointment. I also welcome the officials from the Department with whom I worked. One of the reasons I changed my mind about the validity of this Chamber - which Senator Norris will be delighted to hear - relates to the issue of direct provision. When I was Minister of State, it was the collective will of the people in this Chamber that something should be done about the issue. I was greatly impressed by the campaigning zeal of Senators across the Chamber to ensure that something practical could be done. In fairness to the Houses of the Oireachtas, unlike other parliaments in Europe, when legislation such as the International Protection Bill 2015 and other issues relating to direct provision are brought before the Houses for discussion, the amendments and questions put down in this Chamber and in the Dáil are always on the humanitarian side, never on the conservative side. In the case of the legislation to which I refer, an amendment to try to restrict access or play the race card was never tabled. We should take comfort from that without being complacent about it. There is a collective will in the Houses, across all parties, to do the right thing, which is to be commended. The International Protection Act 2015 envisages that any new applicant for asylum in Ireland would be dealt with in a speedy manner - within six to nine months - through a single procedure mechanism in order to ensure that we do not have people in our asylum system for years on end. Much has been done recently to deal with direct provision. Many have been moved out of the system. There was a logjam and people were not able to get out - even when they had leave to remain in the country - to access housing and other services. I was genuinely horrified when I read the programme for Government. When I read the draft programme, I was delighted to see a commitment to implement the working group report. Many people think the report does not go far enough. It does not end direct provision. I do not believe we can end direct provision because when we go beyond the one line hashtag of "#end direct provision" and dig deeper into the situation, we have to remind ourselves of what happened 15 years ago when direct provision was initiated because asylum seekers here were effectively homeless and without services. Direct provision was created as a short-term measure but, as happens sometimes in Irish public policy, a short-term measure became a long-term reality. The system that was envisioned as lasting for six months remained in place for ten and then 12 years. Children are growing up in this system. I visited 13 of these centres - some better than others - across Ireland. I could envisage myself spending time in some, in others I would not spend a night. There is one in Waterford that particularly sticks in my mind and we are overseeing this. We should have a system that has excellent facilities, with proper oversight, with food preparation that is culturally sensitive, where children can play and people have community links and stay for a maximum of six months. The working group report contained the same vision. The Minister of State’s officials signed off on it. The reason I was horrified was that the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, which engaged in that process took a risk to come inside the door to work with officials and sign off on proposals that could be implemented. They were implementable because the officials signed off on them, from a right to work, to food, to education, to health care, etc. One NGO walked away. The rest stayed in the system and with the process and signed off on the report in order to try to have it implemented. The draft programme for Government stated that it would be implemented but in the actual programme, that line was deleted. Somebody said this line about implementing the report - which Department officials had stood over and which NGOs had taken a great risk to be involved in to protect possibly the most vulnerable children in the State - had to be deleted. I would love to know who said that. It was not the Minister of State because this predated his appointment. Somebody in the political system or the Department decided this report could not be implemented in full. I want to know why because everybody took a risk. Why would any decent NGO trying to make a difference by working with the system engage with the Department of Justice and Equality again?Why, if another working group was set up to deal with any issue, would an NGO come inside the tent, take a risk and do the hard work - in some cases for nine months - to then sign off on a report for a Government which produces a programme for Government that initially states it will implement the report but then deletes the line? Somebody went out of his or her way to delete that line.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am horrified that somebody did that. If the Government does not want to implement it, it should say why. People took great risks. Some people in the Chamber were not happy with the report and did not feel it went far enough, but it is something about which I feel very strongly. I walked into the centres, and could smell the desperation and see people who were genuinely broken and were looking to public policy makers to make a difference. A document was then produced, which was greatly maligned in some quarters but had a chance to change lives, and somebody somewhere decided the line had to go. I am not in any way questioning the bona fides of the Minister of State. The Labour Party is happy to support the Bill. However, the working group report has to be the only game in town. The commitment of the Minister of State to that would be greatly appreciated.
