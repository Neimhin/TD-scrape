AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There is a commitment in the programme for Government to establish a citizens' assembly on the issue of drugs. There is growing momentum for a radical rethink of our entire drug strategy. We have the third highest overdose rate in Europe and there is a belief that this supposed war on drugs is killing marginalised people. There is a view that we need to decriminalise the drug user - not decriminalise drugs or legalise them, but take the drug user out of the criminal justice system. The Taoiseach will have seen the recent report about an individual who was in court in Cork charged with possession of cannabis worth €4. The Government has made a commitment to the establishment of a citizens' assembly on drugs. When is it intended to establish the latter?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Has the Taoiseach sought to meet Mr. Edwin Poots since he became leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP? We are very much at risk of a further breakdown in relations, and Mr. Poots is of the view that North-South relations have never been worse. Ms Nichola Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, has sought legal advice on the boycott by the DUP of the North-South Ministerial Council meetings. Has the Taoiseach received any advice on this? The North-South Ministerial Council is a key part of the Good Friday Agreement.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Senator Bacik and I have been advocating for quite a while for a catch-up fund for children in the next school year. The Taoiseach will be aware of the scarring and damage experienced by young people and children, particularly disadvantaged children, in the past year or so owing to the lack of in-school tuition. The UK has provided a fund of £1 billion. The Government here has allocated approximately €40 million for a summer programme. Will the Taoiseach speak to the necessity for catch-up funding?  Will he also speak to the need for all schools to retain their current teaching posts? I am aware of a school in Ardfert outside Tralee that is losing a teacher. A number of other schools have contacted me with regard to losing teachers. Is it not time for a moratorium on schools losing teachers in order that we can repair the damage that has been done to children and young people over the course of the last year? That was not the Government's fault, of course, but we must invest to drive down class sizes and overcome and repair the substantial scarring and damage that occurred in the past year.
