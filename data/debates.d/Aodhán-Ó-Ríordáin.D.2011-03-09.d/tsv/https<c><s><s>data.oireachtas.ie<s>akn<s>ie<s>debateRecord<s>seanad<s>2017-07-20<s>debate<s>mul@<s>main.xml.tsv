AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I join my colleagues in thanking the Cathaoirleach, the Leader of the House and the staff of the Seanad for all their professionalism and courtesy over the period we have been here. While our next period of parliamentary jousting will take place in a different environment, I am sure that professionalism will lend itself to the new surroundings as well. I raise again, as I have done in this Chamber, in written form and in oral contributions, the issue of Beaumont Hospital and the accident and emergency department which serves a huge number of people on the north side of Dublin. The problems in the Beaumont Hospital accident and emergency department persist. When I was a Member of the Dáil, the then Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and I met the senior management of Beaumont Hospital. The management presented us with a €45 million plan which would rectify the physical problems the accident and emergency department in Beaumont Hospital has. I do not think one could walk anywhere around the north side of Dublin without meeting a family who have some kind of horror story from experiences in the accident and emergency department in Beaumont Hospital. It is no reflection on the staff who work there and who work incredibly hard and incredibly well. The physical environment of that accident and emergency department needs to be rectified. I have raised it in a Commencement matter. I thank the Cathaoirleach for enabling that. I have also written letters, run campaigns and done petitions, but I do not hear anything from Government about where this capital investment is coming from or when it is going to happen. Perhaps, when we come back in September, we can have an update on that situation. The fiscal situation in the country has improved. We have an opportunity now to rectify these problems. I accept that there are other issues, including staffing, in the accident and emergency department, and the demographic in that area lends itself to having a very busy accident and emergency department. At the same time, the physical infrastructure needs to be enhanced, improved and invested in. Senior management has a plan. It wants to see that plan implemented. Everyone in this House who knows that area would agree that it needs that investment. Will the Leader facilitate a debate on that process in order that we could see those facilities being improved shortly?
