AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Labour Party will oppose this motion. In recent weeks, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has driven a coach and horses through the long-established process for bringing legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas. He rammed through the mica redress Bill, and every Stage of the Electoral Reform Bill 2022 has brought complex and substantial amendments outside the original scope of that legislation.Later today, 72 Government amendments made in the Seanad to the Electoral Reform Bill will be dealt with in 45 minutes of debate before going to the President for signature. It is an appalling way to make law that will determine the future of our democracy. Now the Minister is introducing, at a very late stage, six sets of complex amendments to the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill that run to 48 pages. The original Bill was only 18 pages long and dealt with some technical issues. He will triple the length of the Bill with his new proposals. One of the sets relates to short-term lettings. While potentially welcome, the Labour Party has warned for years of the need for stronger regulation of so-called Airbnbs. As far back as 2017, my former colleague, Mr. Kevin Humphreys, introduced a Bill to provide for a register of properties, with fines for those who do not comply. It is good to see the Government finally catching up now, five years later, but it should not be rushed through like this. There has been no scrutiny of the proposals at committee and no engagement with stakeholders or teasing out of how these new laws will work in practice. Many of the proposals being legislated for also relate to the Minister cleaning up mistakes previously made by proposals passed by this Government and its predecessor. Some of these are technical in nature and relate to ministerial directions and the OPR, flexibility in planning applications, maritime area planning and the Valuation Acts. What is not clear is why these could not have been progressed in the Seanad or introduced when the Bill was originally published. The most controversial set of amendments relates to judicial review. It was the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage under Fine Gael, and supported by Fianna Fáil, that created the crisis in An Bord Pleanála and the avalanche of judicial reviews when it introduced the strategic housing developments legislation, bypassing the normal two-stage planning process. We warned at the time that this would result in a significant increase in court activity, and that has been borne out. There was no compelling reason to bypass local authority planning, as it has done nothing to speed up the planning process, and An Bord Pleanála was clearly not equipped to deal with the massive increase in large and complex housing developments that require local planning expertise. However, now, without any pre-legislative scrutiny or Second Stage debate, the Government is planning to limit the ability of people to take judicial reviews and even when the courts find mistakes made by An Bord Pleanála, it will allow it to fix its own homework to pretend it never happened. Planning law solicitor, Mr. Fred Logue, has helped to highlight the problems with the Minister's approach. It effectively moves the goalposts for anyone who legally challenges a planning decision. He said in the Irish Examiner yesterday: "Under European law, the system has to be fair, equitable and not prohibitively expensive." I wonder where the St. Anne's campaign would be now if this legislation had been in place before the campaign began. With the sudden resignation of the deputy chairman of An Bord Pleanála at the weekend, it is crucial that the Minister now fast-tracks the publication of the report by senior counsel, Mr. Remy Farrell, in full. It is essential that people have full confidence in the planning process and if the report reveals more systematic and seismic issues in An Bord Pleanála, they must be addressed. Transparency and fairness are the bedrock of any democracy, and trust in the planning system is vital. The amendments being forced through raise serious questions about the crisis at the heart of our planning system. These changes raise serious questions of European law and constitutional concerns about the restriction of access to the courts. That is why we oppose the motion. If the Minister wants to understand why there are so many successful judicial reviews of planning decisions, it is because a dysfunctional Department and a willing Minister keep bringing forward last-minute legislation. The actions of the Minister also raise serious constitutional questions about the level of scrutiny afforded to our legislation. He has a proven track record now of bypassing the processes and Standing Orders of the House to get his plans put into law. Rushed law is bad law, and the Labour Party opposes this motion.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Rents in this country have reached record levels and the situation in Dublin is a crisis. Rents are more than 50% higher than they were at the peak of the Celtic tiger in 2008. This is causing misery for my constituents in Dublin Bay North. We must conclude that the housing market has failed. We need much stronger State intervention to increase supply through the direct building of social and affordable housing. We need stronger controls on rent increases and we need to limit the causes of evictions. Even at this late stage of the rent crisis, the whole country still has not been designated a rent protection zone. It is not too late for the Government to take some action. Tax rates on speculators need to rise rapidly. The calls for rent relief for landlords already enjoying record rent levels must be firmly rejected. The State needs to take on those engaged in land hoarding and speculation. Use must be made of compulsory purchase orders, the windfalls on development land must be heavily taxed and the LDA must be transformed into the dominant provider of affordable housing. If we want to reduce rents in this country in the long term, there is one clear way to do that. The Government must build tens of thousands of State-owned cost-rental units and destroy the business model of those who expect to make rack-rent profits from the rents paid by ordinary workers. Since 2016, this House and the Seanad have debated a multitude of housing Bills and motions, many of them dealing with the issue of renters and the protections they need. The Labour Party in government froze rent increases for two years in 2015 but, since then, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have allowed record rises. In our Social and Affordable Housing Bill 2016, my party proposed to limit increases for new properties for lease to align with prices for comparable properties in a particular area. This would have stopped landlords evicting tenants or terminating leases in order to get a new renter in to pay the latest market rent. Fine Gael in government voted that Bill down in December 2016, with the abstention of Fianna Fail. As rents got higher and higher, we repeatedly called for a freeze on increases for a minimum of three years to allow supply to catch up. That was one of the key issues in the 2020 general election. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil refused to act. Landlords were allowed to set whatever rent they wanted for a new tenancy and to increase it by 4% a year for existing tenants. The refrain from the Government parties was that our proposal was unconstitutional, despite it having been implemented by the Labour Party in government for two years from 2014. Whenever the Constitution is invoked on property rights, we should always remind ourselves what it actually states. It recognises a right to private ownership but it goes on to state in Article 43.2°:1° The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.2° The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.The principles of the common good and social justice are set out in the Constitution in reference to private property. When people can barely afford to live, when Irish rents are out of kilter with those in the vast majority of similar European countries and when more than 10,000 people are homeless in the State, we can all agree that a case for protecting the common good could be strongly made. Our Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021, which we introduced last September, would have massively restricted the grounds for eviction and frozen rent increases. The Minister made soothing noises at the time about working with us on it but nothing substantial happened. As a result of his failure to act, there is a plague of evictions now happening across the country as landlords seek either to sell properties at the top of the market or use any excuse to get their existing tenant out in order to put a new one in place. A commercial tenant has more rights if the shop he or she leases is sold than does a family when its home is sold by an investor. Why is this? It is because, for some reason, the Government believes the investor must be allowed to achieve the maximum price he or she can. Where is the common good in that, as laid down in our Constitution? We all know the result of this lack of action. More than 10,000 people, and rising, are homeless, including 5,054 single people, 3,028 children and 1,366 families. A modern tragedy is happening right in front of us. Simple changes to the laws covering evictions would shield a lot more people. If the Minister wanted to change the law today, he could do so. He has no compunction about rushing through changes on electoral reform and planning but God forbid he do something to stop a family being evicted or a child going into homelessness. Why not change the law to make it binding that any landlord who wants to sell a house with an existing tenant must first offer it to the State? We should put in place a default compulsory purchase order law for people's homes whereby the seller would get the market price, the family would get security and the State would save on having to deal with another homeless case.As I said during the debate on our Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021 last September, it just makes us all wonder what is the priority of this Government. Whom in the housing market is it trying to protect? There is no equivalence between the danger the renter faces and the danger a landlord faces. We are constantly told that landlords are fleeing the market, but the number of households living in rented accommodation was more than 500,000 in 2020 and that figure has doubled over two decades. The State is subsidising the mortgages and profits of tens of thousands of landlords and investors through the HAP, rent supplement, RAS and other schemes because of decisions made by Fianna Fáil in the late 1990s to get out of the direct building of social housing. The consequence of that is that more than €1 billion of current spending now goes to vulture funds and private landlords instead of towards investment in assets that could provide multigenerational security. We can change that, but it will not happen through the continuous outsourcing of provision to developers that Fianna Fáil is once again engaged in. The State must build and it must challenge the for-profit driven housing model. We can change things, but it is clear that it will not happen under this Government or under this Minister.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State and acknowledge that today is a historic day. It is a little bit of history. We did not have a statutory sick pay scheme and now we do. It was on foot of a Labour Party Private Member's Bill that this conversation started. The Minister took it on in good faith, we have come to the conclusion of that discussion and workers are in a better position today in Ireland than they were two years ago. While it is not perfect, we will work with it and try to improve it. I credit the Department, the Minister of State and the Tánaiste for working with us to get it to this point. Workers are in a better position today than they were two years ago, and that will always be a good day, particularly for people in the Labour Party. In particular, I thank and pay tribute to the efforts of Senator Sherlock in this regard.
