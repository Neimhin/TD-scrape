AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On behalf of the Labour Party, I congratulate the Minister on the passage of this Bill. We in the Seanad and Deputy Sherlock in the Dáil are anxious to be as helpful as possible in this regard. The Minister knows, as he has reiterated it a number of times, that the lack of an administration in the North and a government in Stormont is deeply regrettable, especially at this crucial time in the history of these islands, with the disaster of Brexit unfolding every day. The Labour Party supports this Bill, and we welcome the fact that the Garda Commissioner will now be able to enter into co-operation agreements with non-police or non-law enforcement bodies outside the State. We thank the Minister and his officials for the work they have done on this Bill. As ever, when dealing with matters in both Northern Ireland and these islands generally, it is most advantageous when the political systems in the two Houses of the Oireachtas work as one. I again thank the Minister and his officials.
