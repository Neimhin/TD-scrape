AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators Ivana Bacik, Kevin Humphreys and the entire Labour Party group in the Seanad, in expressing our condolences to the family of the late Jo Cox, MP. I am keen to emphasise what she believed in, which is far more important than what the person who murdered her believed in. She was a person who believed in the human dignity of all individuals, regardless of who they were or from where they came. This is something on which we should reflect because often in Irish society and public discourse we tend to label people and undermine their humanity. This leads to inequality, prejudice and fear. It is important that anyone who is thinking of entering politics, especially young women, be inspired by Jo Cox and not fearful of what happened to her. We live in an era in which there is harsh public discourse. Sometimes it is difficult to get across a nuanced point of view. Some political campaigns can be quite nasty and personalised. Elements of the media are intent on degrading politics and the public discourse in which we engage. It is important that anyone listening to those of us in this House, the other House or any parliament throughout the world should agree that politics can be the noblest of causes. For a person to follow a campaign and believe in something so vehemently that he or she is willing to spend his or her life or career in pursuit of that aim is good and decent. We must protect public discourse and those who wish to engage in it with everything we can.  I again join my colleagues in expressing sympathy. I am keen to reassure young men and women who believe in politics that the beliefs and values of Jo Cox will win out.
