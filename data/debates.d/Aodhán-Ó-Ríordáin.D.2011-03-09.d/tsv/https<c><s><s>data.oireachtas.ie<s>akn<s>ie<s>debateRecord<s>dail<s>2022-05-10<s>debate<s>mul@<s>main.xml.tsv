AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach may be aware that the Labour Party is running a campaign demanding a pay rise for Irish workers. The Taoiseach announced that the VAT cut of 9% will remain for the hospitality sector until February 2023. The number of workers in that sector on the minimum wage is three times the national average so it is a low-pay sector. As we constantly remind the Taoiseach, 23% of Irish workers are on low pay. We are the third highest in the OECD when it comes to the proportion of low-paid workers. The Taoiseach should engage with employers and tell them that the payback for continuing with the 9% VAT rate is their engagement with the joint labour committees to ensure their workers are properly paid. We cannot stand over a situation where the Government is gifting employers a 9% VAT rate but they still stand over a system of poverty pay.
