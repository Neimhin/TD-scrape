AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	As has been said, this weekend marks the fifth anniversary of the death of Savita Halappanavar. While I do not intend to deal with the eighth amendment here, as an Oireachtas committee is dealing with that issue, I ask you, a Chathaoirligh, to ask Senator Mullen to apologise for his recent comments in the media relating to the death of Savita Halappanavar.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	May I ask-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	With the greatest respect, this individual has insulted the name and the family of a dead woman. He did so deliberately and in a callous manner. He also did so with a veil of Christianity which, for me, is quite repugnant to anybody who holds the Christian faith in any type of respect. I suggest that a letter be sent from you, a Chathaoirligh, to Senator Mullen regarding his comments and that he be asked to apologise in the Chamber to the Halappanavar family for what he said. Perhaps we can get back to debating the eighth amendment in a respectful tone, which is what Members of this House should be doing and not insulting a dead woman, particularly in the week of her anniversary.
