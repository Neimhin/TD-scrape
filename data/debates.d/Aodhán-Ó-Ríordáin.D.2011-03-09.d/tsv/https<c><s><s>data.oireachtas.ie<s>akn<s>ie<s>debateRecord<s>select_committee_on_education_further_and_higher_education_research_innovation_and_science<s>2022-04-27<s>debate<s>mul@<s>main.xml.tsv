AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 89:In page 34, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:“(b) the funding status of individual designated institutions of higher education,”. I will withdraw this amendment and try to move it again on Report Stage. That is the best thing to do in the circumstances.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Excellent. I thank the Minister. I will withdraw the amendment and try to move it again on Report Stage. That is probably the best thing to do in the circumstances.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 92:In page 34, line 26, to delete “consultation” and substitute “partnership”. This is a very simple proposition, that the word "partnership" is stronger than the word "consultation". It is as simple as that.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On that basis I am happy to withdraw the amendment, but it is contingent on my being happy with the Minister's endeavours between now and Report Stage. We will move on a basis of good faith.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On that basis, yes. If the Minister is working on the language-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 95:In page 35, between lines 36 to 37, to insert the following:“(b) in developing a funding framework under paragraph (a), An tÚdarás consult with the designated institutions of higher education or their representative bodies.”.Again, this is all about consultation. The amendment inserts a line that concludes, "An tÚdarás consult with the designated institutions of higher education or their representative bodies". It is purely to make the Bill more robust when it comes to consultation.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 104:In page 37, line 5, after "section 126" to insert "or to adequately explain non-compliance in accordance with section 126(7)*".This is on conditions of funding. Section 38 states:(1) Funding that is provided by An tÚdarás to a funded body under section 37 shall be paid in such manner, and subject to such conditions, as the Chief Executive Officer specifies in writing to the body.(2) The conditions, referred to in subsection (1), that a funded body in receipt of funding under section 37 shall comply with shall be consistent with the objects and functions of An tÚdarás provided for in this Act and may include a requirement on the body—Paragraph (d) indicates "to comply with the guidelines, codes and policies issued by An tÚdarás under section 126,". We are suggesting the addition of "or to adequately explain non-compliance in accordance with section 126(7)*". Again, there must be a level of transparency and if there is non-compliance, it should be explained.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	As is generally the case with these matters, if the Minister is not in a position to accept the amendment we will try to work on it and bring it back on Report Stage. It is what I intend to do.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 105:In page 37, line 7, after "requirements," to insert "and".This is a simple insertion of the word "and" after paragraph (f). Amendment No. 106 would delete "thereunder, and" and substitute "thereunder.". It is a question of strengthening the language. Amendment No. 107 would delete lines 9 and 10 on page 37.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That would be to our liking. As can be seen in the Act, the autonomy of the CEOs is a little bit too strong so board approval will be appreciated. I will withdraw on that basis.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 106:In page 37, line 8, to delete “thereunder, and” and substitute “thereunder.” 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 107:In page 37, to delete lines 9 and 10. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 119:In page 42, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:“(e) recognised trade unions and staff associations in designated institutions of higher education,”.There is a very comprehensive list in the legislation of those who should be consulted with when preparing a draft plan but the glaring omission is the trade unions and staff associations in designated institutions of higher education. I see Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh makes the same point. If we have a comprehensive list of those who should be consulted, the trade unions need to be in there.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On that basis, I will withdraw the amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I had a whole speech prepared.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister want to speak to it?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am happy with that.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 134:In page 58, line 4, to delete "is concerned" and substitute "has serious, significant or material concerns".What I am trying to outline with this amendment is the nature of "concern". I want to replace the word "concerned" with "serious, significant or material concerns". That is a slightly more robust definition of what a concern may be, a concern that the CEO may have about the governance of an institution, that it should be serious, significant or material.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I may need more convincing in respect of why approval of the board is required in section 64 but not in section 65. However, similar to Deputy Conway-Walsh, I will withdraw my amendment and consider what the Minister does on Report Stage.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 141:In page 59, lines 25 to 29, to delete all words from and including “not” in line 25 down to and including line 29 and substitute the following:“operate to stay the coming into operation of the measure pending the determination or discontinuance of the appeal.”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 142:In page 60, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:“(4) A decision by the Chief Executive Officer to provide assistance under subsection (1) may be appealed by the designated institution of higher education concerned in accordance with section 70 within the prescribed period after the service of a notice on that institution under subsection (2).(5) The bringing of an appeal by a designated institution of higher education against a decision to provide assistance under subsection (3) shall operate to stay the provision of such assistance pending the determination or discontinuance of the appeal.”.I am interested in the Minister's view, to speed things along.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 146:In page 62, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:“(3) The appointment of a reviewer under subsection (4) may be appealed by the designated institution of higher education concerned in accordance with section 70 within the prescribed period after the service of a notice on that institution under subsection (2).(4) The bringing of an appeal by a designated institution of higher education against the appointment of a reviewer under subsection (1) shall operate to stay the appointment or result in a cessation of the work of the reviewer pending the determination or discontinuance of the appeal.”.”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 147:In page 63, line 15, to delete “or 65(4)” and substitute “, 65, 66, 67 or 69”.I am interested in the Minister's view on this.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 148:In page 63, to delete lines 20 to 22 and substitute the following:“(a) one person having a special interest in or expertise in, or knowledge of, matters relating to higher education or the functions of An tÚdarás (other than a member of the Board, a member of the staff of An tÚdarás, a public servant or a person employed or engaged by in institution of higher education),(b) one person with demonstrable expertise in, or knowledge of, matters relating to higher education at an international level (other than a member of the Board, a member of the staff of An tÚdarás, a public servant or a person employed or engaged by an institution of higher education), and”.We are replacing what has been suggested regarding the appeals board and its appointees. The Bill states, "two persons having a special interest in or expertise in, or knowledge of, matters relating to higher education or the functions of An tÚdarás". We are replacing that with, "one person having a special interest in or expertise in, or knowledge of, matters relating to higher education or the functions of An tÚdarás (other than a member of the Board, a member of the staff of An tÚdarás, a public servant or a person employed or engaged by in institution of higher education)". That is a more thorough definition. We also include, "one person with demonstrable expertise in, or knowledge of, matters relating to higher education at an international level (other than a member of the Board, a member of the staff of An tÚdarás, a public servant or a person employed or engaged by an institution of higher education)". The Minister might comment on the amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will speak to it now. I presume that the Minister would agree with me that the student voice is often relegated. It happens right throughout education. Most of the discussions that take place are about learning, and about those who may learn, without those people having input at the top table. Within all of that, I have to congratulate the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, today on elevating the issue to a higher area of responsibility than had been there before. In the Bill, there is a provision for two student members. We are simply proposing that it would be increased to three. I think that would be a better balance. By having three within themselves as a body, it is easier for them to have a coherent view on something, rather than having two opposing views. The Minister might see where I am coming from there. We would like the Minister to move from two members to three members to strengthen the student voice. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	"Ah go on."
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	"You will, you will, you will, you will".
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No, I am happy to proceed.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 151:"In page 66, line 23, to delete “two” and substitute “three”."
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 158:In page 69, line 22, to delete “enable” and substitute “report upon”. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 159:In page 69, line 26, after “university” to insert the following: “or in order to enable the provision of an adequate explanation for any non-compliance in accordance with section 126(7)* of the Higher Education Authority Act 2022,”. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 161:In page 72, line 15, to delete “governing authority” and substitute “chief officer".I will listen to the Minister's explanation.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 175:In page 78, line 6, to delete “2” and substitute “3”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 184:In page 83, line 27, to delete “2” and substitute “3”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 203:In page 108, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:“(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), An tÚdarás shall prepare or adopt and issue to designated institutions of higher education a policy concerning the sustainable investment of the funds of those institutions, including a prohibition on investing those funds, directly or indirectly, in a fossil fuel undertaking within the meaning of the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act 2018.”.I would like to hear the Minister's response. Deputy Ó Cathasaigh suggested earlier that there is a specific reference to ensuring there is a prohibition on investing in fossil fuel undertakings within the meaning of the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act 2018.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 204:In page 108, to delete lines 29 and 30.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 206:In page 108, line 33, to delete “may” and substitute “shall”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 208:In page 109, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:“Ministerial directions127. (1) Subject to the requirements of this section, the Minister may give a direction in writing to An tÚdarás to prepare guidelines, codes or policies under section 126(1).(2) The Minister shall, in the interests of procedural fairness, give a notice in writing to An tÚdarás to which is attached a draft of the direction concerned stating that—(a) the Minister is minded to give that direction to An tÚdarás, and(b) An tÚdarás may, if it wishes to do so, within the period specified in the notice (being a period of not less than four weeks from the giving of the notice) make submissions in writing to the Minister on the direction.(3) Where the Minister receives submissions referred to in subsection (2) before the expiration of the period referred to in that subsection, he or she may, after having regard to those submissions—(a) give the direction concerned to An tÚdarás with such revisions to the direction as the Minister considers are warranted in view of those submissions,(b) give the direction concerned to An tÚdarás without any revisions to the direction if the Minister considers that no such revisions are warranted in view of those submissions and stating the reasons therefor, or(c) decline to give the direction concerned to An tÚdarás if the Minister considers that—(i) in view of those submissions, the direction is not warranted, or(ii) for any other reason, the direction is no longer warranted.(4) Where the Minister receives no submissions referred to in subsection (2) before the expiration of the period referred to in that subsection, he or she may—(a) give the direction concerned to An tÚdarás, or(b) decline to give the direction concerned to An tÚdarás if the Minister considers that, for any reason, the direction is no longer warranted.(5) The Minister shall cause a direction under this section to be published on a website of the Government at the same time as it is given to An tÚdarás or as soon as is practicable thereafter being a time which is not later than the next business day following the date on which it is given to An tÚdarás.(6) Where a direction has been duly issued under this section An tÚdarás shall comply with the direction.”.
