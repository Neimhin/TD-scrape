AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I suppose what people find difficult to understand with regard to the universal social charge is that self-employed workers who earn over €100,000 pay 10%, yet those who are not self-employed do not. People find it difficult to understand the rationale behind the reluctance to equalise the payment for workers, whether self-employed or not. I understand that if the universal social charge was to be increased to 10%, it would raise €71 million. If that were to happen, there would be potential to lessen the burden on those on the lower end. I am interested, as I am sure are others, in hearing why that equalisation cannot take place. What is the rationale behind the Minister's thinking?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It would be beneficial if a copy of the response the Minister read out to me could be forwarded to all the members of the sub-committee. Can he confirm that the €71 million figure, which was mentioned after I asked how much would be gained if the universal social charge were increased to 10% for PAYE workers earning more than €100,000, is accurate?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The reality is that 40% of third level students are on some level of grant, such as the maintenance grant if not a complete grant. That is a large number of students who are outside the bracket.
