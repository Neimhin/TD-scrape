AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Leader to put on the record of the House the exact nature of the relationship between this Government and Deputy Michael Lowry, who has a criminal conviction for tax irregularities.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I found the Taoiseach's comments about this relationship at the weekend quite disturbing. I ask the Leader to inform the House exactly what support arrangements the Government has with Deputy Lowry, and indeed to publish those details. We would all be interested to know the exact nature of that relationship. I noticed that the confidence and supply agreement was flittered around the place on the Fianna Fáil benches a few moments ago. I would like to inform Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil that I have done a short word count on the important issues covered in that document. It contains ten words on child poverty and 143 words on housing, but 603 words on water. It is obvious that when this agreement was being scratched together, water was 60 times more important than child poverty and four times more important than homelessness and housing.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Surely that agreement, which considers water to be more important than anything else, especially housing and child poverty, contains all the answers to the water shortages and water problems we are having in this country at present.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is busy.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Sorry, I need to clarify. The Leader has not answered my question. I asked him about the relationship between Deputy Michael Lowry and this Government. He has not answered the question.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will be as quick as possible. I have a level of sympathy for the Minister in trying to defend the process in which he clearly does not believe. He has been compared to Archbishop McQuaid but he reminds me of the band Maroon 5 in that insufferable World Cup advertisement, which sings "Don't worry about a thing. Every little thing is going to be all right". If the Minister was part of the Opposition he would rail against this process. If Sinn Féin had not been bought off, it would rail against this process as well.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This is a circus and it is really embarrassing. I am glad the journalists have all gone home. A reputable European body has issued a report stinging in its critique of this legislation. It is only in front of us because the Fr. Ted alliance feels strongly about it. There are bits of this report in Sunday newspapers and in front of me. The Minister has said he has not seen it but again he says not to worry about a thing. With the greatest of respect, if the Minister is going to ask the Cabinet to publish the report on Thursday, could we not just halt everything until then?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We could then have a much more informed debate. The Minister will be able to go back to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, who clearly feels very strongly about this and who I half-expected to be sitting in that chair instead of Deputy Flanagan when I came in this evening-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Let us do this properly. If the Minister was part of the Opposition, along with the Fine Gael representatives, it is just the kind of exercise that they would rail against. This is important legislation being railroaded through despite eminent European bodies raising serious questions about it. Fine Gael is meant to be the party of law and order so let us do this properly.
