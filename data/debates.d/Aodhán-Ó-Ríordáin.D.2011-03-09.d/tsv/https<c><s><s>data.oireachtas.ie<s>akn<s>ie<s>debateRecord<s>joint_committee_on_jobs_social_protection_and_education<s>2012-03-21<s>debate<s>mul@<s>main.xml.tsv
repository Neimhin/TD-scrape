AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I welcome Ms Kathleen Stack, assistant secretary of the Department of Social Protection, Mr. Philip Cox, Mr. Bernard Tonge and Mr. David Dillon, principal officers, and Ms Geraldine Gleeson, chief appeals officer.Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2) (l) of the Defamation Act 2009 witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence at this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of the evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible you should not criticise nor make charges against any person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.I believe Ms Stack has two presentations and I ask her to begin, with Ms Gleeson to follow.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I will take some questions but I remind members not to discuss individual cases if possible.  I realise that on occasions individual cases are used as examples but I ask them not to mention a case about which they are particularly concerned and discuss policy.  I will first call Deputy Aengus Ã“ Snodaigh.  Senators John Kelly and Feargal Quinn have indicated.  If other members are interested in putting a question I ask them to indicate that to me.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Does Ms Stack wish to respond to some of those issues before we proceed?
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Lawlor asked what constitutes a long-term illness.  I have been told transplant patients are not considered as having a long-term illness, which I think is strange.  I ask the witnesses to comment on this and on the issues raised by Deputy Lawlor.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Does Ms Stack wish to comment on this?
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Ms Stack will take it on board.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Deputy to conclude.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I ask the delegation to respond to Deputies Kyne, Fleming and Joan Collins's remarks.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I have a few quick questions.  Recently there has been a lot of comment on the 17,000 anonymous complaints.  Can the delegation give a basic breakdown on the type of complaints? Has the nature of complaints changed over the past number of years?  Is there a need for an information campaign on what foreign nationals are entitled to?  The amount of misinformation on what people assume foreign nationals are entitled to is outrageous.  The amount of misinformation on foreign nationals' entitlements is absolutely outrageous.  This is leading to some very unfortunate commentary and suspicion.Senator Mullins touched on the move from welfare to work.  In this regard, let me refer to the poverty trap of social welfare, the cage that protects but does not set one free.  How can we make it easier for people to move from welfare to work?  Some 93,000 casual part-time workers in receipt of the jobseeker's allowance want to work full-time but perhaps do not understand or have the necessary information on the entitlements they would retain if they did so.  Could the delegates comment on that?
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I am not saying they are.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Are there any suggestions that more complaints are proving to have merit now than in the past?
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Is that a higher percentage than that which obtained in previous years?
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Okay.  There seems to be a lot of misinformation.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for attending, for being so frank and giving us such valuable information.  I appreciate it.  I thank Ms Stack and Ms Gleeson in particular for making the presentations.
