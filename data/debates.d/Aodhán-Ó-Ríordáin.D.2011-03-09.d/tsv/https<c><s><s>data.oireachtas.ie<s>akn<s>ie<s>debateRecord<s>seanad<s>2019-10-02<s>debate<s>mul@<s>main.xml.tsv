AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Often we stand in the Chamber and make political charges against each other. We spark off each other and this is the way of political theatre. In light of what the British Government is apparently proposing as a solution to its Brexit problem, the Houses of the Oireachtas must stand firm as a collective. It is deeply upsetting to everybody in Ireland to witness what is happening in the United Kingdom. One can only use words that Boris Johnson has used and describe the proposal as complete humbug. Twenty years ago, the British Government signed a sacred peace agreement after 30 years of violence and more than 3,000 deaths. All of us, Irish, British, Northern Irish, unionist and nationalist, said we would never again return to a scenario that would lead to violence. Less than 20 years later, the British Government has thrown that agreement in the fire and considers English nationalism to be much more important and that a small cabal in the British Tory Party had to be placated. The lack of knowledge among the British commentariat, public and political system and, particularly, the Tory party about the sensitivities of this island and what happened here is quite astonishing. Within all of this, for Boris Johnson to use words of war in his common discourse is deeply offensive. He has used phrases and words such as dying in a ditch, surrender and traitors. It is deeply offensive given what has happened in this country. On behalf of the Labour Party and, I am quite sure, other parties in the Chamber I say we stand firmly behind the Taoiseach and Tánaiste in their absolute rejection of the proposals coming from the British Government. These proposals are coming from an entity that has no interest in a deal. While we spend a huge number of hours disagreeing in this Chamber, on this day of days, as we head towards 31 October and the British Prime Minister addresses his party conference, we must call out this nonsense for what it is. It is a result of narrow-minded xenophobic English nationalism and the Oireachtas will not accept it. It will stand up for the Good Friday Agreement and peace and prosperity on this island and throughout Europe.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister will be aware of the situation on the north side of Dublin, which I have raised here constantly and consistently over the last year. It has spiralled out of control when murders, gun crime, pipe bombs, shootings outside shopping centres in daylight or murders outside primary schools are part of a list of incidents that have taken place in the Dublin 17, 13 and 5 in the past 12 months. I have consistently tried to be constructive and I have asked the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues to replicate what they did in the north inner city. He has consistently refused. The Mulvey report was produced in respect of the north inner city, and a sit-down initiative was taken by the Government to get every agency, political representative and stakeholder to come up with a set of proposals that would not only police away the problem but understand the reasons for the problem. What I have been asking for, in an effort to be constructive, is for a Mulvey-style report to engage agencies such as Northside Partnership, Preparing for Life in Darndale, local schools and community groups and residents' associations to come up with the reasons such gangland crime, violence and murder are happening and come up with constructive solutions so we can police our way out of it.  Having said that, on my initiative and that of the Clongriffin community association, there has been a campaign for a new Garda station in the Dublin 13 and 17 areas. I am pleased this has been agreed to and this station will be in situ in a number of years. However, the Minister must agree that it cannot be normalised for children to grow up seeing Garda tape in their area because of another shooting. It cannot be normal for a child to go to a primary school having to step around a crime scene or a murder. In my community, which I try to represent to the best of my ability, this is happening far too often. I do not accept that if it happened in any other part of the country, it would be considered acceptable, but for some reason on the north side of Dublin, it is almost coming to be accepted that this is the way it is. However, that is not the way it is. It is a proud part of the country and the city and it deserves answers. I appeal to the Minister and Government to set aside party political divisions, conclude that there is a problem here and commission a report over a period of months, bringing together every stakeholder who cares about the area in a room to come up with a set of proposals that might educate, lift and empower the community out of the situation. Policing is part of the solution, but not alone. Once again, I plead with the Minister to replicate what he did in the north east inner city on this part of the north side as then we might get solutions and a community that feels that the State is working on its behalf. Young people are making decisions. I am sure there is a young person making a decision today regarding whether he or she goes down the route of gangland crime or involve himself or herself in the mainstream economy and society. Those decisions are made every day. It is empowering for a person to get a gun in his or her hand so we must ask how we get to a point where communities find better solutions and choices for young people. We can do that together but every time I raise this, I do not get an answer. I find that desperately disappointing when the Government found the energy to do it in one part of the city. I implore the Minister to please do the same in the Dublin 17, Dublin 13 and Dublin 5 areas.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister to the House. Again, my party supports the Bill, in principle. We will work with the Minister and his officials in as constructive a manner as we possibly can as this Bill makes it way through the House. I have an issue with the Bill in that, as has been outlined by other speakers, the relationship many students and parents have with schools is a financial one. A disproportionate number of conversations that principals have with parents and that teachers have with parents and students are about money. If that is the basis of a conversation one has with a school because of a voluntary contribution, book money or any other moneys that are perceived to be owing, be it at primary or secondary level and notwithstanding the fact that free education is reputedly a constitutional right, this impinges on one's capacity to have a proper, full or empowering conversation about one's child and his or her development in the school. Regrettably, asking for a voluntary contribution is in the Bill. We should be working our way towards there being no voluntary contributions because the State should properly finance our school system. In other jurisdictions in the European Union and across Europe, such voluntary contributions are banned. The Labour Party has a Bill that proposes to ban voluntary contributions that will come towards the House next week.  If one's conversation as a parent is constantly a reminder, subtle or otherwise, about the necessity for a voluntary contribution or book money to be paid, is one more or less likely to find oneself at the school gates? Is one more or less likely to put oneself forward to become a member of the parents' association? Is one more or less likely to stand for a position on the board of management? Is one more or less like to attend parent-teacher meetings? I suggest, and most people will agree with me, that if money is an issue or if this transactional relationship one has with a school is disproportionately large, then one is less likely to engage and less likely to discuss one's child in terms of development and education, how to help one's child at home, how to read to one's child at home, how one can improve a child's oral language skills, improve literacy or how to engage with the system when one's child has a diagnosis about which one has concerns. Unfortunately, the conversation comes back to the book money or the voluntary contribution etc. It is far too expensive, in a society that calls itself a republic and one that has a Constitution that underpins the right to free education, to send one's child to school.We have spoken about uniforms. County Derry is close to the Minister's constituency. In the Six Counties, school books are free because a determination was made once upon a time that school books should be free and no parent of a child in the North of Ireland pays for books. It would cost the Exchequer €20 million to provide that at primary level in the Republic. I believe it is not just a financial issue; I believe the Department is horrified at the suggestion that it would engage itself in the day-to-day management of schools. That is the real reason because it wants to allow the patron bodies to maintain the power and autonomy. This Bill comes from a good place. What the Minister is trying to achieve is that parents and students feel more empowered and greater partners in the education system and in their school life. That is to be congratulated and supported. That is what we want to do. There is a wider issue about whether we tinker with the system or radically overhaul and improve it. Based on my experience as a school teacher and a principal, I was having too many conversations with parents about money. In the context of a DEIS school in an acutely disadvantaged area, even when the book rental scheme was available for all children and it was much cheaper for them to avail of school books than for any other child, having to ask for €60 impinged on my capacity to talk to that parent about other issues that I should have been talking about. Where a parents' association believes that it is fundamentally a fundraising association, it cannot deal with matters of policy and procedure that it should be promoting and thinking progressively about how the school is managing itself, thinking long-term about the school community. How anyone can feel that they are playing on a level playing pitch in the school community if they do not have the ability to make a voluntary contribution, regardless of whether the school has a progressive and open-minded view as to who can afford and who cannot? If one feels as if one cannot afford to contribute, that will impinge on the way that one will engage. This could be the beginning of a conversation on how we fund our schools, how our schools are managed, and the way we view education as a public good, and not something to be purchased. We should not have an expectation that parents' associations fundraise, that voluntary contributions are collected and that books are paid for. Other societies have made different value judgments about education and they have cleared the conversation about finance to one side because it has nothing to do with education and they have maximised this beautiful relationship between the teacher, child and parents and the school and money has no place in this conversation. If this is the beginning of a road to achieve that, we are all for it and the Labour Party will support it, but it is worthy of us to have the conversation. I cannot expect the Minister to say he totally agrees with me, and has a bag of cash to change the way we have always done things overnight. I accept that, but if we are enshrining in legislation an understanding that there will always be a voluntary contribution, that is a failing. If we are empowering on one level but accepting this transactional relationship on another, we are not achieving as much as we could have. I appreciate the good place that this is coming from. The power imbalance has been there in the past and the legislation is trying to address that but, as other speakers have rightly said, there is a bigger conversation to be had about how the school system is funded, the way the Department is willing or unwilling to engage in the day-to-day management of schools, the way the system is organised in the North of Ireland and how we could replicate that in the South and having a deeper and more profound vision of how education can lift up, set free and liberate every child in the land. It should never be relegated by a conversation about money.
