AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Should we thank Fianna Fáil for every tribunal we ever had?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Labour Party welcomes this legislation, which is coming from the High Court ruling on court presenters. I am taken by the letter written by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, to the Ceann Comhairle. She states that on a single day, 2 June, more than 2,131 cases were before the District Court throughout the country. Notwithstanding contingency measures put in place, hundreds of cases had to be adjourned. In one court alone, 130 cases had to be adjourned, which has caused significant distress and upset to victims and accused persons. These cases will be added to the already lengthy backlog of cases arising from Covid disruption. Clearly, the court presenter system, without any legislative underpinning, was holding the District Court system together. If it is struck down by the High Court, the legislative body of the Oireachtas then needs to act. The Government is acting and we support that action. I do not necessarily agree, however, with the Minister's suggestion that delays are purely down to Covid. Anybody who works in the system will attest to the fact there is a lack of judges. That has to be addressed. It is part of the issue that is leading to such delays in our District Court system. It is slightly alarming that a ruling like this can shine a light on a practice that is holding the District Court system together and maintain that it does not have legislative underpinning. Are the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice analysing our systems so there is no other issue that may come to light in future that could be struck down by the High Court? It is important there is robust analysis of how our system of justice operates. If something so fundamental to how a case proceeds through a District Court process can be identified by a High Court judge as not having legislative underpinning, is there anything else? As a result of this judgment, is the Government, the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice or any agency conducting a robust analysis of how the District Court operates so that we do not find ourselves in this situation again? It does not reflect well on us as an Oireachtas that such legislation has to come before us without pre-legislative scrutiny and has to be rushed through the Houses so quickly. If someone is in front of a District Court, this may be his or her only chance to get a level of justice, be that person an accused person or somebody on the other side of the issue. It would cause me and, I am sure, the Minister and the Government, disquiet that such a fundamental element of how this is run could be deemed to be without a legislative underpinning. The lack of judges is part of the problem. We need a robust analysis of how our District Court system is operating. I am heartened by the words of Deputy Ó Murchú when he speaks to how drug offences are dealt with. I feel that across the Oireachtas we have potential for great change here. As the Deputy said, there is a citizens' assembly due in the new year on the issue of drugs. Those who work in this area know a massive number of the drug possession cases that have come before our courts do not need to be there at all. Some 70% of drug cases are for possession for personal use. The vast majority of cases are against people who are addicted to something or who use something. In other jurisdictions, they are funnelled through a very different path. We talk about harm reduction and using the health system primarily, not the courts system. If the Minister takes a trip to the drug court, which has a certain level of success, she will observe a courtroom full of sick people. They should not be sitting in a courtroom looking at a judge. Those who have an addiction fundamentally do not belong in a courtroom interacting with the criminal justice system, gardaí and judges. That is not where they should be. The citizens' assembly, as indicated by Deputy Ó Murchú, is the right forum for us to analyse properly how other jurisdictions are dealing with this issue. I refer to Portugal and various states in America. We should take issues of personal use and addiction out of our courts system. They do not belong there. We need to find another mechanism for dealing with them. If we were to do that, we would free up a lot of court time and Garda time that could be spent tackling the pushers, the gangs and the industry rather than the victims, who are the ones inevitably in front of the courts. We appreciate the Government had to act and is acting. The Minister is bringing forward legislation without pre-legislative scrutiny because there is a time issue and that is fair enough. However, the Government has to recognise that if a High Court judge has struck down something so fundamental to the operation of our courts system, what else is there? What else could there be? Are there other legal loopholes that need to be strengthened so we do not find ourselves in this position again? If we are back here again in six months' time because a High Court judge sees something else that does not have a legal underpinning, it is not going to reflect well on us at all. On the day-to-day operation of a court, I encourage the Minister to go down to the drug court or any court. For any Member of the Oireachtas or member of the public who is not familiar with what happens there, whenever I have taken the opportunity to witness it at first hand, it is really striking how those who are in the accused position need an awful lot more help, compassion, understanding, medical intervention and counselling than is being afforded to them. Many of these cases could be dealt with in a very different way. Other jurisdictions that have dealt with it in a different way have seen the number of drug cases and overdoses collapse. They have seen the number of people in heroin dependency programmes collapse as well. That is my main point. Let us not be here again because of something else we overlooked. Let us deal with the lack of judges, because it is leading to delays within the courts system.If we have the opportunity and if there is goodwill, as Deputy Ó Murchú indicated, across the parties in this House to deal with the issue of drug offences differently, we will have a radically reformed courts system and a much better way to empower somebody with a drug use or addiction issue. As any observer knows, the last person to whom somebody with a drug use or addiction issue needs to be talking is a garda or judge. I will leave it at that.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Ó Laoghaire for tabling the motion. It is important that we reflect on the life of a family with a child with autism, the news of a diagnosis, the challenge of it and getting used to it. They then have to deal with the system and the long waiting lists for assessment and interventions. It can take 36 months in some cases. I have been dealing with families who have been affected by this issue for approximately three years. Let us imagine if one had to deal with the challenge of this diagnosis, the new reality of waiting lists and trying to balance that situation in a family, only to come face-to-face with the education system when trying to enrol a child in the local school and having the school say "No". Imagine how that family or those parents would immediately come to the conclusion that their child was a second-class citizen, because the local school has said "No". The SENO will provide a list of schools to the parents and wish them the best of luck, then tell them they can get home tuition if it does not work. Who among us is qualified to invite someone we do not know into our home to teach their child as a substitute for their child going to the local school? Can people imagine the humiliation of having to chase down school after school and having them all say "No"? Parents have come to me saying they have chased down 17 schools that have all said "No".On the list that was given to a woman in Donaghmede by the special educational needs organiser, SENO, there was a school in Drogheda. Already we have hundreds of parents around the country who feel that they and their children are second-class citizens. I want the Minister to cast her mind back to 18 months ago when we were in the Convention Centre Dublin and we had a discussion about the reopening of schools in January 2021. The Minister did her absolute best to present herself as a champion of children with special educational needs and their parents by pitting parents against school communities. I challenged her by saying she was suggesting to us we have to pick a side. The Minister for Education said she did pick a side, that of young people and children with special educational needs and their parents. That is exactly what the Minister said. Fast-forward 18 months, we are now in June 2022 and again we have no solutions to the reality of what these families are facing. When it suits the Ministers, they can be on the side of children and families who are facing issues of school placement. When it does not suit them, they have to go through Twitter threads because they know there is a "Prime Time Investigates" programme coming or they are embarrassed by a child from Tipperary who has to fundraise for her brothers. They came up with a proposal that is so obnoxious and odious to the rights-based approach of children with special educational needs that it should have been followed by a resignation letter from the Minister with responsibility for special education. There are temperate, mild-mannered lobby groups and NGOs working in this system and area all the time that are horrified by the warehousing that is effectively a direct provision approach to special educational needs. It is as if the Ministers are stunned we are in the month of June because they could not predict it. Allied to this is the fact those who work most intensively in this area, our special needs assistants, SNAs, have the ignominy of being told on the very last day of May whether they have jobs for September. I am exhausted listening to parents who are telling me their life stories, and I do not have to deal with it day to day. I cannot imagine the exhaustion of somebody who is dealing with challenging parenting and who then has to deal with agencies of the State that effectively make them and their child feel worthless. I and other Deputies deal with campaigning groups from all over the country. They have to become campaigning groups. If they were to deal with the State on a one-to-one basis, they would not get anywhere. Unless they become a campaigning group or a full-time campaigner, they are wasting their time. Unless they expose the privacy of their family life to television cameras and go on "Prime Time Investigates", nothing is going to change. They must have the campaigning zeal of a child in Tipperary who sees that what is happening to her brothers is not fair or just and has to embarrass the Government into meeting her. That is the only thing that seems to make a difference. It does not come from an inherent sense of equality or justice within Government. It does not come from an inherent sense of equality or justice on the part of the Ministers. What it comes from is a fire-fighting response to an emergency need. I cannot imagine the rage I would feel if I approached the local school in my community with my child whom I have struggled to convince that he or she is an equal citizen in this Republic, and for the local school to say "No". The Ministers cannot at this late stage tell us they have grand plans for section 37A. It has been utilised twice. One of those cases is still stuck in the courts. As has been said, it takes a long time to expedite. The Ministers could have been reforming section 37A for the past 18 months since they made their grand gesture in the convention centre about how strongly they feel about special needs education, special needs students and their families. They did not. When they had a chance to use it as a wedge against teachers and SNAs on the reopening of schools, it was convenient for them. What actually needed to take place to provide school places for those who need them just did not happen. As has been said by the proposers of the motion, the Minister needs to take action on section 37A and we will support that. We supported emergency legislation earlier today. We will support any amount of time the Minister wants to put forward on section 37A to demand of a school to open up for a child who needs a place and then to resource that school. I am quite sure there are school principals and communities who are not sure they would get the support of the State if they did go down that road. Immediately tonight, the Ministers must end this warehousing proposal. They must make a statement that it was a bad idea, ill-conceived and poorly thought out. It has caused a lot of hurt and upset and it is not going anywhere. The Ministers should make that statement tonight. They must absolutely commit to the ethic of a local school place for a child in that community. They must commit to doing anything they possibly can to ensure that right. They should commit that we will not be back here in six or 12 months' time having the very same debate because it does not suit the Ministers, who are utilising this issue as a wedge to drive between parents, school communities and children with special educational needs.
