AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I join Senator Clifford-Lee and Deputy Coppinger in expressing disgust at the argument made in the criminal courts in recent days. The Law Reform Commission has concluded a consultation process on the issue of consent related to the update of Ireland's consent laws. It would be appropriate in that context for the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to address this House on the issue of rape crime, sexual assault, consent law and how we in this House can be of benefit in assisting the changing of the law in this regard, if required. The message should go out from this House and from every politician and person of influence in this country that the one cause of rape is a rapist. On Brexit, nobody has seen the draft as of yet. This is a critical time for our country, North and South. I support the calls for a debate on the deal in this House when the text becomes available to us. I am happy to support the Government's endeavours in regard to this deal but the Labour Party holds out hope for a second referendum. It is the responsibility of the Labour Party in Britain to lead that charge. The Labour Party here, through the social democratic family across Europe, will seek to exert influence on Jeremy Corbyn to change his view and to campaign for a second referendum on the basis that there is information to hand now that was not available to the people in 2016. Emotions are no longer running high and the complexities of exiting Europe are much clearer now than they were two and a half years ago. The final deal that is being proposed should be put to the British people, including the people of Northern Ireland. I am sure that if this were to happen, we would have a different scenario. I still hold out hope that Brexit can be stopped.It is the political responsibility of the leader of the Opposition in the UK, Jeremy Corbyn, to lead that fight.  My final point concerns BusConnects and bus corridors. I know that quite a number of people in Dublin city have received communications from the NTA about their front gardens potentially being taken away because of the new infrastructure that is being put in place. I know that there is the potential for a cycle line in Marino to be re-directed from Fairview through certain roads in Marino and on to the Malahide Road. Could the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport come to the House to talk about BusConnects? It has the potential to be positive but it could also have a number of negative effects on a number of small communities. If we could have that debate here and have a bit of political leadership on the issue rather than the Minister distancing himself from the NTA, it would also be of benefit.
