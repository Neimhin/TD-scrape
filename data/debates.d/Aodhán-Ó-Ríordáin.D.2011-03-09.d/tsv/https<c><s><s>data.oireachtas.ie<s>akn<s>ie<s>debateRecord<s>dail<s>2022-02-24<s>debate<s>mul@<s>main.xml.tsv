AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In the context of what has happened in Ukraine this morning, I ask the Minister of State to give a sense of what his Department can do and what supports he can give to the Ukrainian community here in Ireland through the various organisations with which he has strong relationships. My question relates to the proposed bid for the European championship football tournament in 2028, for which the FAI is co-bidding. What financial supports may his Department have to give in support of that bid?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The nervousness that comes in from football people, who will have different viewpoints on this, is that major infrastructural deficits exist in Irish football. There is controversy over the Dalymount Park plan that is the heartbeat of Irish football, traditionally. There is controversy over what will happen to Tolka Park. One third of all League of Ireland footballers only have a junior certificate as a qualification. This is a much-loved and very important game. It is much-loved in the more disadvantaged areas of our country, which is probably why it has been so politically powerless, traditionally. There are so many needs within this game and deficits in the relationship between the State and the football communities in Ireland that the hosting of this tournament has to be questioned. I am glad to hear the Department is questioning the FAI's approach.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that. The general point is that if one thinks about where football is, its interaction with the education system is minimal compared to other codes. There is greater energy and atmosphere around the League of Ireland than there has been for a number of years. I look forward to going to Dalymount Park on Friday evening to support Bohemian FC. The infrastructure around the League of Ireland is not perfect. It is only five years since the women's team effectively went on strike because of the lack of respect it was getting from within the association. We also know of all the controversies that have taken place heretofore. Football is so important and so powerful. We have such diverse senior teams in women's and men's sides representing this country. A Traveller woman plays for the Irish women's team and a number of lads with various ethnic backgrounds play for the senior men's team. This is an exciting time for Irish football. The issue really is that we grab that and invest in a different way than with the big prize of hosting a big tournament, the benefits of which are unknown.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I join the other Members in what they have said about the next phase of this process. I would also ask if we have a vision into the future so that we could front-load funding for local authorities. I believe that, in certain circumstances, there are clubs that have expertise within them, perhaps those who have greater education or that have planning experts, engineers, barristers, teachers or whoever on their sporting committees, and there those other sporting clubs that do not have that level of expertise, and this second group can fall through the gaps during funding process. Is it not better as a long-term strategy for the Government to support local authorities to have an audit of the sporting needs in any geographical area and for them to have municipal sporting facilities so that all sporting bodies can benefit from them, rather than having these competing interests within any one geographical area?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am greatly encouraged by the Minister of State's response. The vision the Minister of State is outlining is something that I really welcome. The possibility that we will have an audit of the sporting needs of any given community, and that the local authority will be the driver for that, is something that will be welcome. I look forward to working with the Minister of State on it. We would not want to see a particular sporting code or sporting pursuit fall by the wayside or fall through the cracks because some other sporting pursuit possibly has more muscle or more educated people behind its applications. I hope I am using appropriate language. I take great encouragement from what the Minister of State has outlined and I look forward to working with him on it into the future.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I do not need an answer. I am okay.
