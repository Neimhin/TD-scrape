AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I had intended to raise a separate issue but most Members of the House would agree that everything is overshadowed by the events in Manchester. Like other Members I ask you, a Chathaoirligh, to express the Seanad's condolences with the people of Britain, the Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, and the newly elected Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham. It is difficult to come to terms with what happened last night and to find an adequate response. Unfortunately, when something so hateful and evil occurs the response can often be one of hate. While there has been a massive outpouring of love and compassion among the ordinary, decent people of Manchester there were, unfortunately, sentiments of hate swirling around and trying to capitalise on this event to once again dehumanise and denigrate an entire faith and decent people living in Britain. It was the Irish who once bombed Manchester and people in this country stood with the people of Manchester at that time, so it is important to do so now in the face of this appalling tragedy. Anybody in this House or in Ireland who knows a young person who has ever attended a concert can only weep at the thought of the scenes that were witnessed by the young people. Those who have survived will have flashes of imagery going through their minds for the rest of their lives. It will not leave them, so how do we fight back as has been suggested? What we must have in our armoury, as Senator McDowell so eloquently put it, is information and knowledge, as well as compassion, love and a belief that in unity and understanding we can create a society that can overcome these things. Again, we stand in solidarity with the people of Manchester. We must not allow those of a certain political persuasion to use this event for their own narrow ends to denigrate an entire people or faith in the UK. There are also people in this jurisdiction who will use this for their own ends as well. We are better than that. We are a proud and decent people. It is only through compassion, love and understanding that this terrorism will be defeated.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Who is the new Minister for Justice?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is an open goal.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is very welcome to the Chamber. I am a huge believer in and defender of public service broadcasting, and in general I am supportive of what RTE does in that regard. I would be critical of it in my remarks purely because I have such high expectations for the standard of broadcasting RTE gives to this country. I agree with what Senator Dolan said about diversity because I want to speak to diversity in terms of RTE's programming. I believe RTE needs to take the gender equality issue more seriously.We must address the issue of all-male panels. It is sometimes very difficult to have a handle on how best to promote diversity among presenters of various shows, as the BBC has done. Panel presenters, who are the face of Ireland and RTE, are still predominantly white. This has to be addressed. While it may be challenging to address in terms of various ethnic backgrounds, it is not as challenging to address the gender issue. It is still really unacceptable that a number of panels, be it in political programming or sports programming, are so dominated by men. No matter what a programme is about, having six, seven or even more men discussing it just has to end. I have often been on panels and mentioned that it was an all-male discussion. The researchers often say they did their best. It is not good enough any more to say one did one's best. The practice of having all-male discussions has to be terminated. The issues of gender equality and having role models in our national broadcaster must be addressed such that young Irish children from diverse backgrounds, be they Irish-Polish, Irish-Nigerian or Irish Traveller, can say, "That person reflects who I am." The national broadcaster should proactively seek presenters who are the face of this country and regularly give opportunities to express viewpoints. A creeping issue concerning some of our political programming, particularly our flagship programming, is our giving of platforms to people whom I would describe as little more than cartoon racists. I do not understand why flagship political programmes in RTE feel the need, in order to have entertainment value and ignite a row, to give a platform to dangerous people with dangerous viewpoints and no political mandate at all. Sometimes they are shipped in from abroad. These are people whose nastiness and vitriol are likely to have a very damaging effect on Irish society, yet they are given a platform for the purpose of ratings. I do not expect much from other broadcasters but I do expect a lot more from RTE. If "Claire Byrne Live" or the "The Late Late Show" are to give a platform to a cartoon racist, a comic-book racist, we have to call it out. It is not good enough. It may be good for ratings but it is not good for society. The Minister needs to be very clear on that.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is definitely the case.
