AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Tomorrow, the Second Stage debate on the Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill is being debated, yet amendments have to be submitted by tomorrow morning before the Second Stage debate. We believe that contradicts Standing Order 182. On that basis, the Second Stage debate is a nonsense if amendments have to be submitted before the Second Stage debate. It is an extremely important Bill which the Labour Party wants to support, but it is problematic in parts. In order for it to pass successfully through the Oireachtas things have to be done right, but we are not doing that. I ask that the Office of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Office of the Ceann Comhairle assist us in doing legislation properly. Asking people to submit amendments before a Second Stage debate is not doing legislation properly.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	If the offices of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or Ceann Comhairle could assist in that regard, it would be greatly appreciated.
