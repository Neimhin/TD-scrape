AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It was the absence of a hard border.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I want to-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I second Senator McDowell's proposed amendment to the Order of Business. I join with others in commiserating with the family of Mícheál Ó Súilleabháin who brought great joy to everybody in this land and I commiserate with those in California who are waking up to the news of the death of 12 people in a nightclub in another tragic shooting. I also second the proposal of Senator Ruane that we have a debate in this House on the national drugs strategy but the main point I want to make today if the Leader could-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is important.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I just want to formally support what Senator Ruane said. I raise the matter of a secondary school in Kildare. It would be greatly appreciated if the Leader could pass on my comments to the Minister for Education and Skills because my capacity to raise this with him formally between now and next Tuesday is limited. A High Court case has been taken by a contractor regarding the tender process which means that whatever buildings that St. Paul's in Monasterevin is hoping to get built could be delayed and Councillor Mark Wall in Kildare is concerned about this.I know the Minister is extremely busy with the school building issue at the moment but it appears this school has been waiting for 15 years for rebuilding works. This issue is now in the High Court and, potentially, it is going to delay this much needed and anticipated building work. I ask the Leader to impress upon the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, the importance of this issue and to communicate with me in whatever way possible on St. Paul's secondary school in Monasterevin.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The issue is about the workers, as opposed to it being a political football.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach did that.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We never blamed the workers.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It suits the narrative of a right-wing lunatic who uses this culture to blame workers on the front line in the health service.
