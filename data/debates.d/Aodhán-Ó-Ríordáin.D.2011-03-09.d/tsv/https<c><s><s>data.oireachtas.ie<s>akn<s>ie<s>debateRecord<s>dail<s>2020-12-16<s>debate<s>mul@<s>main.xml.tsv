AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	When I came back into the Dáil and took on the responsibility of speaking on housing matters for our spokesperson, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, I felt like I was walking into a dressing room where everybody knew each other for years and I just had to get to know the dynamics. I have other responsibilities in this Oireachtas in terms of education, enterprise and trade but I am taken aback because, as Deputy Ó Broin said, tomorrow we break up for Christmas and we have to deal with this extensive piece of legislation which is so crucial to so many lives. As the Minister is aware, we had a debate only last night on the causes of homelessness. It appears to me from speaking to Senator Moynihan that two Bills have been wedged together: a residential tenancies Bill has been wedged into a planning and development Bill in order to deal with two issues at the one time. The Minister has decided not to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny. Without that, I agree with my colleague, Deputy Ó Broin, that our ability to provide the type of scrutiny that is needed for these far-reaching measures that are incredibly important to the daily lives of citizens has been curtailed. I can hear the Minister's voice as an Opposition spokesperson in previous years.If he was still the Opposition spokesperson for his party and a Minister walked in and tried to do this the week before Christmas, I am quite sure the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, would say the very same thing - that it is too much in too short a time. The people who need this Bill are so vulnerable that we must do this right. We have put down amendments in good faith around a sunset clause etc. and the onerous process. Is it the intention of the Minister or the knee-jerk intention of departmental officials for this to be overly onerous on the tenant at all times? We will speak to this on various different amendments as we go through the evening. The Minister has done many things since taking office that we have been quite pleased with. He has engaged with my party in a constructive way with the rent-to-buy scheme that I have raised with the Minister and we hope to get some progress on that. He took that on board as something he could work with. We applauded the Minister's move on co-living arrangements, and I made a statement on that a number of weeks ago. Last night he made a contribution in not opposing the Bill from the Opposition; that was also constructive. Many of the initiatives he has taken appear to be getting somewhere, and all of us want that. This is crucial for the people who sent us here. It really feels that at this hour and this date, we are not doing the matter justice with the manner in which it is being presented to us. We have our amendments and we will try to work with the Minister on them and improve the Bill as we go through it. In saying that, I must contend that the manner in which this is being done is less than satisfactory.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I do not intend to use all my allotted time as there are many amendments we wish to discuss on Committee Stage. As Deputy Ó Broin stated, this is not really the way we should be doing business. The Labour Party has no issue with the motion as proposed, but to present the House with the emergency-type rationale the Minister has given for the Bill is not good enough. I commented previously that it seems to be two Bills wedged into one. As a legislative body and a Parliament, we must be equipped with the time to scrutinise Bills in a proper fashion. When a Minister comes to the House and apologises for the lack of time but explains that there is an emergency nature to the legislation, the Government did not realise how important it was, and then expects Deputies to screech in here and the Bill to be passed immediately, it leads Members to believe that we are not giving the Bill the scrutiny and deference it deserves. Any Bill that comes before the Oireachtas needs to undergo such a level of scrutiny. On that basis, I do not intend to make a long-winded contribution. The Labour Party accepts the rationale behind the motion, but to deal with such complex matters on the second-last sitting day before the Christmas break leaves a lot to be desired. These issues have such significant implications for people who are in housing need, as well as for the democratic process of the development plan. I repeat that if the Minister were a member of the Opposition, he would be saying the exact same thing I am saying.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We have gone from J.P. McManus to Karl Marx in a single leap. While I support the other amendments, I want to speak to amendment No. 7 because we want to ensure this is not a long-lasting provision within the Act. To make reference to what has been said already, the development plan is effectively the constitution of the city or county in which one lives. There is often an underappreciation on the part of the citizens of that city or county of how significant it is. The Minister will know that one of the few functions of real power a councillor has is to rezone land. The development plan is the overarching plan for a city, within which it is very difficult to get a planning application, or it is what planners in each individual county or city will refer to when granting planning permission. I did not intend to make a political point but I will make one anyway. If we go back through the history of the State to when there were tribunals of inquiry into the grubby dealings of backhanders and brown envelopes and all the rest of it, at the heart of that whole dynamic was the development plan of the city or county in question. My party was never involved in such dealings but that was what broke an awful lot of people's confidence in the political system because councillors were taking bribes to vote in a particular way in order to rezone land. I know the Minister agrees with me on my next point. The Act relating to strategic housing developments has taken much of this planning out of the councils' remit. Any development of more than 100 units goes straight to An Bord Pleanála and it does not have to adhere as strictly to the development plan. The Minister and others mentioned judicial reviews. Often the only recourse communities have is to go to the High Court to seek a judicial review, if they have the money. Not every community has the money or the means to go to the High Court and seek a judicial review on the basis of a decision made by An Bord Pleanála, unless it has a very high chance of success. The repercussions for a community or someone's own pocket are huge if that review does not go well. I have been involved in two such reviews and both of them were relatively successful. My point is about the sanctity of the development plan. All citizens must understand how incredibly important it is. It is also about that essential democratic link which so often happens at council level. The Minister knows this as he has served on a county council himself. So many powers are vested in the executives. The executives have so much power and councillors often complain about the lack of powers they have. There is an essential democratic connection between individual citizens and the councillors they elected to craft this development plan and to stand over it. That is the context in which planning permissions are given because it was the councillors elected by the people who formulated the plan and they are the only ones who get to rezone or sell land. That consultation, knowledge and power, and the empowerment of the public to know that, is absolutely essential. We cannot demand of any council official, council employee or council worker to put his or her health or life at risk during a pandemic in order to do what has always been done. We accept that. However, there must be an understanding within the Act that this is an emergency measure that will come to an end and that the Minister will do that by order. There must be a given date after which this practice of Zoom meetings and so on will no longer be expected. We have to absolutely accept the essential connectivity of democratically elected councillors and the sacred trust they have from the people in crafting something that is based on that trust and not on an envelope of money they may have gotten in a pub. That has happened in the past and powers have been stripped from councillors and elected officials because of that practice but this is an essential function of theirs. The importance of the development plan and its process has to be something every single citizen understands inasmuch as they possibly can. I acknowledge that the Minister is against the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 and wants to see the back of it. When legislation like that, which overrides the development plan, comes in we have to try to explain to elected councillors at public meetings that because a development has over 100 units it does not go to the council or the planners who know the dynamics of the area and who have to adhere to the development plan. It goes to An Bord Pleanála, which is an independent planning board and the only recourse people have if they want to do something about it is to take a High Court case. We all represent areas with planners and legal people living in them who do these things and have this expertise. If someone lives in an area of disadvantage, a developer can come in and override the process by sticking in a planning application for over 100 units, which goes straight to An Bord Pleanála. If An Bord Pleanála gives permission, the only recourse the community has is to go to the High Court. It must have the money to do that and that is the democratic deficit within this. One needs the money to go the High Court and if people do not have it they are not going to get anywhere. That has always been my major objection to the Act relating to strategic housing developments, because it meant communities were locked out of their say and their proper representation at the planning stage. Without elongating my speech as others have, and without getting down and dirty on the rights or otherwise of tax exiles, who we would rather just paid their taxes and helped us all get through this pandemic rather than picking and choosing their own pet projects in the places they are from-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----it is important that we get back to the reason we are here, which is to defend democracy and defend that essential link between individual citizens and the people they elect to oversee the development plans of a city and a county.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 7:In page 4, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:“(2) The amendment effected by subsection (1) shall continue in operation until the date specified by order under section 251A(4) of the Principal Act.”.
