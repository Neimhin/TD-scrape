AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the witnesses to today's meeting. On the suicide issue, I am afraid that if people have come here to argue that suicide as a risk to the life of a mother should not be in this legislation, then there are here under a false premise. We have to legislate for the threat of suicide to the life of a mother because that is the very basis of the X case for which we are legislating. The Constitution states under Article 34.4. 6°, "The decision of the Supreme Court shall in all cases be final and conclusive." We have had two referenda to underwrite and stand over that decision made in 1992. We have to legislate for suicide. The discussion we are having here is not whether or not we legislate for suicide but how best that can be done. I want to make sure the delegations answer my following question. They are here to lobby politicians. What type of lobbying do all those present believe is appropriate and inappropriate when lobbying politicians on this particular issue?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the witnesses. Yesterday Dr. Simon Mills presented a draft Bill which he felt we could work from in legislating for the X case. His Bill included a section on fatal foetal abnormality and he suggested that it would be constitutional to make such a provision. He also included a section on conscientious objection, which was part of the original British abortion law in the 1960s. I ask the witnesses their views on that. As I asked the anti-abortion groups about lobbying in the interest of balance, it is only fair that I ask the witnesses currently before us what they consider to be appropriate lobbying of Deputies and Senators on this issue.
