AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We can refer them on.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This comes from the same crowd that redirected to the Iona Institute's website.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	If one reads what can be found at that link, one can compare it with the record of the House.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The issue of conscientious objection is dealt with comprehensively in the Bill but as Senator Bacik has said, if we are to envisage a situation where a woman is in a room with a doctor and she is distraught and in clear need of a service available as legislated for and as voted for by the people of this country, are we really going to focus our attention on what the doctor is feeling rather than on the woman? Is that the intent of these amendments? Surely at this stage in our development as a republic, in that very troubling, traumatic and deeply distressing situation the woman and her needs should, first and foremost, be our focus. I find it ironic in the extreme that a facade of Christianity is placed over the whole idea of conscientious objection because it is coming from the same stable that would refuse the rights of teachers to conscientious objection when they are asked at interview if they will uphold the religious ethos of the school. We can be very sure their chances of advancement in the teaching profession will be really stunted if they were to suggest they have a conscientious objection to what they are being asked by a board of management or a principal.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The child to which Senator Mullen referred is mine. I will say this much about my daughter, thank God she has been born in this year in order that in years to come she will live within an ideology of care and compassion for women, not the judgmental views of Senators such as Mullen and Ó Domhnaill which would send her across the waves for the care that she needs, feeling like a criminal. Thankfully, in this year we have had a referendum andare passing legislation that brings her closer to being an equal citizen in this republic, not a second-class citizen which those Senators would have her remain.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I second the amendment.
