AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Many of the questions have been asked, but if the Minister does not mind, I will go over a few points again about Aer Lingus, the stimulus and the potential merger of Coillte and Bord na Móna. Instinctively, I welcome the decision on Aer Lingus. The Minister said that at the moment optimal conditions do not exist for a sale of the Government's remaining shareholding. Deputy Humphreys spoke about the competition considerations, and we want to maximise its value in time but in terms of influencing commercial policy at Aer Lingus, surely a 25% share is effectively useless.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is a shame that the vast bulk of the discussion today has focused not on what we are trying to invest in in terms of the job creation measures and the stimulus. That is the nub of the issue, and it is a success story that we are not selling off assets just to shift the debt but to reinvest in the economy. The Minister referred to traditional investments. They seem to be quite construction heavy. I heard that at the height of the boom approximately 18% of the economy was based around the construction industry. It has collapsed to around 3%. The figure for the average economy is 7%. Will the Minister expand on the investments that will be made? How would he respond to the suggestion that they are construction heavy and that perhaps they should go into other areas? He mentioned Ireland being a potential wind energy exporter.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Would the Minister expand on the comment he made earlier about the potential for Ireland being a major exporter of energy?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This is my final question, and I thank the Minister for his answers. The potential merger between Coillte and Bord na Móna sounds like an arduous process. Am I wrong about that? Will it not be that problematic?
