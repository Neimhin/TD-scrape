AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will speak along similar lines to Deputy Maloney.  We are all in agreement that what we are being asked to do is a pretty obnoxious deed.  Nobody would pretend that what we are being asked to do is fair, right and just and would happen under any circumstances other than those in which we find ourselves today.  I have heard much about septic tanks today but we are effectively talking about what was and still is in many people's minds a septic bank.  When this period of history is written in 50 or 100 years, Anglo Irish Bank will be written all over it.I know to my cost and that of the community which first politicised me in the Dublin docklands what Anglo Irish Bank was all about.  There is a little school there where I worked and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority promised it a new building.  Two members of Anglo Irish Bank were on the board of that authority.  This was only three or four years ago but people should remember the magic dust that these people sprinkled on this country, which was incredible.  One could not, in all seriousness, question anything that these big developers, builders and businessmen were doing.  Everything seemed wonderful and they kept their businesses ramped up.  The Glass Bottle Company site in Ringsend was identified as an ideal site and the authority became involved in a partnership with a third party development, funded by Anglo Irish Bank.  Some €400 million was spent on the Glass Bottle Company site and it is now worth €34 million.  The promissory note my school got for a new school building went up in dust, and for the foreseeable future it is condemned to an 1840s-era building.Many people have been betrayed by the bank and the crazy attitudes surrounding it.  It goes against everything I know to be just or right to stand in the Parliament like this and speak in favour of what we are doing.  As Deputy Maloney has quite rightly said, I know we are effectively talking about putting a €30 billion promissory note process on the table in the hope that we win €1.25 billion, all the while understanding that we have €147 billion of ECB money in our banking system.  I do not gamble.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Even somebody like me would know that gamble is not worth the risk.  We may lose this battle on the €1.25 billion, and it is right and just that we in this Chamber at every opportunity have the right to discuss the process.  Payments like this should not happen without having a proper discussion or debate through the likes of a private Member's motion.  That is the way Parliament should work and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue.  This is something about which the public will want a very tight explanation.  Unfortunately, we have little more to say than that we do not think it worth the gamble.Effectively, we are looking at a process of working with our European partners on something that is much more valuable, which is deconstructing the promissory note and changing it so we get some real change for this country.  What would happen if we defaulted on this or previous payments?  The European Central Bank, ECB, might have found it interesting as it has €110 billion in the Irish banking system at 1%, and it may have increased the interest rate.  What would happen in that case and how could it be explained to the people who are rightly protesting and want to know what on Earth the Government is doing?This is something we inherited and it is not of our making.  Nobody in this Chamber would agree that this is the fault of the Fine Gael-Labour Administration.  We are dealing with the issue as we find it, although we are not happy about it.  The bigger game is the €30 billion figure, and I am not somebody willing to win a battle to lose a war.  We should be careful about the information we send to our constituents when we are, correctly, discussing this payment to the unsecured and unguaranteed Anglo Irish Bank bondholders.
