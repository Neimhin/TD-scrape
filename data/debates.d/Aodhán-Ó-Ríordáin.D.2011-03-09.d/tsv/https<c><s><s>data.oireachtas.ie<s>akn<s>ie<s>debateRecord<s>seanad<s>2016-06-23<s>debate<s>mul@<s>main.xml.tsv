AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister of State and wish her well in her endeavours. It is a positive to have a Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy with the background she has, that she has no other responsibilities and that this issue will be her main focus. The Bill arises from the High Court case of March 2015. We have, therefore, been waiting for this legislation for over a year. I agree with Senator Lynn Ruane's overall remarks that this legislation flies in the face of what every other western democracy seems to be moving towards - decriminalising the addict and the user and focusing attention on the pusher and those who benefit and profit from the drugs trade. I do not believe having legislation that criminalises someone for possession of an illegal substance does anything for that individual. In the debate I have heard words such as "zombies". Other words are used in media to describe people with an addiction. A number of months ago two individuals died from a heroin overdose within a couple of hundred yards of each other, one in the toilets of Connolly Station, while the other, a man, was found after being exposed to the open air for a number of nights. They did not make the news. There was no march, petition, public outcry or media interest. At some level collectively, we seem to have decided that addicts are the authors of their own misfortune and, therefore, that their deaths are somehow self-inflicted. If we continue with that narrative, we are destined to repeat the failures of the past. I do not believe it should be a criminal offence for a person to be caught in possession of something to which he or she is addicted. That is a waste of Garda time. I also do not believe this legislation should separate the issue of injecting centres. In my previous role as Minister of State with responsibility for this area, I felt I had gone a long way down the road towards getting cross-party agreement on the part of the Bill relating to injecting centres. It had been passed by the Cabinet and was due to be included in the Bill. With the best will in the world, I do not understand why it has been separated to be dealt with at a later stage. It does not make any sense. My suspicion is that the responsibility of the Government to react to the High Court case of March 2015 is foremost in the minds of those in the Department, the Minister of State and the Government and that any progressive, forward-thinking way of tackling the drugs issue has to take second place. I am concerned and hope the Minister of State can dampen these concerns and reassure me that the Government will give the same priority to the injecting centre model as it is to this legislation. However, it is very disappointing that the issue has been separated it out. If we reinforce what we have always done, we will always get what we have always had. People have always taken drugs and it is quite likely that they always will. To demonise and criminalise someone with an addiction problem is, in many respects, to criminalise marginalisation. A disproportionate number of those who engage in drug misuse come from areas of social disadvantage and are people with disabilities, members of the LGBT community, migrants and Travellers. Statistically, it can be proved that the further people are disconnected from the mainstream of Irish society, the more likely they are to be sucked into addiction. When we criminalise the possession of substances for personal use to feed a drug misuse habit and an addiction, we are criminalising marginalisation. That is effectively what we are doing. I invite the Minister of State to go to the drug court, if she has not done so already. It is a good initiative with limited success. Effectively, what one sees there is a bunch of sick people sitting in a courtroom. Sick people do not belong in a courtroom; they belong in a medical facility. It is pointless in the extreme to continually suggest the solution to the drugs problem in Ireland is a criminal justice one. It is not; it is a health solution. We will eventually come to the conclusion that what has been done in Portugal is a much more humane and potentially successful approach because it puts the needs of the addict at the centre of public policy and does not dehumanise him or her by using words such as "zombie" or terminology that others in the media use openly and without censure, effectively categorising him or her as being little more than junk. While my party and I are happy to see the Bill progress to Committee Stage, I am disappointed at the separating out of injecting centres. This move feeds my suspicion that the commitment to them is not as strong within the Government as it was in the previous one, notwithstanding the Minister of State's personal commitment to deal with the issue. I have no difficulty with controlling substances and continuing to control substances that are causing intense harm. However, if we continue to criminalise the possession of substances to which people are addicted, because their bodies are crying out for them, we will continue along the road that has led to so much hurt. There were 679 drug and alcohol-related deaths in Ireland in 2013. Not all of them were drug-related. Many were traffic related and many were suicides. Everybody in this Chamber should ask why he or she did not hear about the two individuals who had died from a heroin overdose in a toilet in a train station and a few hundred yards away on Foley Street only three months ago. It may be because we continually blame the person who is the victim.
