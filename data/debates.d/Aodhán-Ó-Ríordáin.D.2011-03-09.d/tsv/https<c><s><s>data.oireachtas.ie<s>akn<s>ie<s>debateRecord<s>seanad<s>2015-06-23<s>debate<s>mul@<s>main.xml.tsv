AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who apologises for not being here as he is at a Cabinet meeting. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for overall policy and the funding of the national roads programme. The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads are matters for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts,1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual national road projects are matters for the NRA in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act. The NRA is responsible for deciding on the annual allocations to individual road authorities.Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer. Given the national financial position, there have been very large reductions in roads expenditure in recent years. Funding in 2008 was €2.3 billion, while funding this year is approximately €730 million for the national, regional and local road network. The reality is that the available funds do not match the amount of work that could be undertaken. For that reason it is not possible to progress a range of worthwhile projects and the main focus must be on the maintenance and repair of roads together with a safety focused minor works programme. For now, only a small number of new national road projects are being progressed to construction stage. I understand the planned road improvement scheme for Slane was originally progressed as a single carriageway scheme; however, the feasibility study for the N2 route recommended a dual carriageway for the Slane bypass. The proposed scheme which was approximately 3.5 km in length and would pass to the east of Slane village was submitted to An Bord Pleanála for approval. The grounds for the refusal of permission for the bypass in 2012 included the fact that An Bord Pleanála was not convinced that all possible traffic management alternatives had been fully explored. Statutory responsibility for traffic management rests with the local authority and following An Bord Pleanála's decision, Meath County Council, in liaison with the NRA, began evaluating traffic management options. The most recent Slane traffic management review
was undertaken by Halcrow Barry on behalf of the council and published in February this year. It is a matter for Meath County Council to liaise with the NRA in relation to how best to proceed at this point. The Roads Act 2015 provides for pre-planning consultation with An Bord Pleanála, and given An Bord Pleanála's previous decision to refuse permission it would seem to make sense for Meath County Council to initiate such discussions. There is no escaping the reality of limited resources and the indications are that funding will remain tight for the coming years. While the Minister has, he hopes, stabilised the funding position, the scope for any new improvement projects depends on the availability of additional capital funding in the future. Once the new capital plan is published the Minister will assess what can be done to address particular bottlenecks taking into account development consent requirements.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will relay those comments directly back to the Minister. I appreciate the Senator's contribution on the matter.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	As the Deputy will be aware, the role of the policing authority will be to oversee the performance by An Garda Síochána of its functions relating to policing services. An Garda Síochána is also the security service for the State and the Garda Commissioner will continue to be accountable to the Government in respect of national security. This is, I understand, generally in line with a broad consensus within this House that security matters should not be within the remit of the authority. The Bill provides that, in the event of a disagreement between the authority and the Garda Commissioner, the Minister will decide whether a matter is a policing matter or a security matter. The Minister has considered the amendments carefully and she is of the view that, given that the security of the State is a priority function of the Government, the task of deciding whether an item relates to policing or security matters should be undertaken by the Minister for Justice and Equality in her or his capacity as a member of the Government. Overall, it is important to bear in mind that the Bill contains a definition of what constitutes security services in order that the scope of the authority's remit can be properly delineated. Under proposed section 44, the authority will, in performing its functions, have regard to the importance of the functions of An Garda Síochána concerning security services. In the circumstances, the Minister believes the scope for disagreements between the authority and the Garda Commissioner as to whether a particular item is a security matter or a policing matter will be quite limited. In addition, discussions to resolve any difficulty will undoubtedly take place between the authority and the Garda Commissioner before any issue is referred to the Minister. Moreover, the Minister has asked me to emphasise that, before making any decision as to whether a policing matter or security matter is involved, a Minister will be required to act impartially. As Senators will be aware, a number of important security related matters are already dealt with by the Minister, including authorising the interception of communications. I also understand the approach adopted in the Bill is in line with similar arrangements that have been made in Northern Ireland and Scotland regarding security matters. In the circumstances, the Minister considers that the measures for dealing with the relevant concerns in the Bill are appropriate. Accordingly, I ask the Senator not to press the amendments.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The purpose of the amendments is to provide for the repeal of existing legislative provisions relating to An Garda Síochána that are now spent. This is a tidying-up exercise that has been undertaken in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh has already outlined the purpose and scope of his amendments and I do not propose to cover the same ground in detail. The effect of the amendments would be, in particular, to remove from the Government, the Minister for Justice and Equality in particular, any role in the appointment or dismissal of members of An Garda Síochána. Obviously, the main area of attention with regard to the Senator's amendments must be his proposals in respect of the most senior Garda ranks, and my response will focus primarily on those ranks. Before discussing the proposals on the appointment and dismissal of senior Garda personnel, however, it is crucial to bear in mind that there are a number of very significant contextual matters that must be fully taken into account. The first and most important of these matters is that, in this jurisdiction, all our legislation must be fully compatible with the Constitution. The last thing any Member of this House would wish is a serious constitutional question mark hanging over any legislation. In that connection, I draw the attention of Senators to Article 28.2 of the Constitution which specifically provides for the Executive power of the State to be exercised by or on the authority of the Government. In the course of the drafting of the Bill senior counsel provided legal advice for the Office of the Attorney General on the applicability of Article 28.2 with regard to legislative proposals which were being considered for inclusion in the Bill. This was a process in which written legal advices were supplied and in them senior counsel indicated clearly that, as a matter of custom, practice and proper constitutional interpretation, the function of An Garda Síochána in the exercise of the policing power of the State has been interpreted by the courts as a function that is exercised as part of the Executive power of the State. In that regard, while the senior counsel acknowledged that an Executive power of the Government under Article 28.2 could be delegated, he also stated it would not be constitutionally permissible for such a delegation to amount to an abdication of the Government's Executive power.Within this framework senior counsel specifically referred to the appointment and dismissal of the Garda Commissioner and his conclusion was that any legislative proposal related to the establishment of a policing authority should preserve, ultimately, the power of the Government to appoint or dismiss the Garda Commissioner. As Senators will appreciate, to address the relevant constitutional concerns, the advice of senior counsel is reflected in the provisions of the Bill. Given the importance of their functions, a similar approach has been adopted in the case of deputy commissioners.  When considering the Senators' amendments, it is also necessary to take account of the fact that An Garda Síochána is a security service for the State. Senators will be aware that under the Bill the Garda Commissioner will continue to be accountable to the Government in respect of national security. This is an approach that has a wide measure of support within the Oireachtas. It goes without saying that national security is a key function of the Government. The Minister's view, leaving aside the very clear constitutional dimension involved, is that the appointment of the head of the national security service should be undertaken by a body other than the Government. To put the matter at its simplest, in view of the functions involved, the final appointing decision must rest with the Government. For similar reasons, the Minister is satisfied that the Government must continue to have the capacity to remove senior Garda members on security grounds. While there are other issues I might raise regarding the Senators' amendments, at this juncture I should concentrate on the functions being conferred on the policing authority by the Bill in the appointment and removal of Garda personnel. Under the Bill, the authority will have a leading role in determining a large body of Garda appointments. This will operate, in particular, at the very highest levels of the Garda organisation and the authority will also have general functions in Garda appointments and promotions. With regard to the Garda Commissioner or a deputy commissioner, all future appointments to these posts will be made solely on the basis of a nomination made by the policing authority, following a selection process undertaken by the Public Appointments Service. In exceptional circumstances, where the Government is unable for significant reasons to accept a nomination made by the authority, it will have to state its reasons. Where this occurs the Government will be obliged to ask the authority to nominate another person for the position. From an international perspective, it is very much the general practice that governments either make or must approve top level police appointments. For example, while the Chief Constable is appointed by the Northern Ireland Policing Board, the appointment must be approved by the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice. Similar arrangements are in place in Scotland where a police authority has recently been established. In the case of Garda personnel, between the ranks of superintendent and assistant commissioner, the Bill provides that all appointments will be made directly by the policing authority. Additionally, the authority will appoint persons to positions within the Garda civilian staff which are equivalent to or above the rank of chief superintendent.  Regarding dismissals and in line with the constitutional and security principles I have outlined, the Garda Commissioner or a deputy commissioner will be removed by the Government. At the same time, the policing authority will have the power to recommend to the Government that a Garda Commissioner or a deputy commissioner be removed for policing reasons. While the Government will not be obliged to adopt such a recommendation, it is very difficult to envisage circumstances in which it would not do so. Dismissals of persons between the ranks of superintendent and assistant commissioner for policing reasons will be undertaken by the authority. It will also be able to suspend a person from duty in advance of a removal decision. While the Senators' amendments would go beyond the appointment and dismissal of Garda personnel, the Minister wishes to make it clear that the overall approach adopted to the Bill by the Government is that relevant functions should be transferred from the Government and the Minister to the policing authority where this is permissible and appropriate. However, the transfer process has its limitations and has to be undertaken against the general constitutional and policy backgrounds I have highlighted. Within these frameworks the Minister could not accept a situation, as proposed in the amendments, where the Minister for Justice and Equality, for substantial legal and policy reasons, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, for budgetary reasons, would not be involved in determining the numbers of persons to be appointed to senior Garda ranks. Overall, the Minister appreciates that the approach of the Senators in the amendments is to remove what they perceive to be a system in which key elements could be the subject of political considerations. However, as I have indicated, the Minister believes the significant reforms and measures provided for in the Bill are fully adequate to address concerns they might reasonably have. In particular, substantial powers are being conferred on the new policing authority which will be independent in the exercise of its functions. Before I conclude on these amendments, I reiterate the earlier statement made by the Minister in the House that the proposals made in the Bill for the establishment of the independent policing authority will play a vital role in ensuring public confidence is maintained in An Garda Síochána and the essential services it provides. Moreover, as I have indicated, they have been developed to address very important constitutional and policy requirements that arise within both the policing and security areas. Unfortunately, for the reasons I have given, the amendments do not meet these requirements and as such the Minister is not in a position to accept them. Accordingly, I ask the Senators not to press them.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Under the Bill, the policing authority will oversee the exercise of An Garda Síochána's policing functions. As I have outlined to the House under earlier amendments, the drafting of the Bill has proceeded in conjunction with ongoing legal advice provided by senior counsel to the Office of the Attorney General. This was done to ensure the functions of the authority would be fully consistent with the exercise by the Government of the executive power of the State under Article 28.2 of the Constitution. As I have indicated, in practical terms, there are constitutional limitations on the extent to which it is open to the Oireachtas, by way of legislation, to delegate the Government's ultimate power over policing to another body. A key element of the approach the Government has been advised and legally compelled to adopt is to avoid any suggestion the ultimate capacity of the Government to intervene in the policing sphere might be unconstitutionally restricted. The three areas covered by the Senator's amendments are the setting of priorities for policing within the State, the approval of the three-yearly strategy statement for the Garda organisation and the adoption of the annual Garda policing plan.For the purpose of addressing the amendments, I do not propose to enter into a detailed discussion of what is involved in each of these areas. However, it is clear, on any analysis, that we are talking about a set of very significant functions. The setting of priorities for An Garda Síochána is a matter of the highest importance in determining how gardaí operate in carrying out their functions throughout the country. These priorities, in turn, feed into Garda strategy statements and annual policing plans which play a vital role in directing gardaí. Furthermore, they are pivotal in terms of the allocation of financial and other resources throughout the Garda organisation. In view of the importance of the functions involved and on the basis of legal advice provided by senior counsel, the Minister is satisfied that it would not be appropriate for final decisions to be taken by the policing authority in the matters covered by the Senator's amendments. For that reason, the Bill provides that the areas in question will be subject to a co-decision procedure with the authority, which will involve approval being given by the Minister. In the circumstances, the Minister considers the approach adopted in the Bill to be the correct one. Moreover, it is my understanding that similar arrangements apply in other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland and Scotland. Accordingly, the Minister is not in a position to accept the amendments.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I cannot comment on why the GRA did not speak before the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. The current arrangements for the issuing of directives to the Garda Commissioner by the Minister are to be found in section 25 of the principal Act. In particular, Government approval is required before any directive can be issued. Where a directive is issued, it must, except in certain cases relating to sensitive matters, be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. Section 23 of the Bill amends the current provision in the principal Act to enable the policing authority to recommend to the Minister that a directive on a specific matter relating to policing services be issued to the Garda Commissioner. This provision recognises there may be circumstances in which the authority considers Government or ministerial intervention is appropriate in a particular instance. As I outlined to the House on other amendments proposed by the Senator, there are constitutional limitations on the extent to which it is open to the Oireachtas, by way of legislation, to delegate the Government's ultimate control over policing to another body. Having considered the relevant legal advice provided by senior counsel on the application of Article 28.2 of the Constitution, the Minister believes there would be constitutional difficulties in seeking to enable the authority solely to direct the Garda Commissioner on policing matters. The effect of the Senator's amendment would be to give the authority capacity to issue a directive "concerning any matter relating to the Garda Síochána" without prior Government approval. Under the amendment, the authority would be in a position to issue a directive to the Garda Commissioner on a security matter, for instance, even though such matter would not fall within the remit of its functions.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Section 38 of the principal Act makes provision for the Garda Commissioner to authorise the installation and operation of closed circuit television schemes in public places for the sole or primary purpose of securing public order and safety in public places, by facilitating the deterrence, prevention, detection and prosecution of offences. In the development of the principal Act, section 38 was given particular consideration in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. In the course of advice provided by that office, it was indicated that the operation of CCTV schemes under the principal Act would fall directly within the executive function of the State within Article 28.2 of the Constitution. Accordingly, for the constitutional reasons I have explained in connection with previous amendments, specific roles were provided by the Government and the Minister in section 38. In part, these roles were intended to ensure that CCTV schemes would operate with due respect and safeguards for the constitutional right to privacy. Section 31 enables the authority to perform the functions currently exercised by the Minister relating to community CCTV schemes. In particular, the authority will, by order made with the approval of the Government, establish applicable criteria for the purposes of community CCTV schemes. Moreover, it may, with the consent of the Minister, issue guidelines to the Garda Commissioner relating to the supervision and control by the Commissioner of the monitoring of CCTV by authorised persons. The effect of the Senator's amendment would be to remove any role for the Government and the Minister under the section. Acceptance of the amendments, therefore, would prevent the Government and the Minister from exercising their constitutional functions. In all the circumstances, the Minister is satisfied that the provisions enable the authority to exercise an appropriate level of oversight in respect of CCTV schemes while not impinging on the constitutional functions of the Minister and the Government. In the circumstances, it is regretted that the amendments cannot be accepted and I call on the Senator to withdraw them.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The wording sought to be deleted by the amendment is concerned with the terms and conditions of the members of the Garda audit committee. They are standard provisions found in many statutes. The fixing of such terms and conditions is an administrative rather than a core oversight function. It is the standard practice that the terms and conditions of State appointees such as the members of an audit committee would be agreed with the relevant Minister and the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform. In the circumstances, the Minister is calling on the Senator to consider withdrawing the amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	A key aim of the Government in establishing the authority is to provide a system of oversight of An Garda Síochána that is effective and fully independent. In this context, the Government is of the clear view that the membership of the authority should not include serving politicians, and the Bill provides that they will be ineligible to be members. I recognise that the Senator's amendments are related to a further proposed amendment that will not be discussed. However, the Minister would have serious concerns with any proposal to remove the ineligibility provisions which prevent politicians from serving on the authority. As I have indicated, this would run counter to the firm policy of the Government. The approach of the Government to this matter is to remove the operation of the authority from the political arena. At the same time it is important to bear in mind that it will be open to committees of the Oireachtas to raise relevant matters directly with members of the authority. I understand the Senator's overall approach is based to some extent on the system applicable to the Northern Ireland Policing Board which has 19 members, comprising ten political members and nine independent members appointed by the Minister with responsibility for justice. However, the Minister believes the composition of the Northern Ireland Policing Board must be viewed in the context of the specific requirements in the North for cross-party and cross-community support for the policing arrangements in that jurisdiction. It is relevant to note that in its report published in October 2014 the joint Oireachtas committee recommended that the Scottish model would be appropriate for our jurisdiction. The legislation for the Scottish authority specifically prohibits serving politicians from membership. In the circumstances, the Minister is inviting the Senator to withdraw the amendments.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am aware that the general scheme of the Bill provided that the authority would monitor and address human rights compliance by An Garda Síochána in policing matters. However, this element was subsequently removed from the Bill prior to publication so as to avoid duplication of the functions of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC. Senators will be aware that the IHREC is the primary State body which oversees and monitors Garda human rights and equality compliance. It is also important to make it clear that the authority will, in accordance with its general supervisory powers, have the ability to pursue human rights policing matters directly with An Garda Síochána. This could be done in different ways and, for example, such issues could be raised in the public meetings it will hold with the Garda Commissioner. In addition, under a new section which is being inserted by section 44 of the Bill, the authority will be in a position to liaise closely with the IHREC. Within this framework the Minister has no doubt that there will be close co-operation between the two bodies and that they will work together very effectively. I might also mention that human rights is a key organisational priority for An Garda Síochána. For example, section 16 of the 2005 Act provides a revised form of declaration for persons joining the force which specifically directs each new member to have regard for human rights in carrying out their policing duties; a Garda declaration of professional values and ethical standards, which underpins all Garda practice, policy and procedure, has been published and distributed to each member; all operational Garda directives make reference to the human rights principles applicable to the relevant instruction so as to remind all members of their human rights obligations; the new trainee programme for Garda recruits - BA in applied policing programme - and ongoing professional development measures for members incorporates specific human rights training; and the Garda Commissioner receives advice from the strategic human rights
advisory committee
on the ongoing development of human rights policies within An Garda Síochána. As well as policing expertise, the committee includes representatives from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, Amnesty International and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. In the circumstances, the Minister considers that fully adequate provision has been made in order to ensure human rights compliance by and within An Garda Síochána. I ask the Senator to not to press the amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The effect of this amendment would be to remove the requirement for the consent of the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform where the authority is seeking to enter into contracts with persons or appoint consultants. The requirement for ministerial consent is a standard requirement in such circumstances and it is an important aspect of good governance. As the relevant arrangements that have been made in the Bill are in line with the established procedures for State bodies, the Minister is not in a position to accept the amendment. In the circumstances, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The purpose of these amendments is to make provision for a chief executive designate of the authority and they have been introduced in consultation with the chairperson designate. They are also in line with the statutory procedures that have been adopted for other State agencies. Senators will be aware that I am making arrangements for the authority to operate in shadow format pending the enactment and commencement of the legislation. This is a process that is specifically provided for in the Bill. Arrangements are being made with the Public Appointments Service for the selection of the ordinary members designate. It is also proposed that the chief executive will be in place as quickly as possible following a selection process to be undertaken by the Public Appointments Service. It is important that in the event that the selection of the chief executive by the Public Appointments Service is completed before the commencement of the legislation, the person selected will be in a position to operate as a chief executive designate. This will significantly facilitate the preparations for the establishment of the authority. The authority will formally appoint a chief executive designate as the chief executive, following the establishment day. Amendments Nos 75 and 76 make this possible. Amendments Nos. 77 to 84 are technical and consequential on amendments 75 and 76. They operate to re-number subsections (2) to (9).
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Senators will recall that among the provisions of the Garda Síochána (Amendment) Act 2015 was a provision inserting a new section 102B into the principal Act which brought the Garda Commissioner within the scope of GSOC investigations for the first time. This was a significant development and one to which the Government attaches a high degree of importance. The issue of Ministerial consent to GSOC carrying out an investigation into the conduct of the Garda Commissioner was debated during the passage of the 2015 Act through the Houses. Under the provisions of the Act the consent of the Minister is required before a complaint against the Commissioner is investigated by GSOC. In this regard, it must be borne in mind that in addition to carrying out her general policing functions, the Garda Commissioner is the head of the national security service. In the latter role the Commissioner fulfils a vital role which is very closely linked to the obligations of the Government to preserve the security of the State. After careful consideration the Government was satisfied that taking account of the key position of the Commissioner in security matters, the Minister should consent to any proposed investigation by GSOC into any concerns that the Garda Commissioner may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would constitute serious misconduct.However, the Minister would emphasise that, as proposed in the Bill, the requirement for ministerial consent does not simply permit the Minister to refuse to give consent - there must be reasons for doing so. This is spelled out in proposed subsection (3)(a) which states the Minister must provide reasons to the authority where he or she refuses to consent to the authority making a request to GSOC. In these circumstances, there is no doubt that it would only be in exceptional cases that the Minister would not consent to a proposed investigation. Accordingly, the Minister considers that it is almost impossible to envisage any circumstances under which, on foot of a demonstrable concern that the Garda Commissioner may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would constitute serious misconduct, ministerial consent would be withheld. While the Minister appreciates the concerns that have prompted the Senator's proposed amendment, she does not believe they are necessary for the reasons I have indicated. In the circumstances, the Minister asks the Senator to consider withdrawing the amendments.
