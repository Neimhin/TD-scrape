AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Finlay and Ms Tinsley for their presentation.  I read their interesting presentation and fully agree with much of what they have said.  I am a great believer that poverty is a thief and education is the great liberator.  I will make a few comments on which I seek the perspective of our guests.On the literacy strategy, which is welcome, I accept the criticism that it does not sufficiently target or engage parents.  We should work towards the development of an adult literacy policy that encompasses every strand of the education system.  It was interesting to learn during our meeting with representatives of FÁS that, despite working with many young people who have literacy problems, the organisation does not have an adult literacy strategy.  The five policies which every primary school must have in place do not include an adult literacy strategy.  If primary schools were required to have a policy on engaging with the parent body and wider community, it could be judged, inspected and updated.  Unfortunately, they are not required to have such a policy in place.  Will Mr. Finlay and Ms Tinsley comment on that proposal?I agree with the comments made about Mountjoy Prison.  I visited the prison last week and literacy levels in it are extremely low.  Whereas 35% of the prison population is actively engaged in educational programmes, an already low figure, the figure in Mountjoy Prison is only 15%.On the programmes operated by Barnardos, educational support should commence nine months before birth, as it were.  I concur with the comments on the issue of pre-school education.  My experience as a school principal in a disadvantaged area is that from the moment one meets four year old children one can identify which of them will have challenges and which of them will not.  This can be done on the basis of their demeanour, whether they have been fed and are rested and how well they are presented.  A number of reports have shown that when compared to a child from a more affluent area with a less challenging background, a four year old child in a disadvantaged school who comes from a challenging background will start school with a gap to make up.  This essential gap, which is clear at the age of four years, will remain even though the progress of the children in question through the education system may be the same.  There is, therefore, a combination of what happens in the education system and what happened before the child entered mainstream education.The Young Ballymun organisation had a conference recently which showed that the problem with our education system, as currently structured, is that there is a direct contradiction, if one likes, between the amount of funding we put into pre-school education versus the impact it has.  We must address the anomaly whereby most funding is allocated to educational programmes in later years where it has little impact.  The comments of the representatives on that issue would be appreciated.What is the balance of support versus empowerment?  I agree with the comments on children going to school hungry.  Our school and other schools and principals with whom I have discussed the issue say they provide a homework club and a breakfast club but there must be a mechanism within this to empower parents at some stage to take on that responsibility.  Where is the balance between empowering the parents to do it and a child going to school hungry?  It should be easy to ascertain.In some isolated circumstances there may be a family who say the children get their breakfast in school and they do their homework in school.  Surely the best outcome would be that a parent would be empowered to deliver those services in their own home.  How does one strike that balance when the alternative is to leave a child potentially hungry or without homework provision?In regard to educational supports, a delegation on special education needs appeared before the committee recently and said it did not accept my criticism about the general allocation model which I have always considered benefits richer schools rather than smaller schools.  Nor did it accept my criticism about SNAs and the fact that those schools who have access to private psychological reports tend to get a larger allocation of SNAs.In respect of the National Educational Welfare Board, the position of four and five year old children who are absent from school is being reviewed.  That a ten year old child who has missed 50 days gets more attention from the NEWB and the education welfare officer than a four year old child who has missed 100 days is incredible.  However, that is the system as of now and it has to change.  If a child is within the education system, the carrot and stick must follow him or her.I tabled a parliamentary question recently on the back to school allowance.  Given the anomaly in the system whereby €7.96 million is spent on two and three year olds who are not attending school, is it correct that we would have a back-to-school allowance for those children?  Could the fund be better targeted and, perhaps, administered through schools?  Would the representatives welcome the school administering such a support?On the question of preschool, particularly in disadvantaged communities, the issue is the balance between empowerment and support.  Many young parents who are engaged in helping preschool community-based initiatives are well-meaning and do their best but are not equipped to target the fundamental literacy and educational issues that are required in those circumstances.  Many of those involved are CE participants.  Again, it is the balance between empowering young parents who may never have been involved in formal employment and are now involved in an educational setting but do not have the essential skills to benefit the child.  In many of these circumstances, the balance between what benefits the child and what benefits the worker has gone the wrong way.
