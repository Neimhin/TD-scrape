AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In relation to the welcome basic income scheme for those in the arts, those in receipt of disability supports are concerned that if they avail of this scheme they will lose supports that are currently available to them. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, shed some light on that for me?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State. I am intrigued by that response. It is quite comprehensive. As the Minister of State was going through it, I was not sure whether we were going to a space where the Minister was working on it. Towards the end of the response, it appeared the Minister of State outlined the Minister is aware of the issue and is working on it but he seemed to indicate that there is not an issue. However, there may be individual cases which the grand sweep of what the Minister is trying to achieve will not cover. I ask the Minister of State to outline to the House that somebody in receipt of disability support will be classed as a self-employed person and on that basis, he or she should not have any concerns about losing whatever supports he or she has. As the Minister of State can appreciate, the arts are about giving license to those who have tensions within their lives to express them and if we are excluding those with disabilities from this scheme, then that will be a major disadvantage, not only for them but for the wider Irish society. I am intrigued to get more detail on the Minister of State's response. It appears to be welcome.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This scheme in general is extremely welcome. There will always be issues, but this is a big one if one is a person with a disability and one is expressing oneself through artistic means and one may be locked out of the scheme. What I am hearing from the Minister of State is that he is aware of this, that he is meeting and engaging, that he is engaging with the Department and that this is going to be resolved both on a wide basis and on an individual basis. If that is the case, those who are listening to this debate will be comforted by that. I want to be absolutely clear that this issue has been recognised, that the Minister is aware of it and is working it out with the Department and those who represent artists with disabilities and that it will be resolved on a project basis and on an individual basis.
