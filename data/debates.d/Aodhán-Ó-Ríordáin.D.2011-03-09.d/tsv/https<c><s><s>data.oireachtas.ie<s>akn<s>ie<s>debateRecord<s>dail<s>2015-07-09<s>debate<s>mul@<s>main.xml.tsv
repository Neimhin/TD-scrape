AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Health	2011-03-09	None	The national drugs rehabilitation implementation committee, chaired by the HSE, has developed a national drugs rehabilitation framework. As Deputy O'Sullivan is aware, people in recovery have complex needs and may require multiple interventions from a range of agencies to assist them in their recovery. The aim of the framework is to provide a continuum of care for the recovering drug user through promoting a more integrated and person-centred approach to rehabilitation based on shared care planning. The roll-out of the framework is currently being advanced through the HSE's addiction services and the local and regional drug and alcohol task forces. An evaluation of the framework, which was piloted in ten sites during 2013, found that both service users and the agencies involved in service provision, expressed a high level of enthusiasm for the framework. Those participating generally agreed that the objectives of the framework could be achieved if all agencies were committed to inter-agency working. The committee has developed national protocols under the framework to facilitate inter-agency co-operation. In addition, competency-based training is currently being designed which focuses on key working and care planning. The intention is to provide training to treatment providers and relevant agencies in 12 task force areas by the end of the year, with the remainder to receive training next year. As Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I am leading the development of a new national drugs strategy after 2016. The process will involve a comprehensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public on the current national drugs policy and future priorities. This will provide an opportunity to ensure that our strategic approach into the future continues to be firmly focused on recovery. I have also asked my Department to examine the feasibility of utilising social impact bonds as a funding model to improve both treatment and rehabilitation service outcomes. The outcome of this work will inform decisions as to the viability of this approach to maximising the social benefits which the national drugs strategy seeks to achieve.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate what the Deputy has said. We had an interesting conversation at the North Inner City Drugs Task Force. I have visited various drugs task forces around the country, particularly in the Dublin area, since my appointment to this post. I share the Deputy's concern about how this situation is changing, in that it is worsening and becoming more acute in certain parts of the country and among certain age cohorts. Today I will take part in a discussion at a joint meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the issue of decriminalisation of drugs, on which the justice committee wants to initiate a public consultation. In that, I have a lengthy contribution to make in regard to many of the issues the Deputy has raised. I am also proposing to have a conference at the end of this month in the Mansion House, with the new Lord Mayor of Dublin, in order to bring together the drugs task forces and people who are working in this sector, because I do not consider that I can wait for the review of the national drugs strategy in order to get a proper snapshot in time as to the nature of the problem we have in Ireland at the moment. That is on 29 July, and I would appreciate the Deputy's attendance and input into that conference.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I agree with everything the Deputy has said. In regard to controlled substances, I found quite disturbing what Inspector Des McTiernan of the inner city drugs task force had to say about the mother who told him it would be almost impossible for him to convince her child to get a minimum wage job in Dunnes when there is €1,000 a week to be made selling certain substances on the street corners of the inner city. We have a misuse of drugs Bill in front of the House this year and we can use that vehicle to address many of the issues the Deputy has raised. Certainly, the prevention and education element is crucial. We have to get away from the idea of victim blaming of young people who have inherited this problem that we have passed on to them. We have to have a more expansive idea of how we can engage and connect with young people. The schools system is part of that, but it is not the whole answer because children and young people do not live in schools and are influenced by many of the things that happen around them.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy McEntee for raising this important issue. The importance of early detection of cancer is fully accepted by Government. Population-based screening programmes are an important element of early detection and have been introduced for cancers in Ireland where international evidence supports this approach. At present, available evidence has given rise to population-based screening programmes being recommended for bowel, breast and cervical cancer and such programmes have been introduced here. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a prostate cancer screening programme. Instead, the focus is on the early detection of such cancers through rapid access clinics that have been established in the eight designated cancer centres. These clinics provide access to early diagnosis and multidisciplinary decision-making for prostate cancer, with patients who are deemed to be at higher risk being fast-tracked to the clinics. Men referred to these prostate clinics undergo comprehensive assessment, with appropriate imaging and biopsies. Apart from non-melanoma skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in Ireland. In recent years, the rapid access prostate clinics have seen between 2,400 and 2,800 men annually. Approximately 1,300 of these patients each year have had a diagnosis of a prostate cancer, a diagnosis rate of 40%. It is vital, therefore, that men are aware of the symptoms of prostate diseases and present early to their GP. The Deputy's comments about the reluctance of men to do this sometimes are well made. Last month my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, launched clinical guidelines on the diagnosis, staging and treatment of patients with prostate cancer. These guidelines, which were approved by the national clinical effectiveness committee, represent a significant step forward in dealing with prostate cancer in Ireland. Survival from cancer has improved markedly in recent years and is expected to increase further when the long-term effects of the reforms in cancer care under the current cancer strategy, including screening programmes, impact more fully. However, it is predicted that the total number of cancer cases will rise in the coming years, with better diagnosis combined with an increasing, and aging, population. The Department of Health is currently working on the development of a national cancer strategy to provide the focus for cancer control for the next decade. A steering group has been established to inform this work. The Department of Health is currently running a public consultation process on the new strategy and I would encourage individuals, organisations and Members of this House to contribute to the process before the closing date of 24 July.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On the consultation process on the new national cancer strategy, I would encourage individuals and organisations the Deputy might know to contribute to that process before the closing date of 24 July. The Department of Health and the national screening service in the HSE will continue to review emerging international evidence on screening, including any developments that arise in relation to prostate cancer. The final point I would make is that any man who has a concern about possible prostate cancer should seek the advice of his GP, who will, where necessary, refer him to a rapid access clinic. I take on board the points made by the Deputy.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am aware of reports that NAMA is seeking buyers for the loans it holds in respect of the commercial entity that owns the Dublin central development site that includes the national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street. Contrary to the impression being created by some of those reports, the fact is that it is loans and not properties for which NAMA is seeking expressions of interest. I am concerned that an entirely false picture is being painted about the sale of the national monument itself. It is being sold. However, the buyer is the State and not some banker or venture capitalist, the State that will safeguard and restore it to how it was in 1916, and the State that will develop a 1916 commemorative centre on the site as a solemn and fitting tribute to the 1916 leaders who held their final war council meeting there. This decision by the Government was made to bring the national monument into public ownership, secure its long-term future and complete the development of the proposed 1916 commemorative centre as quickly as possible. The Government's decision will not in any way be affected, delayed or otherwise impinged upon by any disposal of NAMA's loan books. The national monument site is being removed from the NAMA portfolio sale.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	As part of the transfer of ownership to the State, all loans will be discharged over the monument site and all necessary licences and wayleaves will be put in place to carry out the national monument works. I want to be as clear as I can in the hope that it will dispel the attempt at confusion and uncertainty that has always been the hallmark of certain parties that seem to be more anxious for nothing to happen than to see the monument properly restored and opened to the public. At the risk of repeating myself, the position is that the acquisition of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on behalf of the State is in progress and will, I expect, be completed shortly. What is more, the Minister made this clear in the House in the past two weeks in answer to several parliamentary questions from Deputy McLellan. This is the clearest possible demonstration of the Government's commitment to acknowledge and mark the historical importance of the site in a positive and substantive way and to guarantee, secure and safeguard the long-term future of this historical landmark. The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is actively engaged with the monument owners and other relevant parties to conclude the transfer of the property into State ownership as quickly as possible. This process is nearing completion. In common parlance, the sale is agreed. The Minister is also considering the best way to restore the buildings in order for the commemorative centre, the plans for which are being developed in consultation with the 1916 Relatives Association, to open at the earliest possible date. The Minister has informed the House on innumerable occasions that her functions in this case arise from the preservation order that was placed in 2007 on Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street under the National Monuments Acts with the objective of protecting No. 16 as the site of the final council of war and final headquarters of the leaders of the 1916 Rising. The acquisition and restoration of the monument buildings by the State for the people is the clearest possible statement of how seriously the Government has taken this objective. The commemorative centre to be housed in the restored monument buildings will be developed and run as a public facility that will enhance and complement the 1916 visitor facility being developed in the GPO from where the insurgents retreated to the Moore Street buildings. I look forward to it being completed and to seeing the public going through the doors in the centenary year of the most momentous events in our country's history.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I wish to emphasise that the Minister has no function in the operations of NAMA and has no role in the disposal of its loans or assets. The Minister's involvement in the Moore Street issue, as she has made clear countless times, arises from the preservation order that was placed in 2007 on Nos. 14 to 17 under the National Monuments Acts.Any plans or proposals for the wider area outside the confines of the national monument are the responsibility of Dublin City Council as the planning authority. Redevelopment plans for the area have received full planning permission from An Bord Pleanála. The properties around the national monument are in private ownership. They are not subject to the Minister's remit under the National Monuments Acts. The historical significance of the fundamentally intact building at No. 16 as the final headquarters of the 1916 Rising was the determining factor when the decision was taken to make the preservation order. These buildings are the only substantially authentic, original and intact pre-1916 buildings on the street. They are the only buildings that retain significant original elements that would have been there in 1916, including staircases, partitions, plaster work, doors, floors, fittings and fixtures. Above all, Nos. 14 to 17 also contain the physical evidence of the presence of the insurgents in the form of the openings broken through party walls as they tunnelled their way up the street. All of these elements are being retained, secured and permanently safeguarded as a result of the Government's decision to assume ownership of the national monument. The Minister is pressing ahead as speedily as possible to acquire the site, carry out the restoration work and have the 1916 commemorative centre open to the public. I wish I had a better timeline for the Deputies, but I do not. I look forward to the day work gets started on the Moore Street project. All of our citizens can look forward with pride to the day it opens its doors to welcome the public as a fitting testament to the men and women of 1916 and what they fought for. There are more discussions to be had, not least with the traders who occupy the street and do their daily business there. Subject to agreement, we hope to have a wrap going around those four buildings in the very near future. This will be a solid indication of the Government's intention to establish a lasting monument to the sacrifices of those who fought that week and had their final meetings in this historic building.
