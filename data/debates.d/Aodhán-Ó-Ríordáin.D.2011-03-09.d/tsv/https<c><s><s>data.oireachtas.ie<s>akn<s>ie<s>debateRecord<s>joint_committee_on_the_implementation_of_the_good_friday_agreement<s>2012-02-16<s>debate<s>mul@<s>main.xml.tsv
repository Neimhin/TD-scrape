AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the panel for its presentation and excellent work.  I acknowledge those in the Gallery who have an interest in this field, some of whom have suffered a great deal.  I can think of nothing worse than losing a loved one and not having the finality of a burial.I was taken by the sensitivity with which the presentation was made.  I wish to ask about the criteria the commission uses to investigate cases.  Nine of the 16 cases listed have been resolved satisfactorily.  The panel might not be in a position to answer my question, but are there families who do not accept the commission's criteria as regards the use of evidence and further criminal investigations?  There could be other cases of disappeared persons that do not fall under the commission's remit.  The bulk of the seven outstanding cases date from the early 1970s.  As the years go by, how more difficult does an investigation get in terms of the people who have information and the deterioration of remains?  If the commission is to last for another ten, 15 or 20 years, will longer periods impact on its work?One case seems to involve work based in France.  What level of co-operation has the commission had with other jurisdictions?Unfortunately, I must ask a question that we always ask about funding, given the current economic situation in Ireland and the UK.  As the commission's work is important and sensitive, I hope that its funding and access to resources have not been impacted negatively.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Murray might not be in a position to answer this question.  Are there other cases, possibly outside his remit, in which the families are not comfortable with the idea of leaving aside a criminal investigation?
