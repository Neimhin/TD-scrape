AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	As stressed strongly by my ministerial colleagues in the debate on the counter motion last evening, the fundamental philosophy of the Government has been to improve the lives of people and protect the most vulnerable, while at the same time creating conditions that will allow the economy to grow in order that the curse of unemployment, inherited from the previous Government, is lifted from the people. The debate is timely in reminding ourselves what has happened in terms of how the economy has been turned around and what the Government has done to protect the most vulnerable during the crisis and how it has brought forward measures to reduce inequality during that period. The Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to the well-being of lower-paid workers. On taking office, it restored the national minimum wage from €7.65 to €8.65. It introduced legislation to restore the joint labour committee system and enacted the Temporary Agency Workers Bill 2012 to protect temporary agency workers. It provided collective representation rights for retirees in terms of access to trustees to ensure their collective voice would be heard when the trustees were considering amendments to a particular scheme. Having returned the economy to sustainable growth through transformational policies implemented on the twin tracks of An Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work, the Government is determined to ensure the benefits of the recovery are felt by all in society, both nationally and regionally. Making work pay, enhancing dignity at work and reducing inequality are cornerstones of the Government's agenda. Its commitment to pursue an extensive industrial relations and employment rights reform agenda continues. We have established the Low Pay Commission to make annual recommendations to the Government on the national minimum wage and related matters. The commission will report to it within the next 12 weeks. We are introducing legislation to provide a revised legislative framework to replace REAs. This legislation will be published within the next few weeks. We are conducting a study of the prevalence of zero-hour and low-hour contracts and their impact on employees. The study will be completed as a matter of priority and the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, will act quickly on foot of the report. As regards collective bargaining, a focus of the debate last night, the Government has approved the drafting of legislation to reform the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001. It will provide for an improved and constitutionally robust industrial relations framework that will provide greater clarity for employers. It will ensure that, where an employer chooses not to engage in collective bargaining, either with a trade union or an internal excepted body, the 2001 Act will be remediated to ensure there is an effective means for a union, on behalf of members in that employment, to have disputed remuneration, terms and conditions assessed against relevant comparators and determined by the Labour Court, if necessary. Such a determination will be enforceable in the Circuit Court. In addition - this issue was raised last night by Members on the Opposition side - the legislation will contain strong anti-victimisation provisions to protect workers who may believe they are being victimised for exercising their rights under it, including the introduction of interim relief against unfair dismissal. Given the concerns expressed last night, the Government looks forward to receiving the full support of the House in moving these measures along, as they are part of its dignity at work agenda. It is clear that the Government is succeeding in turning the economy around and improving the lives of citizens. Unemployment is down to 10%. Almost 90,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first action plan for jobs in 2012 and the increase has been in full-time rather than casual or temporary jobs. It is also clear that the Government has demonstrated its commitment to maintaining and improving employment rights, as well as reforming and enhancing both the industrial relations institutions of the State and the industrial relations framework utilised by workers and employers. I acknowledge those who have made positive contributions to the debate on the motion. The Government intends to press ahead with its programme of work with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable workers. It will be seeking the support of the House to ensure the key legislative measures to which I have referred can be passed into law in the months ahead.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. As he will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of personnel among the Garda regions, divisions and districts. Garda management keeps this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources. The Deputy will be aware that the Government is committed to resourcing An Garda Síochána. Restarting recruitment was a key priority and we started to deliver on this last September with the first recruitment of new gardaí since 2009. From September 2014 to the end of this year, the number of new recruits entering Templemore will total 550. I assure the Deputy that the Minister is in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner regarding the overall response to the problem of anti­social behaviour. A key priority for the Garda is to tackle public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities to reduce this type of behaviour and to enhance community safety. This approach includes a strong focus on quality-of-life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti­social behaviour. A range of strong legislative provisions is in place. These include measures under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. The Garda has powers to deal with anti-social conduct that is attributable to excessive drinking, including through exclusion orders in respect of premises and closure orders in respect of licensed premises and catering outlets. The Deputy alluded to one such premises in Mullingar. In addition, gardaí have powers to seize alcohol to forestall public disorder or damage to property or where a person is under age. Where anti-social behaviour is directed at property, the Criminal Damage Act 1991 provides for a range of offences and penalties, including imprisonment for a term of up to ten years upon conviction. The existing provisions provide the Garda with a wide range of powers to deal with offences associated with anti-social behaviour, including juvenile and adult cautions, fixed-charge penalty notices and the bringing of prosecutions. There are also provisions under the Criminal Justice Act 2006 for civil proceedings in respect of anti-social behaviour by adults and specific provisions dealing with anti-social behaviour by children. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour. In engaging with the Garda Commissioner on these issues, the Minister has asked her whether there are further legislative options we might consider that would be of assistance to the Garda. We are actively considering legislative measures.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to read between the lines of what the Deputy is saying. It seems to me he is touching on rather dangerous ground if he is attempting to pit one community against another. We must be very careful as to how we describe issues within communities. If we set out to address anti-social behaviour purely as a policing issue, then we miss the point almost entirely. As I said in my reply, An Garda Síochána and other agencies are constantly working on strategies to empower communities. Where anti-social behaviour occurs, it is clear evidence that there already has been a failure right across the board. I had a meeting this morning with representatives of YoungBallymun to discuss the advancement of the area-based child poverty, ABC, initiative, with which the Deputy will be familiar from his work as party spokesperson on children. The whole point of that programme is to empower parents and communities to look more profoundly at the issues that affect them, including issues around parenting and advancements in education. If the only response from parliamentarians to anti-social behaviour is a legislative or policing one, that is to miss the point. Of course we must be strong in defending our streets and towns against anti-social behaviour, but working out the reason that behaviour is happening is often the more difficult question to answer. That is why policy makers often shirk from answering it. We need to investigate more deeply why these incidents take place. In my own constituency there are instances of endemic anti-social behaviour. We can put 100, 200 or 300 gardaí out patrolling estates and they may deter some people from engaging in such behaviour, but the incentive to engage in it is still there. We must ask ourselves why that is the case. Why are young men and women from certain backgrounds and in certain areas not getting enough empowerment from mainstream society? Why are they seeking empowerment through these types of activities? I take the Deputy's points very seriously. I am sure he is anxious, as am I, to hear what the Garda Commissioner has to say in response to the approaches the Minister has made to her. However, I would caution anybody against moving potentially onto dangerous ground by pitting one community against another.
