AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	My first question on retrospective recapitalisation has already been discussed.  The Minister indicated that the situation has changed since the statement of June 2012 but where stands that statement?  Does it remain the basis for his negotiations?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister previously spoke about how our situation has changed and stated that our debt is perceived to be more sustainable, even though the interest repayment on the bank portion of our debt is €1.6 billion
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Many people would take the view that it is not sustainable.  To return to my main point, the Government is holding fast to the statement of June 2012.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The European Commission statement warned the Government about raising false expectations of tax cuts and spending increases.  Does the Minister want to comment on that?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	My final point is the financial transaction tax, FTT, which I raise as often as I can.  At the last ECOFIN meeting, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne raised the possibility of taking a legal challenge against the imposition of the FTT, and Ireland is not going to support him in that.  Approximately a year ago we had a conversation here with Patrick Honohan, who seemed to have softened his approach to the FTT.  He felt circumstances had changed and that it would not have as detrimental an effect as previously perceived.  The argument is that we would not support it if the UK did not support it, and that the UK would not support it if New York did not support it.  Is that still our view, or has it changed?
