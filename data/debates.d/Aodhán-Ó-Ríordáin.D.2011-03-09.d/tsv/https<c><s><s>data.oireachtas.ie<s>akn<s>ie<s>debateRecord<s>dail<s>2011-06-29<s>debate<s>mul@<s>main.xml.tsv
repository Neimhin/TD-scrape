AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the opportunity to raise this matter.I first refer to the commitment given in the programme for Government, which states: "We will initiate a detailed legal review of the basis, structures and governance of the Red Cross in Ireland to improve its functioning in the light of changing circumstances."  Serious concerns and questions have been raised about alleged abuses of power, misgovernance and misuse of financial resources in the Irish Red Cross Society for over 20 years, yet the State unquestioningly gives it an annual grant of nearly €1 million.  The OPW also provides the IRC with its head office at 16 Merrion Square effectively free of charge.  In comparison, the budget of Irish Aid has been cut by 8% since late 2008, while the IRC has suffered no cut whatsoever.Concerns about misuse of power and financial irregularities in the IRC have been raised by staff, board members, media and politicians for over 20 years.  There was a surge in revelations in 2009 and 2010 following an intensive media campaign and the decision by Noel Wardick, former head of the international department at the IRC, to go public with his concerns.  Mr. Wardick spent four years trying to have the matters addressed internally — all, unfortunately, to no avail.  Mr. Wardick was fired for gross misconduct in November 2010 under the charge of breaking his confidentiality agreement.  This is yet another example of an employee reporting serious concerns in good faith and in the public interest and suffering serious employer reprisal.  Seven months later, Mr. Wardick remains unemployed.  Transparency International Ireland has called for whistleblowing legislation to include provisions allowing for criminal prosecutions to be taken against employers who take retaliatory action against whistleblowers who report the truth in good faith.  It would have been easier for Mr. Wardick to remain silent.In the past, the Government has always taken a hands-off approach to questions raised about the integrity of IRC actions, despite appointing its chairman and 16 members of its central council and despite the presence of a Department of Defence official on the IRC governing executive committee.  It appears that Governments have been happy to involve themselves in absolutely every aspect of IRC operations except those relating to governance reform, financial irregularities and abuse of power.The Minster will be aware of the scandal regarding the undeclared Tipperary bank account which was found to have €162,000 intended for the victims of the 2004 Asian tsunami lying in it for over three years.  The organisation's vice chairman was a signatory on the account.  The matter was swept under the carpet despite the resignation of the then honorary secretary in protest over the society's failure to investigate the matter.  She formally wrote to the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, and was effectively ignored.  An internal investigation was carried out in late 2010 but despite the identification of major breaches of financial policy and certain actions deemed as "a threat to IRC governance", no one was held to account or blamed.  Nothing has changed.  The signatory on the aforementioned account, the society's vice chairman, Tony Lawlor, was re-appointed as vice chairman in May 2011 for the 21st year in a row.  The treasurer, Ted Noonan, who failed to investigate the matter at the time, was re-appointed in May this year to the board for the tenth year running.The IRC made substantial operating losses in 2008 and 2009.  It broke even in 2010 only because more than €600,000 intended for Haiti was recorded as domestic income.  This is a practice that has apparently gone on for years within the IRC and is morally reprehensible.  In reality, the society made a large operational loss in 2010, yet it still managed to pay its secretary general €165,000 and spend €140,000 on legal fees in trying to silence Mr. Wardick, including legal suits against Google and UPC.Any independent examination of media reports, industrial relations hearings and parliamentary questions over the past 20 years will bear out the fact that the IRC is a highly dysfunctional organisation with real and serious questions to answer about its financial affairs.  Since 2007, the IRC has had four secretaries general, which is a clear sign of the problems that remain unresolved in the society.The so-called new IRC constitution is also deeply flawed and is designed to ensure those in power remain in power for many years to come.  I believe there was minimal organisation-wide consultation on its drafting and it must not be approved by the Government or enshrined in legislation without significant amendment.  The Minister has said he is in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General with regard to the legal review, as outlined in the programme for Government.  There is a real worry that the Minister will use the new legislation to enshrine the new IRC constitution into law, which will in effect secure the power bases of the long-serving, discredited incumbents, which is exactly what they are hoping for.The IRC is not obliged to report separately, in financial or narrative form, on its €1 million Government grant.  It appears as a one-line income and expenditure item in its audited accounts.  The Government basically gives the grant annually to the IRC and thereafter washes its hands of its responsibilities.  Based on the evidence to date, all the information now in the public domain and the real concerns that exist inside and outside this House, the Minister must seriously consider withholding the annual grant of €1 million and review its donation of free property to the IRC for use as its headquarters until such time as a comprehensive independent investigation into the society takes place and is concluded.
