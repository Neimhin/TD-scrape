AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I am pleased to present the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill 2015 on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who is unavoidably detained on other important business.  The Bill aims to tackle persistent offenders charged with multiple offences of burglary of homes. It will enhance the provisions for refusal of bail in appropriate cases and provide for consecutive sentencing for repeat offenders. Burglary is an invasive upsetting crime which is not simply about theft or property. When it occurs in the home it strikes at our peace of mind in the one place where we should feel most secure. Article 40.5 of the Constitution highlights the importance of the home, "The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law". The courts have long recognised that the burglary of a person's home is an egregious crime. In his judgment in the 2006 case of DPP v. Barnes, Mr. Justice Hardiman stated, "The offence of burglary committed in a dwellinghouse is in every instance an act of aggression, an attack on the personal rights of the citizen as well as a public crime and is a violation of him or her." On account of her concern about a rise in the number of domestic burglaries, the Minister initiated a review of the response of the criminal justice system to the problem. The review examined legislation, the management of prolific offenders, policing and crime prevention. It involved the Garda Commissioner, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service. The Minister has been consistent in her view that serious and serial offenders must continue to be imprisoned in appropriate cases. Public safety is of paramount importance. However, it is equally clear that imprisonment is only part of the solution. Locking people up and forgetting about them is not an effective way to reduce reoffending or protect communities and reduce victimisation. The review highlighted the fact that a large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders. Senators will be aware that approximately 25% of offenders are responsible for 75% of property offences. There is also evidence of a high rate of recidivism for burglary. Data from the 2013 Irish Prison Service recidivism study shows a rate of over 79% among persons imprisoned for burglary and related offences. Data from the 2008 to 2013 Probation Service recidivism study shows a recidivism rate of 49% among persons engaging with the Probation Service for burglary and related offences. These are the highest rates for any offence group. Offenders pass through the hands of the Garda, the courts, the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service. The criminal justice system cannot be effective if it is disjointed. The Minister is keen to ensure it handles offenders in a co-ordinated way from beginning to end. Last week the Minister launched the joint agency response to crime initiative, JARC, an inter-agency response to the management and rehabilitation of offenders. It involves the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service and An Garda Síochána working in collaboration with statutory, community and voluntary partners. The JARC strategy aims to target those recidivist offenders responsible for the majority of crime. To reduce crime and enhance public safety, the nominated prolific offenders will be managed through the co-ordination and integration of policy, practice and research between the organisations. It makes sense that by targeting identified prolific offenders with such cross-cutting initiatives, which address their criminal behaviour and the harm it does, crime will be reduced and public safety increased. The people concerned require a specific programme in the community if they are to make better choices. In this context, targeting the relatively small group of repeat burglars has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence of burglary and the harm it causes throughout the country.In addition to a more co-ordinated approach to offender management, the review I referred to identified two key problems which can be tackled by legislation. One relates to repeat offenders who are granted bail despite being charged with multiple burglaries and who often commit further burglaries while on bail. The other relates to the fact that relatively short sentences can be imposed by the courts when multiple burglary offences are taken into account. This Bill will address these problems. Of course, before one can prosecute or manage offenders, one has to respond to burglaries and investigate them. Tackling crime and burglaries remains a top priority for the Government and An Garda Síochána. Operation Thor, a new multi-strand, national, anti-crime and anti-burglary operation was recently launched by the Garda Commissioner. An extra allocation of more than €5 million has been committed by the Government to support Operation Thor, which entails a broad range of activities to tackle crime, particularly burglaries, in urban and rural communities nationwide. These include additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased use of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of high-powered vehicles by the armed regional response units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce reoffending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign; targeted crime prevention advice for local communities; and enhanced supports for victims. Since Operation Thor commenced last month, there has been a range of arrests and persons have been charged as part of planned operations. These include arrests in Dublin, Dundalk, Cavan, Dunboyne, Mullingar and Birr, as well as a large-scale search of 12 locations in the Limerick area as part of a targeted operation against organised crime groups in which drugs and firearms were also seized. The Minister expects to receive ongoing reports on the impact of the operation throughout the country. Special targeted patrols have been implemented with the assistance of Garda national support services against criminal groups. These arrangements have also targeted the use of motorways by criminal gangs and have contributed to the arrest of a number of high-priority suspects. It is also important to note that the sustained Garda response under the previous Operation Fiacla has produced many successes in disrupting those involved in this type of criminal activity. As of 31 August 2015, Operation Fiacla had led to 14,381 arrests, with 8,181 persons charged. The everyday tasks of An Garda Síochána and the specialist operations all have to be resourced. The Government has prioritised investment in the Garda and all aspects of its work. More than €34 million has been invested in new Garda vehicles since 2012, with more than 640 new vehicles coming onstream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units. The Government's capital plan for 2016 to 2021 provides for a further €46 million of investment in vehicles, as well as the recently authorised allocation of €1.8 million for the replacement and upgrade of equipment on the Garda fixed-wing aircraft. The capital plan contains an additional €205 million for Garda ICT systems and technology. This will bring overall Garda ICT funding to €330 million over the lifetime of the capital plan. A few weeks ago, the Minister, together with the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, Deputy Simon Harris, announced details of the Garda building and refurbishment programme, which includes more than €60 million of Exchequer funding as part of the Government capital plan for 2016 to 2021, as well as a major public private partnership project. Last month the Minister commenced the DNA legislation that saw the launch of a new state-of-the-art DNA database system, based in Forensic Science Ireland in the Phoenix Park. The DNA database represents a significant development in assisting An Garda Síochána in the investigation of crime. This high-quality intelligence and investigation tool will be invaluable in the fight against a whole range of crimes, including burglary. The most important resources the Commissioner has at her disposal are the members of the force whom I commend for their brave, compassionate and dedicated service, none more so than Garda Tony Golden who went far beyond the call of duty and gave his life to protect a vulnerable victim of domestic violence. He, with the 87 other members of the force who have given their lives in the line of duty, did so out of a sense of service, a vocation to care for and protect their fellow citizens. There are no words of sorrow or gratitude equal to that service and sacrifice. We can, as legislators and a Government, show our support for the members of An Garda Síochána in a practical way by giving them the resources they need to do their work. I have spoken already of the investment in vehicles, equipment, buildings and technology being made by the Government. The Bill we are debating will be a valuable legislative tool for gardaí in their work to tackle burglary. We also need to address Garda numbers. The Garda College in Templemore was reopened to new recruits in September 2014. Six intakes of new Garda trainees have since entered the Garda College, giving a total intake of 550 recruits. Of these, 295 have already attested and are now working in communities nationwide. The Minister recently announced the opening of a recruitment campaign for new members of An Garda Síochána in 2016. This new campaign underscores the Government's commitment to seamless ongoing recruitment to An Garda Síochána to ensure the service is renewed and has the capacity to deliver an effective, responsive police service throughout the country to protect our communities and respond to emerging crime trends. This additional recruitment will bring to 1,150 the total number of Garda trainees recruited under the Government between September 2014 and 2016. The 2016 campaign will include a special stream for eligible members of the Garda Reserve who give their time on a voluntary basis to support the work of An Garda Síochána. Community-based organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association, Neighbourhood Watch and Muintir na Tíre are key partners of An Garda Síochána in the fight against rural crime. Part of Operation Thor is to raise awareness in the community as to how they can work together to prevent crime. The funding being provided to support community alert and Crimestoppers is being doubled, with a total allocation of €397,000 in 2016. I will now outline the provisions of the Bill. Section 1 seeks to ensure prolific burglars can be refused bail in appropriate cases. It is necessary to recall that a decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail because in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proved guilty. Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 which gave effect to the 16th amendment of the Constitution permits the courts to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence where refusal of bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. Burglary offences are designated as serious offences for the purposes of the Bail Act. However, it is clear that prolific burglars with numerous previous convictions are repeatedly granted bail, despite Garda objections, even when charged with a series of burglaries. Section 1 will add new provisions to section 2 of the Bail Act 1997. The new provisions will apply where a court is considering a bail application from an adult charged with a relevant offence alleged to have been committed in a dwelling. A relevant offence is defined as a burglary or aggravated burglary offence contrary to section 12 or 13 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, respectively. For the purposes of bail applications in such cases, the court must consider previous convictions for domestic burglary, coupled with pending charges or recent convictions as evidence that the accused person is likely to commit a further domestic burglary. Turning to the detail of the provisions, the new subsection (2A) applies where a court is deciding whether it is reasonably considered necessary to refuse bail to prevent the commission of a serious offence by a person who is charged with a burglary alleged to have been committed in a dwelling. In such a case, if there are certain circumstances, as set out in subsection (2B), the court must consider the existence of these circumstances as evidence that the person is likely to commit a further domestic burglary. These circumstances are that the person has a previous conviction for domestic burglary committed in the five years before the bail application and that the person has been convicted of at least two domestic burglaries committed in the period starting six months before and ending six months after the alleged commission of the offence for which he or she is seeking bail, the person has been charged with at least two domestic burglaries allegedly committed in the same period, or the person has been convicted of at least one domestic burglary committed, and charged with at least one other domestic burglary allegedly committed, in the same period. The provisions, while making it clear that prolific burglars should be refused bail in the circumstances set out in the Bill, will leave the courts all necessary discretion to vindicate the constitutional rights of an accused person in relation to bail. The new subsection (2C) provides that a reference in subsection (2B) to a conviction for a relevant offence includes a conviction that is under appeal. The new subsection (2D) provides that subsection (2B) will not prejudice the operation of section 258 of the Children Act 2001 which provides for the non-disclosure of certain findings of guilt relating to offences committed by persons under the age of 18 years. A new subsection (4) will be inserted into section 2 of the Bail Act to define "dwelling" and "relevant offence" for the purposes of the new provisions. Section 2 seeks to deal with the related problem of concurrent sentences being handed down for multiple burglaries. In many cases, relatively short sentences are imposed when multiple burglary offences are taken into account by the court. Section 2 will insert a new section 54A into the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001. The new section will require a court which decides to impose custodial sentences for multiple domestic burglary offences committed within a 12 month window to impose such sentences consecutively. The new section applies only to a relevant offence, which means a burglary or aggravated burglary. The provisions will apply only to adults previously convicted of a domestic burglary committed in the five years before the burglary offence for they are being sentenced. Subsection (1) of the new section 54A will apply where an adult is being sentenced to imprisonment for a domestic burglary, was convicted of another domestic burglary committed in the five years before the offence for which he or she is being sentenced and was sentenced to imprisonment for another domestic burglary committed in the period starting six months before and ending six months after the burglary offence for which he or she is now being sentenced.In such a case, any sentence of imprisonment which the court chooses to impose for the burglary for which the person is being sentenced must be consecutive to any sentence of imprisonment imposed for the prior domestic burglary offences. Subsection (2) makes it clear that where a prior burglary offence would come within paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection (1), that offence may be considered for the purpose of satisfying either paragraph (b) or (c) but not both. Subsection (3) provides that subsection (1) will apply only where the burglary offence for which the person is being sentenced was committed after the Bill comes into operation and will apply whether the other offences were committed before or after that date. Subsection (4) provides that the aggregate term of imprisonment for consecutive sentences imposed by the District Court under the new provisions can extend to but not exceed two years. No such restriction will apply to the Circuit Court. Subsection (5) provides that a reference in subsection (1) to a conviction for a relevant offence includes a conviction that is under appeal. Subsection (6) defines "dwelling" and "relevant offence" for the purposes of the new section. The discretion of a court whether to impose a custodial sentence will not be restricted by the new provisions. Section 3 is a standard provision providing for the Short Title and commencement of the Bill. The Bill targets repeat burglary offenders through bail measures and provisions concerning the imposition of consecutive sentencing for repeat offending. It is one part of a broader co-ordinated strategy to tackle burglary and other crime through investment in Garda resources, increased recruitment, specialist operations such as Operation Thor, co-ordinated offender management through the joint agency response to crime, JARC, investment in community initiatives like text alert and investment in crime fighting technology, including the DNA database. The key objective of the legislation is to target a cohort of persistent offenders who prey on law abiding householders and clearly have no concern for the damage and distress which they inflict on others. I commend the Bill to the House.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the contributions made across the House and the support for the Bill. I listened with interest to what Senators had to say and thank all those who contributed to the debate. It is clear that all of us here are of the view that burglary is an odious offence, particularly when it interferes with what should be the peaceful haven of a person's home. In tackling burglaries, the Government is particularly focused on serious and repeat offenders in terms of sentencing and in smarter and more co-ordinated offender management and investing in the capacity of An Garda Síochána to tackle such offenders.  The Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, commissioned a review of this area earlier in the year and the Bill is directly informed by the concerns identified by An Garda Síochána. Officials from the Department met the detectives tackling burglaries so that they could hear first hand the difficulties they face to identify the improvements in the law which have been delivered in the Bill. Gardaí noted the particular challenges they face in tackling repeat offenders who obtain bail, despite having multiple convictions or facing multiple charges. Such offenders often commit many burglaries while on bail and then push to receive a sentence for as few offences as possible while having many more taken into consideration. The Bill addresses both ends of the problem.  The constitutional right of liberty of accused persons is carefully balanced with the constitutional right to inviolable dwelling. Multiple offences of domestic burglary or multiple pending charges or a combination of both will be considered as evidence that the person is likely to commit further domestic burglary. The courts will be empowered to deny bail to such prolific offenders in appropriate cases.  As regards sentencing, multiple offences committed within the same 12-month period cannot simply be taken into consideration or rolled up into a single concurrent sentence of imprisonment. If a court is minded to impose a sentence of imprisonment it would be obliged to impose it consecutively to any sentence of imprisonment for domestic burglary committed within the same 12-month period.  Work is progressing on the drafting of a new bail Bill which the Minister intends to bring forward as a matter of priority to strengthen other aspects of the law and to protect the public against crimes committed by persons on bail. Legislation is only part of the solution. Results on the ground are delivered by the men and women of An Garda Síochána. Gardaí ensure our laws are enforced and that the rights of vulnerable victims are upheld. It is important that we equip the gardaí to do their jobs. I wish to outline the significant investment the Government is making in Garda equipment, ICT, vehicles, buildings and the new DNA database. The Government's capital plan is providing a major investment in 21st century policing to tackle crime. An additional €46 million has been provided for vehicles, €60 million for buildings and overall ICT funding of €330 million over the lifetime of the capital plan. The Minister secured an extra allocation for the recruitment of 600 new gardaí. I have already mentioned the effect of Operation Thor. I listened with particular interest to the concerns of all Members of the House to particular cases mentioned by colleagues. I sympathise with all victims of burglaries. In addition to resourcing An Garda Síochána to tackle the offenders, we are putting in place supports for victims. The general scheme of the criminal justice (victims of crime) Bill has been published and the Bill is being drafted. Victims of crime will be placed at the heart of the justice system for the first time. Victims will have a right to receive clear information on the criminal justice system, their role within it and the range of services and entitlements they may access. The Bill provides the right to receive written acknowledgement of the making of a complaint as well as details on how further information can be obtained. Victims will be able to request information concerning the progress of the investigation in any court proceedings. The information must be provided by a prison service on the release and escape from prison of an offender serving a sentence for an offence against the victim if requested. Victims will also have the right to individual assessment of the measures necessary for their protection from further victimisation. An Garda Síochána, the Courts Service, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Irish Prison Service and the Garda Ombudsman Commission will all be obliged to train staff members in the needs of victims and to enable them to deal with victims in a respectful and professional manner. On the closure of Garda stations, policing has a lot more complexity to it than where a station is located. Recent statistics show no correlation between station closures and a rise in burglary. The number of burglaries has, in fact, fallen in some areas where stations were closed. I understand the concern expressed at the closure of Garda stations. It can appear that resources have been withdrawn from an area when this happens, but that is not the truth. The closure of Garda stations was not about saving money. It was done to enhance service delivery and efficiency. We have heard again in recent days from the Garda association and the Garda Inspectorate about the need to release gardaí from paperwork for front line duties. The rationalisation programme put in place by Garda management shows front-line gardaí to be deployed with greater mobility and flexibility, particularly for targeted police operations. As a result, communities benefit from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which improves the police service to the public. The network of more than 700 Garda stations inherited from the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Dublin Metropolitan Police reflected a 19th century model that predated the invention of the motor car. Can anyone seriously argue that a 19th century policing model should be applied to 21st century crime? The Garda strategy which the Minister supports and has resourced is to ensure a dynamic policing response that has enabled it to tackle crime where and when it happens and the appropriate equipment. The Garda cannot drive a desk to a scene of a crime to apprehend criminals or move that desk to the other side of the county in response to changing crime patterns. However, a garda in a patrol car or a high-powered response vehicle can both engage with the local community and attend the scene of a crime. We must support a 21st century model of policing.  On the issue of tagging, the Criminal Justice Act 2007 provides for the introduction of electronic monitoring as a condition of bail at the discretion of the court. However, due to issues relating to the operational effectiveness of untargeted electronic monitoring, these provisions have not been commenced. Evidence in other jurisdictions has shown that electronic monitoring has significant limitations. For example, the report on the Scottish electronic monitoring has a condition of bail where neither the aims of increasing public safety perceptions nor reducing the custodial remand population have been achieved in any significant way.  I thank Members for their support for the Bill. The Bill was developed, having sought the advice of gardaí on the ground and in the light of the challenges they face. It represents a targeted response to those who think they can repeatedly burgle the homes of innocent victims with impunity. Suggestions that people's right to free legal aid should be curtailed are not consistent with the values of a republic. One may not like it and we may find it difficult to accept, but if we believe in living in a free and open democracy and in a republic, there are certain rights and entitlements that go with living in that republic. It is a constitutional right.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It represents in this Bill, a short Bill, a technically complex Bill which carefully balances constitutional rights to ensure the Garda and the courts can respond fairly but effectively to the crime caused by prolific burglars. This legislation, together with Operation Thor and the joint agency response to crime, is focused on tackling and managing prolific offenders. It forms part of a comprehensive package aimed at reducing the scourge of crime and burglaries, in particular. There is a wider debate to be had about the root causes of crime and issues of inequality in that respect, but that is for another day.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, I thank Senator Sean D. Barrett for bringing forward this amendment. It arose from an interesting point he made on Second Stage regarding the appropriateness of attaching the name "St. Patrick's" to a place where young persons were detained in view of the circumstances under which St. Patrick had been reputedly brought to Ireland and subjected to forced labour. Senators will appreciate the Government is fully committed to and will very shortly achieve, finally, the closing of St. Patrick's Institution. Accordingly, it is now a matter of when, rather than if, St. Patrick's Institution will be closed. Subsequently, there will be an end to the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities. While recommending in 2013 that St. Patrick's Institution be closed, the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention also recommended that the name "St. Patrick's" be consigned to history. The Bill will do this by providing not only for the complete closing of St. Patrick's Institution but also through the general removal of references to St. Patrick's Institution from the Statute Book. In particular, the Bill will repeal all the legislative provisions that specifically enable the courts to order the detention of young persons in St. Patrick's Institution. The term "place of detention" has a specific meaning in prisons legislation. Section 2 of the Prisons Act 1970 provides that the Minister for Justice may, for the purposes of promoting the rehabilitation of offenders, provide places other than prisons for the detention of sentenced persons. These places are known and referred to as "places of detention". Wheatfield Place of Detention, as it is now called, is one such place. Therefore, the Senator's amendment would not prevent a children's detention school or prison from being given the name "St. Patrick's". More generally, I imagine Senators understand the attachment of the name "St. Patrick's Institution" to the premises which is the subject of the Bill was of its time and would not happen today. In the circumstances, while she fully appreciates the sentiments behind the proposed amendment, the Minister does not believe it is necessary or that it should be included in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	We are making a little history today. I thank all of the Members who contributed to the debate on the Bill. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and I are grateful for the support of Senators for the proposals contained in the Bill. The Prisons Bill finally delivers on the calls to close St. Patrick's Institution which have been made for the past 30 years. The Government's unprecedented programme of reform in closing St. Patrick's Institution and developing national children detention facilities at Oberstown will allow young people sentenced to detention to be placed in a secure environment that will offer them a better chance, as stated in the Children Act 2001, to take their place in the community as persons who observe the law and are capable of making a positive and productive contribution to society. Before concluding, I advise the House that the Minister intends to table amendments to the Bill in the Dáil to provide for two further matters. The amendments are linked with High Court proceedings in connection with prison-related matters. Unfortunately, it was not possible for the drafting of the amendments to be completed in time for their inclusion in the Bill, as published, or for them to be tabled on Committee Stage. The first arises from the judgment of the High Court earlier this year in the case of Mr. O v. the Minister for Justice and Equality. In that case the High Court considered the legality of the temporary release of a prisoner who had been subject to a deportation order and deported immediately after his release from prison. The High Court decided that section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960, which governs the temporary release of prisoners, did not permit the temporary release of prisoners who were subject to deportation orders for the purposes of their deportation or removal from the State. Given the practical implications of the Mr. O judgment for the deportation process, the Minister believes a clear legislative basis is needed to allow non-national prisoners to be taken from prison by members of An Garda Síochána or immigration officers for the purposes of giving effect to deportation orders under the Immigration Act 1999 or removal orders under the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006. She, therefore, proposes to bring forward an amendment to make new and specific provision for this purpose. Second, arising from an issue that has emerged in recent High Court proceedings, the Minister considers it appropriate to bring forward a technical amendment relating to warrants issued by courts in Dublin for the committal of persons to prison. Dublin District Court committal warrants are addressed to An Garda Síochána in accordance with the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act 1851. However, District Court Rules permit committal warrants in Dublin to be addressed directly to the governor of the prison to which a person is to be committed. It has always been thought that this was permitted under the 1851 Act and the courts have operated on that basis. However, in a judgment in the recent case of Grant v. Governor of Cloverhill Prison the High Court judge expressed the view that the relevant provision of the District Court Rules might be inconsistent with the 1851 Act. As this opens up the prospect of uncertainty in the legal position, the Minister proposes to table an amendment to the Bill in the Dáil to declare that the committal warrant issued by the District Court in Dublin can be addressed to the governor of a prison. This is the position that has been taken to apply in Dublin for many years. The Prisons Bill is expected to complete all Stages in the Dáil on Monday and I understand arrangements will be made for the Bill to be returned to this House later next week in order that it can complete its passage through both Houses and be signed into law by the end of the year.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	The purpose of the proposed new sections is to amend the law relating to judicial appointments but with only one dimension of the law considered, that is, making legal academics eligible for appointment as judges of all courts by extending to them the qualifying and eligibility provisions which currently apply to practising barristers and solicitors. Effectively, the amendments would equate a legal academic with barristers and solicitors who, subject to having the relevant practice experience, are eligible for appointment to all courts. The first amendment defines a "qualifying legal academic" as a member of the academic staff at the King's Inns, the Law Society, universities and other legal training institutions. The second amendment would make such legal academics eligible for appointment to the High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. The third amendment would make them eligible for appointment as temporary judges. The fourth would make them eligible for appointment to the Circuit Court; the fifth would make the same provision in respect of the District Court, while the sixth would have the effect of including such legal academics among those whom the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board may consider suitable as persons whose names could be submitted by it to the Minister under the appointments procedures set out under the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995. The amendments, given that they deal with appointments as judges, are outside the scope of the Bill. The Government is conducting a wide-ranging review of all matters concerned with judicial appointments that will allow the necessary full assessment of all aspects of the issue. It is committed to bringing forward legislative reforms in this area and a judicial appointments Bill which is being prepared is the subject of a commitment in the agreed programme for Government. The subject of the amendments, that is, the eligibility of legal academics for judicial appointment, is one of a wide range of matters included within the scope of the review I have mentioned.Legislation in this area that might have regard to only one aspect of eligibility for judicial appointment is unlikely to complement the overall reform process needed in the area which is balanced and considered and which, as I have mentioned, the Government proposes to bring forward as soon as practicable. The question of appointing academic lawyers is not new. From time to time, calls have been made to tap into the deep academic experience and knowledge of professors of law and similar. Often, these are persons with a great level of expertise in particular areas of the law or who research the law extensively. They teach the subject and, in some cases, they have authored legal texts and engaged in public discourse on matters relating to the law. I am confident the merits or otherwise of such a measure will be fully explored in the context of the judicial appointments review I have mentioned. It was understood on launching the review and the public consultations that it would be worthwhile to consider opening up the eligibility criteria for appointment as a judge, perhaps in so far as the experience of academic lawyers is concerned, but perhaps also to reflect the depth of experience in other areas where great legal expertise is evident without the required practice experience. The consultation process last year reflected the fact the appointments system, including the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, while a model of best practice in its day needed reviewing almost 20 years after its establishment. Arising from the consultation process, draft legislative provisions to reform and update the judicial appointment procedures are being prepared by the Department as such legislation is part of the agreed programme for Government. The Minister has indicated that reforms will be brought forward in 2016. On this basis I ask the Senator to withdraw his amendment in favour of fully comprehensive reform of the law in the area of judicial appointments as the amendment is outside the scope of the Bill. I undertake to refer the Senator's amendment to the Department for inclusion as a matter for consideration in the work of the review I have mentioned.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	My understanding of the amendment is that its desired effect is to standardise the retirement age of District Court judges with all other judges to a fixed retirement age of 70 years. I have been informed the Minister has been in consultation with the Judiciary on this matter and agrees the retirement age of District Court judges should be raised to 70 years, but I do not believe the amendment would achieve this or that any such amendment should be inserted in the Courts Bill 2015. The position is that District Court judges are required to retire at 65 years of age and may, subject to annual review, be permitted to serve until age 70. Supreme Court judges, Court of Appeal judges, High Court judges and Circuit Court judges retire at the age of 70 years with some exceptions. These exceptions relate only to those serving judges who were judges before the reduction of the age of retirement from 72 years to 70 under the Court and Court Officers Act 1995. The relevant provisions include section 30 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 which provides that the age of retirement of a District Court judge shall be 65 years. Section 2 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act 1949 provides that a warrant may be made by a committee comprising the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney General to allow a judge to continue in office for an additional year if the judge is not suffering from any disability which would render him or her unfit to continue to discharge efficiently the duties of the office. Subsequent warrants may be made to allow the judge to remain in office until he or she attains the age of 70 years. The Minister is inclined to agree that an annual review system for District Court judges between the ages of 65 and 70 years is, when compared to other judges, anomalous and unsatisfactory. There are no grounds for believing that all judges should not be subject to the same retirement regime. To this end, I have been informed that the Minister has instructed the Department to review the relevant statutory provisions and bring forward a comprehensive amendment at the earliest possible opportunity. I anticipate such provision can be brought forward early in 2016. Changing the retirement age to 70 years would require amending the sections I have mentioned. Amendment of other provisions may also be required, for example, to section 1 of the Courts (No. 2) Act 1988. This section makes provision for warrants to be made retrospectively. Additional provisions also require consideration. There would be implications for the pension arrangements of judges arising from a change in the retirement age which would need to be carefully considered and the relevant scheme and pensions legislation are being considered. In this connection, I would be most reluctant to bring forward or accept any amendments in this area until all of the implications are fully assessed. As I have indicated, I anticipate this work, which is at an advanced stage, will be concluded in the near future. Section 72 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 was repealed by the provisions of the Court of Justice (District Court) Act 1946 which was, in turn, repealed and replaced by the provisions to which I have referred in the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961. Apart from the technical difficulties to which the amendment gives rise and the fact the subject matter of the amendment is outside the scope of the Bill, the overriding position is that the substantive issue which the amendment seeks to address is the subject of review by the Department and relevant comprehensive measures are being prepared, while the administrative implications, for example, on pension matters are also being examined. I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment on the basis that its intention can be fully reflected in a comprehensive fully analysed set of provisions which, as I indicated, are in preparation.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	As has been stated, the principle behind the amendment is accepted; it is just the mechanisms around it on which we may be in disagreement. I am informed the review is due to move forward in the early part of 2016.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The desired effect of the amendment is to provide for the eligibility of District Court judges for appointment to the High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. I have been informed that the Minister has been in consultation with the Judiciary on this matter and is inclined to agree that District Court judges should be eligible for appointment beyond the Circuit Court. However, this is not an appropriate amendment and no such amendment should be inserted in the Courts Bill. Dealing with the District Court judge promotion question without more broadly addressing arguably equally pressing judicial appointments issues, as the Government is committed to doing under the agreed programme for Government, would be an unwise step. The Minister's preferred approach is to defer the issue for consideration in the context of wider reform of the law on appointments, a matter to which I will return. Section 5(2)(a) of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961, as inserted by section 4 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002 and relevant amendments in the Court of Appeal Act 2014, provides that a person shall be qualified for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the High Court if he or she is, for the time being, a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than 12 years standing who has practised as a barrister or solicitor for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately before such appointment. Section 5(2)(c) of the 1961 Act provides that a judge of the Circuit Court who has served as a judge for a period of not less than two years should be qualified for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the High Court. Therefore, such a judge is not precluded from consideration by the requirement that the person be a practising barrister or solicitor at the time of appointment to the higher courts. As there is no provision equivalent to section 5(2)(c) in respect of District Court judges, they cannot qualify for appointment to the higher courts as they were not considered to be practising at the time of appointment. A similar provision would, therefore, be required to make District Court judges eligible for appointment to courts higher than the Circuit Court. Transitional provisions and other consequential amendments may also be required.  I am aware that the Judiciary is of the view that District Court judges should be eligible for appointment to the High Court. As I have indicated, the Minister agrees with this view and careful consideration needs to be given to the question of whether District Court judges should be eligible for appointment to the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal. Judges of certain European and international courts are also eligible for appointment to the superior courts. For example, a person who, during the period of two years immediately before the appointment concerned, was a judge of the Court of Justice of the European Communities is eligible for appointment to the High Court or the Supreme Court. This provision also applies to a judge of the European Court of Human Rights, the International Criminal Court and certain other European and international courts.  The Minister accepts that there appears to be no good reason that, of all the various categories of judges, the only group specifically excluded from the possibility of appointment as a judge of the High Court or above are District Court judges. She has asked her Department to prepare relevant provisions to make District Court judges eligible for elevation to courts higher than the Circuit Court. However, this is being done in the context of a full, ongoing review of the entire system of judicial appointments. The Government is committed to introducing legislative reforms in this area and a judicial appointments Bill which is being prepared is a commitment in the agreed programme for Government.  The subject matter of the amendments, namely, the eligibility of District Court judges for judicial appointment, is one of a wide range of matters included in the scope of the review to which I referred. As part of this review, a consultation process on the system of judicial appointments was conducted in early 2014. There was a significant response to the call for submissions, with substantive and wide-ranging views received on the legislative framework that provides for eligibility for judicial appointments and the process of appointments. Legislation in this area which may have regard to only one aspect of eligibility for judicial appointments is unlikely to complement the overall reform process required in this area which must be balanced and considered and which, as I stated, the Government proposes to introduce as soon as is practical. On this basis, I ask the Senators to withdraw their amendment in favour of a fully comprehensive reform of the law in the area of judicial appointments which will include changes in the eligibility conditions for serving District Court judges. The amendment is outside the scope of the Bill. The position is similar to that on the previous amendment in that while it is sound in principle, the issue as stake is the mechanism by which the objective is to be achieved.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Senators for their contributions. The issue at hand is agreed and the principle behind the amendment is accepted, but it is a question of how we achieve what is proposed. A judicial appointments Bill is being prepared and due to be introduced to the Houses of the Oireachtas early in 2016. That is the vehicle by which we feel this issue might best be addressed.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am told it will be ready early in 2016, which is when the Bill to which I have referred will be introduced.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am informed it is at an advanced stage. It must be presented to the Government in the form of a scheme of a Bill. Early 2016 is still my response.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I thank Senators for their comments. When debating the Bill, we all are united in our attempts to tackle this most heinous of crimes. The Senator refers to explicit material. There is a deliberate attempt among commercial enterprises to sexualise young people and children, to shorten their childhood and to make them aware of their sexual power above any other power. It is quite disturbing. It is something that must be addressed because it is completely disempowering and is warping the young minds of boys and girls as early as possible for commercial benefit in the "legitimate" commercial and corporate sphere. This is something we may be able to return to between now and Report Stage because I am taken by the comments that have been made. I will give the technical response, but perhaps this is something on which we can work. The effect of the amendments would be to substitute the term "child sexual abuse material" for "child pornography" throughout this Bill and other Acts in which it appears. As the Senator will be aware, the language used in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and this Bill reflects that contained in the EU directive to which the Bill, among other matters, is giving effect, as well as the Council of Europe Convention on Child Sexual Exploitation. It is also a term used in other EU instruments, including the Council decision to establish Europol. The amendments are proposed on the basis that the term "child sexual abuse material" more accurately reflects the horrific abuse involved and avoids the idea of some form of consent which may be implicit in the term "pornography". In terms of the wording of the amendments put forward, there is a technical difficulty, which means that I would be unable to accept them. The term "child pornography" appears in the Statute Book outside the 1998 Act and any general amendment to that term throughout the Statute Book should be carefully made. I am advised that a general amending provision, as proposed by the Senator in amendment No. 25, would not suffice. Rather each provision in the Statute Book containing the term which it is proposed to amend should be individually identified. While it is not unusual to amend one form of words with another, it is done through individual identification of each instance. This is an important safeguard, particularly where the provisions relate to the criminal law. The amendments proposed also raise other technical difficulties such as the effect on the Short Title of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998. I am advised it is not appropriate to amend the Short Title of an existing Act by an amendment in subsequent legislation. The Act should be substituted and repealed. For these reasons, I am unable to accept the amendment on this occasion. The Minister would, however, fully support including the Senator's proposal in any future review of child pornography legislation. It is a technical reason. Perhaps we might look again to see if we can overcome this technical matter because the language the Senator has proposed is stronger and most likely to be more appropriate.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The purpose of amendment No. 3 is to allow the court to impose a fine instead of, or in addition to, a term of imprisonment on a person who is convicted on indictment of an offence under this section. A fine is already available as a penalty or part thereof for summary convictions under this section but was omitted in respect of convictions on indictment. It is unusual to provide for both a fine and a term of imprisonment in the available penalties, particularly where financial gain may be a motivation in the offence. This is consistent with the framing of other penalty provisions contained in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This is standard legal practice, it is not unusual. To not do it would be an anomaly. The amendment is a standard framing of penalties in the State. A range of penalties are available for offences in the Bill and it is a standard in the drafting of penalties for offences. It is not in any way to suggest a fine in this area is an appropriate sentence, it is just the way that legislation in the State is framed across the Statute Book in every single circumstance. Reference was made to the report of the Garda Inspectorate.
The office of Internet safety within the Department provides a hotline service for the reporting of crime and the Minister has completely accepted the report and is examining it in detail. The prosecuting of child pornography is a technically difficult type of investigation which can involve different jurisdictions, unnamed people and unnamed vulnerable victims. As it is Internet based, it is particularly difficult to prosecute. However, there have been a number of recent sexual exploitation cases which were successfully prosecuted. It is given the highest priority, but in order to execute a conviction one must have a proper, robust investigation. Unfortunately, that can take time because of the complex nature of the offence.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	To clarify one matter, I do not live in the leafy suburbs but in Ballybough, an area that has leaves.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes, although my house is not as big as the Senator's.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I do not wish to diminish the seriousness of the topic we are discussing. On the issue of fines and mandatory prison sentences, mandatory imprisonment is limited to a small number of offences, namely, certain drugs and firearms offences. The sexual exploitation of a child is addressed in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and carries a penalty of a life sentence. We are dealing today with an offence that is in part financially motivated. Therefore, the addition of a fine, as provided for in the amendment, is appropriate. It should be noted, however, that the amendment has been passed.It is a worthy debate, but we have work to do.  In terms of the sections, as outlined by Senator David Norris and on the apparent discrepancy in the definition of what constitutes a child, these are technical issues and relate to international law. Section 3 is an EU directive requirement and, therefore, the age is 18 years. Section 4 is a passive form of sexual assault and the age below which one cannot consent to an act which may amount to sexual assault is 15 years. Section 5 stipulates 17 years which reflects the age of consent in national law generally.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I refer Senators to the comments I made previously. If further clarification is required on the issue of additional fines and imprisonment, we will be happy to provide it on Report Stage.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We can examine it in the context of providing clarification and I have no difficulty doing so. As Senators stated, the definition is a sensitive issue. It is also a difficult one because different instances require different responses. In order to ensure clarity, we have no difficult in doing, as I have outlined.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The amendment has been passed.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The amendment has been passed and the justification for the amendment has been given. I have given an undertaking on the language provided in respect of the uncertainty of some Senators on the question of fines versus imprisonment, as well as in respect of the definition of a child. We are happy to return to this issue on Report Stage to allay whatever fears Senators have.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The issue in respect of age of consent is addressed in section 17. The proposed section 17 includes a new section 3(8) of the 2006 Act and provides for a proximity-of-age defence where a person is charged with an offence against a child between the ages of 15 and 17 years. It shall be a defence that where the child consented to the activity and the accused is younger or less than two years older than the child or the accused, he or she is not considered to be a person in authority or there is no intimidatory or exploitative element to the relationship. Effectively what I am saying is that the issue Senator Jim Walsh has raised is dealt with in section 17.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 4 brings additional clarification to section 8 which creates an offence where a person communicates by means of information and communications technology with another person for the purposes of facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child. The offence is committed whether the perpetrator contacts the child directly or contacts a third person to facilitate the sexual exploitation of the child. The purpose of the amendment is to clarify that the other person referred to in the provision includes the child, the victim. While implicit in the reference to "other person", the amendment makes it explicit.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Article 2 of the EU directive obliges member states to define child pornography as: "any material that visually depicts a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct". In other words, it covers the case of any real depiction of a child. The definition also includes:Any depiction of the sexual organs of a child for primarily sexual purposes; or"any material that visually depicts any person appearing to be a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct or any depiction of the sexual organs of any person appearing to be a child, for primarily sexual purposes; or"realistic images of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct or realistic images of the sexual organs of a child, regardless of the actual existence of such child, for primarily sexual purposes".In this context, the term "a child or someone depicted as a child" is appropriate as determined by the EU directive.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister thanks Senator Jillian van Turnhout for this amendment and will re-examine the drafting of paragraphs (c) and (d) to ensure they cover comprehensively all persons who are or have been in a position of authority through a relationship with the parent of a child.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This addresses a concern about whether a reference to being charged with an offence should refer to a defendant being charged or a person being charged. Substituting the wording "Where, in proceedings for" removes this concern and is consistent with the approach already taken in section 17(4).
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On Second Stage the Minister informed the House that she would introduce amendments to Part 3 of the Bill relating to the purchase of sexual services that further decriminalised the women and men involved in prostitution by removing those who offered sexual services from the existing offences of soliciting and loitering for the purpose of prostitution. Amendment No. 26 makes the necessary provision, while amendment No. 30 ensures no inadvertent consequences may arise from it. Section 7 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 criminalises a person who, in a street or public place, solicits or importunes another person for the purposes of prostitution. Section 8 of that Act creates an offence where a person is loitering in order to solicit or importune another person for the purpose of prostitution and fails to leave that place when directed to do so by a garda. "Soliciting" is defined to include all parties whether male or female, prostitute or client or third party, such as pimp, and includes curb crawling. There have been a number of calls, including from organisations associated with the Turn Off the Red Light campaign, for the removal of those selling sexual services from these offences. The effect of such a change will be that only those people who solicit the sexual services of others, that is, the buyers and pimps, will be prosecuted for the solicitation and loitering offences under the 1993 Act. The primary rationale for decriminalising the sale of sexual services is that those offering the services involved in prostitution are highly vulnerable, often from impoverished backgrounds and frequently with addiction and other issues. It is often the case that those involved in on-street prostitution are among the most vulnerable and marginalised within an already vulnerable group. Retaining criminalisation for solicitation is to penalise this high-risk group. Decriminalisation will also allow people to report violence experienced on the street without fear of prosecution and encourage them to seek appropriate support services. The decriminalisation of on-street prostitution will bring the Irish approach further into line with that of Northern Ireland and the Nordic approach generally. Amendment No. 26 deletes the current paragraph (a), which reads, "offers his or her services as a prostitute to another person", from the definition of "solicits or importunes for the purposes of prostitution" in section 1(2) of the 1993 Act. The effect of the amendment is to remove the persons offering sexual services from the offences under sections 7 and 8 of that Act of soliciting and loitering, respectively, in a public place for the purposes of prostitution. These offences will still apply to any person who solicits a prostitute, that is, the buyer or pimp, or any person who loiters in a public place for the purpose of soliciting a prostitute. The inclusion of this amendment by itself gives rise to concerns that the Garda would be left with no means of combating any public nuisance if sexual offences were to be offered, for example, in a residential area. There is also a concern that the provision could be exploited by criminal gangs or others. Amendment No. 30 addresses these concerns. Section 8 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 provides that a garda may direct a person who is behaving in certain ways, for example, intoxicated, threatening or abusive, to stop behaving in that way or immediately leave the specific area. It is an offence under section 8 to fail to follow such a direction.This amendment will add loitering for the purpose of offering services as a prostitute to the behaviours subject to a direction under section 8. The effect of the proposed amendments will be that on-street prostitution will not itself be an offence, but the Garda will still have the power to move on from a public place when necessary a person or persons offering sexual services. The remaining amendments in this group have been proposed by Senators and I will respond to them after they have been moved.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I join others in commending the Turn Off the Red Light campaign for the manner in which it has approached and campaigned on this issue locally, nationally and internationally. This proposal is being made following an examination of the Swedish approach by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. The Minister and I have deliberated on the matter with various interest groups in this area. The Swedish approach comes from a Parliament that is 45% female. The issue of gender equality in parliamentary representation is an important one. We should think about that when we discuss the issue of gender quotas also. I accept Senator Ivana Bacik's well made point that we cannot take legislation from another jurisdiction without resourcing and funding it, providing for a process of training with regard to it and discussing with the Garda and others how it will be managed and how it will come into effect. I assure Senator Jim Walsh that we are not going to revisit this issue. I disagree with him and Senator David Norris. They are entitled to their opinion, but I disagree with it, as does the Government.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Arguments are always welcome. The argument for decriminalisation is that the seller is the vulnerable person. Prostitution is a demeaning, undermining and nasty industry. There is nothing glorious or glorified about it, contrary to what seems to have been suggested.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am given to understand that in some circumstances the impression is almost being given that this is a liberating profession. It is an industry that undermines, devalues, dehumanises and demeans those involved in it, most of whom are women but some of whom are men.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In this amendment we are attempting to decriminalise these individuals to ensure they know they can approach the authorities, that help and support are available to them and that they are not criminals by virtue of having been lured or forced into the industry. The great majority of those involved in it are involved in it for reasons of poverty or addiction.The amendment criminalises the buyer, which is an appropriate response. That enables the Garda to tackle the issue properly in a proactive and realistic fashion. I thank the Senators who have spoken about this issue. While I appreciate that people have come to it with different perspectives, the issue of prostitution is one that has been with us for a very long time. To suggest we continue to approach it as we always have does not stand up to scrutiny any more. There are movements across the world to address the issue differently. The Swedish and Northern Irish approaches are being adopted here. As Senator Fidelma Healy Eames said, this is a good day.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank Senators for their support.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I disagree. The intent is to end demand.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	One tackles demand.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Our effort in order to tackle demand is to criminalise the purchaser and decriminalise the seller in an attempt to ensure the vulnerable seller of sexual services feels society takes a compassionate view of the situations in which they find themselves, that support services will be available to them, that they can approach gardaí without fear of criminal sanction, that they can find a pathway out of prostitution and that the resources of An Garda Síochána and the criminal justice system are channelled and funnelled toward the demand side of the equation. That is the purpose of the amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will outline for the House the organisations that have been involved in this campaign, which have been described as radical feminists and right-wing extremists. They include AkiDwA, Barnardos, the Children's Rights Alliance, Doras Luimní, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, Focus Ireland, the Immigrant Council of Ireland, IMPACT trade union, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, my party, the Labour Party - perhaps we are radical feminists - One in Four, Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre, the Public Service Executive Union committee, Rape Crisis Network Ireland, SIPTU, Sport against Racism Ireland, Unite and Women's Aid.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Rather than dismissing those groups of individuals who have come to this point of view-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----we should accept that they have come to this view because, like all in this House, they are trying to do what is best. I have only listed a number of organisations, but they should not be dismissed as having any motive apart from what is best for those who find themselves in a very vulnerable postion.  The amendment inserts a review provision into the Bill in respect of one section only, namely, section 20, which criminalises the purchase of sexual services. I assure the Senator that all the provisions in the Bill which, in addition to dealing with the exploitation associated with prostitution, address the sexual exploitation of children and protections for victims in the criminal process will be kept under continuous review. While I appreciate that there is a similar provision in the Northern Ireland legislation, the provisions in this Bill are too important not to be fully and properly implemented and I have no doubt it will be kept under review, with or without the proposed amendment. It is also the case that the information sought should be available on request at any time without the need for a future review provision. Given the considerable debate on these provisions, I fully expect the information to be sought from my Department well in advance of a two-year review. In so far as the amendment sets out particular matters to be reviewed, since 2009 the anti-human trafficking unit of my Department has been providing annual reports on trafficking in human beings in Ireland. These annual reports are available on a dedicated anti-human trafficking website blueblindfold.gov.ie. Information on the extent of prostitution offences is available from the CSO and is regularly published. I certainly expect issues impacting negatively on the safety and well-being of prostitutes to be addressed as they arise, but, as I have said and while there has been much discourse and narrative on this point, there is no substantive evidence showing a negative impact on the safety of those who provide sexual services in those jurisdictions where a similar approach has been implemented.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	For these reasons and because of a minor drafting difficulty with the amendment, I am not in a position to accept it.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I did not say that. I said all-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I did not say it.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I said all legislation was kept under constant review. With regard to this amendment, it clearly has been cut and pasted from the Northern Irish legislation.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The word "Assembly" appears in the amendment and it would have to be amended before it could be considered.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am ready for the Senator. Bring it on.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Sections 20 and 21 provide for two offences in the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services. The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute and the second is the more serious offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a trafficked person. These provisions are the result of considerable and extensive public consultation by the Department of Justice and Equality but primarily by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality which recommended similar proposals in 2013. The matter has already been the subject of considerable debate both inside and outside these Houses and even beyond the State. In deciding on these provisions the Minister considered all sides of the debate and the experience of those states that have introduced similar measures and those that have addressed prostitution in a different way. The purpose of introducing these provisions is primarily to target the trafficking and sexual exploitation of persons through prostitution. Both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have recognised the effectiveness of the criminalisation of the purchase of sexual services as a tool in the fight against human trafficking. However, even to leave aside this unquestionable objective, there is undoubtedly evidence of wider exploitation of persons involved in prostitution outside those trafficked such as those coerced or otherwise forced through circumstances to engage in the activity.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The most direct way of combating this form of exploitation is to send a message to those who pay for these services and those who ignore the exploitation of the women and men that their behaviour is not acceptable and supports the exploitation of others. Senator David Norris raised many aspects in the debate today. He raised issues about the impact of the provisions and the safety, health and well-being of those who work in prostitution. The Minister is well aware of the arguments and concerns. In deciding to put forward her proposals, she listened to all sides of the debate and is convinced that targeting the exploitation associated with prostitution requires targeting those who demand prostitutes.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Senators for the amendment. It proposes to increase the penalty for the organisation of prostitution. The Minister supports the aim of the Senators' proposal. There have been calls to review the existing penalties for offences relating to prostitution. The Minister has concerns about some penalties in this area, for example, the maximum penalty for living on the earnings of prostitution of another person, pimping, is only a maximum of six months imprisonment. The Minister has asked for a review of the penalties for all offences relating to prostitution. On Report Stage she will be increasing the penalty for loitering and will bring forward other amendments where a forum is appropriate.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Senator. The Minister appreciates the purpose behind the proposed amendment, but she has initial misgivings about it. The purpose of the provisions in sections 22 and 23 is to remove the existing gender anomaly relating to the penalty for incest by a male as opposed to by a female. Otherwise, they reflect the provisions of the Punishment of Incest Act 1908. When offences of this nature occur, generally an adult and child are involved. The 1908 provisions were undoubtedly intended to protect children within the family, but they were also motivated by the potentially adverse effects on any children born out of such relationships and eugenic considerations generally. For this reason, the Act and the amended provisions proposed in the Bill limit the offence to an act between persons where pregnancy is most likely. The Senator's amendment would broaden the offence in this respect. For instance, the current offence of incest by a male includes a male who has carnal knowledge of his granddaughter but not a male who has carnal knowledge of his grandmother. Equally, in so far as there is an offence of incest by a female, it may occur where there is carnal knowledge with her grandfather but not her grandson. Obviously, where a person engages in a sexual act with a child under the age of 17 years, the existing defilement offences under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006 will apply. However, where it is an offence of incest, the relationships within which the offence may arise are limited to those most likely to result in pregnancy. Therefore, the Minister wants to examine this aspect of the amendment to ensure that it does not unnecessarily extend the offence of incest. The amendment would limit the offence to persons over the age of 17 years where currently that limit only applies to females and not to males. The amendment would exempt males under 17 years of age from the offence, thus restricting its scope while expanding its extent by unifying the categories of prohibited relationships for both sexes. We must be careful not to bring about unintended or unnecessary consequences. The Supreme Court has adjudicated that the Oireachtas is entitled to protect girls under the age of 17 years from the risk of pregnancy because a girl potentially carries a greater burden from the act physically and emotionally should she become pregnant. The Minister is concerned that accepting the amendment may preclude, where appropriate, the prosecution of a male of, for example, 16 years of age. The amendment also would delete subsection (2) from the offence of incest by a male. Under subsection (2), a male cannot rely on the consent of a female as a defence to a charge of incest. While there is no similar provision in the offence by a female, it would not be correct to suggest that the offence by a female can be defended by the consent of the male. The nature of the offence by the female is different than that committed by a male. The offence by a female is committed where she permits a specified male relative to have carnal knowledge of her. Consent on the part of both parties is, therefore, implied and an element of the offence. Relying on the defence of consent on the part of the male would not arise. The offence by a male is committed where he has carnal knowledge of the female. A provision clarifying that consent of the female is not a defence is, therefore, required and brings it into line with the offence by a female. Removing this provision from the offence by a male would mean a male could rely on consent as a defence but a female could not. For these reasons, we cannot accept the amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is a difficult discussion to have and I understand that it can cause great upset to people who have been victims of this offence or affected by it. In a technical sense, the offence of incest is limited to those relationships that may result in pregnancy. On that basis, sexual intercourse between two brothers would not be considered to be incest.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No, the Senator is right. A female under the age of 17 years cannot commit an offence. Someone who is 16 and three quarters years of age would not be committing an offence.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In any legislation dealing with an age limit, this matter will always arise. One could say it is nonsensical for somebody who is 17 years and 364 days old not to be able to vote, but that is the reality of our current arrangement. It features in this legislation also. It is the Supreme Court adjudication that the Oireachtas is entitled to protect girls under the age of 17 years from the risk of pregnancy as a girl would potentially carry a greater burden from the legislation physically and emotionally should she become pregnant. The Minister is concerned that accepting the Senator's amendment may preclude, where appropriate, the prosecution of a male of, say, 16 years. While I can understand the Senator's examples, the law draws a line in the sand when it comes to somebody's age. That is the way it has been and the way it always will be.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We are not saying that.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Again, the language is quite clear. The legislation refers to protecting girls from the risk of pregnancy. The Oireachtas has a responsibility to protect girls from the risk of pregnancy. We are not in any way suggesting that somebody under 17 years cannot become pregnant. Such a suggestion would be preposterous. The Supreme Court adjudication dates from 2006.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is why we are protecting them. My point has been made. It is our responsibility as legislators to protect a girl under the age of 17 years from a risk of pregnancy through a sexual violation, sexual assault, rape or incest. That is what we are dealing with. In a manner, we are dancing on the head of a pin, but essentially the point has been made.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Section 33 regulates the disclosure of the content of third-party counselling or therapy records in sexual offence trials. The disclosure of counselling or therapy records in the context of criminal proceedings, especially with regard to sexual violence, touches on several sensitive issues and balancing of rights. The right to a fair trial for an accused must be respected. However, so too does the right of the victim not to feel further violated in the criminal justice process. This section establishes a process for the disclosure of such records, where appropriate. Since the publication of the Bill, the Minister for Justice and Equality has received several submissions proposing changes to this section. Notably, submissions from the Ombudsman for Children, Rape Crisis Network Ireland and Q4, representing the child sexual assault units in Temple Street and Crumlin children’s hospitals, are being considered by officials in the Department of Justice and Equality. The necessary balancing of fundamental rights involved in the disclosure of sensitive personal records requires careful consideration from both a legal and operational perspective. The Minister expects to be in a position to address several concerns raised about this section by way of amendment as the Bill progresses through the Houses. For example, the Minister intends to accept one proposal raised in the submissions of Q4 and Rape Crisis Network Ireland, namely, the removal of all references to the competence of the complainant or witness to testify, as she is persuaded that counselling records are not relevant to competence. With regard to the specific amendments proposed, I thank Senators Jillian van Turnhout, Denis O’Donovan, David Cullinane, Trevor Ó Clochartaigh and Kathryn Reilly for their amendments. The Minister fully appreciates the points they have made. Senator Jillian van Turnhout’s amendments Nos. 35 and 43 propose a separate disclosure regime to apply to children. The Minister is concerned that difficulties would arise in applying two regimes simultaneously but will consider the particular protections applying to children as part of the review of this section. As to amendment No. 36, there are several difficulties with the definition of “relevant record” proposed. The proposed amendment deletes the reference to the prosecutor having sight or knowledge of the record, making it almost impossible to identify which records would be subject to a disclosure application and pre-trial hearing. Requiring, by definition, that the record has some probative or evidential value also raises the question of how this can be determined in advance of a pre-trial hearing and may create a presumption in favour of the disclosure of the record at a hearing. These are matters appropriate to the hearing. Amendments Nos. 37 to 41, inclusive, seek changes to the list of assertions in section 33(4) which, on their own, will not establish the relevance of a record, and the factors in section 33(9) which the court must consider in determining whether to disclose a record. These are issues which have also been raised in the submissions the Minister has received and the two subsections in particular are being reviewed. The Minister is minded to take on board some of the changes proposed. However, it is important to emphasise again that a careful balancing of rights is involved to ensure the disclosure provisions are constitutionally sound.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Senator for bringing forward these amendments. This question of introducing a statutory definition of consent has been raised by a number of groups, in particular those who work with and support the victims of sexual offences and also by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in terms of domestic and sexual violence. Moreover, this is an issue which does not appear to have received any significant consideration since Law Reform Commission's proposals in 1988. I know that the Minister is of the view that the question of providing a statutory definition of consent is overdue for review and that she has directed officials within her Department to undertake that work. There is a clear understanding of the arguments favouring a statutory definition, including the clarity and understanding it will bring, as well as the assistance it could offer jurors, particularly in cases that may be difficult to adjudicate. However, there are also concerns that a statutory definition of consent may mean the flexibility of the common law system would be lost. Aside from whether there should be a statutory definition of consent and if the answer is "Yes", what that definition should be, there are also a number of other questions which must be considered. Other common law jurisdictions have adopted different approaches to what is or is not consent. For instance, in the United Kingdom consent is defined with the addition of listing both evidential and conclusive presumptions about consent. While not defining consent itself, the New Zealand approach is to list the circumstances under which allowing sexual activity does not amount to consent. The Canadian model defines consent, as well as setting out those circumstances where no consent is obtained and those circumstances under which a defendant's belief that consent was given would not be a defence. While other jurisdictions share a number of similarities in their approach to the question of consent to a sexual act, there are differences, and Ireland should adopt a model appropriate to this jurisdiction. That is a complex matter which warrants a comprehensive review and appropriate consultation with those involved in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences. While that process is ongoing, the Minister is currently unable to accommodate Senator Denis O'Donovan's amendments today but, again, I thank him. The approach adopted in these amendments will also form part of the further consideration of this issue.
