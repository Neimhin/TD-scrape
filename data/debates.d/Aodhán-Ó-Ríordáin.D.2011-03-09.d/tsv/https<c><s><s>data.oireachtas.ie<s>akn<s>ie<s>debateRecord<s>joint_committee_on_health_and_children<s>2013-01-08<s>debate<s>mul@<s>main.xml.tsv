AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the expert witnesses for attending. Discussing whether suicidality should be part of the legislation is completely futile because it has to be part of it. Otherwise, the X case legislation we are bringing before the House and on which we must vote would not be in keeping with the Supreme Court judgment and the two referendums passed by the people. It would not be in keeping with the thinking on the X case, which was based on a suicidal 14 year old. I wish we could refrain from debating whether suicidal ideation should be part of the legislation because it has to be. If it were not, the legislation would not be in keeping with the Supreme Court judgment. On that basis, I ask Professor Casey, who has said legislation must be based on good medicine and fact, to note the fact that legislators must deal with the constitutional provisions laid down by the Supreme Court and the people. Given the fact that the threat of suicide will be encompassed by the legislation, how does Professor Casey believe it can best be dealt with by those practising in her field?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am not questioning anybody’s integrity. My point is that we have to legislate for suicide. It is not a question of whether people believe we should do so.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	As part of the X case judgment, which we were debating, in that eventuality-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	How does the professor feel the legislation can best be dealt with?
