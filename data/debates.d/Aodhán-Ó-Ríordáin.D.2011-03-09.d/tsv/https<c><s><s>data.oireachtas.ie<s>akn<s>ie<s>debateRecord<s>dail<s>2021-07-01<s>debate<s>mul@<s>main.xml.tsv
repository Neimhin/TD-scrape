AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I want to ask the Minister the status of the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019; her plans to proceed with the Bill; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister. She will agree with me that it is important that we put children and young people at the centre of the education discussion and for far too long that has not been the case. It has been remarked to me on a number of occasions that what the Department tends to understand better than anything else are teachers and buildings but that when it comes to young people and children, they are too often not at the heart of our education discussions. I want to pay tribute to the Minister on the leaving certificate discussions. She put the voice of the student at the heart of all those discussions. They were at the table, they were listened to and they were consulted with. At the end of the day, the Minister listened and acted on what they felt was best for their cohort. That is to the Minister's credit and we have had a better leaving certificate process as a result of that and the Minister's open-mindedness. A definite timeline for this would be appreciated and would represent progress.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the Minister's comments. We share the ambition of putting the child and the student at the heart of the education discussion. Schools have broken up for the summer. Yesterday would have been the last day for many primary schoolchildren. They are moving on to the next stage of their education and some of them are moving into second level. Can I ask the Minister about the commitment she gave a month ago on a catch-up fund? I was appreciative of the Minister's comments that Senator Bacik and I have been campaigning on this since last February and the Minister made a commitment on 3 June that a catch-up fund would be announced to enable children, not just in terms of a summer programme but over the course of the next year, to repair some of the damage that has been caused by the lack of in-school teaching. There was teaching and learning going on but as the Minister knows, much of it was outside of school and done remotely. Can I get an update on the Minister's intention to announce and fund a catch-up fund for next year?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This relates to the leaving certificate for next year. Has the Minister made any decisions or have plans been put in place for leaving certificate 2022? Will such decisions be made in a timely fashion so teachers, students and parents will know the position when schools return in September?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In the course of the conversations over the past few days about NPHET, advice, a question mark - although not a major one - was placed beside the potential return to school in September. Nobody expects that to be an eventuality but it has still been brought into the conversation. Would it not be a cleaner or better for the Minister to decide now to roll out leaving certificate 2022 exactly as the leaving certificate for 2021 has been rolled out, with a choice for students? Fifth year students have lost quite a number of months of in-school tuition in this calendar year. Would it not make more sense for the Minister to make the decision now that students going into sixth year next year would have the exact same experience as those who did the leaving certificate last month? We are not yet out of the pandemic and we cannot make any predictions about what will happen with variants.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I understand that the Minister needs to go through with the wide-ranging consultation with students, parents, teachers and other representatives. A number of months of in-school tuition have been lost to that fifth year cohort now going into sixth year. The July plans have already been delayed and NPHET is suggesting the potential, if everything went badly wrong, for a question mark over the reopening of schools in September. I appreciate that the Minister cannot make a definite decision on the floor of the House.Can we not keep within our decision-making parameters the potential for the exact same scenario to happen in 2022 as happened in 2021? Were the Minister to make an early decision in that regard, it would be greatly appreciated as we would not have to go through six months of campaigning to get to the very same point we reached six months ago.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This is the type of politics that people do not often see or comment on enough. It shows the positive side of this House, whereby a piece of progressive legislation is presented by the Opposition, in this case by Deputy Pringle following on from the work of former Senator Kelleher, and is accepted and supported by Government in an attempt to advance and improve the lives of a particularly vulnerable group. I thank the Minister for supporting the Bill. In respect of Irish politics, I would also say that we should be thankful that we do not have a mainstream political party in Ireland that plays the race card. Every other European country has one, but we do not. There are individual politicians who say stupid, ignorant things at election time. However, no mainstream political party to date has played the race card or the anti-immigrant card, outside of a referendum in 2004. We should cling to that and build on it. What every child, person and human is looking for is a sense of belonging, to feel significant, wanted and needed. In the history of this State, we often undertook an experiment of sameness, where we presented, through our education system, an experience of Irishness that made many children feel that they did not belong, were not needed and were not significant. I know of people in my community who were brutalised for the sin of playing soccer. I know that middle Ireland feels a little dismissive about the idea of a community that gets excited about disco dancing instead of Irish dancing. Generations of young people were taught by Christian Brothers who were, in many instances, deeply unhappy people. They were teaching in parts of the country that they did not want to be in and teaching children they did not understand. They were teaching a language, in the Irish language, that was completely alien to the experience of the children they were teaching. Within all that, we now have potential, through this Bill, to empower, enrich and lift every child with the experience of our Traveller people. I played a part in the recognition of Traveller ethnicity. As has been mentioned, it was a proud day in 2017 when the ethnicity was recognised of people who exist as part of this nation. The Minister mentioned in her speech that she felt the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 was progressive.It is but there is a provision in it that I hope she will agree needs to be amended. It provides for 25% of places to be kept for the children and grandchildren of past pupils. The problem for the Traveller community is that this would affect it disproportionately because if a child's father or mother did not go to secondary school, he or she would compete for the places at a disadvantage. I hope the Minister will support the Labour Party amendment to that Bill at some stage, as she said she will. In trying to seek significance or belonging, the power of having your culture and who you are reflected within the education system is incredibly emotional. It is incredibly emotional for a young person to feel he or she belongs. It is difficult for young persons to come to terms with the fact that they do not belong because of who they are and that there is nothing they can do about it. This causes internal frustration and anger and starts a lifelong quest for belonging that can sometimes be obtained in destructive or negative ways. With this Bill, we have an opportunity to change radically how we approach our education system. I impress on the Minister the necessity of having a teaching profession that reflects the children the teachers are teaching. We should have more teachers from Traveller, immigrant, working-class, disadvantaged and disability backgrounds so every child will feel significant and wanted and that he or she belongs.
