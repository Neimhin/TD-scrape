AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Labour Party Private Members' Bill provided for ten days' sick leave, and rising to 30. I suppose my party's concern with the Bill is that it is not robust enough and that aspirations, as has been suggested, from the Minister of State, Deputy English, and from the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, are not hard wired into the Bill. We want to delete the same lines and to insert, "An employee shall be entitled to up to and including 10 statutory sick leave days in a year, or such additional number of statutory sick leave days (if any) up to 30, as may stand specified from time to time by order of the Minister ..." The Minister would have within his or her power the ability to increase that to 30 days over a period of time, but we have to start with ten. That is our strong view. If the Minister of State does not accept the amendment, I would be happy to discuss it or to try to convince him about a period of time, but we intend to push it again on Report Stage. However, I am interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On our amendment, the circumstances are frustrating. It is a bit like talking to a residents’ group about a planning application in that what is in the planning application is what matters. What is in the legislation is what matters, not what the Minister of State said here or what the Tánaiste said, or what is said in any media interview about aspirations. If it is in the legislation, it is in the legislation. No Minister will be in breach of the law or regulations if he or she still stands over three sick-leave days in five, ten or 15 years, because it will be covered by the legislation. That is it. The Minister of State may aspire to increase the number to ten but it is not written down. That is not how we do business. It almost feels as if the Government views the sickness of an employee in terms of how it affects the employer rather than the employee. That is not how we should do our business, I contend. Following on from what Deputy Paul Murphy said, how did the Government come up with the number of days? How does it equate with the European norm? How are we supposed to do our legislative work if aspirations uttered by Ministers are not written down in black and white?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I do not wish to prolong the debate unnecessarily because we have work to do. The Minister of State has just committed to a review of how this legislation will affect employers over time. Can I assume the same review will investigate how it is protecting the health of workers? Our conversation already feels imbalanced.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 3:In page 5, to delete lines 23 to 25 and substitute the following: “(2) An employee shall be entitled to up to and including 10 statutory sick leave days in a year, or such additional number of statutory sick leave days (if any) up to 30, as may stand specified from time to time by order of the Minister under section 6.”.I will withdraw the amendment on the basis that I want to resubmit it on Report Stage. We are trying to work with the Minister of State and encourage him to strengthen the Bill and have our vision of ten days stitched into the Bill. Otherwise, we would not be in a position to support the Bill on Report Stage. We will give the Minister of State time to work with us and his officials in order that when we get through Report Stage, we will have a better Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 4:In page 5, to delete lines 30 to 32 and substitute the following: “(5) An employee’s entitlement to a statutory sick leave day shall commence from their first day of employment.”.We want to establish with this amendment that the employee's entitlement to sick leave commences from their first day of employment. The Bill as drafted will adversely affect a wide range of workers, including seasonal workers and special needs assistants. We want to ensure the entitlement is available from the first day of employment. If you are sick, you are sick.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am happy to withdraw my amendment on the basis of the comments made by the Minister of State.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I support what Deputies O'Reilly and Paul Murphy said. This is a basic provision in employment law across Europe. The rhetoric from today's meeting is a little disappointing. I am referring to the onus on the employer. As Deputy O'Reilly quite rightly said, we have heard these arguments before in respect of wage increases, minimum wage increases, etc. Every employer group told us Armageddon would occur, but it did not happen. What we have been arguing for and trying to bring into law is a basic provision to prevent people from feeling they have to go to work when sick and so they will get paid to feed their children. These provisions are basics across Europe. Let us tilt the argument back to where it should be. It should be about protecting sick workers.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 16:In page 6, line 27, to delete "3" and substitute "10".I am withdrawing it on the basis I will engage with the Minister of State and the Department. Hopefully, when it comes to Report Stage, we will have a better Bill. I am withdrawing the amendment on that basis, in order to resubmit it on Report Stage.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 18:In page 6, line 29, to delete "3" and substitute "10".
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 19:In page 6, to delete lines 31 to 35.This amendment proposes to delete the following part of the Bill:(c) The Minister shall not make an order—(i) to which paragraph (a) applies, before the expiration of 12 months after the commencement of section 5, or(ii) to which paragraph (b) applies, before the expiration of 12 months after the commencement of the immediately preceding order under this section.It proposes to get rid of the 12-month element of the Bill. The Minister should not have to wait 12 months before improving the conditions of workers.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I respectfully disagree.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	A reality of Irish life that people often forget is that we have a low-pay economy. A total of 23% of Irish workers are on low pay. We have the third highest proportion of low-paid workers in the OECD. People in Ireland are paid poorly. We do not have the same basic state provision of GP visit care as other European countries. The two elements that make the Irish context different are the number of people who are poorly paid and the poor provision of basic public services such as GP visits. If people get sick it will cost them money. It will cost them to go to the doctor and to get whatever the doctor prescribes. It may make more sense to people to pretend they are not sick and to go to work. The Minister of State has to get into the mindset of poorly paid workers. A disproportionate number of them are women. They will have to make this choice. They may decide they cannot afford to take the dip in their wages as outlined in the Bill because of the costs they will have to incur in attending a GP and purchasing medicines. We have to have a sympathetic Act that protects workers who have to make this horrible choice so we do not have in the workforce people who feel they have to go to work when they are sick as otherwise they could not pay bills or feed their children. I ask the Minister of State to respond to this. We have a pandemic of low pay in the economy. This is a recognised fact. We also have the cost of being sick in Ireland, which is much higher than anywhere else in Europe.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	They have free GP care.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We absolutely accept that this Bill will improve things. It should not be left unsaid that this is a welcome move by the Government. We are working constructively to try to improve it. However, it is a hell of a thing to worry about getting sick if you are in a low-paid job and you are genuinely terrified that you might be unwell because you cannot afford to be unwell and therefore you might hide that sickness and go to work because you cannot afford a dip in the wages or the costs that you would accrue for attending a GP. It is a hell of a thing to be that worried, looking at your children or at your bills and knowing that you just cannot afford to get sick. That is why we are bringing forward these amendments. Our fear is that this may be an underutilised provision because people just do not feel that it protects them enough so they go to work sick, hiding their sickness, pretending that they are okay, coughing in secret, telling people they are fine if they are asked, because the protections that are being brought in for them will just not work. Over a period, we may find, through the Department's analysis, that it did not work for the people that it needs to work for most. Those are the low paid, vulnerable workers in insecure work often exploited, who are disproportionately women, migrant workers and young people. We should, therefore, be trying to eliminate the fear in a household or a that person. That is why we put forward these amendments. I absolutely appreciate that employers have fears about their businesses but we live in a country with a low-pay epidemic and one which does not provide basic healthcare in terms of free GP care that other countries just take for granted. That is why we feel so strongly about these amendments.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 21:In page 7, line 4, after “day” to insert “which shall be their full daily rate”.I will resubmit this amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 23:In page 7, line 8, after “pay,” to insert “which shall be 100 per cent”.I will resubmit this amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 24:In page 7, to delete lines 10 to 13.I will resubmit this amendment.
