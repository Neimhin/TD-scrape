AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I wish to ask the Tánaiste about what is probably the biggest issue the Department will face over the coming months, which is rising energy prices and their impact on small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and the potential knock-on impact on employment. What sort of analysis has the Department made on the potential impact on employment in the coming months? What supports will be put in place to prevent businesses going under and for unemployment to increase as a result of that?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We need to see from the Tánaiste’s Department some kind of projections and worst-case scenario as to what sections of the economy are more at risk from higher energy prices and the knock-on effect of unemployment. I am sure that there are senior officials in his Department who can have some kind of an opinion as to what we are facing into in a worst-case scenario and what supports may be needed to be prepared for in such a scenario. Has the Tánaiste spoken to the energy regulator when it comes to energy prices right across the board, but particularly, in this instance, for small and medium-sized enterprises? Could the Department have a scheme that it may be able to roll out which could prevent job losses? It could have some kind of employment support scheme, as it had in the past. As the Tánaiste is aware, some businesses across Dublin, across the country and in my own constituency, did not survive the Covid-19 pandemic and some that did might not survive this crisis. I ask the Tánaiste again about the type of analysis that his Department may be doing as to worst-case scenarios.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that we have experience through the Covid-19 period as to what is necessary and we are going to have to do that at least but I hope the Department may be in a position to prepare for that worst-case scenario because it is going to need to have some plans in place that, hopefully, it will not have to revert to. If we have a situation where businesses go under and unemployment increasing, that is a winter that none of us really want to face into. As I have said, many of these businesses have been wounded during the Covid-19 period. Some of them came out of the financial crash ten years ago, Covid-19 has hurt them deeply and now they are facing into this. We do not want to see businesses struggling but, if they do survive, doing so on the basis of laying people off. While I understand that none of us can predict how long this is going to last or how deep it is going to be, we nonetheless need to give some comfort to businesses and to workers that they will not be left alone and stranded by any Government or potential Government scheme.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Labour Party has been saying for some time that Ireland needs a pay rise. What actions will the Tánaiste and his Department take to ensure workers across the board will get a pay rise? Not least of which the reason would be to tackle the cost-of-living crisis and energy bills they are facing in their households.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Herein lies the debate. What we have had for a very long time in Ireland is a disproportionate number of people on low pay. We also have a disproportionate number of people in insecure work. Perhaps the more we say this the more people will notice. A statistic I always tell the Tánaiste, and I know that he knows it, is that 23% of Irish workers are on low pay. He does not have to accept the recommendation of the Low Wage Commission. He could just decide to go immediately to a living wage of €12.90. It would have a knock-on effect throughout the economy. Many employers do not want to be accused of being a minimum wage employer. It would also increase wages all the while. There are also other issues. As the Minister knows, workers here are expected to pay for services for which other European countries do not expect their citizens to pay, such as GP care and childcare. Back to school costs are a classic example. We are in a bind as we have a disproportionate number of low-paid workers and families have disproportionate costs. On top of this will be an extra layer of expense during the winter. The pay rates of those on the lowest level are within the Minister's remit.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister mentioned again that he does not have to accept the recommendation. My point is that he could take it as the minimal rate by which he could increase it. He could increase it by more. He has to recognise the number of people on low pay and the costs they already have. We have had a cost-of-living issue in Ireland for as long as I can remember. There are various costs I have listed that people in Ireland are expected to pay that those in other countries do not. Those who come down from the North to live here are stunned by the fact they have to pay for school books and GP visits. These are very real things in the cost of living in Ireland. I have not mentioned housing or accommodation. I did mention childcare. The point on the minimum wage increase is that the Minister could take the recommendation as 80 cent at a minimum. He has already made a commitment to move to a living wage so let us do it. We recognise now that all of these elements in the Irish economy are building up on families who are not able to afford them. Those at the lowest level will need extra support from the Government. The living wage would be a realistic measure to take to address it and give comfort to those workers at the lowest level in our economy. Most of them are women and they are disproportionately migrants.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for facilitating this debate at this late hour. Last Wednesday, I attended a safety forum in Darndale. Safety forums across the northside are meetings that take place to discuss issues of concern in the local area, attended by local city council officials and gardaí. They are an effective way for local communities to raise their concerns with local representatives, city council officials, the Garda etc. The issue of this illegal commercial dump that has been in the general Darndale area for a number of years has come to a head. It has gone completely out of control. I visited the dump during the week with my colleague, Councillor Alison Gilliland, and was stunned by what I saw. There has always been a commercial dump, which has been an issue raised constantly with the city council, but now, possibly because of Covid but definitely in recent months, it is the number one issue in the area. It is out of control and dangerous. There are huge mounds of commercial waste and of earth. It is being overseen in an illegal fashion as a commercial entity. I visited it again today and rats were clearly visible running around this illegal commercial dump, which is in close proximity to people's homes. They are citing issues of ill health in the local community and are demanding that the council and other agencies of the State work to remove the dump and utilise the ground for more productive purposes. It could be used for housing, leisure facilities or commercial entities. There are any amount of possibilities for that spot of land, but currently it is a disgusting, unhealthy, illegal mound of commercial waste. My colleague, Councillor Gilliland, and other local councillors have called for a high-level task force to be set up. In other areas of my constituency such a task force has been successful. It has never been tasked with dealing with this size of a dump but that solution is being put forward as the way forward. On Monday, there will be a meeting of the local area committee on the north-central area of Dublin City Council. I believe the chief executive of the council has an interest in attending or, certainly, in being proactive about moving this material but it will need support from the Department and the Government because the council will not have the resources to do what needs to be done. Is the Department familiar with the problem? Is it liaising with Dublin City Council? If a task force is established and a way forward decided upon, will the Department be in a position to help the council to fund such a move for the benefit of the local community?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State and I am encouraged by what she said. It is true that this is fundamentally a responsibility for the local authority but what I get from her answer is that the Department is aware of the issue, that it is engaging with the local authority, DCC, and with An Garda Síochána on the issue. It comes to the stage now where it requires a multi-agency approach. It will require intervention and proactive action by An Garda Síochána to secure the site and it will require action by the local authority to clear the site and to ensure the future of the site is much more amenable. The Minister of State mentioned that in her response, so I am also encouraged by that level of vision within the answer. What the residents require, however, is to be told in good faith that their representations are going somewhere. What the Minister of State said is quite positive but they need to see action. They need to see moves by DCC to begin to move this material. It will need to see physical boundaries put around the compound and actions being taken. It will need to see a Garda presence and some kind of action plan on what the future vision is for this location. I would make the point that it has been said to me that this would not happen anywhere else and that this would not be allowed to happen anywhere else. There is a sense of a lack of faith in the agencies of the State and a lack of faith that they care enough. We do not want to go back to another one of these forums that is populated by public representatives, city council officials and gardaí to talk to the residents if nothing has been done within that time frame. While I appreciate the Minister of State's answer, I cannot but implore how important it is to the local community that it sees that the agencies of the State will work to remove something that is illegal, prosecute those who need to be prosecuted and allow this entire area to be used for the benefit of the local community, not for the destruction of that area so close to people's homes.
