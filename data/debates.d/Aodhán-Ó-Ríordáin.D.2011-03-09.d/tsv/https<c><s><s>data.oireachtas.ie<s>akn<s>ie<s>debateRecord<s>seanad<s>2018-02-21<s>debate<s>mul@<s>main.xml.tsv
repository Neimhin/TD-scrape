AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that the Leader has facilitated statements on housing. I hope to contribute to the debate. The issue of the sale of loans by Permanent TSB to a vulture fund has been highlighted in the media recently, particularly by Fianna Fáil. 
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is a good move because all of us in this House should be very concerned about this. When one comes across families who are in mortgage distress as a result of the actions of vulture funds, as many in this Chamber do-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is particularly difficult to make my contribution.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	May I start again?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is, actually.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	My problem is that, having just come from an RTÉ debate on education, I am back in principal mode. Students should be seated at all times.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that the Leader has facilitated the debate. It is a timely one. My second point is on multidenominational education. There was a Commencement debate yesterday on the five schools across the State that have limited enrolment, the Educate Together schools. There is an ongoing issue concerning the relationship between the State and schools that are selling off lands. With Councillor Deirdre Kingston, I met a group yesterday that is very concerned about the issue in Clonkeen. We are concerned about the lack of movement on Educate Together second level schools and on the baptism barrier. There is a considerable debate that needs to be had in this Chamber with the Minister on the relationship between the State and patron bodies and on the facts that patron bodies are selling off lands under the noses of boards of management, that boards of management are now being threatened with abolition, that primary schools that do not have religious patronage are now being told they can have only a certain number of students in September, and that Educate Together skills at second level are not getting support from the Department.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is news to me. That is great and much appreciated. I do not know what to say now. I talked about housing-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Leas-Cheann Comhairle just ruined my Facebook video.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I fully support the amendment and the sentiments expressed by Senator Norris. His amendment goes to the very core of our belief system and education. It brings to mind the vacuous statement that has been kicked around the place in recent years that Ireland should be the best little country in the world in which to do business. It really worries me that a Senator of such standing as Senator Norris must table an amendment like this one to scratch away at the very foundation ethos of what we are trying to build. Are we trying to create economic units to fit into an economy? Do we believe in the liberation of education? The problem is there is a suspicion or a preconceived idea, which may be unfair, that the Bill, the Government and the Department lean towards industry and commerce and not towards the liberation of the mind. With that in mind, my party and I have on three separate occasions, in three different ways, and with three different wordings tried to ensure a member from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, could sit on the board of the governing authority for each technological university. Unfortunately, my party and I have been rebuffed three times. We simply tried to find a counterbalance to the entrepreneurial spirit that will be enshrined in the Bill. The amendment tabled by Senator Norris and supported by Senator Grace O'Sullivan is crucial. It goes to the very heart of what we, in this Republic, fundamentally believe in when it comes to education. I believe that we should live in a society and not an economy. The purpose of education is to free the mind and not purely to produce entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurial spirit is fine and good. It is important for an economy but it is not the reason that we live. It is not the reason that blood courses through our veins or that hair stands up on the back of our necks. Amendment No. 5 is possibly one of the most crucial amendments that we will debate and it will be illuminating to hear the Minister of State's reaction.
