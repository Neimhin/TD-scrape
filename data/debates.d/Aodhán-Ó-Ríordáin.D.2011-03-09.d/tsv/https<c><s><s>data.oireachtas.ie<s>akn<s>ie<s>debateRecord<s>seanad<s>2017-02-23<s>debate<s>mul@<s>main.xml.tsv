AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I rise to raise two issues, one that has been raised on a number of occasions in this House, which has a campaigning zeal in it. It is an issue I raised directly with the Taoiseach when he was last in this House and I am aware the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is working steadily on it, namely, direct provision. This is not a divisive issue in this House. In fact, it is not a divisive issue in this Parliament. It is to our great credit as an Oireachtas that we do not have any political party or individual who plays the race card or who is advocating an approach other than a humanitarian one to the issue. It would be beneficial for this House to have the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, come to the House to give us his perspective on the progress of the implementation of the McMahon report. Members of all parties in this House would appreciate that opportunity and I call on the Deputy Leader to facilitate such a debate. The second point I wish to make, with the greatest respect, is in complete contradiction to what Senator Craughwell said. I find the current situation unbelievable given that we face into the teeth of Brexit negotiations which are very worrying and will have huge implications for this country. I held a public meeting in my constituency last night and some of the statistics that have been given by the European movement suggest that a worst-case scenario could result in the loss of 400,000 jobs in this country. The agrifood sector is under great pressure. A total of 20% of jobs in Cavan, Monaghan, Wexford and Waterford are dependent on the agrifood sector. In 2008 the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, went on a prolonged lap of honour while the country was on fire and I do not think it is appropriate for the current Taoiseach to do the same. He should be reminded that he is not just the leader of Fine Gael, he is the leader of this country. While the rest of us are fascinated with the personality competition that is going on at the moment between various individuals in the Fine Gael Party, what is happening in this country is much more important than the future leadership of that great Christian democratic movement in Ireland. What we need is a leader who can lead us into the Brexit negotiations and we do not need another lap of honour. My colleagues in Fine Gael can pant, tut and make all the noises they want but the reality is that this Chamber represents the entire country and when the Taoiseach was here last year he made a commitment to come back by the end of 2016. It is fair enough if his diary was full but every Member of this House would appreciate the opportunity to discuss with the Taoiseach the ongoing Brexit negotiations and to implore him not to go on a prolonged lap of honour and to take his responsibility as Taoiseach seriously in order that we face into the situation collectively as a country rather than from a partisan, party-political point of view. I am terribly sorry if my Fine Gael colleagues are offended by my remarks.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Charmer.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister of State and appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue. As with most Senators, I have family members abroad. Most Members will recall the dark days of the 1980s when contact was made via long distance telephone calls and we welcomed our emigrants home at Christmas time. It is often said that the cameras are always rolling in Dublin Airport at Christmas time when emigrants are returning but they rarely capture the images of heartbreak as people leave on flights to Britain or the United States in the new year.I am fully conversant with that situation and know exactly what it is like to have an empty chair at the table. It is a difficult reality that almost every family in Ireland has been through at one stage or another. I have a brother living in Canada and a sister in London.  We now find ourselves between Trump and Brexit. Trump's executive orders are fundamentally xenophobic and patently racist. On the other hand, we have a Brexit debate which is centred around the issue of immigration. We have an international, historic and moral obligation to tell the world the story of the Irish people. As we approach St. Patrick's Day and enter the most powerful rooms in the world, with Ministers travelling around the world, we need to reiterate the fact that Ireland knows better than anybody about emigration. We had a country of coffin ships with people seeking refuge as they fled conflict. Our country knows exactly what the suppression of rights is all about.  At this historic moment in time, the first St. Patrick's Day since Brexit and Trump, we have a moral and historic obligation to stand for something that is more profound than our own diaspora. Senator Lawless and myself have been working with the Migrant Rights Centre to correlate two issues: the 50,000 undocumented Irish in the United States; and the 26,000 undocumented workers here. Both issues are the very same - there is absolutely no difference between them. We who have been working on that project stand in solidarity with those who feel fearful at this time of great uncertainty.  Almost 50 years ago, in April 1967, at the Riverside Church in New York, Martin Luther King made his anti-Vietnam war speech. He said: "Yes, we must stand and we must speak." On St. Patrick's Day in that iconic venue there will be an event called "Irish Stand" at 7.30 p.m. that evening, featuring writers, actors and activists. The gathering will include people from the Waking the Feminist movement, the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as Colum McCann, Richard Schiff, Shaun King, Maeve Higgins and myself. I am calling on the Irish community in New York and elsewhere across America to support it. At the moment it is not good enough for us to speak only about our own diaspora because people across the world are facing into this new political reality. They are fearful, but they need to know that there is a country which lies between the great traditional powers of Britain and America whose people have a story to tell. It is deeper than just having a St. Patrick's Day parade. It is about the human condition, interconnectivity and realising that our forebears had to flee this land, while others are doing the very same today. On St. Patrick's Day it is our historic and moral responsibility to take that stand. I want everybody in this House to realise that there are people willing, able and ready to do so.
