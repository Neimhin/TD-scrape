AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Barry for proposing this Bill, which the Labour Party will be supporting. Oftentimes we come in here and try to make Government the enemy. Sometimes that is theatrics and sometimes there is a genuine reason behind it. In this instance, the Government has absolutely no defence. It has no defence in respect of this issue, the treatment of the Debenhams workers or the Duffy Cahill report, which, as has been said, has been sitting on an office shelf somewhere since 2015. It is absolutely indefensible for any Minister or Minister of State to stand in this Chamber and defend the fact that the recommendations of the Duffy-Cahill report still have not been implemented. It is absolutely inevitable that we will be back here again and again. As a result of the nature of the pandemic and the capitalist society in which we operate, companies will utilise this pandemic to force through redundancies. To deal with this on a case-by-case basis is to fundamentally fail the workers. The Minister of State can list the individual things the Government has done for the Debenhams workers, but to do so is to completely miss the point. Last November, Neasa Cahill and Kevin Duffy appeared before an Oireachtas committee. They said that company law did not need to be amended in order to implement the recommendations of their report. What did Government do in December? It asked the Company Law Review Group to review any company law that may need to be amended, despite the evidence that those who wrote the report gave to an Oireachtas committee. Now the Minister of State comes in here and insults the lot of us with a year-long delay to this Bill.  Every time we bring up issues of workers' rights, we are insulted by the Government. We were accused of virtue signalling when we brought in legislation on sectoral pay agreements. It was the same when we brought in a motion on youth unemployment and when we spoke about the lack of sick pay during a pandemic. What did the Government do? It said we will talk about it in six months' time. As we quite rightly said, no other sector of Irish society would have to wait so long - for six years - for the implementation of a report that does not go as far as this legislation. This is a reasonable report written by reasonable people which aims to prevent the very issue we are talking about today. In my own constituency, there are two instances of redundancies in Baldoyle affecting a total of 540 workers. How many more will there be over the coming months and years? Somebody in the Minister of State's position will trot in here and say that it is a difficult situation but that one must understand company law and that all of these individual circumstances are different. This will be said even though the Government has had a report since 2015 that would ensure that, in such circumstances, workers would not have to spend 400 days protesting to stand up for their rights. The Government has absolutely no defence.We in the Labour Party pay tribute to the Debenhams workers and other workers who, over many years, have taken a stand in this regard. We are sick, tired and sore of being forced to go down to picket lines with workers who should be sorted out at the start. There is no glory or honour from a Government point of view in saying it has respect for Debenhams workers or whatever other band of workers there may be in the future. The Government has the capacity and ability to sort this out now, so that other workers do not have to go through the same heartbreak in the future. What is the point of politics or legislative processes? What is the point of the over and back in this Chamber or of commissioning a report? What is the point in telling us that it will take one year or asking the Company Law Review Group to do its work when the Government does not do anything about a review for six years? It is absolutely indefensible. The Government has no defence. Once again, I and Deputies from other political parties will say the very same thing and we will get another response from another Minister or Minister of State who will say "Well, you know, we will have a look." As has been correctly said, we will hopefully get a resolution to the Debenhams issue. The Minister cannot come in here in some months' time when this inevitably happens again and say, with a straight face, that this is a particular situation, as the Tánaiste is so well-practised in doing. In any other aspect of public life or public policy, legislation can be rammed through in jig-time. This is why people sometimes lose faith in politics, Departments and Ministers. The Government asked the workers to put faith in the review and report and to trust the process, which the Clerys workers also did at one point, but six years after the report has been done, there is nothing. I suggest that the Minister come to the House next week. We will all forfeit whatever time is necessary for the Minister to implement the recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report so that we are not back here in a number of months' time dealing with what I fear will be an inevitable cascade of redundancies, for which companies will no doubt use the pandemic as cover. There are 540 such redundancies already in Baldoyle. If this was happening in Ballyhaunis, we would all hear about it. I ask the Minister to do his work. The Debenhams workers have done their work, having spent 400 days on the picket. None of us wants to see another band of workers go through the same thing. Six years is not good enough. I suggest that the Government do what it was asked to do six years ago by implementing the recommendations of the report. Do not insult the authors of the report by completely contradicting them only one month after they come before an Oireachtas committee.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This is a technical Bill which does exactly what it says on the tin. It gives the relevant Ministers power to enter into agreements with the SBCI to implement loan guarantee schemes. The reason for the Bill's introduction is to enable the Government to deliver the Brexit impact loan scheme. The cost to the Exchequer of the Brexit scheme will be a maximum of €29 million with up to €500 million in low-cost finance being made available to viable micro-SMEs and mid-cap enterprises. It aims to assist them to adapt their businesses to the challenges caused by Brexit. We have one amendment from Deputy O'Reilly, which aims to get the Minister to engage with the relevant stakeholders and groups regarding favourable interest rates from moneys loaned under the Act, which is fine. The Labour Party will support both the Bill and the amendment. I want to raise some concerns about the Bill, related schemes and the other existing schemes, which are not enough. There are businesses falling through the cracks. Many small businesses were hit by Brexit and then suffered the double whammy of being smashed by the pandemic. However, they do not qualify for support from any of the current Government schemes and are not suitable or will not qualify for this one either. My concern is that too many of these businesses, particularly micro businesses, will be thrown to the wolves as they fall outside the different schemes being rolled out. I want to use the example of a small Irish service business connected to tourism but not a tour operator, whose owner was in touch with me yesterday. His business is headquartered and pays tax in Ireland. He had turnover of over €2 million at its height, mostly services exports, and has a good chance of a return to that when he can resume. Due to the nature of the business, he took a serious hit and was preparing for restructuring due to the threat of a hard Brexit. Then the pandemic hit and his business was eliminated almost overnight. He employs dozens of people directly and a similar number indirectly. The core of the business is in Ireland but his service is dependent on travel. As soon as recreational travel returns, the business will be able to recover and expand. However, it has been savagely hit by the lack of income and the standing costs it has had to support over the past year. He feels the State is offering him next to nothing, however. He got rate support for which he is grateful. He applied for the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, but got nothing. When he applied for the Fáilte Ireland scheme, he was told by the Department he would get nothing. Under the terms and conditions of the loan scheme enabled by this Bill, he will also get nothing. If we do not support businesses like his and he is forced to close or is constrained in recovery, there is no guarantee that the business will be replaced by another Irish headquartered entity. The danger is we lose jobs, tax and revenue for lack of vision and flexibility in our supports structure. I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister on behalf of businesses like this. Hopefully, I am wrong and there is some scheme they can avail of which will help. Otherwise, viable firms like this could go to the wall. Small, medium and micro enterprises provide 70% of enterprise jobs. While we support this scheme and the Bill, it is important to remember at whom it is aimed. The Minister of State should make funds available for those firms which do not qualify for other schemes. No company should fold due to Brexit or the pandemic when there is a reasonable chance for it to regroup and rebuild its enterprise. It would be far cheaper to save existing jobs than to spend to regain others. I welcome positive engagement from the Minister of State on the constituent's business to which I referred. Hopefully, there will be a scheme available which will be helpful for similar businesses.
