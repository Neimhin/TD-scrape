AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I wish to ask about the ring-fencing of funds. Many of the suggestions presented by our guests make a great deal of sense. We should try to support them in whatever way possible. However, the Department of Finance always reacts very badly to any suggestion of ring fencing, which is does not like. Bizarrely enough, however, it has no difficulty in ring-fencing funds for horse and greyhound racing through legislation. I refer to the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, by means of which money procured via a levy which applies to every bet placed throughout the country is immediately placed in the horse and greyhound racing fund. When it comes to ring-fencing funding relating to mental health, children or anti-poverty strategies, however, the Department does not like it. Will our guests indicate how practical or justifiable they consider ring-fencing to be, particularly in the context of the fact that it is considered fine for horses but not for poor, sick or vulnerable people?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome all the guests. There are two ways of looking at the budget. One is to say that it has to meet the deficit target set out, which should be €3.1 billion. The other is to say that we can meet the targets by having a much less austere budget. Do the witnesses have a general opinion on what budgetary measures should be taken, considering that the toughness of the budget will have a disproportionate effect on carers and those parts of our society which depend so much on direct payments from the State? I get a sense from the IFA's submission and comments that there is a sense of hope or expectation that things might be turning or improving a little and that the agricultural sector can be a leader in the Irish economy to get us out of where we are. Could the IFA representatives expand on that a little as to how they feel matters are progressing? I will ask a controversial question on maintenance and college grants. I want to tease it out without being adversarial. I understand the IFA's position - the self-employed have a similar view - on the proposal that productive assets be taken into consideration for maintenance grants. We spend approximately €300 million on third-level grants. The suggestion is that productive assets of €750,000 would be taken into consideration. If that figure is far too low for the IFA's estimation, is there a figure that could be worked around - €1 million, €2 million, €3 million, €5 million? Or does the IFA have an opinion on the level of savings an individual might have to suggest that he or she does not need a maintenance grant to send his or her child to college? Somebody who had €250,000 in his or her bank account was entitled to everything the Department of Education and Skills could give to send his or her child to college. I am not deliberately trying to cause a row, but the best thing we can do is to toss around these ideas and see what the IFA's thinking is on this.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	May I make a comment on that before the other speakers come in on the broader questions? We are completely in agreement - nobody should ever have to make a choice between education and their livelihood. Any changes should be on the basis that those who demonstrably can afford to pay for the maintenance of their children in college should be asked to do so. It is just a question of finding the mechanism. I appreciate the IFA's point of view on the matter. We all want the first person in generations of a family to have the opportunity to go to university. But if that person is drawing from the same €300 million as others, bearing in mind all the other strains on the budget, we need to find a mechanism. It is not an issue solely for the IFA; it is also an issue for self-employed people. I went to college with people who came from the same area of Dublin as I did. They got college grants that I did not get because I came from a family with a PAYE worker. It is unfairly suggested that it is an IFA or farming issue. We need to find a mechanism whereby those with the ability to pay do so, but I accept Mr. Bryan's comments.
