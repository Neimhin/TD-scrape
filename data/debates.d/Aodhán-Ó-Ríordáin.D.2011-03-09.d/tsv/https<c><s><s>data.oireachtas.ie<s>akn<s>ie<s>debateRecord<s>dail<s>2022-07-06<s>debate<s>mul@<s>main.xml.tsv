AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 4, line 15, to delete “The” and substitute the following: “Subject to the adequate provision of resources and supports, by the Department of Education and the National Council for Special Education, the”.Due to the lack of time, I am happy to get the Minister’s response.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am happy to hear from the Minister.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	What we are trying to express here is the reality on the ground, which is that schools do not feel supported. I must strongly make the point that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, saw fit to malign four schools, two of which are in my constituency and all four of which are Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, schools.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Actually, what the Minister of State was said was not true. Indeed, she maligned them unfairly, without any evidence. She put forward an incorrect assertion that they were not engaging with the system in terms of what was expected of them. However, it is her form to punch down on vulnerable groups. I have not had the opportunity to engage with her on-----

AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----so strong about pressing this amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, let me be perfectly clear here what the issue is in terms of this argument.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is very difficult because schools sometimes feel completely unsupported in embracing issues, particularly when the actions of the Minister of State in the Department are part of the problem. That is what we are trying to achieve here. I absolutely stand over my comments. To be quite frank, only for the fact that we are focusing on children this week, the Minister of State with responsibility for special education would be facing calls for her resignation.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 3:In page 5, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:“(2) Where, following consultation with the Minister and having regard to any information provided to the Council by the Minister in relation to any planned additional provision of education for children with special educational needs and available lands and buildings, the Council remains of the opinion that there is insufficient capacity in an area for the provision of education to children with special educational needs, it shall prepare and submit a report on the matter to the Minister.”.I will give an overview of my amendments, and my colleagues will want to speak on theirs. First, in consultation with the Minister, which I appreciate, I am happy to accept the amendment to amendment No. 9. Amendment No. 3 inserts, "Where, following consultation with the Minister and having regard to any information provided to the Council [the NCSE] by the Minister in relation to any planned additional provision of education for children with special educational needs and available lands and buildings, the Council remains of the opinion that there is insufficient capacity in an area for the provision of education to children with special educational needs, it shall prepare and submit a report on the matter to the Minister." Amendment No. 4 relates to timing and states that, "such a notice shall issue no later than the 31st of March". The idea here is that it is unfair not to give a school enough time to open in September. Our contention is that later than 31 March would be too late. Amendment No. 6 states, "Prior to preparing a report under subsection (2), the Council shall consult with the Minister...". This relates to consultation, and it is important. In the briefing that was afforded to us by the Minister, and we very much appreciate that, this Bill is about truncating the process so we do not have an elongated process. However, it is still important that we have a list of those who we should consult. It is similar with amendment No. 9. The Minister has proposed an amendment to that amendment and we accept that. The other amendments are similar to that as well. I have given a broad sweep of what we are intending to do here. It is mainly about consultation and making sure the school is given the best opportunity to open in September. The timeline would be important there. We are accepting the amendment to amendment No. 9.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I moved the amendment for Deputy Ó Laoghaire.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is not in any way our intention to prolong the process. The briefing that the Minister's Department provided is very clear. It is trying to truncate the process and is trying to take simultaneous steps along the way rather than sequential steps. What we are saying here is very much that schools can prepare if it is something that needs to be utilised. The Minister has said she does not want to be in a position to utilise it unnecessarily and it is not the best way to go. Schools have to prepare. If a school opens a special class for the first time, it changes the dynamic of the schools. It is a good and positive change. It is something that will benefit everybody, but schools have to be empowered to embrace that change. They need to know how to change properly and well. That is what our amendments are trying to achieve. We are in no way trying to exhaust the scenario or to make the Bill in front of us redundant because it effectively does what the previous Act would have done. I wish to make that case strongly. I appreciate where the Minister is coming from on the issue of the 31 March cut-off and emerging situations. I can appreciate that the Minister wants the leeway to engage with schools in the months of April and May. I am happy to withdraw the amendment. However, I wish to state that the point of the amendment is that we are not in a situation where schools have no time. I think the Minister will accept that it would be better, in the majority of cases, that such a decision or such an introduction be made well before the month of April. I can appreciate that the Minister would want the leeway within legislation to be able to act in an emerging situation. On that basis, I will withdraw amendment No. 4.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 4:In page 6, line 5, after “person” to insert the following: 	“, such a notice shall issue no later than the 31st of March preceding the new school year and shall not be issued during the months of July and August”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 5:In page 6, line 15, after “Minister” to insert “, following consultation with stakeholders,”. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 6:In page 6, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following: 	“(4) Prior to preparing a report under subsection (2), the Council shall consult with the Minister, bodies representatives of patrons, national associations of parents, recognised school management organisations and recognised trade unions and staff associations representing teachers.”.
