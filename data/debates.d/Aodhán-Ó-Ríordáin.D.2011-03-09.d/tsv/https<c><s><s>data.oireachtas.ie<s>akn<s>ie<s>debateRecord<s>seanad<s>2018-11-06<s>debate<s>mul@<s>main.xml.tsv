AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister of State. He is aware of and familiar with the issue of the accident and emergency department at Beaumont Hospital. I have visited it on several occasions and I am sure he has also done so. The staff of the department are dedicated and hardworking, but there is a need to upgrade the physical environment in which they operate. There are other issues relating to the department of which all present are aware, such as the ageing demographic in the area, staff requirements, etc., which must be addressed by the Department of Health. However, it has long been acknowledged that the need for a new emergency department is a top priority for the staff. In the dying days of the previous Government, a plan was formulated with senior hospital officials for a €45 million refurbishment of the emergency department. The Minister of State has made me aware that good news is forthcoming relating to the plans for the department and I know that €100,000 has been allocated in respect of the design phase. However, I have searched for a reference to the €40 million which the Minister of State indicated has been allocated to the refurbishment or reconstruction of the accident and emergency department and cannot find it. Deputy Brendan Ryan tabled parliamentary questions on the matter on my behalf. The responses state that it is a matter for the HSE. I have searched the capital plan for mention of the project but cannot locate any references to it. Where is the €40 million allocation the Minister of State announced on several occasions? If it exists and is contained in the capital plan, I ask for an indication as to the timeline for the refurbishment of this facility, which, as the Minister of State and I know, is badly needed by communities on the northside.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for the reply. There is a bit in his reply which is not in my copy, which I find a bit strange. The Minister of State made reference - which is not in the reply I have here - to restrictions on the site or issues relating to the site. Perhaps the Minister of State might expand on that please. On the timeline, I am not sure if they are written in notes that he has done himself from his own knowledge of dealing with officials or if there is a reason the two scripts are different, but I would be interested in getting that information in written form if that is in order.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is that for the emergency department?
