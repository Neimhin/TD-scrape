AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I wish I had 45 minutes, not just four. We should look into the idea of producing a committee report on the issue of trauma, particularly in primary and secondary schools. I thank Dr. Downes for his presentation. I do not know where to start. Does he accept that we cannot solve educational disadvantage within the school structure and that there is a large number of issues that happen before children ever get to school? We are familiar with the issue raised in the Hart and Risley study and the fact that if we take two three-year-olds from different backgrounds, as I often cite, with one three-year-old from a disadvantaged background and another three-year-old from a more mainstream background, there is a difference in their oral language capacity. Significant investment has to happen before a child ever gets to primary or secondary school. I refer also to the way that we structure the system, in particular, at second level, where it is not a State system but a State-funded system. We, therefore, have all this competition between schools, which means that there are schools that parents are trying to get their children into, there is a kind of layering underneath that and at the bottom there tends to be a school that has a disproportionate number of Traveller children, migrant children, children with special needs and children who have been suspended or expelled from other schools.It is not fair, but that is the system we have constructed. It is not a State system, but a competition system, and perhaps Dr. Downes would like to comment on that aspect.  Could he also speak about trauma and the issue of addiction? Having worked in that area, I know that addiction, especially with substance abuse, involves people trying to deal with pain. We do not like talking about pain and trauma in Irish society, because it is often felt to be an issue of failure. People, however, are suffering pain and walking around with pain that has been there a long time. It can also be intergenerational pain, which has been handed down to people. Those are some of my initial thoughts that I wanted to set out for Dr. Downes. I referred to the preschool element, that children do not live in schools and the question of how we can bridge the gap between what happens in schools and activity in the wider community. I also spoke about how structural inequality is built into the system, and we are always going to struggle with this issue until we crack that aspect. I finished by referring to the need to make the link between trauma and addiction and having a proper conversation on that connection.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the delegates for their presentations.I am sure I speak for everybody on the committee when I say that the political day can be quite long. In my own case, I will be here until 11 p.m. or midnight. This presentation will be the highlight of my day. I mean that sincerely. We are now looking at the education system in a different way because of Covid. It has exposed many things that do not work. One of a few things that gets me extremely wound up is the annual league tables. Having taught in school myself, as many people here have, it is no reflection of what success is. Success for some students is being in school every day. Success in some cases is being able to interact with somebody, to speak and to raise one's chin when addressing somebody else, to listen and be respected, and to show that respect to somebody else. That is why I am critical of it. In this committee, we might have the opportunity to form a new education system. If Ms Cotter was given the opportunity to start again, with all the money and opportunity in the world, what would she do with it? Mr. O'Leary is thinking about it and it might be a lot to throw at him. Is there an international comparison to the school that he has in Europe or the OECD or another comparable education system, into which the Cork Life Centre would fit neatly? The joke about the Irish education system is how many people in the Department of Education it takes to change a lightbulb, and they will answer by asking "Change?" As in, it does not change things, it has received things this way and they will always be thus. How has this system worked in other jurisdictions? How would Ms Cotter like to see things change if she had a blank sheet?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is a big question.
