AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. MacSharry and Ms Hayes for attending this meeting.  I would first like to hear from Mr. MacSharry and Ms Hayes their understanding of the term "public interest directors".
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yet, in response to previous questions, the witnesses cannot identify how their approach is different from that of other bank directors.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	By the public interest, does Ms Hayes mean the wider economy?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I think most people listening to the previous replies will be disturbed to hear phrases such as "consensus decision making" and "very few votes".  Do the witnesses think the public would find that a bit troubling in terms of the witnesses' role, how they perceive that role, how they view the public interest and their interest in the wider economy?  However, when they attend board meeting, there is a level of consensus between what the witnesses think and what other bank directors think in terms of decision making.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is there ever a vote on any matter?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. MacSharry think that the public who put their faith in him battling on their behalf will find that a bit strange?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It was stated, almost as an achievement, that 80% of the mortgages are performing loans.  Does Ms Hayes consider a loan that is in negative equity to be a performing loan, even if the mortgage is being repaid and there are no arrears?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Most people would find that statement strange that the 80% of performing loans, includes the negative equity loans.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is the problem with statistics.  Mr. MacSharry states that 80% of mortgages are performing loans.  However, most ordinary members of the public who are looking to him to battle on their behalf would look at that statistic and wonder that the 80% contains mortgages in serious negative equity which can be repaid, but could hardly be described as performing.  I can only imagine the difficulties that the remaining 20% of borrowers are in.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In respect of those loans, I think there was a play on words or a misunderstanding of the phraseology when we discussed write-offs, write-downs and debt forgiveness.  Most people want to know the absolute definition and how the witnesses define the difference between write-off and debt forgiveness.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is that the way the system worked or is it the way the system will work as a result of the current mortgage crisis?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Have there been write-offs in the institution in which Mr. MacSharry is a public interest director?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is not necessarily a change in policy, it is just how things are done.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	So it is not a reaction to the current mortgage crisis?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I would like both witnesses to respond to questions on the overarching policy.  There has been no change in policy, effectively.  There has been on an individual, case-by-case basis but there is no overarching change in policy as a result of the mortgage crisis.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There is no overarching policy difference?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The variable rate went from 5.19% to 4.5% in recent months.  Is that correct?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	One of my constituents tells me she is being punished for the stupidity and greed of the decision makers in Permanent TSB who sold too many tracker mortgages.  Do the delegates agree?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Given what happened during the boom and bubble years, when all of these tracker mortgages were being sold, do the delegates not agree that it amounted to stupidity and greed?
