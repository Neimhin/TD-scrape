AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will second that.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell has been critical of my use of my phone in this Chamber so I want to make sure I build bridges by seconding her amendment to the Order of Business, like a good student.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I hope that is done now. On the question of housing another debate with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government would be beneficial and important.Senator Humphreys and I have discussed the importance of reinstating the rent-to-buy scheme. It was available ten years ago and allowed people to raise enough money for a deposit while still renting. I refer to that stuck generation who still live at home even though they are in their 20s, 30s and 40s. The scheme allowed for the entire rent paid for the previous three years to go towards a deposit. It meant one did not have a situation where people who were renting had to try to save for a deposit at the same time. Before the economic crash, the rent-to-buy scheme worked for quite a number of people and I believe the scheme should be reintroduced. The Labour Party will include such a proposal as part of its pre-budget submission. We should proactively work with city and county councils to reintroduce the scheme.  I want to refer to US border policy and the current practice of separating families at the southern border of the United States. A number of years ago I called Donald Trump a fascist. One thing that clearly identifies a person as being fascist is to pick on a very vulnerable group, dehumanise them, blame them for everything and treat them in the most appalling manner. Sadly, such disgusting political behaviour has begun to spread because recently, the Italian Government issued statements about the Roma community who live in Italy. We should not be surprised about what has happened at the southern border of the US because it follows a travel ban, loads of rhetoric and the fact that Donald Trump has called illegal immigrants animals. I have to hand the invitation that all Members of the Oireachtas received by post from the chargé d'affaires of the United States Embassy. Of course there is no US ambassador to Ireland because that country has not bothered to give us one. The chargé d'affaires has invited us all to drink - I assume champagne - and to eat sausage rolls on 3 July to celebrate US Independence Day on 4 July. Bizarrely, the event is entitled "United We Rock". Earlier we had a briefing with an American immigration lawyer, Ms Fiona McEntee, as well as Senator Lawless, who obviously also feels passionately about this issue. Earlier, there was representation from every political party in the House, which I was delighted to see. I am very taken by the strong statement made by the Tánaiste and by the motion tabled in this House by Fianna Fáil. I believe it is time for us to collectively and with one voice, given what is happening on the southern border of the United States, to refuse point blank to attend the reception and tell the chargé d'affaires the reasons we are not attending it.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It would be a small gesture in response to a big issue. We can all see what is happening with Brexit, which has anti-immigration sentiments. We also have Trump and we have seen what has happened in Italy. In addition, after what has happened recently with our referendum and the referendum that took place a number of years ago, people look to us to stand for something better. Let us consider our history of coffin ships and Irish people being forced to emigrate to places all around the world, we must tell the chargé d'affaires in the American Embassy that no Member of the Oireachtas will attend his reception for 4 July.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 35:In page 24, line 9, to delete “school;” and substitute the following:“school, or by virtue of his or her family relationship with a member of the board or a teacher or other member of the staff of the school;”.The amendment speaks to an issue within the Bill which gives permanence-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I accept that. The amendment relates to the provision within the Bill that allows for children, grandchildren or family members of past pupils to be given a level of priority when seeking access to an oversubscribed school. There are two amendments on this in two different sections that relate to it but it is very much the same point. This particular section makes the point about family members. It is connected with another section in the Bill. It is the same point I am trying to make. It is connected to the children and grandchildren issue which I will raise later. There is a provision in the Bill that 25% of places in schools can be reserved for children or grandchildren of past pupils. The Minister knows my point of view on this because I have raised it before. I do not feel it is right that children who are trying to access a school on the same basis as everyone else should be disadvantaged because they are not a family member of a past pupil. It is not an unreasonable proposition. It is completely unreasonable that it is in the Bill. It places certain children at a disadvantage to other children. Nobody wants to have an oversubscribed school. Everybody wishes we could have places for everybody. In that scenario, what the Minister is proposing is that family members of past pupils should have priority. We are not talking about siblings. We have no difficulty with siblings. We are talking about children and grandchildren as is outlined in the Bill. Inevitably, if one's parents did not go to second-level school, as some people in the Chamber might be familiar with, or if one's grandparents did not go to second level school, which I am familiar with, one is at a disadvantage. If one is a Traveller child or does not come from the immediate area or from the country, one is also at a disadvantage. The Minister may deny it but I will say anyway that these measures are in the Bill at the behest of the fee-paying private school sector because it has been lobbying every political party in the Oireachtas extensively for many years on the issue. The sector feels strongly about keeping a royal bloodline of succession going through its schools to maintain the old school network of fundraising. It means that sons and grandsons of former students of certain fee-paying boys' schools or daughters or granddaughters of certain fee-paying girls' schools can still have a connection with the school and still fundraise and all the rest of it. It is elitist, odious and wrong. It is only there at the behest of that sector. I remind the Minister - he was at the Cabinet table - that the Labour Party vehemently opposed this measure under Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and tried to delete it. There was a compromise of 10% but this measure is the reason the legislation stalled and did not get past the Cabinet in the last Government. It is the reason we are only discussing it now. While we all have to accept the constitutional reality about religion, etc., and there are measures in this Bill to try to change that, it is absolutely unconscionable that we would again allow the fee-paying private school sector to walk through the open door it seems to have with Cabinet members and get what it wants in this Bill. It is absolutely wrong. The Minister probably knows it is wrong. If he goes with this he will not get the emails from people in that sector. Those people are very powerful and influential and they normally get what they want. In this Oireachtas we should facilitate a Bill that speaks to the majority. I think the majority of people in this country did not have a parent or grandparent who went to the same school and they would find the measure elitist and wrong. I am interested to hear the Minister's comments as I will press the amendment. It will be interesting to see how other people react to it and I will call out those who do not support this. I feel more strongly about this measure than anything else in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I defer to the southsider on that score.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I was wondering when she was going to refer to the amendment.
