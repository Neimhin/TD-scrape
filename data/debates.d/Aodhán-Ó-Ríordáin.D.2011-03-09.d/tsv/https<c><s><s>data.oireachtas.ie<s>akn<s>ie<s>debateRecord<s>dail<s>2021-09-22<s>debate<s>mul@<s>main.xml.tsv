AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Michael Barrett, Richard Bennett, Carol Bissett, James Buckley, Paula Byrne, Caroline Carey, John Colgan, Jacqueline Croker, Liam Dunne, Michael Farrell, David Flood, Thelma Frazer, Michael French, Josephine Glen, Michael Griffiths, Robert Hillick, Brian Hobbs, Eugene Hogan, Murtagh Kavanagh, Martina Keegan, Mary Keegan, Robert Kelly, Mary Kennedy, Mary Kenny, Margaret Kiernan, Sandra Lawless, Francis Lawlor, Maureen Lawlor, Paula Lewis, Eamon Loughman, George McDermott, Marcella McDermott, William McDermott, Julie McDonnell, Teresa McDonnell, Gerard McGrath, Caroline McHugh, Donna Mahon, Helena Mangan, James Millar, Susan Morgan, David Morton, Kathleen Muldoon, George O'Connor, Brendan O’Meara, John Stout, Margaret Thornton and Paul Wade. These are the 48 names of those who died 40 years ago in the Stardust fire. Hundreds were injured. We do not know the cost in terms of trauma, heartbreak, marriage difficulties, suicide and addiction, but it is huge. I am asking about the cost of what the families are looking for in terms of ensuring the inquiry into the Stardust fire, which cost all these lives and caused all the pain, can finally be set up.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for the reply. Nobody, certainly not me, wants an unseemly political row over what is an intensely traumatic and sensitive issue. The families, however, feel the funding has not been made available to their satisfaction. There is the potential for 47 families not to be involved in the inquest if things continue as they currently stand. While I understand the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, is not the decision maker in this regard, I urge him to ensure that he speaks to the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, and ensure this inquest can continue and that we will not have any cloud hanging over it. We all want an inquest to begin and the truth to be found in good faith on all sides. What we do not want is to have a row over money, because money really is irrelevant when you consider the list of people who should still be alive today. All of them were young enough to be alive today. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, to make that case and for this to be resolved.It is the last thing any of the families want to be talking about and I am sure it is the last thing the Minister of State and the officials in the Department want to be talking about in terms of the Stardust fire inquest. They do not want it said that before the inquest began there was a row over money which was not forthcoming from the Department.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for his comments. I acknowledge the work put into the Bill by my colleagues, Deputy Bacik, and Senator Moynihan, our housing spokesperson. We appreciate that the Minister is not opposing the Bill and some of his comments reacting to the Bill are welcome. Some of the commentary made outside this House, however, has been particularly disappointing. My colleagues referred to that earlier.It just makes us all wonder where is the priority of Government. Whom in the housing market is it actually trying to protect? There is no equivalence between the danger that the renter faces and the danger that a landlord faces. I wish the Tánaiste and Taoiseach would realise this. It is a bit like when we have the debates on low pay and workers' rights. My colleague, Deputy Nash, will conclude the debate for the Labour Party and he knows well that whenever we talk about legislation to strengthen workers' rights, somebody always asks, "What about the employer?" We end up with 23% of workers in low pay because resisting giving a worker that right inevitably leads to that worker having less stake in the economy and not having that level of dignity because the legislation always seems to fall down on the employer's side. In response to the comments that the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach made, I say that renters could lose their home. There is no equivalence between the danger of a renter losing his or her home and a landlord losing some money. In Irish history classes as children we are taught about the Land League and the very basic rights it was seeking of fixity of tenure and fair rent. These things are not consigned to the history books. We have history lessons in here all the time from flag-wavers in different parties. They are some of the most basic foundations of the decency that we were hoping to achieve in a republic. There is a sense that renters are some kind of failures who have not got themselves on the property market, their lives are somehow disorganised, they have not made a success of things or they are young and will probably move out at some point. We need to recalibrate and recast our collective brains around the fact that many people will rent for their entire lives. The Tánaiste and Taoiseach saying that we need to be mindful that a landlord might lose some money out of this makes some of us in opposition wonder if they really get it and highlights where the power really is. As Deputies, we have all spoken to people in fear of losing their homes. It is a very real fear. The potential of losing one's home is a terror. That is why I am so proud that Deputy Bacik has stood by her by-election commitment to introduce legislation in this House to protect those rights. We need to collectively rebalance our priorities in this area.  We appreciate that the Minister is not opposing the Bill. Legislation can always be improved and we take that process in good faith. However, it is a commentary on those in senior positions in this Government that when it comes to the suggestion of having absolute protections for renters what jumped into their head first was the profit margins of landlords or the money that landlords might lose out on. This is an issue the entire Government needs to reflect on.
