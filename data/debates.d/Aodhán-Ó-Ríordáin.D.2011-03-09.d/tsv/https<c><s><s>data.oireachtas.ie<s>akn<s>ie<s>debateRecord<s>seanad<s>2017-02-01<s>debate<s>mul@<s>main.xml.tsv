AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am proud to support Senator Gerald Nash's Bill. I congratulate him on the work he has done to bring this important legislation before the House. At its heart is an essential understanding of what equality really means. Equality is not a sense that one privileged group in society can hand down rights to another in society. That is not what equality means. It is not in the gift of one group to allow another to be themselves. Equality is very different. It is an understanding we are all equal in every sense and that if any group are deemed or perceived to be lesser, we will do everything in our power to override, undermine, fix and change that understanding. In the past few years when the Labour Party was in government with Fine Gael, we managed to achieve quite a number of things in the sphere of LGBT rights. Marriage equality is an obvious one, as is the Children and Family Relationships Act. There are now mandatory anti-homophobic and anti-transphobic policies in all schools and we also passed the Gender Recognition Act and amended section 37 of the Employment Equality Act. These were five commitments made by the Labour Party which were achieved in government. What we are doing is acknowledging that while we have achieved a huge amount in the recent years, we must right the wrongs of the past. We have to admit that our legislative provisions before 1993 were wrong and that they undermined people's rights. We have to acknowledge this as a state and apologise for it. The legislative provisions at the time and the constitutional provisions, until very recently, made people feel that they were lesser beings. They made people feel second best, not full and complete parts of this republic. I say this in the context of the current situation worldwide because often we can be quite complacent about the advancement of human rights and the equality agenda in this state and across Europe. As we look around the world today, we see the new political dispensation in Russia and the new political situation in the USA, where the Vice President has stated openly his belief LGBT people can be corrected by some bizarre form of medical intervention. That is the new political dynamic we are facing in the United States of America. We are saying quite clearly in Seanad Éireann today that this republic, on the edge of Europe, believes not only do LGBT people not need to be corrected but that the fact that LGBT people were not full, complete and equal members of this republic in the past is something for which we must apologise. We must be absolutely determined to ensure we will advance this agenda further. It is not correct to suggest that because we had a successful marriage equality referendum or because other legislation has been passed - even this valuable Bill - it will make it easy for members of the LGBT community to come to terms with themselves and come out to their family and friends in various parts of Ireland. There is, unfortunately, still a very dark road ahead for many young and not-so-young people who still feel as if they are living in an Ireland that does not accept them. It is like saying that because the Civil Rights Act was passed in America in the 1960s, African Americans are completely equal in the eyes of all citizens and states in America. That is not the case.  What we must do in this republic and the Houses of the Oireachtas is ensure every single Bill that we can pass or Act that we can correct is so passed or corrected. We must also apologise for the wrongs of the past. Just like Senator Gerald Nash, I sat my leaving certificate examinations in the early 1990s. It is unbelievable to think that at the very same time my contemporaries or people older than me were criminalised for being who they were and for the love they felt. I know that the younger generation - those younger than us - find that absolutely unbelievable. What was remarkable at the time of the referendum was the fact that young people, regardless of background, gender or from where they came, found it remarkable that before 1993, engaging in homosexual activity was a criminal act.I know that the Minister of State feels strongly about this issue. I congratulate him for the work he has done heretofore in his equality brief. We have met on a number of occasions to discuss various issues. He is a person with a deep commitment to equality. As Senator Gerald Nash said, when issues such as this come before the House, there is often a temptation for Governments to pick holes in things. There is sometimes a temptation for Opposition parties to play politics. In this instance, the Minister of State will acknowledge that Senator Gerald Nash has brought forward legislation that is well crafted and has the right motivation behind it. What the Minister of State and his office can do is take it in that spirit and if it needs to be tweaked, changed or improved, that ccould be done at a different stage of the legislative process.  The Members of this House can stand together proudly, collectively and across party, in this republic and send a message to the rest of the world. Let us not pretend that this agenda is going in the same direction in every single part of the world because it is not. It is going backwards. It is going backwards in America, Russia and across the world in many respects. If this House was to restate its absolute commitment to equality for our LGBT brothers and sisters across this land, it would be a powerful symbol at this time. I commend Senator Gerald Nash for the work he has done and my Labour Party colleagues for supporting the Bill. I commend Senators across the House who are standing in solidarity with the Bill and the Minister of State's endeavours to bring this issue to the fore. It will mean an awful lot for people who lived in the shadows before 1993. None of us can understand what a measure such as this passed in the House today will mean for people who lived in those dark days.
