AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will raise two issues, the first of which is child poverty. There have been a number of requests made this morning and I agree that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs should be invited to come to the House to discuss the issue of mother and baby homes. In the past few weeks I have found the noise in the Houses on the issue of water charges distressing. One sees images of Deputies and Senators with scraps of paper surrounded by other parliamentary colleagues and there have been discussions of the threat of an election and the possibility that the issue will cause the collapse of the Government. An incredible amount of energy has gone into discussing the issue. It would be refreshing if the issue of child poverty created the same amount of heat, excitement and enthusiasm in all political parties represented in the House. It would be refreshing to witness a politician in the Houses with a scrap of paper discussing how the issue of child poverty could be adequately addressed and tackled and to have those surrounding that individual saying it is something on which we could go to the country. It is of fundamental importance to the survival of the Republic. Anybody who believes in the real meaning of the word "republic" would take the issue of child poverty that seriously. However, the issue which generates that effect is water charges. It is the issue that has got people excited. On the issue of child poverty, I want to make a practical suggestion that the Minister be invited to come to the House to discuss her vision for the ongoing area-based childhood, ABC, programme which encompasses a number of initiatives, including in my constituency the preparing for life scheme in Darndale. There are 15 such schemes across the country. I would like to have the Minister's input on how she believes the schemes that tackle child poverty and empower parents can be enhanced in the coming years. Like other Senators, I raise the issue of Chechnya and LGBT rights. This was the first country in the world to openly vote in favour of marriage equality. We have a number of things of which we can be proud in this country in promoting LGBT rights across the political spectrum. Most recently, my colleague, Senator Gerald Nash, has been attempting to push that agenda further in this Chamber. We are a beacon of light for the world when it comes to LGBT rights. It is important when the Vice President of America wants to roll back on LGBT rights that we stand firmly in opposition. In Chechnya there are reports that camps and detention centres are being established and that young LGBT males, in particular, are being rounded up and sent to them. It is important we take a stand against this. I respectfully ask that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade be asked to come to the Chamber to discuss the issue in order that we can have a proper conversation with him about how he can discuss the issue with the Russian ambassador to this country because we are a beacon of light when it comes to dealing with certain issues. This is a country which has a proud recent record of promoting LGBT rights. It is something on which we should not be behind the door when speaking about how we can play our role in the international fight for LGBT equality.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Senator Mullen walks on water.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Labour Party and I support the Bill, but before our friends in the Gallery from the vintners association get too excited I wish to state on the record I am not a fan of that association or what it does. Its influence over Irish politics is far too powerful, and its opposition to the injecting centre proposal is at best misguided and at worst miserable. We have an obsession with alcohol in this country which is dysfunctional. It is the cause of a high percentage of domestic abuse, sexual assault and rape cases. Two people a week in Ireland die from fatal overdoses of alcohol. These are not people who get so drunk they fall in front of a car, these are people who drink so much that they die. It costs the HSE approximately €3 billion every year and if one goes to an average accident and emergency department any night of the week one realises why this is so. I wince when I hear politicians speak about the pub being the centre or focal point of a community. If this is the case we have gone seriously wrong. I remind people that the GAA, when it was established in 1884, was as much an institution to tackle the abuse of alcohol among young people as it was to re-engage people with the national sports. I will put my cards on the table. I have a vested interest as I drink and I partake in a pint or two. However, I am also a republican and on this basis I inform the House that as someone who has been a public servant and paid from the public purse since March 2000, as a teacher, a principal of a school, a Deputy, a Minister of State and a Senator, in all that time I have started my working day with a Christian prayer. In every place I have worked, in my school, in the Dáil and now in the Seanad, as a public servant every single day my working day has begun with a Christian prayer. I am paid from the public purse now, as I was when I was a teacher. I absolutely believe in the separation of church and state. This is why I and my party support the contention that if people do not want to drink on Good Friday it is absolutely their religious right not to partake in alcohol on Good Friday.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	People in my family feel very strongly about what they consume with regard to food on Good Friday and Ash Wednesday. It is something they do because of their strong religious beliefs. I will not belittle anybody. In fact, I was very impressed by Senator Joe O'Reilly's speech. Despite the fact he was interrupted by number of people in the Chamber, I am quite impressed that somebody would stand against the grain and make the case for the retention of the law as it is, although I do not agree with his reasons. As somebody who fundamentally believes in the separation of church and state, this is not the big issue. Our churches still have a huge influence over our hospitals, health system and education system, and there are bigger issues that need to be contended with. I must accept the issues raised by my colleagues in Sinn Féin on workers' rights, and agree with the representatives from the trade unions who have also made these cases. It is a low-paid industry where people generally start on very low pay, and it is a vulnerable type of work. By its very nature, the individuals employed in the industry deal with people who have had too much to drink. It is something of which we must be mindful. In this regard I am thankful we did not ram through the legislation in one day and we are taking the time to consider it more fully. I will summarise my few points. Our national obsession with alcohol is dysfunctional and literally killing us. It is supported by a very powerful lobby group, whose influence on Irish legislation is something that must be tackled. I make reference again to its objections to the injecting centres. It is remarkable how it feels the drug it pedals is somehow more socially acceptable than what we are trying to control in injecting centres. Fundamentally, as somebody who believes in the separation of church and state, on this basis if someone wants to go down to a pub on Good Friday and have a pint in good conscience who are we to stop him or her from doing this? I believe the original legislation was enacted in 1927 and it also included St. Patrick's Day. Since that was overturned 50 years ago, nobody has suggested we should return to having pubs closed on St. Patrick's Day. Let us be honest, what goes on on Good Friday shows exactly what type of a dysfunctional relationship we have with alcohol. There are lines of people outside off-licences on Holy Thursday, people trying to get into train stations to go on imaginary train journeys and people going on barges on the canal. I heard a story last Good Friday of a friend of mine on a barge on the canal, who shared the barge with several friends and an English hen party who were so confused as they could not find a drink in Dublin.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I do not in any way diminish the issues we have with alcohol in this country, which are killing us. On the republican basis of separation of church and state, this is something we must support.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Hear hear.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is about choice on Good Friday.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Except the gays.
