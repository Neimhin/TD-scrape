AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I congratulate Irish Rail on responding to recent cases of anti-social behaviour on its services by introducing a text message alert system. It is due to come into effect in the next couple of weeks to deal with anti-social behaviour on rail services. Anybody who uses the DART, in particular, knows that it is an important transport service for the citizens of Dublin and that we must defend public transport because it is important. We must ensure we can overcome the barriers that might make people reluctant to use the DART service. It is time to have a discussion with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, on security in the transport system. He has spoken about being in favour, in principle, of having a transport police service or a section of An Garda Síochána being assigned to transport services. I would appreciate it if the Leader facilitated such a discussion. There is a realisation in Irish Rail that there is a problem. If the Minister also recognises there is a problem, perhaps we might work together to try to find a solution and deal with the matter in the way it has been dealt with in other jurisdictions. I commend the #SaferFromHarm campaign. Yesterday Christy Moore lent his considerable credibility to the campaign, which aims to advance the cause of decriminalising drug use and dealing with addiction simply as a medical issue rather than as a criminal justice matter. I know that the relevant Minister of State will soon have sight of a working group report and we hope to discuss its recommendations. There is a growing body of opinion which realises the place for people with addiction is not a courtroom or a Garda station, that they should be helped in the medical sphere. I would appreciate having a discussion in this House on the report with the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, in order that we can advance the cause of decriminalisation of drug use. I congratulate the Ana Liffey Drug Project and others who are behind the agenda. To my mind, it is one of the more crucial campaigns of our time. As we are so close to making a difference in this space, I would really appreciate having that debate.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Beidh mé an-ghairid. Ba mhaith liom an tAire a mholadh tar éis an méid oibre atá déanta aici. Is léir go bhfuil sí ag éisteacht linn. Ba mhaith liom an Seanadóir Bacik a mholadh freisin. Is léir go bhfuil fadhbanna móra ag baint leis an mBille seo. Táimid ar fad tar éis na mílte litreacha a fháil uathu siúd atá uchtaithe agus ó dhaoine eile atá fadhbanna acu leis an mBille. Ní féidir linn tacaíocht a thabhairt don Bhille mar atá sé faoi láthair. Tar éis an mhéid atá cloiste againn ón Aire, tá sé soiléir go bhfuil sí sásta éisteacht linn agus oibriú linn. Tá sí ag éisteacht leis na hoifigigh atá timpeall uirthi. Tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann an reachtaíocht seo a neartú, a fheabhsú agus a chur chun cinn ionas go mbeimid ar fad bródúil as an bpróiseas seo.
