AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I congratulate the Tánaiste on his appointment and look forward to working with him over the coming period. His remarks are welcome for the emphasis he has placed on young people. I am glad the Government is aware of this. We have only just in recent memory come out of the last economic collapse, which was quite painful and bruising. Many small business owners will have just begun to look forward to the next period of their lives and their businesses' lives. They may have extended themselves on the feeling that things were improving economically and now they have been hit with this Covid disaster. It is much easier to retain a job than to create a new one. While we welcome this Bill and note that it is enabling legislation, there are elements to the microfinancing project that could be enhanced and improved. Comparisons have been made with the bounce back microfinance operation in the UK. The bounce back scheme makes loans available at 2.5% with no repayment for a year. The Government pays the first year's interest. The loans are 100% State guaranteed. Loans of up to 25% of turnover are available with a term limit of six years and a maximum of £50,000. In the Republic, Microfinance Ireland offers a six-month interest fee repayment holiday, a term limit of three years and a maximum of €50,000. The Labour Party's suggestion is that €50,000 is inadequate and could be increased to €100,000. The interest rate of 4% is considered to be too expensive. In previous times, when the State was getting financing at somewhere similar to that rate, it could be in some way justified, but finance is available to the State now at a much-reduced rate and it would follow that a much-reduced interest rate should be applicable here. The term limit of three years is quite short compared with the UK bounce back scheme term of six years. We would like to give businesses a sense that they have five or seven years or maybe longer ahead of them to recoup and start afresh. Before Covid, we had very encouraging employment statistics and the economy appeared to be going in the right direction. However, the statistics and economic analysis have clouded the reality of being a low-pay economy. About 23% of Irish workers pre-Covid were in low pay according to OECD statistics. That is a very large figure, as the Tánaiste can appreciate. As has been said, about 40% of young people were in insecure work. Those sectors of low-paid and insecure work were the ones most affected by Covid. We in the Labour Party feel that we cannot return to that type of economic model which is so dependent on low pay and insecure work. We want to work with the Government to provide a better and more secure model for workers. It is much appreciated that the Tánaiste outlined the youth unemployment element in his address. We feel that this will at least be a significant part of the July stimulus. James Doorley from the National Youth Council of Ireland gave a statistic over the weekend that 45% of young people under 30 years are currently in unemployment. That is a staggering and incredibly worrying figure. We have all seen the damage the last economic collapse caused. We have potential now with support from lenders not to make the same entrenched and damaging mistakes that many of us made ten years ago and in the years after that. We appreciate and support the Bill, but if we look at what is happening in other European states and the UK, there are other models that are probably more generous. We could make this much more generous. I have spoken about the interest rate, term limits and amounts involved.Unemployment is not just an economic cost or a statistic that we try to bring down, as the Tánaiste knows, it is a real human cost to the person's sense of worth to his or her family and to society. We cannot reduce it to economic terminology. We will support the Bill but we feel it must be more flexible and give voice to the fact that we are in a very precarious economic situation, and that is without mentioning Brexit. The debate until now has focused on Covid, and justifiably so. Covid has given rise to a health crisis that has caused economic collapse. While, Brexit has an influence on identity, security and other matters, including the Good Friday Agreement, it is also an economic threat. With both of those things, we also have an unemployment crisis. That is why we feel that Microfinance Ireland requires a greater capacity to lend larger amounts at lower rates over a longer period to those businesses which probably only turned the corner a few years ago in order that they can stand on their own two feet. I emphasise that we cannot return to the model of low pay and the grinding, humiliating existence that too many of our workers endure. That 23% of workers are on low pay is a damning statistic. It is not something over which we can stand or to which we would want to return. If, as my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly said, so many people are in insecure work, that must also be challenged. There are many mechanisms we can use to challenge that but it is an economic model to which we do not want to return. I want something that is better not only for the economy but also for society in general. The Labour Party will support the Bill and I look forward to the Tánaiste's response to the points which have been raised.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I congratulate the Minister on his appointment. During the general election held a few short months ago housing was the biggest issue arising on the doorsteps. In terms of affordability, it was far too common to come across a number of generations of one family living under the same roof, with people priced out of starting a life, with relationship break-up putting a huge strain on families and with people wondering what life chance they had to live in the area I represent, although this is a national issue as well. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the issue of housing this evening. The Labour Party Private Members' time tomorrow evening will focus on housing as well. This evening, we are focused on the issue of affordable housing. The Minister mentioned in his contribution that he proposes to initiate an affordable purchase scheme and he mentioned that he would welcome practical and positive suggestions. In this regard, I refer the Minister to the former rent-to-buy scheme. The Minister will recall that prior to the crash a number of housing schemes were in place during the late 2008 to 2010 period in particular, which afforded people an opportunity to get on the property ladder but these schemes were disbanded when the crash happened. The rent-to-buy scheme was operated by Dublin City Council and Louth County Council. A similar scheme operated in Northern Ireland. I would like to speak to the scheme operated by Dublin City Council. Under this scheme a person entered into a three-year agreement with the council to rent at an agreed monthly rent of up to 20% less than the market rate in a particular area. If the person decided to purchase the property, 80% of the rent paid over the three years, or a shorter term but up to a maximum of three years, was offset against the purchase price, this price having been agreed before the tenant moved into the accommodation. One of the benefits of the rent-to-buy scheme was that a person had three years to decide if he or she wanted to buy the property, to continue to rent it or to walk away. This gave people an opportunity not to have to rent and save simultaneously. These are the couples and individuals all of us meet who cannot afford to rent and save for a deposit at the same time and so they feel completely locked out. What we need now is a scheme such that people do not have to rent and save at the same time. Such a scheme existed pre-2010. The Labour Party is suggesting that the Minister recommence that scheme, but nationally rather than in any one local authority area. As I said, a similar scheme is operated in Northern Ireland, known as the rent-to-own scheme. Under this scheme a person signs a tenancy agreement, the rent-to-own co-operative buys the property selected by the rent-to-own applicant and it rents it to the tenant at market rent. The tenant then has an option to buy at the end of three-year fixed term. To qualify, a person must be able to show that he or she can make the repayments and does not have an alternative route into home ownership. The Labour Party proposal is practical and it should be taken on board to address the situation for the locked out generation. It is a proposal we could work on collectively across the House. As I said, schemes of this type were in place prior to the crash. When the crash came, over a short period a huge amount of property became much more affordable to people of a certain income stream if they were still in employment.  These are the types of schemes we need to revert to. The State should be happy to get involved. I do not understand the reluctance of successive Governments to have the hand of the State hugely, if not solely, involved in the provision of housing. The State does not have a profit motive. The issue with housing when it is left to the market is that the market has no conscience and it has a profit motive. If the State is involved it does not have a profit motive and there are standards that we can expect from the State and those who oversee the agencies of the State, be they local authorities or Departments. We would have more faith in councils, local authorities or direct funding from Departments to drive these schemes. Those who could avail of these schemes would have much more faith in them because they would know that in a private rented market situation they would not end up on the rough end of a tenancy agreement if things did not go their way. People can trust the State more than the market economy. On that basis, tomorrow night we will flesh out other issues the Labour Party has in terms of the housing situation. As I said, when I was canvassing a rent-to-buy scheme was a measure many couples said they could potentially buy into. People should not have to rent and save at the same time. The two can happen simultaneously with tenants being given a three-year timeframe within which to make a decision. This would give people a level of comfort for a set timeframe. It also would not put a huge emotional strain on a relationship or an emotional strain on a family that just wants to move on and live their lives.
