AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank our guests for their presentation.  It was stated that 23,000 jobs were created last year.  What type of jobs were created and what skill sets do those who obtained them possess?  How sustainable are these jobs?  Will our guests comment on the geographical spread in respect of the jobs in question?
