AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, will be aware that the announcement of any job losses in any part of the country is particularly devastating at this time of year. He will be aware that last Friday, the potential loss of 440 jobs at the Viatris plant in Baldoyle was announced. This was a devastating blow to the workers and their families at this time of year. The company is going to engage in the process over the next two years. I feel strongly that the Department, the Minister of State and the Tánaiste can play a positive role in reassuring the workers that their statutory entitlements will be forthcoming and that the Government will work with the company to ensure fair play and to offer new employment opportunities to those greatly affected by the announcement. An announcement like this is no different from any other job loss announcement anywhere else in the country and it should be treated by the Government and Department in the exact same way. Four hundred and forty jobs involve 440 people and 440 families. I am sure the Minister of State will agree with me that the announcement could not have been made at a worse time, as we approach Christmas. I have written to the Tánaiste to seek a meeting with him. I have also written to the company itself. There is an opportunity for us to step into this space and provide solutions, leadership and comfort to those affected. I am unsure whether the workers have a representative body or trade union representation. I have yet to find that out. If there is, we obviously want to engage with the trade union. If not, it is all the more important for political representatives to do what they absolutely can for the workers affected. The Minister of State will agree with pretty much everything I am saying but I want to ensure that we start a process to help the workers over the next two years, maximise the potential of the site so the area will not lose out in the long term owing to the announcement, and ensure this is just a fork in the road for the 440 workers and their families, rather than a devastating blow from which they may never recover. With that, I would appreciate the Minister of State's response.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I would appreciate a copy of the response, if that is possible. I appreciate the Minister of State's reply. I do not in any way think that this situation is a reflection on his Department or the Government. It is particularly bad form for the company not to have communicated this decision to IDA Ireland or the Department before making it. Of course, the timing is also bad form. On that basis, we have got off to a bad start to our relationship with the entity in question. I appeal again to the Minister of State that this is something on which we can work together. Perhaps when we reconvene in the new year, seeing that this is going to be a two-year process, all local elected representatives can meet with the Minister of State and the Tánaiste to build up a continuum of a relationship over a period of time to ensure that we can do our best for these families and to lay down a template. If this happens again, we want to be sure that we have a template in place to which we can refer. The Minister of State mentioned retraining and education, and I appreciate that. I would hope that the Minister of State takes my call to work together in good faith. Perhaps in the new year, we can set up a meeting between all the local Deputies, officials from the Department and officials from the Department of Social Protection who will be heavily engaged in this matter. That would ensure that everything is being done, any communications that we are getting from the workers or their families can also be relayed to the Minister of State's Department, anything that may have been missed, and also to ensure that, in the fullness of time, this is seen to be a fork in the road and not a full stop for any family. I appreciate the engagement of the Minister of State and hope it will continue.
