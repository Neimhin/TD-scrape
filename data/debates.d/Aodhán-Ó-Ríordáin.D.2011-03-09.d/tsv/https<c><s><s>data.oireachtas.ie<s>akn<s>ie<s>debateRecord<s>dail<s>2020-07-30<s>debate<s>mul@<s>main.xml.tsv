AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I intend to be brief, but I concur with my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, about the Tánaiste's engagement with his portfolio. It appears to those of us in opposition that it is beneath him to address matters pertaining to his Department in the Oireachtas. It is approximately two weeks since he took a swipe at the Labour Party's proposal to introduce legislation in reference to the High Court decision on sectoral employment orders. He dismissed it as virtue signalling. I have been waiting for an opportunity on the floor of the House to take him to task for that remark. We have had two sessions of Private Members' business on the broad theme of employment rights, one tabled by the Social Democrats and another in the form of a motion relating to the Debenhams workers from Solidarity-People Before Profit. We have also had the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill. Despite all of those debates, I am still waiting for an opportunity to engage with the Tánaiste. There are themes that other political parties in the Dáil and I want to return to under the broad umbrella of the economy, employment rights and company legislation, but if the Tánaiste is not present for at least part of those debates, he will not hear those messages or be influenced by them. That is not in any way a reflection on the entire team in his Department, and I respect the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, very much, but it undermines what we are trying to achieve when the Tánaiste does not seem to be minded to address issues raised in the House and pertaining to him. We have studied this Bill and proposed no amendments to it because we view it as timely and necessary. I note the level of consultation that the Department has had with various stakeholders in order to ensure that the legislation is robust, is necessary and can operate effectively. However, I will make a point about how the economy and business will change in light of remote working, online meetings, etc. There is a growing assumption that the manner in which businesses operated remotely or how meetings took place remotely over the course of the pandemic was 100% positive. Although it was positive to see a reduction in traffic and the amount of time workers spent commuting and it was positive that people could spend more time at home, what happened was not universally positive. In some circumstances-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The point I am making relates to remote working and the fact that there is an assumption that it is in all circumstances a positive. If, however, a company decides that a worker can in all circumstances work remotely and connect remotely to the workplace, that is something which will need to be regulated heavily by the Government and via legislation. There may be overcrowded housing, the workers may be young or may not necessarily have access to the appropriate materials or IT equipment. In addition, workers may not be able to connect remotely or may be uncomfortable doing so. We need strong regulation and oversight of this issue because, as the Minister of State knows, the market has no conscience. Therefore, how companies operate their interactions will need to be heavily regulated if the workplace is to be radically different in future. We appreciate the motivation behind the Bill, but, like Deputy O'Reilly, we hope that other areas of company law, oversight and employment legislation will be dealt with as speedily. We are still awaiting a Government response to the Duffy Cahill report on issues surrounding Clerys, Debenhams and HMV, matters that were referenced recently during Private Member's business. It is this sort of speed that makes the public realise what the Government's priority is. While we have no issue with the speed with which this Bill is being dealt, if every legislative measure governing employment law and workers' rights was dealt with as speedily, there would be a sense across all sectors of society that the Government was even-handed and would respond to the needs of employers and employees equally. Some of us would rather it if the Government spent more time listening to the concerns of employees than employers, but if the speed was seen to be even-handed across the spectrum, there would not be the sense of alienation from the political system and legislation that governs the way people work. There is a sense that if one is a captain of industry or a company director, one's access to the Cabinet, the decision makers and those who prioritise legislation is swifter, whereas if one is a shop steward or trade union representative, one's access is not as swift and one cannot get what is necessary done. The Duffy Cahill report was published in 2017, but here we are in 2020 and the issues it covered are still surfacing. To summarise, it is important that the Minister of State convey to the Tánaiste our disappointment regarding his failure to attend. A number of issues have arisen in recent weeks but the latter has not been present. If he does not hear the messages from this Chamber, he will not react positively to them. We welcome the Bill and have not tabled amendments to it, but we must be careful about how the sector is regulated in future so that we do not fall into an assumption that all elements of remote working are positive. We must be mindful of unreasonable burdens being placed on workers, in particular young ones, in terms of how they interact with the labour force. My third point relates to the swift way in which this legislation is being dealt with versus long delays in addressing issues concerning amoral actions of businesses in overriding workers' rights.We will not be tabling any amendments and will be supporting the Bill but I hope the Minister of State will take the comments of the Labour Party on board and relay them to the senior Minister.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There is a commitment in the programme for Government to establish citizens' assemblies, including one on drugs and on education, which I believe is restricted to primary and secondary education. I seek further detail on this commitment, including when will this be established, its terms of reference and the timescale for its sittings.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Some of the reservations people in education have about the Minister's appointment do not relate to any lack of ability, competence or understanding of the education system. Our nervousness is that when a conservative Department meets a conservative Minister, the possibility of a radical overhaul of our education system may be affected. Such an overhaul could lead to having equality at the centre of the system and addressing its constitutional underpinning, which ensures that we do not really have a State education system. We will not necessarily have the opportunity to deal with that in a radical way. I was hoping that the proposed citizens' assembly could deal with the constitutional underpinning of the education system. In her response, the Minister did not give a timeline as to when the citizens' assembly will meet. I ask again what is the Minister's ambition for its establishment, sitting and terms of reference? I am sure she has an opinion on the matter.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That all sounds great. My problem is in predicting our engagement with the Minister. Over the next period when we raise something that could radically overhaul the education system or bring in legislation that could enhance equality provisions within education, her go-to answer could very easily be that we will deal with the matter in the citizens' assembly. What I need from her is a commitment on when she wants the citizens' assembly to be established. Even if she could name a year, I would appreciate it. The last thing I or any Deputy wants to do is have a policy, motion or Bill before the House and for the Minister to pick up a script saying the citizens' assembly is the best place to deal with it. I ask the Minister to give me a year by which she hopes the citizens' assembly will have started its deliberation.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 4, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:“(2) (a) The Government may from time to time by order extend the emergency period, either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision, for such period as it considers appropriate if it is satisfied that, having regard to the threat to public health presented by Covid-19 and the need to mitigate the economic effects arising from that disease, the making of such order is in the public interest.(b) Every order under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House sits after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.”.Most of our amendments speak for themselves so I do not intend to have a prolonged debate. We have made our speeches and we know what is at stake. Our amendment clearly outlines our demand that the emergency period be extended. I am interested to hear the Minister's response to that. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will be quick. Regarding the issues outlined by Deputy Ó Broin, we in the Labour Party will support this amendment. I also want to record my gratitude and that of my party to the Minister, Deputy Harris, for recognising the literacy issues in this State. Some 17.9% of Irish adults are functionally illiterate, and these are the people who we are asking to navigate the housing schemes we put through the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is why we support this amendment and that is why I was glad to see the Minister, Deputy Harris, recognise the situation regarding literacy this morning. We need to work collectively to ensure we have measures, legislation and documents that can be accessed by all the citizens who desperately need these services.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 4:In page 5, to delete lines 14 and 15. I wish to correct the Minister. Section 4(1)(b), as drafted, does not allow for a declaration by a tenant after the event. I want the Minister to correct his assertion. Unless something is in law and written down in black and white, the Minister's comments on the floor of the House only travel so far. Many of us are frustrated by attempts to criminalise in respect of any aspect of public policy unless it is absolutely necessary. I spend a significant amount of my time trying to ensure that those living with addiction are not criminalised because of the lives they lead and the difficult circumstances they are going through. In the Bill only one cohort of person on either side of the tenant and landlord relationship has the potential to be criminalised on the back of a what is termed a "false declaration", namely, a tenant.On that basis, we feel strongly that lines 14 and 15 on page 5 should be deleted and we will press this amendment. I am interested to hear not only what the Minister, but also my colleagues from Solidarity-People Before Profit, have to say.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Labour Party has an issue with the lopsided nature of the Bill. Somebody who owns property with a tenant in his or her property can play the game and get away with it by making declarations which many people know to be a half-truth, a non-truth or a blatant lie. That person will not end up with a criminal sanction under the provisions of this Bill, but the tenants who try to keep their family together, as other people have mentioned, face criminal sanction on top of potential eviction. That is why we feel so strongly about it and will press the amendment to a vote.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will be as brief as possible in support of these amendments. The overarching thing we are trying to achieve was referenced by the previous speaker, with whom I agree. There can be a level of political game playing, either here or in Leinster House, as the Minister knows, in which the Opposition tries to depict the Government as uncaring, unfeeling and on the side of everything that is bad while everybody in the Opposition is on the side of everything that is good. It is not as simple as that, as we know. We know that everybody in politics comes into politics to make a positive difference. We are not trying to depict anybody in the Government as trying to do something destructive. The issue is that we have been having debates on housing and homelessness for the best part of at least seven years and the public has lost faith in politicians' ability to come together and deliver solutions. However, what the public has seen since March is that a Government intervention has made the difference. We are asking the Government to continue its own policy. If a measure introduced by the Government in March has resulted in a decrease in the number of people presenting as homeless and a demonstrable improvement in tackling the problem, why would the Government not just continue with the policy that is seen to be successful? That is what is so frustrating. The Labour Party and other political parties in the House are not trying to depict the Government as uncaring or unfeeling. However, if a Government policy is working, why can we not just continue to work with it? The problem is, as I said the other day, that we will return here in September and, while we do not want to be right, there is every indication that we will be right and that we will be in a position to say, "We told you". It is much more comfortable for me to stand in Dáil Éireann and say we were right than it is for the person who is affected by this Bill. Those are the stakes with which we are playing. We cannot get this wrong. I fundamentally believe the Minister is a compassionate person who wants to do the right thing in terms of housing people. I know that he has absolutely no intention of making anybody homeless. The problem is that the Government policy is working but this Bill is going to change that. The stakes are so high that I wish the Government would accept the amendments that have been put forward in good faith.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed to.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Labour Party would like to support the proposal made by Deputy O'Reilly. I also wish to raise the issue of pandemic unemployment payments to those who are self-employed and those who are in receipt of employee wages and self-employed wages, who are now going to be put on a lower schedule of payment. We can only resolve this issue if the Dáil is sitting. We cannot have a six-week recess for those who are in receipt of this payment. It would be very simple for us to return here on Tuesday to have questions on this issue and come to a resolution on it and the issue outlined by Deputy O'Reilly.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the Minister being here. It feels as if we are in the worst nightclub ever, spending this time together. Perhaps there should be some type of mechanism for us to interact over the month of August. I appreciate that we cannot recall the Dáil but we should find an imaginative way for Opposition Deputies and the Minister or her officials to engage in the weeks before the reopening because this issue is so important. I strongly hope that this plan works. We all need it to work and we need the Minister to be successful. I strongly believe we could work with the Minister in whatever way we can over the next number of weeks to ensure it is successful. I have a question about masks. Many schools are concerned about what type of protocols will be issued from the Department regarding the wearing of masks, particularly at second level and in respect of students who are vulnerable and have special educational needs. I have in mind children with cochlear implants who have concerns about how they might wear a mask. We need some guidelines on that. The issue of special education teachers being used as substitutes is crucial. I was a resource teacher for a period of time. It was difficult if my work was interrupted by going into a class to substitute for that class. Not only was my work disrupted but obviously the child who needed the attention was disadvantaged as well. That is something that needs to change. We have spoken about the lack of time. We cannot blame the Minister for that as she has only been in the office for less than a month, but obviously this package would have been required a number of months ago. However, we are where we are, as they say. On school transport, we probably need a few more days to allow parents to engage with the system. The Minister has delayed it to 4 August, but it probably needs to be delayed for a few more days. Can she speak on that? Regarding the issue of calculated grades, in fairness to the Minister, as part of the discussion this evening, she did arrange for a briefing with Opposition spokespeople on this yesterday and it was very informative. If calculated grades are going to be used as a mechanism for the leaving certificate in 2021 - I know the Minister will not want to make an announcement on this now or admit defeat on it at all - junior certificate and leaving certificate students of 2021 will need an early decision on that. If that decision is going to be made, it needs to be flagged well in advance because, as the Minister knows, students will have been out of the system for a number of months. Their potential for maximising whatever grades they could have got in the junior certificate or leaving certificate will be greatly impacted by that loss, so there will have to be some way the Department can look into that. If it means there will be some level of assessed grades, can an early decision on that be made? The Minister has plenty of time to respond to my last point. It has come to my notice that there are third level institutions that have internal documents circulating within them suggesting that only one day's attendance per week will be necessary for students when they come back in September. As the Department with responsibility for higher education is not legally constituted, I still must deal with the Minister for Education and Skills on this issue. If third level institutions are circulating such documents, is she aware of such conversations taking place within third level institutions? If this is the case, how can we stand over the maintenance of the student contribution at its current level if students will get only one day per week of in-class tuition? Further, why should we expect students to seek accommodation for themselves in the middle of a housing crisis if the in-class tuition they are expected to receive in September will be one day per week? To summarise my points, I seek greater clarification on masks and mask wearing; on special educational teachers being used as substitutes; and on school transport and how long parents have to apply for it. Obviously, a lot of school transport providers are still unsure as to what they can do. I want a straight answer because, unfortunately, I asked the Minister a straight question a number of weeks ago in this Chamber and did not get a straight answer, and then there was a press release a couple of hours later. I am asking her about this situation in third level institutions. Is she aware of third level colleges that within their internal conversations are suggesting there will be only one day per week in class or physical teaching, if I might put it that way? If that is the case, and if she is aware of this, does the Minister think it is appropriate that the student contribution should remain at the same level? Does she think it is appropriate that students would be under such pressure to try to obtain student accommodation for themselves, given that they will be in class only once a week?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I very much appreciate the Minister's presence here this evening. She has had a long day of engagement with Deputies and Senators on a wide range of issues over the course of this day. It is now past 2 a.m. and she is still here. I appreciate that. I made a comment about a Cabinet colleague of hers not affording us the same respect, but she is here and it is greatly appreciated. For those who are interested in the topic that we are going to discuss, it shows the seriousness with which she takes the issue. The campaign for Killester Raheny Clontarf Educate Together school was started several years ago. I was involved in the campaign from the start. There is great interest in the establishment of an Educate Together school in the catchment area as laid down by the Department. The Department determined that there should be a new primary school for the catchment area of Killester, Raheny and Clontarf and so the competition, for want of a better word, was started and Educate Together was deemed to be the most appropriate patron body to take on the running of that school. All was fine. However, with the school to be opened last September, a site within the catchment area was not found. A particular site was investigated for a period of time, but my understanding is that there was an issue with planning. After a long period of time, a site was found outside the catchment area, at Suttonians Rugby Club in Sutton, to enable the school to open. As a result of that, many parents who were enthusiastic about sending their children to this school thought otherwise because the idea of travelling from Clontarf, Raheny or Killester to Sutton and back again for an infant was just not going to work out. I am not sure if the Minister is familiar with the geography of the area. Suffice it to say that having a school even on a temporary basis outside the catchment area when it is just trying to find its feet, to embed a culture and to embed a dynamic around the school was not going to work. On the basis that it would be a year, many people felt that over the course of that year the Department would work hard to ensure that by following September there would be a physical site in the catchment area. Obviously, the pandemic has most likely interrupted that process and parents will probably face into a second year on site in the rugby club in Sutton. The agreement from the off was that it would be a two-year arrangement. What plans and processes are in place for the Department to ensure that a temporary or permanent site within the catchment area of Killester, Raheny and Clontarf can be obtained for this school so that it can embed itself in the community which it has been established to serve? It has not been established to be located in Sutton. It has been established to serve the students of the Killester, Raheny and Clontarf catchment area. Of course, priority is given to children who reside in that catchment area. The issue is very simple. I ask for an indication of what moves the Department is making. It would be great to have it this September. If it is to be September 2021, what is the likelihood that we can have Killester Raheny Clontarf Educate Together school in the catchment area of Killester, Raheny and Clontarf?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is very positive. I appreciate the Minister's response. I think the parents of children who are attending the school or intend to attend the school will be very satisfied with that response. A permanent site option for the new 16-classroom school has been identified. We are not talking about a temporary site but a permanent one and it is in the school planning area. It is quite a wide area and it spans what would border Fairview all the way down to the Kilbarrack Road, which is quite a large catchment area. I also appreciate that there are commercial sensitivities associated with the land acquisition. I appreciate that the Minister cannot go into any further detail. I appreciate the answer she has given me. This will be greatly welcomed by the school community. I ask the Minister to continue to engage with me and other representatives in the area to ensure this matter stays on the top of the agenda locally. It is crucial that if a child is from the given locality, he or she has an opportunity to attend Killester Raheny Clontarf Educate Together school in his or her own locality. I appeal to the Minister to continue to engage with me, the board of management, local representatives and the school community as this process continues.
