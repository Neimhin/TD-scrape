AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We are here to discuss with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, proposals to reform the junior certificate examination syllabus with specific reference to enterprise education, and subject choice that reflects the needs of industry.  I welcome Mr. John Hammond, deputy chief executive, and Mr. John Halbert, director, junior cycle, of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.I ask Mr. Hammond to begin the presentations.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I am conscious of the number of speakers and will ask them to be as concise as possible.  We will bank some of the questions.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We will take questions from Deputy Lawlor and Senator Kelly before we ask the delegates to respond.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I invite the delegates to respond to these questions.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	It was to keep you out of trouble.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I believe we will deal with it again after Christmas.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Obviously the needs of industry is just one component of a wider discussion.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy should try to be as brief as possible as members are due to hear another presentation.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy has made that point well.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	No, I appreciate that but-----
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	No, Deputy-----
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	No, Deputy, in fairness, the point about-----
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	In fairness, the point about going into the field has been made by a number of members.  While it is a fair point, I am conscious that another presentation must be made and there are pressures of time.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	No, I-----
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I accept what the Deputy is saying but I ask Mr. Hammond to comment.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Sorry Deputy-----
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	No Deputy-----
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	----- I must stop you.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy is not being fair.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Deputy, I may be obliged to suspend the meeting.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Sorry Deputy-----
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Lyons, in fairness to everyone, I asked all members to be as brief as possible.  I am conscious there is a Dáil na nÓg delegation which is waiting patiently to make a presentation on this very issue of the junior certificate cycle.  It is unfair to go beyond what is reasonable.  The Deputy has asked reasonable questions and it is only fair to allow the officials to respond to those questions.  In fairness to everyone, I do not appreciate being talked over in that manner.  I ask Mr. Hammond to respond.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	On behalf on the committee, I thank the NCCA representatives for attending and engaging in such a worthwhile discussion on a topic affecting so many young people.  I hope we will have further discussions on other aspects to the satisfaction of all Deputies.The committee went into private session at 3.31 p.m. and resumed in public session at 3.33 p.m.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I welcome Mr. Luke McTernan, Ms Lisa Murray Sheehy, Mr. Tiarnan Fallon Verbruggen, Mr. Leo Cauneen and Mr. Tom Leahy, who are all Dáil na nÓg council members.Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Does Deputy Conaghan care to regale us with his Latin days?
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	While schools are tasked with teaching subjects and moulding people into good citizens, parents also have a role to play in empowering their children.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	On behalf of the committee I thank the officials from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment for remaining to hear the delegation's presentation.  This is how seriously they take the presentation.  I agree with Deputy Lyons and other speakers that it is one of the best presentations we have heard.I am very much taken with the discussion about body image and the mental health issues attached to it, and the recommendation to enforce the law that all altered advertising images should indicate they have been altered by means of a symbol and text.  This is a practical measure we can follow up.  We have to take to task the advertising industry on many of the images being promoted.I spent 11 years teaching.  We are going through very difficult times, things are very tough and they will be pretty tough for a long time.  Sometimes one can dip into despair but what always cheered me up was being around young people and I have missed that terribly since I got this new job.  Listening to the representatives today has given me a new sense of hope about what our country will be like in years to come.  If these young people are an example of what we have coming next, then we do not have anything to worry about.  Their points about the junior certificate were well made and will be taken with the respect they deserve.  I definitely think the campaigning they are doing on mental health is absolutely crucial.  This should be the start of a long conversation between this committee and the Dáil na nÓg council.  We can work together on many of the points that have been made, not just now but over a period of time.I thank the witnesses for attending before the committee.  Did they get a day off school to come here?
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough.  That is very important.  We should put it on the record that nobody missed school in order to be here today.
