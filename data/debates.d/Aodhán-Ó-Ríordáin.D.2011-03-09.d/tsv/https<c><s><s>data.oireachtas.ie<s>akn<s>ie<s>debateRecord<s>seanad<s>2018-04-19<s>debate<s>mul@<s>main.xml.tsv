AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for taking this debate. The issue is about St. Thomas's special school in Clonshaugh. It is a small school, with a small enrolment, and a school that nobody really believes has a future, although that is not the issue at question here. It is a school where, through circumstance, all the pupils enrolled are Traveller boys. A decision was reached recently and communicated to the patron of the school that it is to close with immediate effect in June, not to be phased out over a number of years. I do not believe in segregated education and do not think many people do. I do not believe boys should be separated from girls. I do not believe children of different religions should be separated from each other in schools. I do not believe children from families with financial advantage should be separated from children from families without that financial advantage and I certainly do not believe that Travellers should be educated separately from other children. However, there is a way of changing that. If this school is to close, and the principal, the staff and the school community appreciate the need for that to happen, then it should be done in a compassionate manner. There is a handful of young men in the senior cycle of the school, or approaching the senior cycle, who would be severely affected by this closure. I do not know if the Minister of State can remember when he was 16 but I remember when I was 16. If we had been told we had to leave the school we were in to go to another school, it would have been pretty difficult for us to do that, and we are not members of a much-discriminated against minority. We are also not members of a minority that has a tradition of having difficulty in progressing in mainstream, formal education. The issue here is that there are a number of young men who do not really see themselves staying in education if this rug is pulled from under them. The issue in St. Thomas's is not that the school should not close; I think everybody believes it should close. The issue is that it should be done with compassion and understanding for the young men who it will affect most profoundly, namely, the young men in fifth year and in third year. I could understand if the school was told not to take any more students in September. I could also understand if the Department said it would do this over the course of a year or two years, particularly for those young men who will face the leaving certificate next year. Despite the best will in the world, what will happen as a result of this situation is that young men who were going to do their leaving certificate in a year or two years will now not do it. Understanding that the school has to close, what I need to know from the Minister of State is that it can be done over two years to allow these young men to continue in their education in St. Thomas's and to allow a calm and compassionate transition for other students to other educational facilities. We are not asking for the world. We are not asking to reverse the decision. We are just asking that the decision be phased, rather than immediate. For a school to be told in April that it is to close in June is, I would contest, very unusual. I do not think a school of a different character would get a message in April that it is closing in June for good. That is the message from the school community. These are vulnerable young people in mainstream education and they are doing their best. I would ask that the Department would give them that small bit of leeway, not to close the doors of the school overnight, but to do it over a more prolonged period.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I listened to the Minister of State's reply. I appreciate that the intention of the Department is to promote integration. I believe in that and look forward to the day when we have more Travellers in the teaching profession and as role models in the educational sphere. My fear is that in years to come, there will be three, four, five or six young men who will point to the closure of the school as the reason they do not have a leaving certificate. Tusla and the Department will do their best to help these students transition to another mainstream setting but my fear is that for the want of a bit of leeway - a year or two - in allowing the students to stay in their current setting, the educational system could lose them completely. I again ask the Minister of State to pass on my concerns to the Minister and the Department about these young men, the danger presented by the immediate closure of the school and the message that sends to them. Nobody is arguing - I certainly do not - that Traveller-only schools or educational settings are the way to go. They are not. They are not healthy or progressive but I suggest that phasing in this closure is in the best interests of those young men, which must surely be our collective goal.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Senator Norris should read his emails, a Chathaoirligh.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	A couple of months ago I raised the issue of posters pertaining to this referendum. I made the comment that perhaps it would be best for all sides if neither "Yes" nor "No" posters were erected because of the sensitive nature of the issue at hand. I feel that even more strongly now. Walking past Leinster House today, I was greeted by an incredibly offensive and insensitive banner. Members of An Garda Síochána told me that there is a very long and complicated process involved in complaining about such an offensive banner. The posters around the city and the country feature statements that do not have to be verified or fact checked. In fact, there is nobody whose job is to fact check or verify statements written on referendum posters. As the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, signed the order for the referendum quite early, we have a two-month campaign rather than the one-month one we were anticipating. My suggestion to the Cathaoirleach is that the Minister should come in and discuss this matter. There should be some mechanism for overseeing or verifying statements or slogans used in referendum campaigns. One such slogan has no basis in fact whatsoever, namely, the claim that one in five pregnancies in Britain ends in a termination. There is no basis for that declaration whatsoever but it is on every lamp-post in the land.  I spoke to a woman who rang the Labour Party offices and who last year was in the traumatic situation of having to deal with a fatal foetal abnormality. Of course, she had to leave this country because of our archaic legislation and constitutional amendments on pregnancy. She was highly traumatised by the entire situation and now has a poster outside her door that is extremely upsetting to her. We arrived and stuck a poster on the same pole to countermand or balance the situation, because of how offensive that poster was to her. Can we have the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment before this House? There is a loophole in legislation here. It is nobody's fault but we need to rectify it. If a referendum is taking place and posters are being erected, people should not be able to tell lies. One should not be allowed to display deeply and gratuitously offensive messaging and posters outside the Houses of the Parliament of the Irish Republic in a huge and graphic style. It is offensive to me, it should be offensive to every Member of this House and we should be in a position to do something about it.
