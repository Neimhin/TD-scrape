AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	With regard to the mandatory reporting of sex abuse, is there legislation promised to deal with the excuse that may be given about information being divulged at confession?  With regard to the relationship between the church and State and the vice grip the church still has on too many of our institutions, I congratulate the Minister for Education and Skills on his work on pluralism and patronage in schools.  If we are serious about breaking the link between church and State, we should not start proceedings in this House every day with a prayer.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Many in these benches find it difficult to stand through.  If we are serious about having a real republic, starting afresh and breaking the link, perhaps we will reconsider this.
