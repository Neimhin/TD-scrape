AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on behalf of the Government on the Garda Síochána (Amendment) Bill 2014 introduced by Deputy Niall Collins. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, is, unfortunately, not in a position to attend today owing to other unavoidable commitments. The substance of the Bill should be taken in the positive spirit in which it is presented. The Deputy has outlined the objectives of the Bill and I do not propose to repeat what he has said. As Members will be aware, the Bill was published last February and a lot has happened since, with reference to strengthening the operation of the criminal justice system. This is especially the case with regard to the delivery of a quality and effective policing service in which all of the people can have full confidence. In April this year the Government announced a new programme of justice reform in response to the series of issues that had come to light in relation to An Garda Síochána. These issues are familiar to Deputies and are, as they know, wide-ranging and serious. The term "systemic failure" has been applied to the situation that has emerged. In that light it must be fully and honestly acknowledged that the policing system, with the standing of the Garda organisation, has gone through a difficult and challenging period. Given the overall circumstances that have developed, it is not going too far to say we are at a pivotal juncture in Irish policing. We have to look back and thoroughly examine what went wrong. At the same time, we have to look forward and decide, here and now, what kind of police service we want for the country. The Government's programme of justice reform provides a comprehensive and concrete platform for these two sets of actions. It is evident from the events to which I have referred that an essential element of the reform needed is an enhanced system of police accountability. This is, of course, a matter that is referred to in the Bill we are discussing. As the Deputy will be aware, the Government's programme of justice reform includes the establishment of a new independent policing authority, which is a very positive step. The Cabinet sub-committee on justice reform, chaired by the Taoiseach, is charged with overseeing the development of legislative proposals for the new authority. This is a project to which a very high priority has been attached and it will continue to be addressed on that basis.  The accountability of the Garda Commissioner is one of the most important matters being addressed in the drafting of the general scheme for the policing authority Bill. In that context, the Government has made it clear that, in policing matters, the Garda Commissioner will be accountable in the exercise of his or her functions to the new authority. The preparation of the general scheme is at an advanced stage and the Minister has confirmed that she will bring it before the Government as quickly as possible.  The Government appreciates the work undertaken by Deputy Niall Collins on this Bill. At the same time, I am sure he will acknowledge that, apart from the urgent work under way on the policing authority, the Government has been proactive in bringing forward measures which cover the same ground as that covered in the Bill. The Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014 was recently initiated and is expected to be debated in the House in the coming weeks. The Bill is another important element of the Government's reform programme. Its main purpose is to amend the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to expand the remit and powers of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. To a certain but more limited extent, this is one of the objectives covered by Deputy Niall Collins's Bill. The Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill is concerned with a number of areas and a significant measure in its own right. In particular, it provides for the first time that the Garda Commissioner will come within the investigative remit of GSOC; will confer additional police powers on GSOC for criminal investigation purposes; provide greater autonomy for GSOC in examining Garda practices, policies and procedures; and enable the Garda Síochána Inspectorate to carry out inspections on its own initiative without the need for the prior approval of the Minister for Justice and Equality. On a point of information, the Minister has indicated that she will further consider legislative changes with regard to GSOC within the framework of the policing authority Bill.  In addition, the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 which came into operation on 15 July deals with Garda whistleblowers by way of provisions similar to those proposed in the Deputy's Bill. The new Act inserted a section into the Garda Síochána Act 2005 to allow members of An Garda Síochána to make protected disclosures to GSOC in confidence in respect of alleged Garda misconduct. The Government has committed in the programme for Government to the introduction of legislation to protect whistleblowers. I note that Deputy Niall Collins's Bill contains provisions to allow GSOC to access the Garda PULSE computer system. No specific statutory amendment is needed for this purpose and I understand it is being catered for operationally on the basis of technical co-operation between GSOC and An Garda Síochána.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality commenced a review of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 earlier this year and has held hearings with interested parties, including GSOC and An Garda Síochána, following a public consultation process.The Minister received interim recommendations from the committee in June. A number of the committee's recommendations are catered for in the Government's No. 3 Bill and the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. The joint Oireachtas committee is continuing its review of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and the Minister understands that it will bring forward a more detailed and comprehensive report. She is looking forward to receiving this and she will consider all the recommendations made by the joint committee. The Government's reform programme is not confined to legislative measures. In other areas, substantial progress has been made and the current momentum is being sustained. Last month, the open competition for the recruitment of the next Garda Commissioner was announced. An appointment from this competition is expected in late November-early December. An independent review mechanism has been established to review complaints alleging Garda misconduct or inadequacies in the investigation of such allegations. A panel consisting of senior and junior counsel was established and the aim is to have the majority of cases reviewed within a period of up to 12 weeks.  The Fennelly commission of investigation into the operation of telephone recording systems in certain Garda stations and related matters has been up and running since June and is due to report to the Government by the end of this year. The Garda Síochána Inspectorate's crime inspection report is imminent. This report will cover a wide spectrum of policing activity including the recording, investigation and prosecution of crimes. The report will also deal with a number of concerns raised in the report submitted to the Government by Mr. Sean Guerin SC following his review of certain Garda actions. The Government has committed to establishing a commission of investigation into matters arising from the Guerin report. The terms of reference of the commission, including the timeframe and the appointment of a member, are under consideration and will be finalised shortly.  The Government published Judge Cooke's inquiry into reports of unlawful surveillance of GSOC in June. Recently, GSOC published a redacted version of the report commissioned from Mr. Mark Connaughton SC into the possible disclosure of confidential information. I welcome the publication of GSOC's report in the interest of public transparency. I might add, importantly, that the Government's No. 3 Bill meets a number of key commitments made arising from the publication of the Cooke report. These relate specifically to ensuring that GSOC can conduct a public interest investigation without reference to a specific complaint and also enhancing the effectiveness of the existing statutory provisions concerning the exchange of information between the Garda Síochána and GSOC. The Minister published the report of the Independent Review Group on the Department of Justice and Equality in July. Since its publication, an open competition to recruit a new Secretary General to my Department has been announced and the Minister is working closely with management to implement the report's recommendations. The Garda Síochána has been included within the scope of the Freedom of Information Bill 2013 in accordance with the commitment in the programme for Government to extend freedom of information to all public bodies. The Heads of the Bill were previously extensively debated in committee in the Oireachtas. The Bill has concluded all Stages in the Dáil and has been tabled for the Seanad. It is expected that the Bill will be enacted quickly. A review under the Haddington Road agreement will make recommendations on the use by the Garda Síochána of the resources available to it with the objective of achieving and maintaining the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness in its operations and administration. The review encompasses all aspects of the operation and administration of the Garda Síochána. The review is expected to be completed by mid-November and will form a platform for the new Garda Commissioner to oversee a programme of comprehensive reform in the organisation.  The concept of organisational culture has been referred to in many quarters over the past several months in respect of the Garda Síochána. September saw the Garda College in Templemore welcome new recruits for the first time in a number of years. We want these men and women and the further recruits that will follow them to be members of a police force that upholds the finest and most professional standards in policing - members of a force that I and citizens of this State are justly proud of. The Government has committed itself to having in place and, as required, to changing Garda structures and systems that will provide our communities with the policing service they deserve. It is not a process that is being undertaken just for its own sake but is directed towards ensuring that the Garda Síochána will be fully up to the task of meeting the challenges of modern policing throughout the country. With that in mind, it is very important that the measures to be put in place in the area of policing reform are properly co-ordinated. This is what the comprehensive Government justice reform programme is about. As I have indicated, the programme has already produced important results and I am fully confident that it will bring about the necessary changes so that confidence in policing can be fully restored. Bearing in mind the overall objectives of the Deputy's Private Members' Bill, the Government does not intend to oppose it on Second Stage in this House. However, the Deputy will appreciate that since he originally introduced his Bill, the Government has embarked on a very substantial programme of criminal justice reform. In that regard, I wish to make it clear to the House that the Government intends to proceed fully with the programme. It will, of course, be dealt with as a major priority.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, to respond to the debate on the Garda Síochána (Amendment) Bill 2014 introduced by Deputy Niall Collins. I thank him and all other contributors to the debate. Debates such as this are invaluable as they enable us, as Deputies, to reflect on the critical issues of Garda oversight and accountability. Reflection is the foundation of effective policy-making. We are at a pivotal juncture in Irish policing. Collectively, we are charged with moulding the type of service we all want. I hope the Government's decision not to oppose the Bill on Second Stage will be viewed as a genuine indication that it wants to seize this historic opportunity to work collectively for reform. While it accepts the principles of oversight and accountability and decided not to oppose the Bill, it has been actively pursuing its programme of justice reform. One facet of that reform programme is new Government legislation to expand the remit and powers of GSOC and establish a new policing authority. In this context, some of the measures provided for in the Deputy's Bill have already been achieved, while others are in the process of being dealt with.I have spoken about the Government's legislative reforms in the course of the debate. The Government is absolutely committed to progressing the new legislation as a matter of urgency and this is being overseen by the new Cabinet committee on justice reform established this year and chaired by the Taoiseach. The Garda Síochána (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014 will be debated on Second Stage soon. Legislation to establish a new independent policing authority is at an advanced stage. The Government appreciates the importance of establishing the policing authority and is pursuing the matter with urgency. The Government's reform programme is ambitious in its scope. I outlined many aspects of the programme in my opening contribution, including the commissions of investigation, the independent review mechanism, the Cooke inquiry into reports of unlawful surveillance of GSOC and the establishment of the policing authority. However, as a Government, we must be ambitious. It has been a very difficult year for policing in the State and our chief aim is to restore not just the public's confidence in the Garda Síochána but also the Garda Síochána's confidence in itself. So much good work is done on a daily basis by gardaí throughout the country. There is much to be proud of. I suggest that those who would welcome this reform most are the decent, hard-working and patriotic gardaí who regularly put their bodies on the line for the security of the State. I refer to instances outlined by Deputies which have shaken the confidence of the public, such as the Corrib gas situation, for example. I know from my experience of instances of the difficulties encountered by young working-class men and the stories they tell me of their treatment in Garda stations. This is an issue. The relationship between working-class communities and An Garda Síochána has been a difficult one but there are many thousands of instances from all around the State of good members of the force doing excellent work beyond the call of duty in the service of those communities and of their State, an example being the CLAY project in Crumlin which I visited recently. While I am aware of some of the disturbing and difficult cases which feed into a culture which needs to be addressed, now is the opportunity for us to address it. I also have responsibility for new communities and there are questions about how these communities feel confident in reporting issues to An Garda Síochána and how the force reflects the society it is charged to serve. No more than other areas of public service such as this House, I ask if the force represents the community it polices. This is a question we need to address. It is critical that the current momentum of the Government's programme for justice reform continues over the coming months so the serious failings that have come to light can be dealt with effectively. We need to acknowledge that there have been serious failings. The reform programme will remain a central concern for the Government and we are determined to establish a system of police accountability that will be rigorous and robust.
