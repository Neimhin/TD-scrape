AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I go door to door as often as I can and the other night in Raheny I came across two families with children in dire need of help from the Government. One family has a child in need of a psychological assessment in a school where there are 12 such children in need of a psychological assessment. Three of them will be able to get that assessment but this child is not one of them. The parent is now faced with the prospect of either going privately, at a cost of €650, or not having an assessment at all. What are the Government's plans to ensure every child who needs an assessment can obtain one in order that he or she can maximise his or her potential? I came across another family where the situation was even more worrying and distressing, and the family has no problem with me naming them. Abigail, the daughter of Claire and Mark, was diagnosed with autism at the age of two. They also have two younger children and difficult enough as it is to hear that type of news about the daughter they love dearly, they have fought a war since that diagnosis to get any sort of early intervention from the HSE to benefit their child. In recent days, they were told the earliest they will get help from the early intervention team in north Dublin is approximately six months' time. The child will be almost five years of age. She will finally get help almost three years after her diagnosis. She is approximately 150th on the list, but there are hundreds and hundreds of children on the list. Unfortunately, in this country, not only must people deal with the difficulty of managing a child with autism, as well as every other aspect of family life such as looking after other children and doing their best for them, they must also embark on a war with the State. Unless people kick, shout, roar and scream, it appears they get nowhere, and it is utterly exhausting. I do not know of any other European country that has a waiting list of this nature for a child as vulnerable who needs this intervention. There may have been an argument a number of years ago, in the pit of an economic recession, that there was no money. We could have argued over and back about the priorities in budgets and so on. In the current circumstances, however, when it is clear there are resources, why must Abigail wait three years to get access to an early intervention team in order that she can begin the journey of maximising her potential as a little girl?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I acknowledge that the Minister of State is a compassionate individual who feels strongly about this issue. What time does he think is reasonable to wait from the diagnosis of a child just like Abigail to the beginning of intervention? What time does he aim for? What is his vision? Does he feel that three years is too long? I am sure that he does. What is a reasonable length of time for a family in this scenario to wait? I mean the families that have children like Abigail. I do not think it is good enough for a family to be stressed over waiting for an intervention. They will have to deal with this diagnosis for many years to come as will other members of the family. Everybody around the family will be clued in to this issue. There is a constant state of conflict with agencies that are supposed to surround people with care and compassion. As happens in other jurisdictions when there is a diagnosis like this, one automatically feels as if there is a team of people working with the family and the child to improve his or her circumstances. The situation is completely different in Ireland where one feels almost completely abandoned and must work through this by oneself. The stress, as one can appreciate, is quite substantial. I ask the Minister of State the following again. What timescale does he think is appropriate from the time that a child gets a diagnosis to the time that the early intervention team can click into place? Are we working towards that timeframe? Then we can have a sense that we are all working together.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I cannot accept that.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State must have a view.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy is a Minister of State in the Department of Health so he must have a view on what is an appropriate waiting time.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That answer is absolutely unacceptable. I genuinely do not want to do this but it is unbelievable.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I join with others in seeking a debate on sports capital funding. What was outlined in recent days in respect of Ministers lobbying heavily for private golf clubs is quite disturbing. That fund is deliberately to benefit children in disadvantaged areas, in particular to enable them to access sports facilities and compete on a level playing field. A debate is necessary and I call on the Leader to facilitate it with the Minister who has responsibility for sport. In this regard, I pay tribute to Martin O'Neill and Roy Keane who left their positions as manager and assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland soccer team by mutual consent this morning. Many of us have had a difficult time following the Irish team in the past year but we need to look back to the great wins over Germany and Austria to get us to the European Championships. The best half of football I have probably ever seen an Irish team play was during the match against Sweden in the European Championships. I also saw the team getting a one-nil win over a great Austrian side in Vienna. They lifted the expectations of the Irish soccer side for a number of years. Things have not been great in their most recent period. Whoever takes on the job, be it Stephen Kenny, Brian Kerr or whoever, it is important to give credit where it is due even though the past year or so has been difficult. I also want to raise the issue of the Government's response to our Private Member's Bill that will be debated this evening. Our citizenship Bill would give effect to citizenship rights for children born in Ireland who have been resident here for three years. The Government has decided to oppose the Bill and I find this quite outrageous.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister for Health can go around his constituency of Wicklow to advocate for a child who may be deported and the Minister for Justice and Equality can go around his constituency of Laois to advocate for a child who may be deported but when it comes to an overall system to improve the situation for all children who may not be their constituents they are against it.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I find it absolutely unbelievable. I appreciate we will have plenty of time to flesh this out this evening but I find it very disturbing that it is fair enough to get stuck into a campaign as a constituency issue for a child who is clearly identified but when the Government has a chance to regularise the situation for children who do not need to be deported and who may be deported it turns its back on them in the most callous fashion. It backed the referendum in 2004, which was wrong. The Labour Party along with Sinn Féin, the Green Party and others campaigned against the referendum.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	And Independent Members. Now the Government has an opportunity to put it right and it is turning its back on the children it pretends to support in individual cases in Wicklow and Laois.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is not an answer.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is remarkable and very disappointing.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Only for private golfers.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Leader.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Civil War ended in 1923.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Immigrant Council of Ireland and the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland for being here this evening. Their advocacy and lobbying shows the best of our country and what it means to be Irish. I am bitterly disappointed at the Government’s reaction to this Bill, which I genuinely did not expect, but I will start on a point of unity. No mainstream political party has ever done this. Immigration never comes up in general elections.The race card has only been played once during my political career. That was in 2004 during an unnecessary referendum. It was a despicable gesture by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government of the day. I remember it, as do other candidates who ran in the local elections held on the same day. I remember reports of African-Irish families being booed at polling stations. I swore when I got elected to the city council on that day that I would never forget the emotions I felt during that referendum campaign, which my party and others on the left stood against. The Bill does not overturn the result of that referendum. It does not give automatic citizenship rights to Irish-born children. What it does is allow that a child born on this island, that is, in Ireland, North or South, has the right to citizenship after residency of three years. As has been said, if the Government is opposing this, what the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, did in Wicklow was a lie and what the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, who was in this Chamber only moments ago, did in Laois was a lie. They are well able to accept the applause of their constituents when it comes to a popular campaign around an individual who was facing deportation. However, when it comes to regularising the situation and having legislation to underpin the rights of all children in that situation, regardless of whether they can run a media campaign and regardless of how influential they are, they are turning it down. Despite all these launches relating to children's rights for the next five years and all this talk about a new republic, about getting up early in the morning and about a republic of opportunity, what opportunity are we handing to a child who is eight years old, Irish-born, knows no other country but Ireland and who faces deportation? The only chance they have is if they have a campaign group that is willing to go to a local Minister, who might step in and save the day on an individual basis. What disappoints me most is that this is happening despite the Seanad having been really progressive, across all parties, Government parties included, on issues such as direct provision and advocating for the rights of undocumented workers. All of us have collectively called out the hypocrisy of going to the White House and advocating for undocumented workers in the United States and advocating for the rights of dreamer children. Dreamer children are dealt with in the Bill before the House. How dare we suggest that Trump is not doing the right thing when it comes to dreamer children and taking them away from their families, when this is exactly what we are dealing with here? We are dealing with dreamer children. We are dealing with children whose position here needs to be regularised. What the Government is stating is that they are not important enough, that they do not have access or influence and that it will do this on an individual basis but not collectively. I did not want to make this contribution. I wanted to make a contribution that would unify the House. I wanted to say that we, as Irish politicians, are better at this and that the 2004 referendum was a blip, a once-off mistake that involved the playing of the race card and something that should not happen again. The Government has an opportunity now, if it changes its mind, to regularise the situation of Irish children and to ensure that their schoolmates are not looking around themselves at an empty chair in the classroom and wondering why this so-called republic is sending them to countries of which they have no knowledge. I urge all Members to back this Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Kick him under the table there, Martin.
