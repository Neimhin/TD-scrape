AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Ministers. I have two specific questions. One relates to the funding that has been put aside or prioritised to ensure children can catch up and not just that they can return to school. In addition to making adjustments to schools and providing more personal protective equipment, PPE, or hand sanitiser, they need to be able to ensure children can regain what they lost. What funding is available in that regard? I have previously spoken to the Minister about the £1 billion catch-up fund for children in the UK. There do not appear to be specific measures in place for children, especially those from a disadvantaged background, to analyse and then to ensure they can repair some of the damage caused by not being in school, notwithstanding that they were being taught or that efforts were made to teach them as best we could. My second question relates to demographic pressures. In my constituency many parents cannot find a place for their child at second level. This may be more of a policy measure than a financial one. What kind of funding mechanisms does the Department have to ensure areas of the country undergoing demographic pressures can have increased access to second level schools? I have a further question on face coverings for oral exams, but that may be a discussion for a different time. Perhaps the Minister could communicate with me separately on that. I ask her to respond on the catch-up fund for children and on investments to ensure the pressures as a result of demographic changes can be eased to allow for greater access to second level places.
