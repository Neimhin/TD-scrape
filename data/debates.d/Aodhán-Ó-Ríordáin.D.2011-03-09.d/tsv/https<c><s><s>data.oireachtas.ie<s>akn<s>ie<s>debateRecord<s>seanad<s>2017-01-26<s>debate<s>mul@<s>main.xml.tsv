AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister. I join others in expressing my thanks to the former deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, for the journey he has taken and his commitment and work in the past few years. I wish Michelle O'Neill, MLA, the very best in her new role. I disagree with Senator Neale Richmond in his belief the British Government will act in good faith in meeting its responsibilities as co-guarantor to the Good Friday Agreement. I watch the debate and I am outraged by the complete and utter indifference of the British Government and the Brexit campaigners to their responsibilities to this island. They are a massive part of the problems on this island for a very long time. Now it appears that we are almost completely indifferent to their negotiations and thought processes. It was very decent of the Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, to place us at No. 4 on her list of 12 items of concern. It is possible that the Minister had some role in that regard, on which he is to be congratulated. If it was to be seen in the cold light of day as to where we stood in her thought processes, she had an historic opportunity to come to the Houses of the Oireachtas to speak in the Dáil Chamber and express her commitment and that of the British Government to meeting their responsibilities on this island, but she decided not to do so. I have a deep distaste for hardline nationalism. It bores me to tears. I am not necessarily looking forward to the debates in the North when the electioneering begins because I find hardline nationalism particularly tedious. There are other issues in Northern Ireland to discuss. I was very taken by a speech made by Colum Eastwood, MLA, on the child poverty rate and the numbers of adults in west Belfast who had no formal qualifications. Other speakers have mentioned marriage equality and other social issues that rarely get an airing. I attended a meeting in Belfast before Christmas on the issue of drugs. There are serious social issues such as equality that need to be addressed. The hardline nationalistic stances on either side of the debate are the ones that come to the fore. It is the hardline nationalist instinct in the United Kingdom which is at the centre of the debate on Brexit. It is the campaigning zeal of those in favour of Brexit that has led to Britain walking away from its historical responsibilities in Europe as a whole and off the stage in meeting its responsibilities here. We have had 20 years - perhaps longer - in which everything we said about the United Kingdom and our relationship with it was couched in friendly terminology. It was important to do so. It was important and responsible that Irish Governments and those representing the State did not say anything that would have inflamed tensions or made things worse, particularly when lives were at risk. However, there comes a stage when one has to call a spade a spade. When the Prime Minister in 10 Downing Street is pandering to the worst excesses of British nationalism, we must call it out. The new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom had a fantastic opportunity to come to the Houses to speak to Members about the Good Friday Agreement, her commitment to it and the fact that Brexit would not impact necessarily on peace on this island, but she is reportedly refusing to do so. I suggest it is important for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, as a representative of the Government, to speak in frank terms about our dismay that Ireland and Northern Ireland are not on the real priority list for the Prime Minister and her Government and also when overseeing and commenting on events in Northern Ireland in the coming period say it is social issues, including equality and empowerment, the issues beyond orange and green, that will come to the fore. It is time to put to one side the niceties of language and the pretence of friendship because if one cannot speak frankly to people who are walking away from their historical responsibilities, we are doing the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland a disservice. This is not about a flag waving blame game. I am the last person in the world who would stand with a Tricolour and fly it in somebody's face to try to score a nationalistic point off them. That is not me. It worries me to the bone that such a powerful country with such historical responsibilities to a place on which it has had a significant impact for centuries does not give a thought to it and does not take the opportunity to settle nerves about its intentions. I would like the Minister to respond to my remarks. I understand he has responsibility for this ministry and his words carry weight. That is very important. It is important that Members speak frankly about the direction the Prime Minister and her Government are taking in dealing with the situation in Northern Ireland and issues that affect the entire island of Ireland.
