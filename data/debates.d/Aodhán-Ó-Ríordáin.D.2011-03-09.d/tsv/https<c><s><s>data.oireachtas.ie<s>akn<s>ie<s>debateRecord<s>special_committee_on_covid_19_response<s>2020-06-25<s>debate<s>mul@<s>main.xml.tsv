AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Can the witnesses put in context the school lives that children with additional needs lead? There is a tendency to assume that everything is working well and that this July provision debate comes in an extreme circumstance, which is why we are discussing it. Can the witnesses speak to the reality experienced by parents who cannot find a school place? Can they speak to the waiting lists that are there for basic interventions that can often last as long as five years? I have documentation here from constituents of mine, one of whom has a daughter aged six who has been on the waiting list for two years for a basic intervention. She has autism and the letter from the HSE states in black and white that the waiting list for Beechpark services is five years long. Can the witnesses speak to the fact that many parents go from school to school trying to get a school place and can be and are turned down? Can the witnesses speak to the number of times the Minister has invoked his right under the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 to instruct a school to open a unit? Can the witnesses speak to the fact that because of the constitutional reality, the Department of Education and Skills abdicates its responsibility and puts the onus on parents to find a school place for their children and that special educational needs organisers, SENOs, hand a list of schools to parents and basically abandon them at that point? We have parents who have been to 15, 16, 17 and 18 schools looking for a school place for their children. Can the witnesses speak to the fact that parents become campaigners when they do not want to be campaigners? They need the State to defend and protect them and to care for them. What happens is that they suffer huge levels of exhaustion because at one point, one is dealing with a challenge in one's family life where someone has a diagnosis that has to be dealt with and learned about and then overnight and at the same time, one becomes a campaigner for services that are not there.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I accept that.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is fine. I will bring it back to that context so. Given the context of the deficiency of services and of State provision for children with additional needs, how do the witnesses reflect on how these issues can be addressed in the long term in terms of the July provision and of schools returning in September?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for the presentation. My first question is about the summer programme. A principal contacted me to say that she was under the impression or she was told that the pupil-teacher ratio for the summer programme would 6:1. On that basis she encouraged four teachers from her staff to sign up to the programme, which they did. Then she got an official notification from the Department stating that the ratio would be 12:1. As a result, two of the teachers who had signed up for the programme will now no longer be able to do it. Will Mr. Tattan comment on that? Was there an official statement from the Department that it would be 6:1, and if that situation changed what was the reason? I will read a message that was sent out by a school regarding July provision. I want to get the reaction from the Department to the message that parents are getting from schools. It states: "Due to lack of guidance and support from the Department of Education and for health and safety reasons the school has decided not to participate in the summer provision programme". That came from a primary school. I was a primary school principal and when a primary school principal is engaging with the parent body, one's language is very tight. One generally does not use any type of blame, one might say. However, this is quite stark. What reaction would the Department have to such a communication from a school to a parent body? The third issue is transport for July provision. Certainly, in an urban context it might be easier to access July provision if it is school based, but it is obviously more challenging if one lives further from the facility. However, even in an urban context many people and children have to travel long distances in transport which is often provided but which I understand will not be provided in these circumstances. I ask the witnesses to respond on those three issues - the pupil-teacher ratio, the statement from the school to the parents and the issue of transport.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am referring to the DEIS programme.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is it the case that at no stage should any school have been under the impression that the ratio was 6:1?
