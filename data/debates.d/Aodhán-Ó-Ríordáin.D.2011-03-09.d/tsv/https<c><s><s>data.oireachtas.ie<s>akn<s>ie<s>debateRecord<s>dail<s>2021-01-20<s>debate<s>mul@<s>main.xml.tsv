AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Nobody in the House denies the Minister has a difficult job. I particularly notice accusations from the Opposition and his own Government Members that are not truthful and that could be extremely frustrating for the Minister. I heard a Member from the Opposition state we are at the bottom of the European table when it comes to vaccination, which is not true, and a Member from the Government - the Minister's own party - stated that vaccinations are only happening from Monday to Friday, and again that is not true. I know that in the Minister's position, he must battle through many political accusations and misinformation. However, I know if the Minister were standing where I am now, he would make the exact speech I am about to make. I know if he were still in his role as part of the Opposition, he would not find any way to justify the treatment of student nurses and midwives. I know he would rail against it. I know he would connect the new pay deal for the Secretary General at the Department of Health with this matter. I know he would probably pick up the speech the Minister would have just made and dismiss it out of hand as being tone deaf to the reality of the work being done by those who are putting their health and lives at risk. The Minister does not need to be reminded of this but I will do so anyway. Yesterday, 93 people were recorded as having died from this virus.The youngest was 41 years of age, and yet student nurses and midwives are working in this scenario for poverty pay. My Labour Party colleague, Senator Hoey, has published a Bill, the intent of which is to link the pay of student nurses and midwives to the rate paid to healthcare assistants in recognition of the increased workload and risk. The INMO has also called for healthcare assistant contracts for all students whose placements were suspended and clarity on what will happen to placements over the coming months. The Minister mentioned his own review, but as the INMO has stated, it is quite clear that this review is out of date and is not going to cut it. It is not good enough. The Minister would not accept it if he was in my position, and the student nurses and midwives should not accept it either. They need to be paid at the healthcare assistant rate to reflect the higher levels of risk in the health service, as proposed in the Labour Party Bill. There are other outstanding issues that need to be addressed, including the fact that nurses are being asked to pay for the privilege of renewing their membership of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, for 2021. I put it to the Minister quite baldly that we are all being told that we are in this together, that all of the old received wisdom and legacies are being challenged, and that there is nothing that will not be done to address the situation, but that patently is not true. I wish that student nurses and midwives had the same power as other lobby groups who seem to be able to influence Government policy. I wish they had the same power as the hospitality industry and that they had the ability to change completely the methodology and mechanisms being used by the Government to address this problem. I wish the Minister had bent the advice he got from within his Department to facilitate student nurses as he did to facilitate hospitality and home visits simultaneously in December. I wish that student nurses and midwives had the same power as the private hospital sector, which seems to be a sacred cow in this country and one that must be pussyfooted around. Robust engagement with that sector seems to be impossible for some reason. Apparently people like me, standing where I stand, just do not understand the complexity of the situation, how delicate and difficult it is or the fact that it is not at all simple. However, when it comes to student nurses and midwives, the Department conducts a review, which is already out of date, and recommends a payment of €100 which it believes will suffice. At the same time the Department believes that the new Secretary General of the Department of Health is fully worth an extra €81,000. None of this adds up. The problem here, as far as the Irish public is concerned, is that there is a deep unfairness at the heart of all of this. When it comes down to it, for those on the front line who are putting their own health and lives at risk as well as the health and lives of their families, there is a barrier or a line which the Government will not cross, unless it involves rounds of applause. I know that the Minister for Health would be saying the very same thing if he was standing where I am standing now. I have some advice for him from his friends and colleagues in the Labour Party. I suggest that he thinks of the speech he would make if he was still an Opposition health spokesperson.I suggest that he realise the depth of feeling regarding this issue within hospitals and healthcare settings and among student nurses themselves. I ask him to reflect on how embittered people are and on the length of time for which this issue will affect their mindsets as they look forward to a career in this area. I also ask him to reflect on the amount of money this would actually cost in the overall scheme of things. I ask him to reflect on how he can justify the pay increase of €81,000 for the Secretary General of the Department of Health and on the reasons he has given for this increase, which include that the job is difficult, high-powered and responsible. Reflecting on that, he might consider how those superlatives and adjectives might apply to the role of the student nurses and midwives who are asking to be paid and how they will have to register this year and pay for that privilege. I ask him to reflect on all these matters. I know, as the Minister knows, that these things are not simple and that it would take some manoeuvring and action on his part but, if anything has been proven over the course of this pandemic it is that if Government really wants to do something it can do it. What I learned from my time in government is that, when a group is important and strong enough and when the political will is strong enough, anything can be achieved. The problem is that the will is just not there. Perhaps this is because departmental officials are advising the Minister that this may set an unwanted precedent and that it may open a Pandora's box that it would not be possible to close but, in the fullness of time when this pandemic is over, this will be a black mark on the Minister's own record and that of the Government. It will be felt that when it came down to it these people were just not worth more than €100. If the Minister was standing where I am, he would be saying the exact same thing. The Labour Party supports this motion. We have not just been drafting motions, but have published legislation. We want these payments to be given so that these people can have the dignity they deserve and we want the Minister to live up to the rhetoric he used in opposition now that he is in his current position. I ask him not to stand behind speeches which he would have decried if he were standing where I am.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I join the Taoiseach and others in expressing the Labour Party's sympathy to the families of those who lost their lives yesterday, one of whom was 41 years of age, which should be a reminder to everybody in society that this is a virus that can affect all age groups. I also join the Taoiseach in congratulating, if I may say, one of our own in becoming President of the United States on his inauguration today. The Labour Party is attempting to de-escalate the tensions that have been involved in the special education issue. We do not feel at this point that it is going to benefit anybody to point the finger, to blame or to join the attempt to create division between special education teachers, SNAs and parents. However, I put it to the Taoiseach that it is now time for him to get involved because it is clear that the Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, have lost control of the situation. We were quite supportive of the Minister and the Minister of State in investigating the possibility of reopening schools, as the Taoiseach rightly said, for certain cohorts. We believe that the closing of schools is a profoundly negative thing to happen to children and it profoundly negatively affects the most vulnerable children, including those with additional needs and those in areas of disadvantage as well. However, from the start of this year, 6 January, an announcement was made on school reopening with no consultation. The Taoiseach should please not make liars of trade union leaders who say that they were not consulted about the flat announcement on 6 January. On 14 January, another announcement was made, before an education debate in this House, on the reopening of special schools and special classes. Again, there was no agreement. On 15 January, at 8 o'clock on a Friday evening, a letter was sent to every school in the country on the reopening of special schools. Again, there was no agreement. Even since last night, we had an extremely ill-advised communication from the Department, with quotes from both Ministers, pointing fingers all over the place. Both unions issued a joint communication saying that they were still at the table and willing to talk. Comments from the Minister, Deputy Foley, this morning, suggested that comments made about one of the union leaders was disingenuous. The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, made a comparison between this situation and the mother and baby homes, and last week she made a comment about non-SNA students being normal. We have been doing our best as a political entity to try to be constructive. In the spirit of being constructive, could I ask the Taoiseach if his office would get centrally involved in this situation? Does he appreciate the severity of the situation and how dangerous it is for young people to be out of school for this length of time? Does he recognise that the entire reopening of schools is now in jeopardy because of the bad faith that has been shown by Ministers in their public comments? Will the Taoiseach also comment, please, on the potential for the next round of vaccinations to be centred on this area because that would give some comfort to those who are expected to be involved in this process? I put it to the Taoiseach that the Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, are now part of the problem and the Taoiseach and his office can be part of the solution. It is important for the Taoiseach and his office now to step in.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the Taoiseach's response but he underestimates the damage that has been done in public commentary by the Minister and Minister of State. The Taoiseach mentioned the webinar last Monday, but I am aware of a webinar that took place last night. While this process was falling apart, the Minister, Deputy Foley, took it upon herself to attend a Fianna Fáil-sponsored webinar at 7 o'clock last night. We had a press statement from her yesterday evening and media comments this morning from her and the Minister of State in the Department that have been deeply unhelpful. Other school reopenings are now at risk because of the bad faith exhibited and bridges being burned all over the place by the Minister and Minister of State. Their commentary is ill-tempered and must be de-escalated. It is now the responsibility of the Taoiseach and his office to step in because the Minister and Minister of State are not in control of the situation.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We support that call. There is no need to elongate the debate on it. It is important that the Minister comes before the House to facilitate questions on this important matter.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On that, we are not suggesting that the new Secretary General of the Department of Health should be paid nothing. The Taoiseach, however, does expect student nurses and midwives to be paid nothing. On the matter of vaccinations, because this is an important issue, the Taoiseach is battling against misinformation, not just from the Internet but from within his own party on certain occasions, regarding the weekday-only roll-out of vaccinations, which is not true. Members of the Opposition have also suggested that our vaccination rate is the lowest in Europe, which is also not true. Unfortunately, however, misinformation is even coming from the HSE. I have received such information regarding a hospital in my constituency. These are understandable mistakes and teething problems, but we feel we need a dedicated Minister of State to be the point person in Government for the vaccination process. There is much goodwill around the country for what the Government is trying to achieve and we in the Labour Party certainly want to play our part. It would be beneficial, however, if we had a dedicated Minister of State in place with full responsibility for the vaccination process as we roll it out and we want the Taoiseach to consider it.
