AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	As we have a quorum, I call the meeting to order.  At the request of the broadcasting and recording services, I ask members to ensure their mobile telephones are turned off completely and not left on silent mode for the duration of the meeting.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Charlie McConalogue.  I propose we go into private session to deal with correspondence and other housekeeping matters.
The joint committee went into private session at 10.05 a.m. and resumed in public session at 10.10 a.m.
