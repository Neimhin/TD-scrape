AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	With regard to the overall discussion about the Teaching Council, there must be a mid-way point between absolute abolition and retention as it is.  Perhaps the committee could invite representatives of the Teaching Council to appear before it for a wide-ranging discussion on the way the council does its business.  The Teaching Council is currently considering matters relating to some of the requirements to become a teacher in primary education, including some of the requirements from the leaving certificate.  It might be timely, in view of this discussion, to talk to some people in the Teaching Council about its structures and its engagement with the teaching profession.  It is fair to acknowledge, as Deputy O'Sullivan has correctly pointed out, that there is a level of dissatisfaction among teachers.  Every agency of the State in this period of reform must reassert its credibility and the need for the agency.  I will propose inviting the Teaching Council to attend a meeting when we sit as the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education.
