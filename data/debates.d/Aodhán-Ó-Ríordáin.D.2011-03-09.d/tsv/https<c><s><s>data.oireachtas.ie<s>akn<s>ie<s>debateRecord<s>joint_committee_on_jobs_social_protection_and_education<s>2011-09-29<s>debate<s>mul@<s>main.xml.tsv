AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We will have a presentation from the Department of Education and Skills but the Deputy has ensured a spot on the news tonight.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Finally, I call on Deputy Tóibín.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for their positive contributions, for coming here today and outlining the importance of the USA to this country in economic terms, as the report demonstrates.  We are all enjoying the robust Republican debates late night on Fox News.  They keep me entertained if nothing else.  The strong trading links between both countries are very positive at this point in time and augur well for the future rebuilding of the Irish economy.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	The next item is a briefing by officials from the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills on proposals to ensure that there is a better skills match between industry needs and third level graduates and to develop enterprise education in Irish secondary schools and business innovation in third level institutions.I welcome the following: Mr. Kevin McCarthy, assistant secretary; Ms Anne Forde, principal officer, higher education and policy section; and Ms Margaret Kelly, principal officer, qualifications, curriculum and assessment policy section of the Department of Education and Skills.  I also welcome Mr. Pat Nolan, principal officer, science and technology policy unit; Mr. Eamon McHale, principal officer, local enterprise section; Mr. Gary Dixon, assistant principal officer, industrial relations unit; and all the officials of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I also welcome Mr. Cathal Fitzgerald who is here in the place of Marie Bourke, department manager, educational and skills and labour market policy unit of Forfás.Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.

AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. McCarthy for the presentation.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Do any of the officials wish to respond?
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I will call the next speakers and the officials might respond to their contributions.  I will call Deputy Conaghan followed by Senator O'Donnell and Deputy Lawlor.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Senator, this is not necessarily a suitable topic for this meeting.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	The witnesses may not be in a position to answer it.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	The validity of the question is not at issue.  It is simply that it is not relevant to the topic under discussion at this meeting.  We can discuss at another time.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Officials are not in a position to comment on Government policy.  I invite Mr. McCarthy to comment on the contributions that have been made.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We appear to have gotten a lot of secondary school teachers out of the last general election.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Nothing will have a larger impact in a classroom than an excellent teacher.  Giving a teacher the opportunity to acquire such skill sets is difficult.  There is a heavy emphasis on teaching maths, science and technology subjects.  A Teaching Council report on one primary school training college, however, noted the time allocated for religion in the college was four times that for science.  Is the delegation concerned about this finding?  Have the teacher training colleges adequate resources to impart balanced skill sets to teachers?
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps the officials will respond to the questions that have been raised?
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I asked about training colleges and the imbalance.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I thank the officials for briefing the committee on a fundamentally important issue.
