AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Cheann Comhairle as ucht an deis seo a thabhairt dom labhairt an ábhar seo inniu. Last Tuesday a constituent of mine was shot dead in Furry Park in Killester. A street was cordoned off, Garda barriers were erected and local children learned that a man was shot. Eamon Kelly was a notorious criminal but daylight murder should not happen in a civilised society. There are those who would openly argue that as long as these people are killing each other, it does not matter. There are those who say people who live by the sword die by the sword or that this was no loss. These people do not have a clue about what they are talking. I am thankful this murder did not injure or harm any bystander or other innocent party.However, such events imprint themselves on the consciousness of a community, which is not healthy. I know children who have lost family members to violent crime, and this has created a scar that will last a lifetime and poison their minds, possibly irreversibly. The killing of Eamon Kelly was connected to the murder, also in my constituency, of Alan Ryan, who was shot dead on 3 September last. The Irish Times reported the following in connection with the killings:Gardaí believe Ryan was shot dead in a conspiracy between a number of crime gangs as part of their efforts to resist the extortion demands of the Real IRA, with Ryan having led that extortion campaign. Intelligence suggests the Real IRA believe Eamon Kelly had assisted the gangs in organising the Ryan murder, with Kelly believed to have been gunned down as a result of his involvement.Deputy Kevin Humphreys and I represent areas where young children and men are dragged into gang culture as they seek a perverse sense of empowerment. I have a number of direct questions for the Minister. Does he agree that murder is murder regardless of who is the victim and whether he or she is known to the Garda? Does he have a view on how we can prevent this specific feud and feuds in general from spiralling out of control to avoid further bloodshed? Does he agree that constant attacks by politicians and media commentators on the pay, terms and conditions of the Garda Síochána are undermining Garda morale? Is he confident the Garda has sufficient resources to address this issue? How can we prevent young men and women from being sucked into this destructive way of life?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for his response and ask him to elaborate on the following statement in his reply:It is also unrealistic to expect the Garda Commissioner to devote his entire resources to protecting individually people who are routinely trying to avoid the Garda in order that they can continue to engage in criminal activity. Such an approach could only come at the expense of ordinary Garda activity to protect the community generally.If there is a suspicion that someone may be shot, surely other persons in his or her vicinity will also be at risk? I will repeat my question and ask whether the Minister agrees that murder is murder. The Minister of State's reply did not give any of the Minister's thoughts on how the feud to which I referred could be prevented from spiralling out of control. We are aware of two killings related to this particular issue, both of which occurred in a small geographical area of my constituency. How can we prevent someone else being shot? Both of the recent killings took place in broad daylight. Such events do not take place in a civilised society and I do not want to see Garda tape about the place when I travel around my constituency. I am not convinced by the reply the Minister of State gave. While I do not expect the Garda Commissioner to devote his entire resources to protecting those who are at risk of assassination, at the same time, we must understand the nature of these types of murder attempts and who could be hurt or potentially killed as a result of them.  The Minister of State addressed the issue of Garda resources. Does he agree that when people consistently attack Garda pay and conditions, which are covered by various agreements, they undermine Garda morale? How can we prevent young people from disadvantaged areas being sucked into a criminal way of life to pursue a perverse sense of empowerment?
