AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	My amendment specifies the need for an adult learner to be on the ETBs. It states: "and the Minister shall nominate 1 man and 1 woman who are representative of students and who are registered as students in a centre for education or recognised school or are learners in an education or training facility or other facility maintained by any other public service body where the board provides education or training and have reached 18 years of age for appointment to the board." This is recommended by NALA. I would like the Minister to consider this, if not now, on Report Stage.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I understand where the Minister is coming from and I acknowledge the business element might be difficult to nail down but because of the education that will be provided by ETBs, the nature of the students who will attend, the nature of the further education sector and the fact that the empowerment of the student body has not necessarily always been to the forefront, it would be much easier to close that circle of empowerment by having an adult learner on the board and to make that a statutory requirement along with a requirement relating to the other representatives the Minister suggests.
