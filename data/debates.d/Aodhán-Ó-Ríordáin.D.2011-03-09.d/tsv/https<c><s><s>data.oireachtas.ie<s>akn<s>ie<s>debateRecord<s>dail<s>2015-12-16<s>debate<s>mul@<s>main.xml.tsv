AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. a1:In page 7, after line 29, to insert the following:“(3) An order under subsection (2) may, in respect of the repeal of the Act specified in section 6(1) effected by that section, appoint different days for the repeal of different provisions of that Act.”. I will now deal with amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 4.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 8, to delete lines 6 to 10 and substitute the following: “ “applicant” means a person who—(a) has made an application for international protection in accordance with section 15, or on whose behalf such an application has been made or is deemed to have been made, and(b) has not ceased, under subsection (2), to be an applicant;”.This grouping of amendments relates to the definition of various terms for the purpose of this Act. Amendment No. 1 is a minor amendment to the definition of the term "applicant". Amendment No. 2 provides a definition of the term "biometric information", which is referenced in section 2. Amendment No. 4 provides a definition for the term "DNA profile" which is referenced in section 2.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 8, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:“ “biometric information” means information relating to the distinctive physical characteristics of a person including—(a) measurements or other assessments of those characteristics,(b) information about those characteristics held in an automated form, but does not include references to the DNA profile of a person, and references to the provision by a person of biometric information means its provision in a way that enables the identity of the person to be investigated or ascertained;”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 3:In page 8, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:“ “chief international protection officer” means the person appointed under section 74 to be the chief international protection officer;”.Amendment No. 3 provides a definition of a chief international protection officer who will be responsible for the management of the international protection office which will be established in the Department of Justice and Equality. Amendment No. 5 provides a definition for the term "international protection officer". Amendment No. 177 inserts a new section into the Bill on international protection officers. This section provides inter alia that these officers shall be independent in the performance of their functions under the Act. Amendment No. 178 inserts a new section into the Bill on the chief international protection officer. It provides for the appointment of the chief international protection officer by the Minister and that this person shall be independent in the performance of their functions under the Act.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I have heard various descriptions of the Bill and the tone of this debate brings more emotive language to the discussion of this Bill, which is completely unnecessary. Why would the Minister for Justice and Equality appoint somebody who is completely unfit for the job? This individual will come from the Civil Service and will meet UNHCR standards. The overall point of the Bill, which the Deputy alluded to, is to ensure that people do not languish in the protection system for years on end, which is the overarching problem identified by every NGO I have come in contact with concerning the protection system in Ireland. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that applicants for protection in this country will get a decision on their application within six months and finality on that decision within 12 months. There will not be a situation in which they languish in the system, many in direct provision, for a long number of years. That is the point of the Bill. The international protection officer will be a person of the highest standard who will exercise his or her duties fairly and independently.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am fascinated by the terminology used by the Deputy, including that this legislation is being rammed through the House. It has been around for approximately 15 years-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----the result of which is that this issue has not been addressed. Every NGO of which I am aware has been calling for a long time for the introduction of a single procedure mechanism. The Deputy will be aware that the expiry of the term of office of the Government is approaching. It is important in the context of the current protection process in Ireland that we put this issue to bed and put in place a single procedure to ensure the system will be more transparent and efficient. The current system is not fit for purpose. On the Deputy's reference to the lack of a definition of international protection officers, the purpose of these amendments is to define their role. They will be civil servants trained to UNHCR standard. The point of the exercise is to ensure improvement of the system. I am sure the Deputy will agree that, owing to a lack of reform of the current asylum system for many years, it is broken. What we are attempting to do by way of this process is review and assess it in a humane and proper fashion, understanding all the while that even since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for this area and the appointment of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to her portfolio, the situation has changed radically in terms of the number of people coming to Ireland to seek protection, including those who are coming here because of the situation internationally. Be that as it may, the objective is to put in place a protection process to deal with individuals with dignity and respect and to ensure their applications will be processed in a fair and independent manner.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There are only so many times I can repeat the same point. All international protection officers will be civil servants who will be trained to UNHCR standard. The suggestion that what is being proposed will lead to the outsourcing of these roles is tiresome. That is not the case. IPOs will be civil servants who will be trained to UNHCR standard and will exercise their role independently.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy is correct that it is not specified in the Bill. The staff of the international protection office will be civil servants transferred from the Refugee Application Service to take up this role. They will be civil servants who, as I said, will be trained to UNHCR standard. I assume what the Deputies opposite are suggesting is the highest possible standards in the processing of applications might not be adhered to. We must have a system in which people can have faith. In this regard, there are international standards we have to uphold. As a country, we must ensure our international process is in line with that in place in every other European country. Our protection process in recent years has not been one of which we can be proud. Part of the reason for this is legislation of this type has not been given priority for more than 15 years. We are now in a position where we can address this issue appropriately. I assure Deputies that international protection officers will be civil servants who will be trained to UNHCR standard and that we will deal with applications on that basis.The asylum status is a fundamental international status and the UNHCR is strong in its opinion that it should retain that international status for many different reasons. The Bill will proceed on that basis. The suggestion about outsourcing and privatisation does not stand up to scrutiny. These will be civil servants trained to the highest UNHCR standards. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is implicit in section 73 that international protection officers will be civil servants. The Minister is not empowered to authorise anyone who is not a civil servant. Section 73 provides, "The Minister may authorise in writing such and so many persons as he or she considers appropriate to perform the functions". The Minister cannot authorise anyone who is not a civil servant. Only a civil servant can perform this function. While it may not be explicit, it is certainly implicit in the section. I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies. I appreciate the comments made about my bona fides. We are attempting to improve the Bill and we are accepting many of the amendments tabled by the Opposition in order to make it better. There is no intention here but to do the best for those vulnerable people who seek our protection and have a system that works better. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Section 73.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I have already outlined that the Minister can only authorise civil servants to carry out these functions. He or she cannot authorise anyone else. It is implicit in the text.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am on page 27, section 73.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In terms of the amendments, "The Minister may authorise in writing such and so many persons as he or she considers appropriate to perform the functions conferred on international protection officers by or under this Act". These people can only be civil servants.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am working off the list of amendments. The central point is that section 73(1) provides, "The Minister may authorise in writing such and so many persons as he or she considers appropriate to perform the functions conferred on an international protection officer". The Minister cannot authorise just anyone to fulfil this role. This is implicit. No Minister in any circumstance can authorise anyone within his or her Department who is not a civil servant. That is the reality of the situation. It is implicit in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There will be people who will make the decision. There will be people who will assist the individual in terms of the operation of the office but the international protection officer who makes the decision will be authorised by the Minister and that person must be a civil servant.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	These are Government amendments-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We are dealing with a group of amendments relating to the functions of the international protection officer. The issue arising relates to the outsourcing or privatisation of this service. What I am trying to outline to the Deputies opposite is that implicit in the Bill is that such individuals will be civil servants, as appointed by the Minister and the Minister cannot do otherwise. That is in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 4:In page 8, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:“ “DNA profile” has the meaning it has in section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014;”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 5:In page 9, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:““international protection officer” means a person who is authorised under section 73 to perform the functions conferred on an international protection officer by or under this Act;”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	As with all other amendments, I appreciate the attempt being made to improve the Bill and safeguard the best interests of those who are seeking protection in Ireland, particularly children. Before we entered into this process, the term "best interests of the child" was mentioned three times in the Bill. If we conclude today's proceedings successfully, the term will be mentioned in the Bill seven times as a result of the interaction we have had with Opposition Deputies who have been trying to improve it by tabling positive amendments. A lot of it comes down to terminology which is consistent with EU directives. The term “separated child” is not defined in the EU directives to which the Bill seeks to give effect. Unfortunately, I cannot agree with the proposed amendment as the term does not need to be defined and is not one used in the text of the Bill. All children who arrive in the State will be protected by the provisions of the Bill, with the best interests of the child taken being the primary consideration.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We have to keep in line with international terminology and EU directives. I repeat that the term is not defined in EU directives and our legislation has to keep in line with such EU directives. I appreciate that the Deputy is attempting to improve the Bill in the best interests of children.Following our deliberations, the best interest of the child will be implicit and explicit throughout the Bill, which many would suggest would not have happened if it was not for Opposition and Government amendments. In this particular situation, we are dealing with terminology and the proposed term is not defined in the new directives.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate what the Deputy is saying. We all want to be in a position to support a single procedure mechanism. I have no difficulty with taking soundings from NGOs and am aware of their concerns. However, the Government is entitled to disagree. Our amendments and the advice we have received from the Attorney General and officials must also be considered. A number of voices must be taken into consideration. In terms of the specific amendment and the term "stateless person", we must keep in line with international law and EU directives. I cannot accept the proposed amendment as the term is not defined in EU directives. If the term is not defined, it is not a term we can entertain. It is not defined in the EU directives that this Bill gives effect to.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 8:In page 11, to delete lines 5 to 26 and substitute the following:“(2) A person shall cease to be an applicant on the date on which—(a) subject to subsection (3), the Minister refuses—(i) under subsection (2) or (3) of section 46 to give the person a refugee declaration, or(ii) under section 46(5) both to give a refugee declaration and to give a subsidiary protection declaration to the person,(b) subject to subsection (3), he or she is first given, under section 53(1), a permission to reside in the State, or(c) he or she is transferred from the State in accordance with the Dublin Regulation.(3) Where—(a) a recommendation referred to in section 38(3)(b) is made in respect of an applicant, and(b) the applicant appeals under section 40(1)(a) against the recommendation,notwithstanding the giving, under section 46(4)(a), of a subsidiary protection declaration to the applicant on the basis of the recommendation, he or she shall, for the purposes of this Act, remain an applicant until, following the decision of the Tribunal in relation to the appeal, the Minister, under section 46, gives or, as the case may be, refuses to give him or her a refugee declaration.”.This amendment provides further clarity on when a person ceases to be an applicant under the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We are dealing with two separate issues if we are talking about the Bill and the direct provision system. Approximately half of the people here seeking asylum are in direct provision and half are not. There are approximately 4,500 people in direct provision and a similar number are not. Members know the working group was established 18 months ago and it reported earlier this year. A number of those recommendations are being worked on. It is the only document in town when it comes to direct provision and nothing else is being entertained. It is the document that the Government is working from and many of the recommendations are in this Bill. Other recommendations, such as those relating to the right to work provision mentioned by the Deputy, are currently being assessed by the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy. I have visited approximately 14 centres around the country. The overarching and main issue that is constantly being raised is the length of time in the system. It does not matter what kind of wonderful conditions that anybody could possibly put in place for people seeking protection as they just want out. It is not a place to live for a long period or, certainly, to raise a family. We do not accept the amendment because this is a different issue from what is being dealt with in the Bill. Since the publication of the report between 60 and 80 people per month who have lived in the direct provision system over five years have been getting leave to remain. The report's recommendations are being implemented, even in this Bill. We have seen over 80 deportation orders quashed since July. Other recommendations are yet to be effected. If we get to a stage where every asylum application is assessed within six months, it would logically follow that asylum seekers could access the labour market and other entitlements. When direct provision was first established, it was a response to a homelessness issue. There were 10,000 applications per year in the early 2000s and people were living in parks and playgrounds, sleeping on benches because there was nowhere for them to live. It was a homelessness crisis in the asylum system. The direct provision system was established with the intention that applicants would be there for a number of months. I could stand over a system where people would live in a facility for a number of months but I cannot stand over a system that belittles people because they are there for years on end. That is why we put together a working group to consider the entire process, including direct provision. It did not advocate an amnesty but rather that anybody in the system for over five years should see a fast-track approach in their application. That is exactly what is happening and I have mentioned the figures already. This is for new applicants and to deal with them in a fairer and more transparent fashion so that they do not have to languish in a protection system for years on end. This is so we do not have the scandalous position of families living in and children being born in centres, living there for nine, ten or 11 years and knowing nothing else but the walls of a direct provision centre. We are trying to effect reform to deal with the backlog of applications in the system. For the information of the Deputies opposite, approximately 450 people in direct provision have leave to remain but have nowhere to go because of housing issues. I have had to take on the responsibility of chairing a task force, examining the information and empowering people to be able to access accommodation, dealing with local authorities and housing agencies to ensure that families can get out of direct provision into accommodation to rebuild their lives. They have an absolute right to do that. We are working with them. The worst thing we could do to a family is say that they have leave to remain and show them the door. We have not done that. There are approximately 18 cases of people who have been in direct provision for more than a year after they get leave to remain status. I understand and admire the Deputies' intent and campaigning zeal on the issue. We have worked together on this issue, as we have with many Deputies opposite. The intent of this Bill is to have a process that is much more humane and transparent, so as to deal with the issue much more quickly than the current system. Direct provision is a separate issue that is being dealt with through the report, which has been signed off by many non-governmental organisations in the field. Its recommendations are being implemented as I speak.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Deputy for his contribution. There were three references to the best interests of the child in the first draft of the Bill but because of amendments such as this, on the passage of the Bill, there will be at least seven references. I do not accept the Deputy's amendment and I will outline the reasons shortly. The Bill will be better as a result of the contributions from across the House. We do not oppose the motivations behind the amendment but, unfortunately, we are dealing with technical wording that appears in legislation. The working group on the protection process, including direct provision and supports to asylum seekers, held a similar view and one whose intent I share. However, the working group did not consider the potential impact on other areas of this Bill, including the fact it refers to the protection process and certain immigration provisions. Following extensive legal advice, I am satisfied the provisions in the legislation and our amendments ensure not only the intent of the recommendations but also fulfil the Government's policy to enable such protection to be included in our Constitution, as the Deputy has mentioned. The amendment does not legally satisfy the advice we have been given and would have an unintended consequence beyond the scope intended that we cannot resolve at this stage. We have explored all avenues to reassure all those who rightly advocate for children's rights that the Bill will ensure the best interests of the child will be a primary consideration in the protection process, ensuring the best practice, which exists in our process, will be embedded in the practices that will result from the enactment of the Bill. A number of amendments have been tabled by the Government which will further strengthen the safeguards for children in the legislation. A provision has been inserted in section 15(4) to provide for the Child and Family Agency to include legal advice when deciding if an application should be made in respect of an unaccompanied minor. We also propose an amendment to section 27 along with an amendment to section 25. These were prompted following serious engagement with Senator van Turnhout and the Children's Rights Alliance. Amendment No. 74 also addresses this matter. The amendment is linked to amendment No. 52, which relates to section 27. We acknowledge the engagement of the Senator on this matter. The amendment, once again, demonstrates that in all appropriate provisions of the legislation, the Government has been wiling to reassure everyone that we are fully committed to ensuring best practice in respect of children in the protection process is not only at its heart but is embedded in the work of all those who will engage with children seeking protection. The new section 25(6) states: "The best interests of the child will be a primary consideration in the application of this section". While there may have been comments that there were not sufficient references to the best interests of the child, that has been addressed and such references are much more explicit than was previously the case.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 11:In page 12, to delete lines 20 to 23.This is a technical amendment. The advice of Parliamentary Counsel in the Attorney General's office is that this subsection is not required.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No, that is not the intent of amendment No. 11. That amendment was tabled on the advice of the Attorney General's office. I understand that the purpose of all of the amendments tabled to this Bill by Deputies is to improve the Bill from a humanitarian point of view. Were this legislation being debated anywhere else in Europe, the intent of a number of the amendments sought would be to not have as generous or humanitarian a focus as is provided for in this legislation. However, in Ireland we have political parties and representatives who are doing their best to ensure that our protection process is as humanitarian as possible. The Minister and I appreciate the motivation behind each amendment tabled. In not accepting any of the amendments, we are not in any way trying to refute or criticise the intentions of those who have tabled them. On amendment No. 12, the Bill, as set out in section 5, already provides for the serving of documents to legal representatives, where appropriate.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister and I are satisfied that section 5, as drafted, adequately covers the serving of documents to legal representatives, which is the motivation behind amendment No. 12.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	These amendments deal primarily with the issue of domestic violence. I will deal with the amendments one by one. I cannot agree to amendments Nos. 13 and 14. The section in the Bill is in line with the EU qualifications directive and the list contained in section 7 of the Bill is not an exhaustive or limited one. I cannot agree to amendment No. 128 which relates to permission given to family members of qualified persons. The category of person referred to in the proposed amendments has other remedies available to him or her, either by changing the residency permission or under the Immigration Act 1999. Amendment No. 131 relates to permissions given to family members of qualified persons. Again, the category of person referred to in the proposed amendments has other remedies available to him or her, either by changing the residency permission or under the Immigration Act 1999. I, therefore, cannot agree to the amendment. The same issue and reasons apply in terms of amendment No. 132 as apply to amendment No. 131. Similar answers apply to amendments Nos. 143 and 144. I cannot agree to amendment No. 147. The list contained in the section is not exhaustive. Other forms of violence or abuse will be taken into account when dealing with international protection applications from vulnerable persons. Section 7(2)(a) defines acts which may amount to acts of persecution as including "acts of physical or mental violence, including acts of sexual violence". These can be used to establish an entitlement to protection need.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	If someone had been offered protection under our system and the relationship breaks down with resulting separation or divorce proceedings, this does not mean someone would have to automatically leave the State. The individual could apply to change his or her residency permission under the Immigration Act. While it may appear that such protections are no longer afforded to the individual, avenues are available under the Act which the person can pursue. I consider this reasonable.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	An EU directive.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I have already outlined my reasons for not accepting the amendments, although I understand the intent behind them. The Deputy's suggestion that it is a waste of time to table amendments does not stand up to scrutiny. Amendment No. 74, which has yet to be voted on but has already been discussed, on the best interests of the child principle is based on an amendment tabled by an Independent Senator in the Seanad. A number of amendments tabled by the Deputy's party are also being accepted by Government and I hope we will reach them today.Section 7 agreed to. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I cannot accept amendment No. 14 as the list provided for in the Bill is not exhaustive. I note there may be a suspicion that the list is an absolute and limited list but that is not the case. The list is not exhaustive and it is in line with the European Union asylum qualification directive. This is already encompassed within the text of the Bill and there is no need to prescribe it separately.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am happy to discuss the amendments individually.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 77 was tabled by Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and Deputy Boyd Barrett and again, I cannot agree to this amendment. The wording of this section is taken from Article 4.1 of the recast qualification directive which does not include a provision along the lines of the proposed amendment. Indeed, accepting this amendment may lead to a person being granted refugee status who does not meet the definition of a refugee as outlined in the Geneva Convention.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will deal with the amendments one by one. Some of what we have done in the amendments is reflective of the debate in the Seanad, when Senator van Turnhout and the Children's Rights Alliance had concerns around the Bill. I will explain that it will be necessary to have two opinions of the age of a suspected minor, not one, as previously envisaged, and also that the Child and Family Agency will be automatically involved. I cannot agree with amendments Nos. 16 and 17 as all applicants are asked for their date of birth as part of their initial interview on arrival. If the person gives a date of birth that makes them a minor, then they have self-identified as a minor, and that is the way it works. I also cannot agree with Sinn Féin's amendments Nos. 18 and 19 because there is a concern they may be too narrow. A child may be accompanied by a responsible person who is not covered in the suggested text of the amendments. Government amendment No. 72 is a technical drafting amendment. I cannot accept amendment No. 73, which seeks to insert a provision into section 24 which deals with the examination to determine the age of an unaccompanied minor in order to provide that such examinations should only be carried out as a measure of last resort. This amendment is not necessary. Section 24(1) clearly states that an age assessment examination will only be conducted when necessary for the purposes of determining the age of an applicant for international protection. Section 24(6) also provides that the best interests of the child will be a primary consideration in the application of this section. Amendment No. 74 is a Government amendment linked to amendment No. 52, which concerns section 27. We acknowledge the input of Senator van Turnhout in regard to this matter, which relates to having two opinions rather than one and also the involvement of the Child and Family Agency. Government amendment No. 76 arose from an engagement with the Children's Rights Alliance and Department officials. The alliance has many NGO members from the protection sector. This amendment gives a further reassurance that the best interests of the child are at the heart of the Bill and provides specific safeguards as to the assessment of the child's capacity to understand the process. Those provisions were not in the Bill previously but they will be as a result of accepting these amendments.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Officers will always err on the side of caution with children in age assessments, as they must because of the constitutional amendment passed and supported by all sides of this House. The issue with these amendments is that they risk adults claiming they are under 18. We have accepted Senator van Turnhout's advice on ensuring a second opinion is required and, if there is any doubt at all, the Child and Family Agency - Tusla intervenes. The officer has to err on the side of caution if there is any doubt in regard to the age of the applicant.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I have sympathy with what the Deputy has just said because that was my assumption in the past as well, namely, that the system erred by making the assumption that nobody coming here was telling the truth.I watched a documentary recently where an individual whose job it was to assess these claims gleefully told the interviewer that he had sanctioned just two out of 600 applications for asylum status. Part of the conversation around this Bill seems to come from the same place, from suspicion and an ungenerous spirit. Senators and Deputies have put forward amendments on the issue of children and unaccompanied minors, which is a particularly sensitive area. In regard to the first amendment in this group, if somebody arrives here and gives a date of birth that clearly identifies him or her as a minor, he or she has self-identified as a minor. The previous system, as envisaged, was that one officer would make a determination on that application. Now, as a result of amendments that have been submitted, the determination is that two officers must make a determination. If one officer makes a determination, the second officer must corroborate it. If there is any doubt and if somebody is clearly not a minor, that may be evident. If there is any doubt - for cultural or other reasons - the person is not a minor, the Child and Family Agency becomes involved. Therefore, we now have a double lock system and an external independent agency that will be involved in the process. Previously, one individual had all the power. Now this has changed and two officers must collaborate on the opinion and the Child and Family Agency may then be involved in copper-fastening the decision. Notwithstanding what I said previously about the perception of an unsympathetic system, we must remember that asylum is a sacred status and the UNHCR has constantly reaffirmed this. We undermine that sacred status if we do not ensure those who acquire this status meet the international criteria, which is why we like to ensure these checks and balances are in the system.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	If a 16 year old arrives in the manner articulated - I am sure that can and has happened - the determination on that situation is made by the protection officer with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. That is how that situation is dealt with. There is no suggestion that individual would not be entertained or that an application would not be processed. The amendments in this grouping deal with applications for international protection. I am not accepting amendment No. 20, as a provision is included to stop applicants making claims on behalf of their children in their own right, after their own cases have been completed, in an effort to frustrate the process and delay their removal from the State. Amendment No. 22 is a Government amendment. It is a technical amendment which adds a comma. I cannot accept amendment No. 23 as it would weaken the provision and would not be in the best interest of the child. Amendment No. 24 is a Government amendment which further amends and clarifies the information required to be provided by an applicant when making his or her application, which may have a bearing on other matters to be considered by the Minister for Justice and Equality as appropriate at any later stage. I am not agreeing to amendment No. 25, as a person arriving at the frontier of the State who is an unaccompanied minor will be referred to the Child and Family Agency, which will decide what is in the best interest of the child. The Child and Family Agency will make a decision on behalf of the child, based on the information and legal advice available to it. I am not agreeing to amendment No. 29, as the existing provision adequately balances the needs of the State and the circumstances of the individual and current practice takes account of personal circumstances. Amendment No. 75 is a technical Government amendment. I have already spoken on amendment No. 76 in the context of the interaction with the Children's Rights Alliance. Amendment No. 90 is a Government amendment which clarifies that an application for international protection may be withdrawn by the applicant at any time prior to the preparation of the report under section 38.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 22:In page 18, line 37, to delete “legal advice available to it” and substitute “legal advice, available to it”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 24:In page 19, to delete lines 4 and 5 and substitute the following:"(5) An application for international protection shall be made in the prescribed form and shall include—(a) all details of the grounds for the application, and(b) all information that would, in the event that section 48, 49, 55 or 56 were to apply to the applicant, be relevant to the decision of the Minister under the section concerned.".
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I agree with what the amendments are trying to achieve. A total of €6 million was allocated in the budget to fast-track many applications. That is why between 60 and 80 leave to remain cases are being processed each month since publication of the working group's report. The report is being implemented. I agree with the right to work. I accept what the Deputies are saying about the nine-month stipulation not being necessary if everybody has his or her application processed after six months, but the fundamental point about having a right to work should be acceded to by the Government. This is being done through the Cabinet social policy sub-committee. That is the mechanism through which I want to see it happen. It is not happening in the Bill, but I am not letting the issue go because, as Deputy Niall Collins said, I do not think we should be outside the European norm in this regard. The right to work is fundamental and we must vindicate it. As I said, it is not happening in the Bill, but I believe it will happen through the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy.
