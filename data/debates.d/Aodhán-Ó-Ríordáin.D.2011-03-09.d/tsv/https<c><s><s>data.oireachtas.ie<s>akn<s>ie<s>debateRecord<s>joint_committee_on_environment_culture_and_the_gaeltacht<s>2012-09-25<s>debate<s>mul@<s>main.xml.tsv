AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I would like to add my view on what I believe is outrageous behaviour of the part of the insurance companies dealing with the residents in my constituency, whom I have been trying to support.  I find Mr. Kemp's comments in regard to the Tolka works puzzling.  In the most recent floods in 2008, 2009 and on 24 October last, the Tolka region was almost unaffected.  There must be a communication breakdown somewhere.  I would like to put on record the trauma being experienced by these people in terms of their dealings with the insurance companies.  As pointed out by the Chairman, Deputies Murphy and Humphreys and others, these people are living in homes that are effectively worthless because, as everyone knows, without house insurance one cannot sell a house.  While some families are obtaining a level of flood cover, new purchasers of houses in the area will not get cover.  Leaving aside the trauma of living in an area of perceived threat of flooding, which threat has in many cases subsided because of remedial works, having this situation hanging over their heads is a life sentence.  Despite that works are planned, have been signed off on or completed, the attitude of the insurance companies has not budged, which is outrageous.  I agree with the Chairman that the response in terms of the role of the federation in moving the insurance industry towards a situation whereby it can take individual cases outside the geocoding is disappointing.  A shift in culture and attitude is required.  It is difficult for any of us to offer support to residents in this situation when the attitude of the federation representatives is simply to throw their hands in the air and say they wished things were different but there is nothing much they can do.  We are all aware of the savage nature of market forces and what has happened to our economy.  The families concerned have been left once again to the mercy of the savage nature of market forces and are suffering as a consequence.
