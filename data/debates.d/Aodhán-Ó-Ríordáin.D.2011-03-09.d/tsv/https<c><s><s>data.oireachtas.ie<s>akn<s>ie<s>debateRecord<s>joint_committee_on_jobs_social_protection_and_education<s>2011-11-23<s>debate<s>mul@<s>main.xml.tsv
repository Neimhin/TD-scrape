AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for his presentation.  It states:Under the Treaties governing the European Union, Member States have full responsibility for the content of teaching and the organisation of education systems and their cultural and linguistic diversity.Does a conflict arise between our education system and EU equality legislation or frameworks?  I refer specifically to section 37 of the Equality Act which provides for the promotion of a religious ethos in schools and which impacts on admissions policies and the rights of gay teachers.I refer to the Council resolution on the renewed European agenda for adult learning.  Our provision of second-chance education lacks a formalised adult literacy policy.  It is one thing to have a curriculum but it is another matter to have an adult literacy policy embedded in the system for second-chance students with a low level of literacy.  The body previously known as FÁS did not have such a policy.  I hope SOLAS will have policies to deal with early school leavers or second-chance education participants.I am interested in the modernisation of higher education and the U-Multirank development.  What are the criteria for these rankings?  I refer to the Minister of State's comments on European languages.  Will he agree that the level of knowledge of modern European languages is deficient?  Is there scope in the proposals for a new junior certificate curriculum for more emphasis on oral language acquisition?  One oral examination at the end of a period of learning a language, be it Irish or a European language, often in the leaving certificate year, is not sufficient.  I suggest an oral examination at junior certificate level as a means of promoting the proficiency in a modern European language.
