AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In a similar vein to Senator Ruane, I thank the Minister of State, her officials and Mr. King for their engagement. This has been a positive process and on that basis I support what the Minister of State said. I hope we have contributed in our own way to make this a stronger Bill.
