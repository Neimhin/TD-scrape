AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome Mr. Cooney and join other Senators in expressing sympathy following his bereavement in the summer. The Cathaoirleach asked us not to stray into discussing the presidential election in the United States. While that is fair enough, at every opportunity before election day we must call out the racist buffoonery that appears to be becoming popular across the United States. The problem is not confined to America. As previous speakers noted, there are very unwelcome, xenophobic and racist comments being made by people from across the political spectrum in Europe. In the United Kingdom such commentary is becoming mainstream. Immigration is extremely important and Mr. Cooney's wise words on the issue were very welcome.  The most rank hypocrisy in Irish public life can be observed when Irish politicians ask US Administrations and politicians to change their views on the status of Irish immigrants in America. How on earth can we, with a straight face, present ourselves in the White House with a bowl of shamrock every March while refusing point blank to do at home what we ask the United States to do? Between 20,000 and 26,000 undocumented individuals, including many children, live in Ireland. Last March the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child asked the Government to take steps to regularise these undocumented workers. Nothing has been done since. While we will have nodding heads around the Chamber and gushing declarations of love for our brothers, sisters and children in America, as is entirely appropriate, how on earth can we tell the US political system it must get its immigration system in order to benefit our children when we refuse to do the same here? I ask representatives of all parties to leave hypocrisy at the door. They should ask the leadership of their respective parties what they are doing to regularise the position of undocumented workers in this republic. The language used in that regard is interesting. When speaking about the American political system, we always use the term the "undocumented Irish" but the terminology somehow changes to "illegal immigrants" when we are describing undocumented workers in Ireland. The best symbol of goodwill we could possibly show in terms of what we want the US system to do is to do what we ask the United States to do right here at home. Any US Senator, Congressman or President could easily ask, in response to all the lobbying being done in the United States, what we are doing at home and whether we are regularising undocumented workers or doing what the UN Committee for the Rights of the Child asked Ireland to do, because the answer is "No". I suggest, therefore, that after this debate is done, we all ensure our respective political parties get the finger out and do what the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child asked us to do before we engage again in rank hypocrisy in March 2017 when a bowl of shamrock will be handed over to the US President. This grates on my sense of social justice, Ireland's place in the world and its responsibility to mankind.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister. While many of us in the House may be very critical of Government policy in many areas, it should be commended for how proactive it has been in dealing with this issue prior to and since the referendum. The Minister's presentation is very welcome. I find the entire issue profoundly depressing because of what it says about modern politics, not only in Europe but also throughout the world. It is depressing how a minority view in one party can become the mainstream to drive the political agenda and split a country. The emotions and xenophobia generated since and because of the referendum are startling. I am interested in hearing the views of the Minister on the future of the European Union because it has been a force for good. I am stunned to hear voices in the House, of members of parties which have resisted every referendum for decades on integrating more with the wider family of the European Union, now criticise the Government for what it is or is not doing on Brexit. Since it was founded in post-Second World War Europe, the European Union has allowed peaceful diplomacy to be the order of the day on the Continent. We can only deal with the great international issues of climate justice and the refugee crisis as a collective in the European Union. When one major member state decides to leave, what does it mean for the greater project? We must have a conversation in Ireland about the relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom. The critical issue is the border with Northern Ireland. Communities in the Border region recently made a presentation to the Oireachtas committee on regional affairs. They are, rightly, very concerned about the impact Brexit will have in the coming years. What does Brexit mean for the future of the European Union, diplomacy and discussions and the state of international politics? We know what is happening in France, Austria, Hungary and Germany. The political mindset which led to great men and women of the 1940s and 1950s deciding that they had to put the disasters of the past behind them and build a new future seems to be under threat more than ever. It is particularly worrying considering what is happening in the United States. I commend the work done by the Government prior to and after the referendum. I found it astonishing at the time of the referendum that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland had particularly taken a position in favour of exiting the European Union. I was astonished that somebody in her role, which is so critical to peace and prosperity on the island, representing the British Government in the Six Counties, would take such a position. I believe strongly that Ms Villiers was absolutely wrong to take a position on the issue. She was definitely wrong to advocate for what was clearly not in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland. I wish the Minister well in his endeavours. As a pro-European party, the Labour Party will assist him in any way it can. I worry about the future of the European project and other member states and political parties looking at what has happened and seeing Brexit as a political opportunity. I worry about our ability as a collective to deal with the great issues of the day which can only be dealt with by the wider international community.
