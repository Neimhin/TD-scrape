AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is fair to say that school communities around Ireland are this morning grappling with another chaotic management of messaging and leadership from the Department of Education. The Minister, Deputy Foley, and I are in absolute agreement that it is incredibly important that schools remain open. It is profoundly damaging for children when schools are closed. We know that when they were closed it was very difficult for students, particularly those in disadvantaged areas and those with additional needs, to get the type of educational services they needed. For the past 18 months, the Department and the Government have been saying, "Schools are safe", "Schools are safe", "Schools are safe". Last month, I stood here and asked the Minister and the Government to stop saying that, but they continue to repeat that schools are safe. Last week, we heard a new line from NPHET, that is, that it never said that schools are safe. Having taken five days to consider what NPHET has suggested in terms of mask-wearing for nine-year-olds, from third class upwards in primary schools, we get an overnight diktat from the Department of Education, delivered with all of the subtlety and compassion of a gas bill. This morning, principals have to police mask-wearing by nine-year-olds, from third class upwards, without any sense of what the legal implications are if a parent was to refuse, no sense of a lead-in period and an absolute absence of commentary, guidance or leadership from the Minister.  All we needed last night was a video message or other communication from the political leader of education in Ireland acknowledging that this change is difficult, telling parents that they are part of the solution and asking them to talk to their children about wearing masks - children have seen adults wearing masks - and telling them that the reason for that is we are trying to make sure that people do not get sick, that they can help us in that regard, that they should not feel anxious or worried, that we will get through this together and that they are part of the solution. Instead, we got a classic, soulless communication, a follow-up to a communication from the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, Dr. Tony Holohan, and NPHET to each individual school stating that this change was required to come into effect today. After everything schools have been through, the Minister being asked last April to do something around antigen testing, but doing nothing about it until this week, all of the failures of communication heretofore and the Minister and Government parroting the line, "Schools are safe", "Schools are safe", "Schools are safe", they have given principals and school communities 16 hours to get their act together to enforce a diktat, a requirement from the Department of Education on face mask wearing among, potentially, very anxious children, with zero compassion and zero leadership from that Department.  The Government has been described as a bad debs committee. That is the best description I can come up with this morning. I would like the Minister to respond to that and to speak not just to me, but to take this opportunity to speak to the children of Ireland who may see this contribution later today. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister cannot stand here and tell us it is a public health measure and that is just the way it goes. She has said a practical approach is expected over the next day or two. What kind of leadership is that? What kind of certainty is that? What legal basis is there for this? What happens if somebody comes to the school gate and refuses for their child to wear a mask? What does the principal do then? Does the Minister know what principals should do in such circumstances, and has she informed them of this in the 16 hours given for them to prepare for this measure?  We all know we are trying to protect people from getting sick, hospitalised and ending up in ICU. We know what the point is. Government Members were the ones telling us for the last 18 months that schools were safe while school communities, principals and managers were screaming out for support. I think the Department is depending on the goodwill of principals, who are hardwired to ensure they defend the reputation of their schools at all costs in the school community, to ensure there are not high anxiety levels among their student body or parent body and to keep the show on the road, rather than telling the truth of what is happening. The Department expects a practical approach over the next day or two. There is no understanding of legal implications, no reference to the potential for HEPA filters to be put in schools and no understanding of the heating bills that schools are facing. There was no leadership from the Minister last night. Please do not throw it back at us and say we are somehow not adhering to public health advice when the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, was sketchy on that last night. Will the Minister, Deputy Foley, take the opportunity to show some leadership and give some guidance to schools, school communities and principals who are doing their best to deal with anxious children, who the Minister has let down in this regard? What they needed last night was a voice of compassion, care and leadership from the political face of education in Ireland.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	You did not say that last week.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	And leadership.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Do not give us that line. We have all worked in schools.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The word "requirement" was used. That is not flexibility.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	For the love of God. If I hear that accusation one more time-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am beginning to think that the new phrase in political circles, which is not opposing the Bill, feels a bit like you can go and talk to the cat because it has pretty much the same effect. The frustration we have on the Opposition benches is we have spent the past 18 months trying to bring forward practical solutions to benefit workers and people in society and to fill the gaps and fault lines that Covid has exposed. I am talking of basic protections for workers and young workers who have been asked to work from home and the protections they need. Sick pay is a basic provision in almost every other European country, yet we still struggle to grapple with such pay. I believe the Government's recommendation is that 7% of a person's wages would be covered by sick pay, which for a minimum wage worker would not even cover on a daily basis the price of going to a GP to get a certificate. Now we have this recommendation in terms of legislation from the Opposition. Again, it is a basic provision in the fight against Covid. Schools have been mentioned and we had a debate with the Minister for Education this morning as to why people like Professor Orla Hegarty are not being listened to when she says it would cost €12 million to install a HEPA filter in every primary school class in the country. Yet, when it comes to Government, it seems as if, when it gets advice or a recommendation from the Opposition, it has to deal with it with a mindset of scorn and not being open-minded enough to work on this together. When we asked about antigen testing and when Professor Mark Ferguson said last May that it should be introduced in primary and second level schools, the Government sat on it for six months. Meanwhile the Government has repeatedly told us schools are safe until NPHET told us last week it never said that in the first place. Then the Government gave schools 16 hours to implement a mask-wearing measure for third class and up. Meanwhile, as my colleague has said, children are sitting in classrooms wearing coats, scarves, hats and gloves with the windows open and what Professor Orla Hegarty is saying seems to be irrelevant. When practical and goodwill legislation is brought in to protect workers, we get the not opposed line from Government, which has the same legal basis as saying you can talk to the cat. What we are trying to bring forward here is a practical suggestion from the Opposition as to what is actually happening on the ground because we want to be part of the solution.We want to drive leadership in our own communities. We want to assure everybody that there is hope, that we can get through this and that things are not disimproving out of control. That is the level of anxiety every public representative must deal with day to day. What the Government sometimes throws back at us is that we are not putting on the green jersey or we are not part of the same team. That is deeply insulting to those of us who are dealing on a day-to-day basis with people who are losing hope, who are cracking up and who are now facing into what they think is going to be a very difficult December, Christmastime and January. This is particularly so as yesterday the Taoiseach was again very unwise in his words on school opening in January. Meanwhile, basic supports such as the EWSS and the PUP are being cut. I ask the Minister of State to take advice from the Opposition in good faith, to stop using this line about not opposing and to embrace what we are trying to achieve here to protect workers in their workplaces.
