AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank the Senator for raising this matter. As he is aware, the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, was established on a statutory basis in 2012, in accordance with the provisions of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011. The authority is independent in the performance of its functions. A key role of the authority is to set and enforce standards in the provision of property services by property service providers who fall into four categories - auctioneers of all types, estate agents, letting agents and property management agents. The 2011 Act provides for the licensing of all companies and individuals engaged in the provision of property services. There are in excess of 4,000 companies and individuals licensed to provide property services. A publicly visible register of these licensees is maintained on the PSRA website at www.psra.ie. Under section 28 of the Act, it is an offence to provide a property service, or purport to be available to provide a property service, unless the person is appropriately licensed. A company or person who contravenes this section of the Act is liable to a fine or imprisonment, or both. It is the authority's policy to prosecute all of those found to be trading without a licence. A number of prosecutions have already been before the courts in the Dublin area. The Minister for Justice and Equality has been informed that two cases have so far resulted in convictions and more cases are pending. She has been advised by the authority that 242 instances of companies or individuals suspected to be trading without a licence have been brought to its attention since 2012. Some 23% of these cases involved companies of individuals who were, in fact, already licensed. A letter campaign instructing companies to cease trading without licences resulted in a further 6% applying for and being granted licences. Another 31% have ceased trading or were never trading in the first place and no current evidence can be found of trading. The authority is investigating the remainder of the cases.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I am very pleased to be here on the resumption of Committee Stage of this important Bill. To respond to Senator Averil Power, it is my intention and my hope that I will be the final Minister to deal with it. Senators will be well aware of my strong opinions on the need to amend the current section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act 1998 and that, together with Senators Ivana Bacik and Mary Moran, as well as Deputies John Lyons, Dominic Hannigan and Ciara Conway, I first introduced this Bill to the Houses in 2013. I also acknowledge the work done by Senator Averil Power on her previous Bill on the issue and a similar Bill two weeks ago from Deputies Catherine Murphy, Ruth Coppinger and Joe Higgins. The existing section 37(1) of Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended by section 25 of the Equality Act 2004, provides that where a religious, educational or medical institution which is under the direction or control of a body established for religious purposes or whose objectives include the provision of services in an environment which promotes certain religious values shall not be taken to discriminate against a person if it gives more favourable treatment, on the religion ground, to an employee or prospective employee where it is reasonable to do so in order to maintain the religious ethos of the institution, or it takes action that is reasonably necessary to prevent an employee or prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution. The provision was previously contained in the Employment Equality Bill 1996, which was referred by the President to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution. While the court held that Bill to be unconstitutional on other grounds, the constitutionality of what is now section 37 was upheld as a reasonable balance between the competing constitutional rights involved. While we can seek to find a new balance that better meets the needs of employees, the logic of the Supreme Court decision is that a balance does need to be struck; it is not simply a matter of deleting certain elements of the existing Act. For this reason, the Government, in the programme for Government, committed to amending section 37(1) to ensure its operation leads to a fairer and more equitable balance between the rights of freedom of religion or association, on the one hand, and, on the other, the right of persons in employment, or prospective employees, to be free from discrimination and to privacy in their personal lives. A key feature of the Bill is the distinction it makes between religious institutions that are entirely privately funded and those which are funded by the taxpayer. The rationale is that in the case of the second category, the Government has the right - and arguably the duty - to protect employees who are paid from the public purse from unfair treatment or discrimination. On examination by the Attorney General's office, the Bill was found to be essentially constitutionally sound, although some amendments are required to the text as published to enhance its constitutional robustness. Aside from some technical changes, the most significant change that needs to be made - the precise details of which I will bring before the House on Report Stage - is to replace a proposed power for the Minister for Justice and Equality, in consultation with the Minister for Health or the Minister for Education and Skills, to issue directions or guidelines to relevant employers for the purpose of giving effect to the proposed amended provision. It was felt that this approach would be unsafe, as the courts could find it to be an unlawful delegation of authority by the Oireachtas. Instead, the Government amendments will oblige relevant employers in religious-run schools and hospitals to show that favourable treatment of an employee or prospective employee is limited to the religion ground and that action taken against a person is objectively justified by reference to that institution's aim of protecting its religious ethos and that the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.  The proposed new subsection will provide that action taken against an employee or prospective employee on the religion ground shall not be regarded as justified unless it is rationally and strictly related to the institution's religious ethos; a response to conduct by a person which undermines or would undermine the religious ethos of the institution, rather than a response to that person's status under any of the other discrimination grounds, such as sexual orientation, that are set out in equality legislation; and proportionate to the conduct of the employee or prospective employee, having regard to alternative action the employer could take, the consequences of any action taken for the employee or prospective employee and the actual damage caused to the religious ethos of the institution.The aim is to raise the bar in order that religious run schools and hospitals will have to show real damage to their ethos, are precluded from discrimination on any of the other equality grounds and that any action taken is reasonable and proportionate. I wish to signal my intention to the House to use the opportunity afforded by the Bill to advance on Report Stage a number of other, mainly technical, amendments to existing equality legislation. On rent supplement and housing assistance payment, the most significant amendment is to prohibit discrimination in the letting of residential accommodation on the basis that a person is or is not in receipt of rent supplement or housing assistance payment. It will eliminate the inclusion, by some landlords, of references to rent supplements not being accepted in advertisements for residential rented property. This will involve an amendment to sections 2 and 6 of the Equal Status Act 2000.  I also intend to amend the definitions of indirect discrimination in the Equality Acts to follow precisely the definitions in the relevant EU directives and their evolving interpretation by the European Court of Justice. Therefore, amendments will be advanced to the definitions of indirect discrimination in the Employment Equality Act 1998, Equal Status Act 2000 and the Pensions Act 1990 to bring the letter of the legislation into line with those directives. While the Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibits discriminatory advertisements, there is no provision to allow an aggrieved party in relation to an employment opportunity to take a case to the Equality Tribunal other than a referral by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, formerly the Equality Authority. I intend to remedy this deficiency by allowing the person, himself or herself to take a complaint, as distinct from allowing cases to be taken solely by the IHREC. This will involve amendments to sections 2, 8(5), 12 and 13 of the Employment Equality Act 1998. While the Framework Employment Directive 2000/78/EC, which outlaws age discrimination in employment, was transposed into law by the Equality Act 2004 based on the wording in the directive, the case law of the European Court of Justice has since established that national provisions laying down retirement ages could amount to age discrimination if they cannot be justified under the specific provisions of the directive. The court has also held that the provision of fixed-term contracts on the basis of age constitutes age discrimination and would require justification under Article 6 of the directive. I, therefore, intend to bring forward amendments to bring our domestic legislation more into line with these judgments. The amendments required are to sections 6 and 34 of the Employment Equality Act 1998. The State is obliged under the European Economic Area agreement and the EU-Swiss agreements to ensure that benefits in admission to any course of vocational training offered by an educational or training body are extended to EU nationals and are also extended to EEA and Swiss nationals, in the absence of an explicit provision to the contrary in these agreements. In practice, the same benefits in terms of such fees and admission are afforded to EEA and Swiss nationals, but the equality legislation does not refer to Swiss and EEA nationals and needs to be amended to explicitly reference them. I will bring forward the necessary amendments on Report Stage. Amendments required here are to section 12 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 and to section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000. As these amendments will extend the scope of the Bill, it will be necessary to amend on Report Stage the Bill's Long and Short Titles along with the collective citations. I look forward to engaging further with Senators on Report Stage and ensuring an effective Bill is passed by both Houses and enacted as quickly as possible.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is my intention and the individual discussions can then take place on Report Stage.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	He reminds me of a good friend of mine, a committed Dublin supporter, who once had to do teaching practice in County Meath and had to convince all the children of the merits of supporting the Meath football team, which really went against his ethics. Not to belittle the point that has been made, the difficulty we have here is a procedural one because it has been two years since we had this conversation in this House. There are various reasons for that, but we are here now.  We cannot accept the amendment on Committee stage. It makes much more sense to do so on Report Stage when the Government amendments are published. The proper context can then be given and a proper discussion can then be had as to reasons various amendments can, should or may not be accepted. I appreciate the Senator's position. We are on amendment No. 4, but we are having a broader debate now on the substance of the entirety of the Bill. I think it would be more appropriate do this on Report Stage, but I appreciate what everybody here is saying. We have gone off into whole new area with what Senator David Norris said, which will probably capture most of the headlines, but we need to focus back on the procedural element, which is what we are doing on Committee Stage. Report Stage will be taken next week. I accept there is a problem with the procedural elements in the House of having such a long delay between the last discussion two years ago and the discussion we are having now.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Procedurally, again, my response is the same as to all these amendments. Report Stage would be a better context in which to debate them.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We are trying to achieve this together. In the Dáil three weeks ago, a Bill was tabled by three Deputies from the Anti-Austerity Alliance and the Government did not oppose the Bill because it accepted its spirit, despite the fact that a Bill was already working its way through the process. I hope Senators will accept my bona fides. We are trying to ensure we have full context to what we are doing and we understand that Senators need Government amendments to work on in order that we can have a proper debate on Report Stage. That will be done.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Again, in the absence of Government amendments, the same point is being made and I will repeat my remarks. The Government amendments will oblige relevant employers in religious-run schools and hospitals to show that favourable treatment of an employee, or prospective employee, is limited to the religion ground. The religion ground shall not be regarded as justified unless it is the following circumstances - rationally and strictly related to the institution's religious ethos; a response to the conduct of a person, which was the point made by Senator Averil Power, which undermines or would undermine the religious ethos of the institution, rather than being a response to that person's status under any of the other discrimination grounds such as sexual orientation, marital status or being an unmarried parent or divorcee, as set out in equality legislation; and is proportionate, which is a key word, to the conduct of the employee, or prospective employee, having regard to alternative action the employer could take, etc. In terms of the amendment, the Government will also table amendments to the Bill. Today, we are discussing the text of my remarks. Rather than get into the substance of the debate I understand where the Senator is coming from. It would be better for the debate, in its totality, to take place on Report Stage when we have the context of the Government amendments, rather than working from the initial Bill and my own remarks.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate what has been said. However, most European countries have a section 37(1) or their own version of section 37(1). The difficulty in Ireland is that the vast majority of schools, particularly national schools, are under religious patronage whereas in other European countries that is not the case. In every other European country that I am aware of, a version of section 37(1) is on their statute books. In those countries the State's education system runs in a particular way but parallel to that are religious ethos schools and teachers make their own determinations. The difficulty in this country is that we do not, effectively, have a State-run education system. We have a State-funded education system which is then outsourced to patron bodies and that is how we run the system here. We have a section 37(1) on our Statute Book which has a huge impact on virtually every primary schoolteacher unless he or she is fortunate enough or has the facility to teach in a school that does not impinge on his or her ethos. The difficulty is the population of schools, or the number of schools, which are run under a religious ethos and trying to balance the constitutional right of parents to have education delivered through a particular religious ethos with the right of the worker. In other countries the balance is easier struck but here it is not as easy to do, unfortunately. That is the balance that we are trying to strike.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I would-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The essence of the amendments is to provide a clear definition of what "conduct" means. My nervousness is that because it took so long to get it to this stage, if we start giving specific examples of the meaning of "conduct", it could take a lot longer before the Bill is enacted. I take on board what the Senator said that perhaps we need to do some work on language and perhaps we can do something when the Bill goes to the other House. In the absence of any case law, it is very difficult to know what would or would not happen in that eventuality. Speaking personally, the only issue that was raised about my prospective employment was membership of a particular political party and I had to deal with that.  I have sympathy for the Senator's position. However, other legislation protects the freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. We hope to get a clearer definition of the meaning of "conduct". Assuming a particular course of action would not lead to any kind of ramifications in a person's employment is not good enough and tighter language or explanation is required. We can work on that issue, but I am slightly nervous that if there are too many scenarios, this Bill would end up back in the Attorney General's office and we might not see it again in the lifetime of the Government. While I appreciate what the Senator is trying to do and we can work on that issue, there is the question of how successful it would be.  If a private citizen goes on a march in support of something he or she feels strongly about, and this is technically not in line with a particular religious view of the world, it is a question whether this will impact on his or her employment prospects. For example, if a promotion opportunity arises in a school or a hospital, will the person be overlooked because he or she is demonstrably in favour of a political viewpoint? Let us work on it. I am conscious that we have spent a long time on this Bill and I am anxious to get it through. We have made substantial amendments to the original text. That will have been obvious in the discussions yesterday and the amendments have been roundly welcomed. We can have a more comprehensive debate on Report Stage. We are trying to nail down the definition of the word "conduct" and this will be the key element. It is all about raising the bar to make it so high that it would really have to be a very unusual or a deliberate event to contradict the ethos of the institution concerned. Bill reported without amendment.
