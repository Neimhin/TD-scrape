AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Ms O'Brien has said the majority of studies indicate the effective corporate tax rate here is generally very close to 12.5%, as there are few deductions and reliefs within our corporate tax regime.  Why is there such a focus on Ireland's corporate tax rate internationally if the majority of studies show this?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps Professor Stewart might also contribute on this point.  The sense we get is that there is international pressure to give the impression that Ireland is a tax haven, yet when we asked that question of Pascal Saint-Amans when he made a presentation to us, he said Ireland was most definitely not a tax haven.However, he could not actually point to any jurisdiction that technically was a tax haven, which did not help us in dispelling that myth. It appears that a geopolitical game is being played, with countries trying to tarnish the reputation of others to give the impression that there is something underhand or shadowy going on in order to gain an advantage for themselves in attracting jobs and inward investment. Would Ms O'Brien or Professor Stewart buy into that theory or they be in a position to even comment on it?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I ask Professor Stewart to expand on that point a little more for the benefit of the committee.  The term "tax haven" is a very dangerous one because it can mean different things to different people.  When Professor Stewart says the Netherlands is a bigger tax haven than Ireland, that implies Ireland is a tax haven, if only to a degree.  I ask him to clarify what he means by that comment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It implies something illegal, shadowy, wrong or quasi-criminal.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The sub-committee is discussing this issue because a number of multinational companies located here have been the subject of international attention.  Politically, we are trying to strike a balance between a corporation doing right by the country and paying its dues and, at the same time, providing employment here.  Is the focus on Ireland unreasonable in a global context?
