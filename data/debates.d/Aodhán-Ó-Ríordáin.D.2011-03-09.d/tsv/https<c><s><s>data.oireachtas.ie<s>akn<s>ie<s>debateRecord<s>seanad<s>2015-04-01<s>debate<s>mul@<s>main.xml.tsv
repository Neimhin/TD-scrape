AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I have a formal statement on the implementation of the national integration strategy which I propose to read before commenting on the PolskaÉire 2015 festival. Before I begin, I take the opportunity to thank Shane Long for scoring the equaliser in the last minute of Sunday evening's game. The Government parties are criticised for many things and I suppose the Labour Party could have been criticised for increasing the motivation of the Polish soccer team to do well on home soil, as it were, on Sunday last. I was delighted, in the context of the stability of the Government, that Shane Long managed to score his last minute goal. I welcome the motion and thank the House for giving me the opportunity to provide an update on where we stand in the development of the revised national integration strategy. A Private Members' motion on racism agreed by the Seanad in June 2014 called on the Minister to report back to the House on these matters. This is an opportune time to provide some further information on developments in this area. As Senators will be aware, the programme for Government contains a commitment to the promotion of polices which integrate minority ethnic groups in Ireland, including those policies which promote social inclusion, equality, diversity and the participation of immigrants in the economic, social, political and cultural life of their communities. The Government recognises the importance and value of the many new communities that are now an integral part of Irish society. The importance of these groups was recognised and underscored in a tangible manner through the assignment, in July last year, of specific responsibilities for new communities to a Minister of State. The assignment of responsibilities in this manner helps ensure that issues of importance to new communities are highlighted appropriately. I am sure Senators will be aware that we are in the process of reviewing Ireland's strategy on integration. This follows a decision which was taken by the Cabinet committee on social policy early last year. The work on this review is being carried forward by a cross-departmental committee of senior officials and it is chaired by a senior official in my Department. The mandate of the cross-departmental group includes the following specific tasks - to review the activities being undertaken by Departments and agencies directed to promoting the integration of non-Irish nationals; the preparation of a draft overarching integration strategy taking account of the policies and actions already being implemented; and undertaking consultation with key stakeholders. An important part of the work of the group was to engage in a meaningful way with members of the public. In order to do this, a two-fold approach was undertaken by the committee. The first step was to place a call in media outlets inviting submissions from interested parties who wished to contribute to the work of the group. The closing date for contributions was May 2014 and I am delighted to say more than 80 submissions were received from a wide range of organisations and groups providing services to migrants. The second phase of the consultation process was a series of face-to-face meetings with some of those who contributed material for consideration by the group. Five consultation sessions were held, with each session lasting one day and involving a series of sub-meetings with members of the public. A total of 27 separate groups, one individual and a group of seven individuals met with the cross-departmental group during these sessions. This segment of the consultative process facilitated the highlighting of, and in-depth discussions on, issues of particular concern. They also permitted those contributors present the opportunity of imparting their personal experiences to the committee. I understand those who participated in these meetings, both from the official side and the non-government side, found these face-to-face interactions to be valuable. Separate to the above process, the cross-departmental group also held a series of thematic meetings which addressed particular issues. The topics discussed during these meetings included promoting inter-cultural awareness and combating racism and xenophobia; education; social inclusion and access to public services; employment and pathways to work; and active citizenship. In addition, suggestions which were made in the context of written contributions have been collated and circulated to the relevant Departments and associated agencies for consideration. Work on the development of the updated integration strategy is ongoing and I expect that a draft strategy will be sent to key stakeholders for their observations before the summer, with a view to the strategy being published as soon as possible thereafter. I hope that the resulting recommendations on migrant integration will form the basis of a new and more comprehensive overarching strategy, which is capable of meeting present needs and expected future conditions of society. According to Census 2011, we have a situation where non-Irish nationals account for more than 500,000 or 12% of the population and where there has been a rapid growth in the non-Irish population in the past decade or so. We now have people from more than 199 countries living in the State. This can pose challenges but it can also provide opportunities. There have, unfortunately, been circumstances where individuals have experienced racism and xenophobia. I want to be clear in expressing my views on such behaviour - it is not acceptable and we will do everything possible to combat it. I am aware there have been calls for the legislation on racism to be reviewed and this issue is a topic which is being looked at by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in terms of its ongoing work on integration, multiculturalism and combating racism. I fully expect that the legislation to combat racism will be considered in the context of the outcome of the review of the Oireachtas committee and following publication of the Government's integration strategy. In the meantime, I urge those who are affected by manifestations of racism to report the matter to the appropriate authorities. I am aware of the excellent work that NGOs in this sector have been doing in providing support and assistance for those who have been victims of racism, for which I commend them. Of equal importance is their advocacy role in opposition to racism and in seeking to keep the focus of Government and of society generally on this problem. I am pleased that the motion commends the holding of the PolskaÉire Festival 2015. This is an initiative I have had in mind for some time because I saw it as important to recognise the Polish influence in present day Ireland. It is estimated that there are 150,000 Polish citizens living in the State, resulting in Polish becoming the second most widely spoken language here. It also seemed to me to be a worthwhile exercise in furthering integration of Poles in Irish society and promoting contact between Irish, Polish and other nationalities, through a range of cultural, artistic, social, sports and other events and catering for different age groups. I thought it would be a good idea if the festival was organised on the occasion of the Republic of Ireland v. Poland international, and that proved to be the case. I arranged for funding for elements of the festival from the two Departments in which I am Minister of State. However, I thank the Polish Embassy, the FAI, Dublin City Council and other local authorities, the Irish-Polish Society, Polish associations such as Forum Polonia, sports clubs, SIPTU and cultural groups across the country - in short, anyone and everyone who organised events or participated in what was a successful festival. Despite what other members of my party might say, RTE was particularly supportive of the events last week.  With regard to the amendment tabled by Senators David Cullinane, Trevor Ó Clochartaigh and Kathryn Reilly, as Senators will be aware, I have a personal commitment to reforming the direct provision system. Alongside my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, I established a working group on the protection process. The work of this group is ongoing and it will report back in the coming weeks with a suggested path of reforms. However, I cannot accept the amendment. Indeed, some of the matters referred to fall outside my remit in the Department. I appreciate that these are important issues and if the Senators want to outline their concerns in writing to me, I will ensure that they are brought to the attention of the Minister. On a personal note, I thank those who were involved in the festival, which has become the first PolskaÉire Festival. It was intended to be a once-off occasion because it would centre around the soccer international but that changed over the course of the week of the events, which are still ongoing because there are events around the country and the film festival in Smithfield this week has all of a sudden become the first Polish-Irish festival. There is a new plaque on O'Connell Street to Pawe Edmund Strzelecki, who did a massive amount of famine relief work here in the 1840s and is credited with saving the lives of 200,000 children in Ireland during that period. The plaque, a monument, if one likes, to the PolskaÉire Festival, will last for a long time, and great credit is due to the Irish-Polish Society for organising it. We always have had people come to this country who have contributed to Ireland. One can go back to St. Patrick. One can look at the seven signatories to the Proclamation, two of whom were born outside Ireland and two others of whom were sons of migrants. It is a fantastic opportunity for us. As I have said this on quite a number of occasions, I feel sorry for the Polish representatives in the Gallery who have heard so many similar speeches of mine in the past ten days or so, but, if I might, I will continue along that vein. The country that I grew up in was a particularly boring, stale, mono-cultural one, a country that people wanted to leave. Many of us in this House will have friends and family living abroad who have found a country outside of Ireland that they decided to call home. I was taken by something an Italian Minister said at an EU event recently, that he wanted Italy to be the best place in the world for Italian-born people. That is something we have to do for ourselves in the hope Ireland might be the best place in which Irish people can live. However, from a situation where, in 1996, 0.5% of the population were born outside the State, now 12% were. It is a wonderfully enriching and exciting for us to have that shared experience. The thousands of years of history that have brought the Polish nation to this point is now our history too. While the Polish people go through a period of reflection on the 70 years since the end of the Second World War and we are going through our period of reflection, I am so excited about the new identity of being Polish-Irish. I said this on quite a few occasions that we are so used to the idea of being Irish-American but we have never necessarily come to the realisation that there is a whole new body of people in the country who are comfortable with the idea of being Hungarian-Irish, Czech-Irish, Moldovan-Irish or Polish-Irish. We have started something wonderful with this conversation this week. We talked with young people about where they are with that internal friction between two identities and how they can celebrate it and move on from it. We have spoken about integration through sport, which, as Senator Hayden stated, is a fantastic avenue in which to connect and build bridges. We have used art and music. We have focused, not only on the constraints of a national identity but on what a national identity can do in terms of connecting with another human being.National identity is important, but one's humanity supersedes all of those elements. I thank Senators for allowing us discuss the nature of integration. I agree we have problems and issues to overcome. People have mentioned the issue of direct provision and that is something we discussed at the joint committee earlier today. There are obviously issues to be discussed in regard to the protection system. Not everybody has the same mindset when it comes to the issue of migration and our political system does not give itself enough credit for its achievements. Look for example at what is happening across the water in the British general election and how immigration is front and centre of that debate. Look too at what is happening in France and Germany. The European Union is under a greater strain now, despite being the greatest political movement of the past 100 years and bringing people together with the common goal for a peaceful Europe. Our system, regardless of political party affiliations, has not been strangled by the issue of immigration and we should hold on to, cherish and build on this for the future.
