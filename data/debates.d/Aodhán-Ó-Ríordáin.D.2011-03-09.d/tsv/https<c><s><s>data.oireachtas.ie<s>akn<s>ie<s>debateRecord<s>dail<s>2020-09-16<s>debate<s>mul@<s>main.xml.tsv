AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I congratulate Deputy Joan Collins and the Independent Group for tabling this motion. Quite a number of motions have been put before this House on workers' rights. Unfortunately, and I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, it is a common theme of the debates on these motions that a senior Minister is not in attendance. The Minister of State may consider that to be a political jibe and an unfair political criticism but it is the truth. The last time we discussed a motion of this nature a number of months ago the very same comments were made and it was reported upon. Whether it is the Minister with responsibility for social protection, Deputy Humphreys or the Tánaiste and Minister with responsibility for business, their absence gives the sense to those who are deeply affected by these issues, the workers, that they are absent from the thought processes of the Cabinet, as Deputy Barry rightly pointed out. My frustration is that we seem to be going from one industrial dispute to another, dealing with the individual issues that arise in each individual case and not looking at the entirety of the industrial relations architecture of the State which is clearly deficient. Myself and Deputy Ged Nash proposed legislation to deal with this situation but it was dismissed by the Tánaiste as "virtue signalling".That was a remarkable statement for the Tánaiste to make, when we try to be as constructive as possible and we try not to make personalised political jibes. It is a legislative body and we come here to propose legislation. As noted, Deputy Nash was the one who commissioned the Duffy Cahill report and he is somebody who knows this area intimately. He brought forward legislation, which is the appropriate thing to do, rather than trying to engage in any other type of political activity. However, our reasoned contribution was dismissed as virtue signalling by somebody who has done nothing.  It is also not good enough for the Tánaiste to say the Duffy Cahill report would not deal with the Debenhams situation. We might be willing to argue that over and back if the recommendations of Duffy Cahill had been actually implemented to the letter and then were found to be deficient. However, as has been stated, the Duffy Cahill report has been sitting somewhere in government since March 2016. To give my own party a level of credit, I do not think that would have happened if the Labour Party was still in government and I feel more weight would have been given to the importance of the issue. However, it is stuck on a shelf somewhere, not taken seriously by Government and certainly not taken seriously by the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, who has a history of watering down rhetoric around the rights of workers. He stood on a platform in order to become Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach, saying that essential workers should have restricted access to collective bargaining rights and the right to strike - it is in black and white in his literature. Again, as others have said, it is all very well to applaud these essential workers when they come to the country’s aid at a time of national crisis, but his instinct is that collective bargaining rights and strike rights are secondary to the great national endeavour about which he feels so strongly.  My point to the Minister is that this is about whether people feel the Government and the Legislature have their back or not. Is industrial relations in Ireland about conflict after conflict, or is it about having protections from within this body? I am glad I do not play golf and recent experiences have taught me I should never take up golf. Nonetheless, the industrial relations architecture of this State has been described as being like a golf club where somebody can become a member but they cannot play - they can join the golf club but they cannot play golf. In other words, the employer has a veto. Regardless of the efforts of many people in government and outside government who have put down legislation and tried to lobby in this area, we have probably some of the weakest industrial relations and collective bargaining legislation in Europe because the employer has a veto and there is no requirement on an employer to engage with a representative body which represents workers.  This is an economy in which, before Covid, 23% of workers were statistically on low pay, one of the highest rates of low-paid employment in the OECD, and some 40% of young people under 30 were in insecure work. These things happen only in economies which have weak industrial relations legislation and weak collective bargaining legislation.  What has happened before when a piece of legislation was brought to the Seanad or the Dáil is that the Attorney General has facilitated the Government by saying it is anti-constitutional. What we in the Labour Party would say is that it may be time to challenge that and to strengthen our Constitution by means of a constitutional amendment to enshrine workers’ rights in the Constitution. Therefore, no longer would we have the fallback position from Government that says, “We would love to help you and we really care deeply about this case or that case, but the Attorney General says it is unconstitutional, so what can we do?” If we can take on some of the thorniest, most difficult and divisive issues in Irish society, bring them to the people and have them resolved by means of a referendum, then why can we not do it for workers’ rights? If it means we have to require an employer to engage with the representative body of the workers, let us do it, because then we will not have an economy which is underpinned by low pay. I am quite sure it is an insult to people's sense of morality or decency, no matter what their background, where they live or what their income bracket is, that this economy has been propped up by low-paid work. This affects 23% of workers and, as was said earlier by Deputy Connolly, these are disproportionately women, migrant workers and young people.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, to tell the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, to stop with the jibes, to engage with the responsibility he has, to implement the Duffy Cahill report and to maybe investigate the entire infrastructure through which we are operating. What is he so afraid of and what is the Government so afraid of? We need to even up the imbalance. If it takes a constitutional referendum, I am sure Deputies around this House and the people of Ireland would support such a referendum. It may take 18 months or two years, but I believe if we had that, we would not have this situation with the Debenhams workers, who have been courageously fighting for so long and inspiring so many people across the country with their battle, and we would not have poverty pay, insecure work and the level of unemployment that has been caused by Covid, which is directly connected with the way our economy has been constructed. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We had a debate earlier on workers' rights. I know the Tánaiste will have an interest in what was said and in the nature of the economy we are trying to grapple with, even since before Covid arrived, which is a low-pay economy. The Tánaiste spoke about this in his remarks also. We have spoken before about the disproportionate number of young people and migrant workers who are on low pay and the huge numbers of young people in insecure work. I will give context to the debate and what we are facing. This is not a debate on building an economy after Covid. We are very much in the thick of this. Professor Philip Nolan has stated that having seen the statistics tonight, he is more concerned than he has been at any stage of the pandemic since late April. Without trying to rehash a debate about yesterday, I put it to the Tánaiste that there is a level of confusion about what is happening in Dublin. Perhaps the Tánaiste will confirm to the House the situation with household restrictions. Only two households, regardless of their size, and a limit of six people can meet and socialise together. I understand that this also means bars and restaurants but I am not sure if this has been communicated, or if it is as well known throughout Dublin that restrictions are that no more than six people from two households can socialise. People cannot, therefore, socialise in a bar or in a restaurant beyond two households either. I am not sure if this has been clearly communicated. The Tánaiste might clarify this in his concluding remarks. This would have an economic impact on the city. It would have an impact on those who are booking tables and hoping to sell their wares in bars and restaurants. The point is well made for having a sector-by-sector response. I appreciate the efforts the Government has made. I am aware that it is difficult and that the Government has tried to keep as many people as possible on the standard of living they had been used to. The Tánaiste will appreciate that it can be frustrating for sectors that are not getting the same amount of media attention when they hear certain lobby groups in certain industries getting a huge amount of airtime. Other sectors may not be getting as much attention, which is frustrating. Some industries are clinging on but others may not survive as a total industry. I will refer to two, one of which is the travel agent industry. My office met with representatives of the travel agencies yesterday. The industry supports 3,500 workers. The industry has been though a lot, as one might imagine, such as ash clouds, wars and 9/11. The industry has survived but it cannot just close its doors and then hope to reopen after a period of time. The agencies must try to recoup refunds for people they deal with, and they provide a particular service because there is a callback or a guarantee that is a friendly Irish voice for those who depend on travel agents. The industry has told me that if specific sectoral supports are not put in place now, there will not be an Irish travel agent industry after Covid. It could be run from abroad or from the UK. We need to be mindful of this when formulating responses to Covid and when formulating budgets. How do we decide sector by sector and how do we formulate responses to protect jobs? The Tánaiste will know that it is much easier to protect or maintain a job than to create one. The travel agent representatives have some very practical suggestions as to how this might be done and I wanted to flag this with the Tánaiste. While the travel agents industry represents 3,500 jobs, another group that makes the case for 35,000 jobs is the live events industry. I have to say this is absolutely remarkable. I would not walk out in the middle of a Deputy's contribution in this Chamber. I have stayed to the end when other Deputies were making their contributions and then I have left. The previous contribution I made in this House was on the matter of workers' rights and we did not have a senior Minister for the debate. I did not make that point again when the Tánaiste was here. I thought I had made my point on that and that I would leave it. He sat there, listened to half of my contribution and then he left. I find that incredibly disrespectful to what we are trying to achieve here. Honestly, I walked into the House thinking that the time for party political point scoring was over. I thought let us have some practical solutions here and let us talk about the travel agents I talked to yesterday and about the live events industry that supports 35,000 jobs but in the middle of my contribution the Tánaiste decides to walk out. He could not wait, literally, for five minutes. Is there any point in me continuing my contribution?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	My point is made but I want it to be recorded. The Minister of State, with respect, is here and he made a contribution which was well put together and was appreciated, but the Government cannot go on the airwaves and in the media and suggest that the Opposition is not being constructive, that the Opposition is part of the problem or that the Opposition is trying to sow confusion when in the middle of a contribution by the Opposition the Tánaiste decides to leave. He left halfway through it. We are all in this together. We are all doing our best. We are all trying to show leadership in our communities and to say to the people we represent that we can get through this, that we will get through this, that there will come a day when we can hug our grandparents again, meet our friends again, walk to the shop again, not have to wear a mask again, go to a football match again and that there will come a time when we do not have to be worried about this virus again. That day will come and we will celebrate that day. Hopefully, when that day does come we will have an economy and a country of which we can be proud. So many things have been ripped open and exposed by this virus, including the inequality, the housing problems, the issues of low pay that I mentioned already, with 23% of Irish workers on low pay - I am sick of saying it - and large numbers of young people in insecure work. All of these issues have been ripped open, including the issues in education with overcrowded classrooms but we can work together on these things. We can find solutions together on these issues. We can actually prove to the people of this country that when it comes down to it, Irish politicians are better than what is happening in the UK or the US right now. We are a collective that, when it comes down to it, has the Irish nation at its heart. We should be able to say, on examining the Irish nation, how it is formulated, the economy, society and all of the rest of it, that when we went through a pandemic, we came out the other side of it and we actually decided to repair what was wrong - the disadvantage, the housing, the inequality, the way that our systems and our Parliament are formulated. We can work on a huge amount of that together. I have spoken to the Minister with responsibility for higher education, Deputy Harris, about his belief in doing something about adult literacy. I have spoken to the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, about her belief in doing something on free schoolbooks. We have spoken across this Chamber about things we can achieve together and we actually have achieved an awful lot together on a cross-party basis. That is what the people of this country want. They want to see us working together.  It is perfectly legitimate for the Opposition if it sees something that is wrong or inherently contradictory in a presentation by the Government to point it out. Two minutes ago, before the Tánaiste walked out, I said that there seems to be some confusion about the number of people who can meet together in their own family home compared to in a pub or a restaurant. I raised a legitimate point and sought clarity because we are all are getting phone calls from our constituents who are asking what they can and cannot do in the context of the regulations. Can I leave the county or not? Is the Government serious about not leaving the county or is it only half serious? To go back to my earlier point, midway through my contribution, the Tánaiste decided to get up and leave in some kind of mock protest. I wonder if there is any point in me engaging with the Tánaiste on this level because he seems to find it tedious when people decide to raise such issues with him. I have already referred to the live events industry which employs 35,000 workers. It is at a very serious point. It absolutely accepts why the restrictions were introduced and the rationale behind the Government's decisions. It has suggested that the Government reinstates a support payment of €410, the previous level of the temporary wage subsidy scheme and €350, the previous level of the pandemic unemployment payment which is vital for the skilled workforce in the sector until it fully recovers. The sector is unique in that it is almost entirely closed under Government mandate, with no opportunity to trade. This is the real issue here. This is not about it trying to re-establish a relationship with its consumer base; it is mandated by the Government not to operate. A sector by sector, strategic investigation by the Government as to how we can recover certain elements of the economy would be beneficial to us all. Issues concerning workers' rights, low pay and representation rights for workers were dealt with in the previous debate this evening, so I will leave it there for now.
