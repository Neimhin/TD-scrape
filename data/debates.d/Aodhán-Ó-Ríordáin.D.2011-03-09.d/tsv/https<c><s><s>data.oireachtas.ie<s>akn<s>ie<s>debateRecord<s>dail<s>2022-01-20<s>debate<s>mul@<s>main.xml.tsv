AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the comments that Tánaiste made earlier on the leaving certificate. I understand a meeting is taking place today with the education partners. There have been some very welcome comments from Government sources, including Deputies and Senators, who have been advocating for a hybrid model for the leaving certificate. Does the Tánaiste agree with these comments that have come from his own party? Will he commit that between today and tomorrow we will have finality on this?If the Cabinet is meeting tomorrow, there would be a reasonable expectation from the students who are sitting their leaving certificate that some clarity will be brought before the weekend because this really cannot trundle on much further than that.
