AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	Tugann an Bille seo deis dom eolas a thabhairt don Teach ar an dul chun chinn suntasach atá déanta ag an Rialtas chun Éirí Amach na Cásca a chomóradh an bhliain seo chugainn. Mar atá ráite cheana, tá sé i gceist ag an Rialtas go mbeidh an bhliain 2016 Ián le himeachtaí éagsula agus ilchineálacha. Beidh deis ag pobal na tíre seo castacht iomlán na 100 bliana seo caite ar an oileán seo a chíoradh agus a cheiliúradh. Is léir go bhfuil tacaíocht forleathan ag cur chuige an Rialtais. Sheol an Taoiseach clár na n-údaráis áitiúla inné. Tá beagnach 2,000 imeacht pleanáilte ag pobail aitiúla ar fud na tíre. Tá sé seo mar bhreis ar an gclár suntasach a sheol an Rialtas i mí Márta. Is ceart a thabhairt faoi deara gur tríd imeachtaí shearmanais an Stáit a thabharfaidh saoránaigh na hÉireann aitheantas foirmiúil agus sollúnta d'Éirí Amach na bliana 1916, agus is ar Sheachtain na Cásca a leagtar an bhéim. Athródh an Bille atá os ár gcomhair an bhéim sin go huile agus go hiomlán. Ní fheicim go bhfuil aon tacaíocht taobh thiar den chur chuige sin. The surprising thing about the Bill before us is that it would move the focus of the 1916 commemorations away from the Easter weekend to the end of April. This would seriously dilute the traditional Easter Rising commemorations, and there is no demand for such a move. The Government put in place one of the most comprehensive public consultation processes ever seen in this country, with over 80 very well attended public meetings across the country, in every county. A new public holiday was not sought; nor was there support to move the focus of commemoration from Easter to 24 April. In this regard, I note that the Bill has been sold in the media as an opportunity to introduce an additional public holiday next year, but this is disingenuous. The Bill would, in fact, introduce a new public holiday in perpetuity, but there has been no discussion of the cost of such an additional annual holiday. Next year will be a time for reflection, celebration and commemoration. It is not a year for singular narratives of the events of Easter 1916 but one in which we embrace the multiplicity of traditions on our island and celebrate our independence. The Ireland 2016 centenary programme
is a fully inclusive programme.It contains formal State commemorations and a broad programme of events and initiatives planned in partnership with the national cultural institutions, universities, State bodies and agencies, local authorities, local communities and a number of other interested individuals and groups. That this programme is a cross-government, non-political initiative in which all citizens regardless of political background are encouraged to take part should not be underestimated. This is the key to ensuring broad participation in the events being planned for next year and is a sentiment which featured strongly in the various consultations conducted in recent months. Those who attended the consultation meetings did not want the commemorations to become a party political football.  There has been widespread support for the programme across the political spectrum and significant engagement at both national and local levels throughout the country and abroad. The programme was drafted following extensive consultation with a range of stakeholders and was welcomed by the expert advisory group on commemorations, chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning, and the all-party consultation group on commemorations, of which Deputy Ó Snodaigh is a member. Only yesterday, we launched 31 individual local authority plans to commemorate the centenary of 1916. Local communities have taken the themes of Ireland 2016 and developed exciting and innovative plans for next year covering art, historical reflection, community events, events involving children and young people and a range of other activities, all of which have been designed to be inclusive and reflect the diversity of opinion on the events of 1916. My colleagues, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, recently launched an extensive nationwide programme of activities for primary and post-primary schools, including research projects, competitions and awards as part of the youth and imagination strand of the programme. The Government's "Flag for Schools" initiative has got off to a great start, with more than 700 flags already delivered to primary schools by members of the Defence Forces. We are also working with the third level institutions which have developed extensive and reflective programmes for 2016. For example, only this week, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht launched the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, programme, which offers a range of activities for next year. On Saturday last, I launched the Department's Culture Ireland international programme, I Am Ireland, which is a key element of the Ireland 2016 global and diaspora strand of the Ireland 2016 programme. It is a programme of celebration through contemporary arts which also reflects on Ireland's cultural journey over the past 100 years. The Arts Council and national cultural institutions also have extensive programmes planned for next year. The diaspora will also be involved in events next year and our network of embassies abroad has developed a range of activities to engage with the diaspora and local communities. Full details of the programme were launched in June and it continues to grow. The core of the programme will be the State commemorative events, including ceremonies at the GPO on Easter Sunday and events at Kilmainham Gaol and Arbour Hill. Many events will also take place at local level on an annual basis. Next year, a range of additional commemorative events will be held to mark the centenary of the Rising and the existing Easter bank holiday will provide an appropriate opportunity for a major public celebration to mark the end of the Easter commemorative events. This will build on the very successful Road to the Rising Easter Monday events in Dublin this year. It is clear the forthcoming year will be a year of solemn remembrance, reflection and celebration. It will also be a once in a lifetime opportunity to re-imagine our future, reflect on the ideals of the Proclamation and use this learning as inspiration for this generation. The Government will continue to work with everyone to ensure the Ireland 2016 centenary programme is a success. This Bill seeks to distract from the Easter weekend commemoration. It seeks to provide an additional public holiday in perpetuity for which there is no public demand and to use a singular narrative which could undermine the respectful and inclusive approach to all commemorations on this island which the House supports. Ar na cúiseanna sin go léir ní féidir leis an Rialtas glacadh leis an Bhille seo.

AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	The Government will not oppose the Employment Equality (Abolition of Mandatory Retirement Age) Bill 2014 sponsored by Deputy Anne Ferris. I congratulate her on the work she has done on this issue and I look forward to discussion on the detail of the Deputy’s proposals on Committee Stage. Age discrimination should not be countenanced. I am the Minister of State with responsibility for equality, and equality issues are dear to my heart and central to my reason for being in politics. However, there are serious policy issues in this proposal which need careful consideration. A simple change to equality legislation may not be the vehicle in which to capture all the nuances that need to be taken into account and all the legitimate interests that need to be balanced when we think about work and retirement issues. The Bill is presented as an amendment to equality legislation that would have the effect of abolishing mandatory retirement ages, save in specified security related employment. Those security related exemptions in respect of An Garda Síochána, the Prison Service, fire services and so on are welcome and necessary, and this reflects the position in existing equality legislation. This would be a radical step and the issues that arise in considering such a radical measure as is proposed in the Bill are not fundamentally equality issues but have wider ramifications. The proposal in the Bill would involve setting aside the retirement provisions of most existing employment contracts on a unilateral basis and would have serious implications for public sector employment, pensions policy and labour market policy generally. It would appear from our reading of the Bill that the setting aside of existing employment contract provisions would operate on the basis that the employee still had a choice to retire at the contractual date whereas the employer would not have a choice. This arises due to the interplay between compulsory and voluntary retirement in the precise text of the proposed amendments. That seems to be very problematic from a legal point of view. State intervention in private contracts to abolish on a unilateral basis the retirement arrangements entered into by the two parties would be of doubtful legality and would need careful consideration following comprehensive legal advice. A one-sided abolition raises even more serious doubts as to its fairness and constitutionality. We will need to think carefully about the objective we are trying to achieve and whether we can find other approaches that avoid legal pitfalls. It is important to note that EU equality law provides expressly for compulsory retirement ages. When the EU Framework Employment Directive 2000/78/EC, which outlaws age discrimination in employment, was transposed into law by the Equality Act 2004, reliance was placed on the wording of Recital 14 of the Directive, "(14) This Directive shall be without prejudice to national provisions laying down retirement ages", to conclude that it was not necessary to amend section 34(4) Employment Equality Act 1998, "Without prejudice to subsection (3), it shall not constitute discrimination on the age ground to fix different ages for the retirement (whether voluntarily or compulsorily) of employees or any class or description of employees." However, case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, has since established that national provisions laying down retirement ages could amount to age discrimination if they cannot be justified under the specific terms of the directive. In particular Article 6.1 entitled “Justification of differences of treatment on grounds of age” provides that:Member States may provide that differences of treatment on grounds of age shall not constitute discrimination, if, within the context of national law, they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim including legitimate employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives, and if the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.The CJEU has, in the course of a series of judgments, applied this test to national compulsory retirement schemes. The High Court, the Labour Court and the Equality Tribunal have applied this test in Irish cases. As a result, the text of section 34(4), which I quoted and which seems to give carte blanche to employers to set any age as a retirement age, does not reflect the law as it is actually applied. The opportunity of the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013 is being taken therefore to amend section 34(4) to reflect the law as interpreted by the CJEU. The new text as accepted by the Seanad will read:(4) Without prejudice to subsection (3), it shall not constitute discrimination on the age ground to fix different ages for the retirement (whether voluntarily or compulsorily) of employees or any class or description of employees if-(a) it is objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim, and(b) the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.The Bill has finished all Stages in the Seanad and is awaiting Dáil time. I am advised that this amendment, which focuses on the same section that Deputy Ferris’s Bill addresses, will go as far as it is appropriate to go in regulating retirement ages from an equality perspective. After that, the advice from the Department of Justice and Equality and the other Departments with central policy concerns is that the issue becomes too complex, with a range of interests and policy objectives to be balanced, for equality legislation. The essential point is that our national retirement age regime must be considered in the wider context of national employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives and national pension policy. These extend across the whole of Government. In no particular order of importance, the relevant issues in respect of which there would be implications that need careful consideration by the relevant policy Departments are as follows. In terms of pensions policy and pension schemes, the immediate implications for affordability may be positive as persons expected to retire shortly choose not to do so, but there may be implications for pension contributions calculated actuarially which could have an opposite effect. In employment law, the retirement clause in existing contracts would be made void without reference to the wishes of the contracting parties. The detail of the Private Members’ Bill would allow an employee discretion to retire at the previously envisaged age but leave no choice for an employer. Voiding a contractual agreement in such a one-sided way may itself be legally problematic. In respect of labour market and employment policy, the consideration is whether a reduction in expected numbers leaving employment may reduce opportunities for young people or advancement opportunities for people at an earlier stage of their careers. Youth employment remains a priority challenge. Older workers must be protected against discrimination. Our law and EU law allow for compulsory retirement ages, provided these can be objectively justified. Putting in place a clear national policy framework to help the State, employees and employers to know the appropriate balance in specific circumstances requires us to consider the range of relevant objectives, including competing objectives if one looks at the problem of youth employment, for example. I look forward to the detailed examination of these issues on Committee Stage and to the contributions of other Deputies in the debate.

AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is exactly what happened.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate and also on the "When Will the Election be Held?" Bill 2015. Or is it 2016? As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are making an important amendment to the retirement age provisions in our Employment Equality Acts and another Private Members' Bill is due to come before the Dáil from the Seanad as soon as a time slot is made available to us. This amendment reflects the evolution of EU law as interpreted by the European Court of Justice and the jurisprudence of our national courts, and will go as far as appropriate in regulating retirement ages from an equality perspective. After this, a national retirement age regime must be considered in the wider context of national employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives, and national pension policy. These extend across the whole of Government, including pensions policy and schemes, employment law, the labour market, and employment policy in the context of major unemployment, which remains a priority challenge. Wider work on retirement policy issues was previously taken forward in a working group on working and retirement under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection. The Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Justice and Equality were also represented on the working group. The social partners were also involved in the working group. Further consideration of the range of policy issues must be addressed in a cross-departmental way in consultation with the social partners. We have had such discussions about strengthening Oireachtas oversight in pre-legislative scrutiny in the Oireachtas, taking the initiative in consulting with society at large on policy issues so as to inform the decision-making process. While I would not wish to instruct any committee on how it should go about its business, I agree that there would be a very useful role for the relevant Oireachtas committee to take the lead on further analysis and consideration of the wider context in which retirement age questions must be examined. This could be done by undertaking further consultation with all stakeholders before the detailed examination of the Bill to ensure the detailed examination is fully informed by the views of all relevant stakeholders. My Department and other Departments with lead roles in the relevant policy areas will be very happy to support the committee system in that work. Again, I thank Deputy Anne Ferris for introducing the Bill. There are important issues which we need to consider in detail, and the Oireachtas is well placed to initiate consultations in a wider context with all those who have an interest in retirement age and work-life balance issues. In terms of the potential for a forthcoming election, there is plenty of work I would like to proceed with during the coming months, including the international protection Bill, the misuse of drugs Bill, the family leave Bill, and amending section 37 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 on Traveller ethnicity. There are many matters I would like to knuckle down to and get over the line.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It will take months rather than weeks to get it done.
