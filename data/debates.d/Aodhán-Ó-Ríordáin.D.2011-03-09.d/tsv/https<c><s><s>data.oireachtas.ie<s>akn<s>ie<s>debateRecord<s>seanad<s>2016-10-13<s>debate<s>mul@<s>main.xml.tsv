AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for being here to discuss this matter. I am quite sure he is aware of the ongoing issues in the emergency department in Beaumont Hospital. In the past few years, as an active representative and a Member of the Oireachtas, I have visited the emergency department on a number of occasions and met staff there and senior management. What senior management has told me in stark terms is that the emergency department is physically not fit for purpose. There are also other issues. There are staffing issues, with the fact that the demographics indicate that patients are particularly elderly. These are eminent staff who are experts in the field. They know their hospital well and care for their patients extremely well. Anybody who has visited it will attest to the fact that the physical environment of the emergency department is not up to standard and if the senior management team in the hospital is stating it is not safe and that they cannot stand over it, clearly something has to happen. We are obviously in a period where the Exchequer is in a healthier place. Hospital management has put together a plan. It has a vision of investment in the emergency department to bring it up to standard and provide a much better service for the local community in Dublin and the wider region. It has estimated the cost at €45 million. The previous Government, in the guise of the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and me, met senior management. We were in a position to commit to working with senior management to deliver the plan, that the investment would happen and that the emergency department would be reconfigured and reconstructed in order to be a much better physical fit for the hospital. I have been running a local campaign in which constituents who want to see the investment happen have been engaging. Have the Minister for Health and the Department committed to implementation of this €45 million plan? Has the Minister met senior management? Is it part of the Estimates process? Is it something that will be delivered in the short to medium term because anybody who has visited the emergency department in Beaumont Hospital will realise what is happening there cannot continue? While I did not see anything in the Estimates process and the budget announcements about Beaumont Hospital, I was eager to have this discussion today because, before we head into the winter months, it is important for the staff in Beaumont Hospital and the wider community to know that the Government takes this issue seriously and wants to deliver a better service in the hospital.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I sometimes get a little worried when people use the phrase "it is my understanding" and I had hoped for something a little stronger. The Minister of State indicated that Beaumont Hospital was in the process of finalising business cases for these new developments, but it is my understanding the hospital had completed its business case for the emergency department because it was handed to me almost a year ago. It details the €45 million it believes would be required for it. He stated the business cases would be reviewed by the HSE capital and property steering group which approves projects for inclusion in the multi-annual capital plan in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's guidelines. The business case has been finalised, but the Minister of State's reply indicates that it will be reviewed by the capital and property steering group and that, as part of the process, funding provision will be made available for the planning and design phases of the proposed new developments in preparation for the capital plan review in 2017. I was hoping there would be a commitment that the capital plan, as outlined by senior management in Beaumont Hospital, of which I have a copy, was being taken seriously and would be delivered. The reply seems to suggest the business plan has not been finalised, but it has been. It also implies that it will be reviewed. The community in the Minister of State's constituency was hoping for something a little stronger. I totally understand there are other issues, including staffing and demographics that are particular to Beaumont Hospital and the wider area. The business case has been produced and I am worried about timelines and the commitment that can be given about the delivery of the physical infrastructure the hospital states it needs. It cannot stand over the service it provides, which I am sure the Minister of State will agree is extremely worrying.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister for the latest of several discussions on Brexit in this House. I commend the Government's action before the referendum in doing as much as it possibly could to speak to the Irish community in Britain and all British voters about the importance of this issue for Irish people. However, no message should go out from this or any chamber which does not state clearly that Brexit is an absolute, complete and unmitigated disaster. When the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, came to the House, I talked about the importance of European connectivity, noted that the European Union had in general been a force for good, born out of the ashes of the Second World War and that we had to re-evaluate the European project. The United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, at the behest of the people of England and Wales, is a disaster for Ireland and the Union. As Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn rightly noted, it was narrow-minded nationalism and the whims of a small group which took over the mindset and mainstream of British politics and led to this disaster. That mindset is being replicated, unfortunately, across the world. The regional development committee, of which I am a member, recently received a delegation from Blacklion, County Cavan. I was interested to hear about Senator Frances Black's connections with that area, particularly as mother is from Blacklion and my grandfather was an IRA volunteer in the Civil War. He was imprisoned, went on hunger strike and escaped before spending the rest of his life as a customs officer on the Border, which was an ironic change of career. My mother recalls there being a time zone difference between the North and the South during the Second World War. The delegates from Blacklion told us that Brexit had already had a devastating impact on their community. People who were envisaging buying homes in Cavan and working in Enniskillen are pulling out left right and centre, with their plans for their future and raising their families in disarray. In recent years, because we have come to a collective complacency around peace in Europe and peace on this island, we never envisaged that this would happen. A case before the High Court in Belfast, which Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile has mentioned in the House, involves a challenge by all but one of the major political parties in the North to the constitutional validity of what the British Government has done. Their argument is that it requires a vote of Parliament in order for Brexit to proceed and that no such vote has taken place. I am interested in hearing the Minister's view on that case. I welcome the Government's announcement that an all-party forum will take place at the beginning of next month. We in this House are national politicians and must think of the country as a whole. The Border region will be particularly affected by this issue. In our negotiations and discussions about what happens next, we must be mindful of that impact. The message needs to go out from the Government to all of our European partners that this no small deal. If any other EU member state has sympathy with what Britain has done or feels there might be some political advantage in going down that road, we must say to it that this has been an unmitigated disaster. We cannot say there are advantages in it for Ireland. The message from this country must be that this was a right-wing conspiracy which has gone belly-up and will cause untold misery economically and socially across the Continent. Any dilution of that message would be a major mistake for the Government to make. Senator Frances Black has brought a section of the Minister's speech to my attention. A motion was passed in this House last week, drafted by Senator Alice-Mary Higgins, concerning the EU-Canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement, CETA. The Minister stated:Ireland will also continue to make the most effective use of the framework of trade agreements the European Union already has in place, as well as supporting the opening of new markets through the Union. These agreements such as the EU-Canada comprehensive economic and trade agreement, CETA, which will be signed by EU Ministers in Luxembourg next week ...Is the Minister mindful that this House rejected that particular agreement, by way of Senator Alice-Mary Higgins's motion, and will she respond to this? Is it something she will take into consideration? I am not sure whether there has been a vote on the matter in the Lower House, but this House had a robust debate on it and most Members rejected the idea of this deal. I ask the Minister to ensure the Government will place a particular focus on Border regions in considering the impact of Brexit, is mindful of not being complacent about the peace process, North and South, and is an absolutely unwavering advocate for the European project. Minsters must speak in stark and forthright terms about how damaging this whole event has been in order to ward off other member states from going down the same road. I ask the Minister to respond to the expressed will of this House on the particular trade agreement to which she referred. I wish her well in her endeavours, but I reiterate that there should be no message from this House or Ministers which dilutes the reality that Brexit is an unmitigated political, economic and social disaster.
