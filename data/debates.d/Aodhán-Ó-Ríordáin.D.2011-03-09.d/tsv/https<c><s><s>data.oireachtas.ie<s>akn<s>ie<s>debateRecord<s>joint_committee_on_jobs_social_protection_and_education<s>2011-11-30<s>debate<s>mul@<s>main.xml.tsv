AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Riordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank Dr. Healy and his team for their presentation.  We have discussed these issues previously.  We do not live in a high tax country, which is the message that must go out.  Page 3 of the presentation shows a table of the effect of taxation rates in Ireland.  I am not necessarily advocating that in current circumstances there should be a huge hike in tax rates but the value judgment of society during the past 14 years has been that with money in one's pocket one could pay for private education and grinds for one's children, purchase a car rather than take public transport and rather than depend on the public health care system could sign up to a private health care plan.  I am an advocate of a more fair, equitable and progressive system which would allow for all those things to be free.  As a society we need to discuss this issue.  I was interested to hear Dr. Healy's remarks in regard to a ten year discussion about Irish society.  The best we can come up with now, in terms of ambition for Ireland, is a return to the bond markets.  That is what all this pain is for, which is a pretty raw and uninspiring ambition for families experiencing tough times.Dr. Healy mentioned the six ways the previous budget hit the poor particularly badly, one of which is no longer in existence.  Which was the most difficult?  I assume it was the universal social charge.  Many kites have been flown in the past few weeks - playing with people's emotions - to the effect that the universal social charge will be tweaked or changed to take the pressure off the lower paid.  Perhaps Dr. Healy will give us his views on that.My final question is in many ways cruel and unfair in that it asks the delegates to differentiate between those on social welfare and the working poor, which differentiation should not be made.  Are the people most at risk of poverty those on social welfare who have a level of protection in terms of medical cards and so on or those who find themselves in the bracket of the working poor where the level of debt is unsustainable?  The latter may perhaps be people who purchased their council houses in recent years and whose incomes have dropped significantly since then.  I am interested in hearing the delegates views on that issue.On vouchers, I have a problem with the type of narrative which comes from the point of view of benefiting the child.  So many families are struggling and should not be tarred with the same brush as the small minority who cannot cope for various reasons and dysfunction in their homes.  To offer a family doing its best for its children a new voucher system would be the final insult.  I would welcome the delegates' comments on those issues.
