AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 5:In page 13, to delete lines 28 and 29 and substitute the following:“ “students’ union” means an independent and self-governing body, recognised by a higher education provider or by the Minister, that is established for the purpose of promoting the general interests of students of a designated higher education institution, and of representing students, both individually and collectively, in respect of their well-being and academic, disciplinary and other matters arising within that institution;”. Many of the amendments I have put forward are to strengthen the role of trade and student unions, to provide greater transparency and ensure that too much power is not vested in one individual. We are trying to have a better definition of a student union in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am happy to work with the Minister on that. Our concern is that the Bill contains the phrase "student union or other student representative body", which could mean anything. It could be a number of students without any mandate or who have been appointed by the education provider.The Minister can understand our need to nail into the legislation a more robust definition of what a student union is. I will take the bona fides of the Minister and work with him on it, however. I will not be pressing the amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I wish to speak in support of the Bill and to reiterate a point made by Deputy Conway-Walsh in respect of primary school teaching. Currently, more primary school teachers are trained by a private online college than in any other way. That does have an impact. It could have a negative impact in future if it is not regulated and if the ethic that underpins the Bill is not stated, such as in the form proposed by the amendment. It started as an add-on to teacher training but it is now the primary provider of teacher training. The amendment is an important rebalancing of the ethics behind what we are trying to achieve.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 18:In page 16, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:
"Academic freedom
9. Nothing in this Act shall be construed as modifying or restricting the principle of academic freedom as provided for in section 14 of the Universities Act 1997.".We want to protect the concept and the principle of academic freedom within the Bill. The definition of academic freedom is, "A scholar's freedom to express ideas without risk of official interference or professional disadvantage." It is obviously something we should respect and cherish in a democratic society. Therefore, it needs to be explicit within the Bill. That is why I have tabled amendments Nos. 18 and 19.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the Minister's response. Effectively, he is saying there is nothing in the Bill that undermines academic freedom and academic freedom is protected in separate legislation. That is all the more reason for it to be enshrined or explicitly referenced within the Bill. As the Minister is aware, we live in turbulent times. One never knows what is around the corner. On that basis, the principle of academic freedom should be in every piece of legislation we deal with. That is why I will be pressing these amendments.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 19: In page 16, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:	“(c)	support and recognise the application of the principle of academic freedom,”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 40:	In page 18, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following: 	“Direction and guidelines to be published	13. The Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and to be published on the Minister’s website— 	(a) any direction issued under section 11, and	(b) any guidelines issued under section 12.”.I tabled this amendment in the interest of transparency.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I withdraw my amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 43:In page 20, to delete lines 7 to 9 and substitute the following:“(b) Not less than three of the persons appointed under paragraph (a) shall be students or full-time officers of a national student union, nominated by the Board.(c) Not less than one of the persons appointed under paragraph (a) shall be nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to represent the interests of staff.”.This amendment was discussed with amendment No. 5 but I reiterate that we are trying here in the Bill to rebalance from one to three the number of appointments who are student representation. I also re-emphasise the fact that representation for non-academic staff in these institutions is crucial. The institutions cannot function without them and they often go unrepresented or unheard. This is the basis behind the amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman is ahead of me. I am sure the Minister will look at my amendments as I believe that was his indication on amendment No. 5. I will come back on Report Stage.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 60:In page 32, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:“(c) the funding status of individual designated institutions of higher education,”.On the same theme of the strategy in this legislation, all the conversations we have had about the sector for which the Minister is responsible have come down to funding. It is a hot topic of conversation. This has been going on for years and it is the elephant in the room in any conversation about higher or further education. Within the context of the strategies laid out by the Minister, therefore, I feel strongly that the funding status of individual designated institutions of higher education must be included in such a strategy and that this aspect must be contained in the legislation.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	With that in mind, we will reflect on the amendment. We reserve the right to resubmit on Report Stage but I will withdraw the amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am happy to withdraw amendment No. 64 on the basis of what the Minister said. However, I will point to the reference to representatives of students or students' unions. We have spoken about this matter previously and I hope it can be addressed. It is welcome that trade union representation is included but that reference to representatives of students or students' unions, which looks small, may not be small if it is not ironed out. I have made this point already. We may revisit the issue.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is exactly my concern.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The inclusion of the word "or" is problematic.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 68:In page 32, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following: “(e) recognised trade unions and staff associations in the designated institutions of higher education,”. In fairness, the Minister has recognised this issue in previous amendments. However, we feel strongly about the inclusion of recognised trade unions and staff associations in this part of the Bill for the reasons already outlined. I re-emphasise the point that many people who work in these institutions are not academic staff and, therefore, need proper representation.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I can probably withdraw my amendments. The sequencing of the amendments is a little fortunate for the Minister and not for me.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will withdraw amendment No. 68.
