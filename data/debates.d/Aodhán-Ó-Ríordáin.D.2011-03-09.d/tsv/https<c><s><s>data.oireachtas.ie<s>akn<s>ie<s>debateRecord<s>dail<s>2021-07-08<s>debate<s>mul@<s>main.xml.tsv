AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The issue here, if we get beyond the sloganeering, is very real. In my community in Marino, there has been a discovery this week about a development on Griffith Avenue. When it was being proposed, there was a lot of internal debate in the community about its size and scale, which was making people uneasy. There was also a lot of sentiment in the local area that development was needed to house our people. We discovered this week that 343 of these units are being sold to a vulture fund. Young people are facing an average rent of €1,914. What are we supposed to do in this situation and how can we prevent it from happening again? When the Minister says, and I genuinely believe he agrees, that this is not something that should happen, how can we prevent it from happening? It is very real; it is happening right on our doorsteps.
