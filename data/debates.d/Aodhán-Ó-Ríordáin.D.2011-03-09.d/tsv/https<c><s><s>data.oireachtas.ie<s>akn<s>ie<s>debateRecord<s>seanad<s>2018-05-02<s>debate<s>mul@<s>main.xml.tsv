AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for attending. I am raising the issue of access to St. Michael's House in Dublin 9 for day service users. These people are having difficulty accessing transport. The Department is well aware of this issue. In a presentation made to me last week, however, I was told that it had 788 adult service users who are transported to day services every day, of whom 200 are supported by St. Michael's House drivers and escorts, 120 are transported by Vantastic, 96 are transported by residential house staff and bus, 41 are transported by day service staff and bus, 35 are transported by contract taxis, 38 are transported by family members - with 18 such arrangements being unsustainable - and 258 are transported by public transport, some with support. A total of 435 of these individuals live with residential supports from St. Michael's House. The Minister of State will appreciate that these are very vulnerable users of the service for whom transport is essential. If they do not have transport, the service will not be accessible to them. I will outline some of their concerns and some of the deficiencies relating to the service. A total of eight service users who live at home cannot access the service because they have no transport. This is a serious situation for these eight individuals. A total of 38 individuals are being transported by family members and, as already stated, 18 of these arrangements are not sustainable. An issue of equity arises here. St. Michael's House also supports an ageing group of people with increasingly complex needs. The average age of primary care givers there is also increasing. Twenty individuals supported in St. Michael's House residential services are on a waiting list for transport, which impacts on residential service staff. A total of 325.5 staff hours could be released from the roster if an effective transport service was delivered. The issue of transport to and from St. Michael's House to allow individuals to access its services has been ongoing for quite a number of years. There is no cheap solution and providing transport is expensive. What is even more expensive, however, is the compounded vulnerability, isolation, loneliness and sense of despair experienced by the families who need these services for their loved ones. The sense of isolation because of a lack of transport is quite acute. While I know the Minister of State and his Department will be looking at both the cost and the bottom line, I contend that the cost of not taking action will be quite profound. I want to be constructive. I know there are no easy solutions that the Minister of State can offer today but I would ask that he and other Ministers, who I know have been in contact with and have met representatives from St. Michael's House, can try to find an equitable and sustainable solution. A number of people clearly need this service and cannot access it because of the lack of transport to which I refer. The families of the eight individuals I mentioned will be impacted upon as well because of the range of challenges their loved ones face. I plead with the Minister of State to look at the situation and provide transport for these individuals. They are very vulnerable and need the service and to be able to access it. Without transport, they will continue to be isolated. We are in a much better financial position than previously and we have the resources to do things we were unable to do in the past. I ask the Minister of State and the Department to prioritise this issue.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	With the greatest respect, it does not really do much, particularly for the eight service users who are at home and cannot access the service because they have no transport or the 18 individuals who are transported by family members, something which St. Michael's House has indicated is not sustainable. I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the answer he has provided, particularly in the context of these service users, who are isolated and who cannot use the service. I understand the constraints the Minister of State is under when he comes to the House with a script but we have a service for vulnerable people, a number of whom are at home and cannot access it because of lack of transport. The Minister of State's answer does not really give me, St. Michael's House or the families of these eight people and the 18 individuals whose current transport arrangements are made by family members and are unsustainable any comfort. Can the Department not meet representatives from St. Michael's House and find sustainable transport solutions for those 26 individuals?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Senator can go ahead.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I wish to raise two issues. What the women of Ireland need now is leadership from these Houses. I know that politics has a bad name, but politics can do much good in the coming days. I am delighted that Senator Norris mentioned the name of the woman at the heart of this scandal, Vicky Phelan. People have asked for this not to be made a political football and then have immediately engaged in political football. I do not believe that the people of Ireland need to see one side of the House point a finger at the other side of the House. We should point the finger, collectively, at ourselves and ask what we can do better for the women of Ireland. I doubt that anybody would disagree that if this was a service exclusively for men, this would never happen. We continuously fail women in this country and that must be recognised. I also wish to raise the issue of sport. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the House to discuss sport in general and the capacity of children to play sport in the context of the accessibility of local playing fields. I am a member of Scoil Uí Chonaill GAA club. It was a delight for us to see a member of the club, Hannah Leahy, who is vice-captain of the Dublin ladies minor team, be named the player of the game on Sunday when the team won the Leinster championship. We are very proud of her, as are her family. While many of us in the House enjoy GAA and sport, we see what is happening to many of the playing pitches across this city and further afield with regard to rezoning and commercial development, including what is happening in the Na Fianna club in Glasnevin. I would appreciate the opportunity to have a discussion with the Minister with responsibility for sport about the availability and accessibility of playing pitches and how we can facilitate clubs and young children to enjoy sporting endeavour into the future. With the building or construction boom back there is more pressure on lands in institutional use in colleges and schools across the State and, due to major infrastructure plans, clubs such as Na Fianna are under increasing scrutiny and pressure. That debate would be timely and I would appreciate if the Leader could facilitate it.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I concur with my colleague and I also welcome the Minister to the House. I appreciate the work that she and her officials have done in this regard. I completely agree with her. What she has outlined is not the intention of our Bill in any way. The intention is to bring parents under the compassionate arm of the State rather than having them end up in a courtroom. I appreciate the difficulty the Minister's drafters will have in differentiating between a child not enrolled in a school and one who is. The intention of the Bill is to ensure that Tusla and the agencies of the State can deal compassionately with all children within the primary school enrolment system, particularly four and five year olds, and that they can be interacted with, encouraged and empowered. Nobody wants to see the parents of any child in a courtroom situation. It is a failure on everybody's part if it comes to that. We want to have that compassionate engagement and interaction from the agencies of the State for four and five year olds enrolled in school in order to correct poor patterns of behaviour at the earliest stage so that they do not compound and embed themselves into a much bigger problem later on. I appreciate the difficulty that the Minister's drafters will have. We will support her at every step along the way. Perhaps in time a more comprehensive Act may be needed to deal with this whole range of issues over a period of time. From the Labour Party's perspective, we are absolutely determined to work with the Minister on this.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the Acting Chairman's indulgence. I thank the Minister and I reiterate that I hope nobody thinks that the intention of this Bill is stick rather than carrot. There are principals like myself in my former occupation who had the situation where they could only deal with the agents of the State, the National Educational Welfare Board as it was then and Tusla now, if a child was over six years of age. If there is a child in the school with very poor attendance patterns, for whatever reason, there was not the opportunity to refer that child because the legislation provided for children between the ages of six and 16. The intention of this Bill is not to hurt families. It is not to try and create difficulty between the school and a family. It is intended that a school can work with a family to address these poor behaviour patterns and that they can be empowered to do so by legislation. That is the ethos behind the Bill. I am delighted the Minister has accepted the Bill, is taking it on board that we have reached Committee Stage and can progress it. I mention a child who is enrolled and who is dependent on adults advocating for him or her. When one is 16 or 17 years of age, and in the education system, one is in a position to advocate for oneself and it is a different conversation, but when a child is four or five years of age, he or she needs adults to back him or her. Children need their parents, family and whole school community to back them. I am delighted that people in this House are backing those children and the Minister is too. I appreciate the Minister's support.
