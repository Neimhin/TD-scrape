AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Tánaiste and his team for attending the committee meeting.  Will the Tánaiste expand on the statement he made on the impact of bank lending policy by our two pillar banks on business in Northern Ireland with regard to the insecurity of the euro and the perceived flight of deposits from the Southern side of the Border to the Northern side?  What impact would a discussion on this have on the recapitalisation of our banks?Will the Tánaiste outline any discussions which took place on the ongoing security situation and the worrying rise in dissident activity?  This forum has had much discussion on the commemorative process we will go through in the coming years, with a presentation from the Parades Commission at our previous meeting.  We are very sensitive to the potential for divisive emotions to arise in the coming ten years.  However, there is also the potential for great coming together in celebration and I am intrigued and encouraged by the discussion taking place on tourism and the potential positive effects of these commemorations.  I would appreciate if the Tánaiste expanded on these points.
