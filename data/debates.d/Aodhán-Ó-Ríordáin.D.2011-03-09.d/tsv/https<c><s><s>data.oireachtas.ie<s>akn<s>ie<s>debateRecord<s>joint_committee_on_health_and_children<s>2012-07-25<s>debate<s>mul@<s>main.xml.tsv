AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank Ms Doherty for her presence today.  The remit of the NEWB under the Act is to deal with children between the ages of six and 16.  I published an amendment to that Act recently, suggesting that any child aged four or five who is enrolled in the school should come under the remit of the Act, because we cannot have early intervention unless we can intervene when a child is enrolling in the school.  Poor attendance patterns are often embedded in a child's experience, so by the time they hit six or seven years of age, when the welfare officer can intervene, it may be too late.  In my own experience, attendance patterns say a lot about the family and the aspirations of that family.  What does Ms Doherty feel about this amendment becoming law?  At the other end of the scale, there are 17 or 18 year old pupils missing any amount of days who still do not come under the remit of the Act.  Should we have a stipulation that anybody enrolled in a recognised school should come under the remit of the Act?  The Act will work for anybody within the ages of six to 16, but not for anybody outside it.I wonder how the figure of 20 days was arrived at, because 20 days is almost a target for some parents in many schools.  It is a comfort zone.  If they stay within the 20 days, they are fine.  If they go outside it, that is where the problem arises.  In my own experience, a child could have 12 or 13 days in June and knows there is a comfort zone of 20 days, so it is difficult to encourage him or her to be in attendance every single day.  Is there potential to reduce that number of days?  I am interested in hearing about the NEWB's interaction with the school completion programme and the home-school liaison service.  Also, given the importance of mental health issues at both primary and secondary level, how does it intend to address that?  Am I right in saying that the number of expulsions at post-primary level is rising?  If so, how does Ms Doherty suggest we could address this?
