AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome Mr. Saint-Amans. One comment he made earlier that interested me was that the OECD's position was that low direct taxes are pro-growth. Could he expand on that?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Saint-Amans made the welcome statement that Ireland is not a tax haven and has said that part of what he wants to do is to improve transparency and the automatic exchange of information. How difficult will that process be?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Saint-Amans think the date of 2014 can be achieved?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Does he think that the new standard can be up and running by 2014?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	He made a point earlier about the balance that must be struck between not impinging on sovereignty and neutralising schemes that are used. It sounds like a pretty difficult balance to strike. A previous question was asked about why this was at the forefront of the international agenda. How difficult would it be to strike that balance between national sovereignty and neutralising schemes and to keep this issue at the forefront of the international agenda?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate where Mr. Saint-Amans is coming from. My point was more about the politics of these things rather than the sovereignty. I thank him for his interaction. I appreciate his comments very much.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It could be called double Dutch.
