AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputies from all sides for their valuable contributions on this Second Stage debate and for the broad support they have given to the principle of equality for all workers, particularly teachers and other workers who feel threatened by the current provision of section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act 1998. Deputies referred to the devastating effects of discrimination and homophobia, and studies highlighting higher rates of depression and self-harm among the LGBT community have, sadly, underlined these effects all too clearly. These, and other examples mentioned by Deputies, show the extent of the problem and the urgency of having amending legislation in place as soon as possible. It was for this reason that the Government, in the programme for Government, undertook to amend section 37(1) to provide for a more equitable balance between the rights and freedoms of religion and religious institutions on the one hand and the right to be free from discrimination on the other. The aim of the Bill is to provide clear guidance on resolving disputes that may arise between employees and employers. While it will always remain the case that an employer has the right to take action against an employee who acts against the employer's best interests, or undermines the institution's ethos, there will now be criteria against which to determine the reasonableness and proportionality of any action taken. The Bill requires that employers who provide publicly funded services should meet a higher standard of justification for any action taken against an employee on grounds of undermining the institution's religious ethos. The Bill thus distinguishes between religious institutions run wholly for private purposes and those providing a social, educational or medical service to the public financed by State funding. This important distinguishing feature must be recognised in any amending legislation in order to ensure its constitutionality. I understand the frustration of some Deputies that the Bill does not go far enough and their desire that section 37(1) be repealed. However, there is a constitutional balance to be struck in reconciling the competing constitutional rights involved, namely, on the one hand, freedom of religion and freedom of association for religious bodies and their freedom to establish and maintain their own institutions, and on the other hand, the right of employees to be free from discrimination. To present it in a positive way, the legal advice available is that the State has a stronger standing, the right and, arguably, the duty to ensure people whose salaries are paid directly or indirectly from the public Exchequer are protected and that in such circumstances a stronger intervention in the employee-employer relationship than would be appropriate in purely religious institutions is justified. The fundamental point with which we are grappling is that religious institutions do, and must, have the constitutional right to differentiate, which is the sense in which discrimination is used in EU law and our domestic legislation, on the basis of religion or belief. We can say there must be a rationale for favourable treatment and any action taken must be fully justified. We can raise the bar to a very high level where public funding is involved. However, we cannot prohibit religious institutions from differentiating on the basis of religion. Otherwise, the legislation when passed will be liable to successful challenge in the courts. The Bill should be seen in the context of what the Government has achieved for LGBT people. We have introduced compulsory anti-bullying procedures in all schools explicitly referring to homophobic and transphobic bullying for the first time. We recently enacted progressive gender recognition legislation, making us one of the most progressive countries in the world for transgender rights. This week, we gave effect to the results of the marriage equality referendum last May through the commencement of the Marriage Act 2015. Ending discrimination in our schools and hospitals is the next major step in the programme of reform. I look forward to engaging further with Deputies on the technical aspects of the Bill on Committee Stage.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Next Wednesday.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue for discussion today. Nationally, inpatient child and adolescent bed capacity has increased from 12 beds in 2007 to 58 beds at present, with 26 beds in Dublin, 12 beds in Cork and 20 beds in Galway. This represents an almost fivefold increase over eight years. I am pleased to announce that a new purpose-built 22-bed child and adolescent inpatient unit located on the grounds of Cherry Orchard Hospital has been completed and will be opened next week by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch. The existing 14 beds in the current temporary facility will transfer across to the new facility. This means that there will be an additional eight child and adolescent mental health beds in the country and that the total number of beds will increase to 66. Those who provide child and adolescent mental health services in the mid-west region, which covers Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary, have access as required to a modern state-of-the-art inpatient child and adolescent mental health facility in Galway. Requests for admissions to this facility are made by the local child and adolescent mental health teams in the mid-west to their counterparts in Galway. All applications are appropriately considered and prioritised. The HSE is committed to the appropriate provision of child and adolescent mental health service inpatient beds for children. From time to time, a young person may have a very short admission to an adult facility pending the availability of a bed in a child and adolescent unit. These placements are generally for very short periods. Progress in this area is underscored by the fact that such admissions have declined from 247 in 2008 to 89 last year. It is important to stress that the HSE's intention is to aim for appropriate placements and to reduce to the greatest extent possible the need for and dependency on inpatient beds. Modern-day multidisciplinary interventions for children are much more appropriate to non-inpatient admissions and to supporting children in their own family settings. In the mid-west region, a consultant-led child and adolescent mental health service is provided by multidisciplinary teams across Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary. This service operates an emergency service for critical cases of same-day referral. In addition, an out-of-hours on-call service is provided through the emergency department of the University Hospital Limerick. This is not replicated in all parts of the country. The child and adolescent mental health service based in Limerick is scheduled to move to a new outpatient and clinical premises shortly, subject to the completion of some final details in respect of the property involved. Plans are being advanced to explore the possibility of providing the equivalent of a day hospital-type service. This will further enhance the capacity of the services within the region. The Deputy will appreciate the priority shown by this Government to modernise mental health policy and services in line with A Vision for Change. He will also be aware that significant new resources have been allocated for mental health since 2012.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy makes a solid case. He has acknowledged the movements and the improvements that have been made in this area, as borne out by the statistics I provided to him in my initial reply. I do not have an answer at the moment to the very direct question he has asked. I will ensure the Department makes direct contact with him and supplies him in writing with the information he has sought in the question he has asked this evening.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this issue. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is responsible under statute for the six designated fishery harbour centres which are located at Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Dingle, Rossaveel and Killybegs. All six fishery centres are, first and foremost, working fishery harbours which provide essential services and facilities to the fishing industry around the coastline. Each fishery harbour centre has unique features which facilitate a broad range of other diverse activities which are important from both an economic and social perspective. The Department is conscious of the importance of both fishing and non-fishing activities at the harbours. This involves day-to-day operational support by harbour staff and management and development and repair of infrastructure, subject to available financial resources. I am pleased to advise the House that, notwithstanding the prevailing economic environment in which we operate, in excess of €4.2 million has been invested in maintenance, development and upgrading works at Howth as part of the Department's fishery harbour and coastal infrastructure development programme between 2011 and 2014. The Minister also approved funding of €1.79 million for the maintenance and development of Howth fishery harbour centre in 2015. Major works for 2015 include the continued upgrading of the electrical system, provision of a small craft pontoon and traffic management works. Siltation in Howth harbour is recognised as an issue and is being kept under review. It has been discussed with various stakeholders, and officials from the Department attended the Howth Harbour Users Forum on 29 January 2015 and used the occasion to have a number of tangential meetings with users, at which the issue of dredging was discussed. A further meeting with the Howth Yacht Club was held on 17 July at which the question of dredging was again the main item of discussion. As part of the 2015 fishery harbour centre development programme, the Minister sanctioned €150,000 to carry out site investigation works in Howth for the west pier pontoon and middle pier upgrade. The site investigation contractor commenced work on site in early November and the work is expected to be substantially complete by the end of the year. It is anticipated that the report on the site investigation will be issued in early 2016. This report will include information on the nature of the material to be dredged and the extent of contaminated material within the dredge footprint. This information is required to prepare a dumping at sea licence application which will be necessary for the commencement of any dredging project in future. It will also provide the basis for an informed estimate of the cost of dredging the harbour at Howth. As with all other developments in the six fishery harbour centres, a dredging project at Howth fishery harbour centre will be considered under future capital programmes on the basis of available Exchequer funding and competing priorities. The suite of projects for inclusion in the 2016 programme is being considered and the Minister will make an announcement on these in due course.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is an important issue and I agree with many of the points the Deputy has made. On the publication of the report early next year, local Deputies and interested parties may be in a position to meet with the Minister. I will do my best to facilitate that, as it would be the best way to proceed. I will ask the Minister about the capital allocation and see if he can move the issue forward. Howth Harbour is a wonderful amenity, and the issues the Deputy raised are extremely important. We must be in a position to act on them and proceed in an appropriate manner once the report is available. It should be published, available and transparent and we should be able to act on it as soon as it is there. Deputy Broughan and I can facilitate a meeting with the Minister to ensure that we can act on it.
