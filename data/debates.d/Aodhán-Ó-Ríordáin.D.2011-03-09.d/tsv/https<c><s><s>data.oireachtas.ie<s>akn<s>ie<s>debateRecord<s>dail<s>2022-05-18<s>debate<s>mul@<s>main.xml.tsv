AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The annual State of the Global Climate report provides another damning indictment of our failure to adequately respond to and tackle climate change. Four indicators broke records last year, namely, ocean heat, ocean acidification, greenhouse gas concentrations and sea level rises. We are out of time. We are out of time. However, if we want to avert further damage, we need a just transition that takes people with us. We needed it a long time ago. When the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 was passing through the Houses, there was extensive debate on the amendments proposed by the Opposition to strengthen and define exactly what a just transition would mean. Unfortunately, the Minister did not incorporate this principle into the Bill. A just transition is a concept that originates from within the global trade union movement and is central to a labour and social solidarity understanding of climate protection measures. Our transition to decarbonisation must be carried out in a fair and just way that will not adversely impact on those who are most affected by the cost-of-living and energy crises. When I speak of a just transition, I mean the protection and creation of jobs, improved living standards and reduced emissions, protecting our biodiversity and generating new sustainable communities. We need a blueprint for the future and a structured dialogue that is inclusive of all stakeholders. We must ensure that investment to address our climate emissions and to meet our targets takes account of the need to bring people with us and to protect employment and communities. We need a flexible and accessible skills and education system to meet the needs of a net-zero economy and to address inequalities where transitions are occurring. As I said before, improving energy efficiency of the housing stock is an opportunity to do this. Investment to restore peatlands, urban tree planting and woodland management are all ways in which we can action a just transition and ensure that communities are not hit in terms of employment opportunities. The recent controversy regarding turf is a prime example of the work that is needed to deliver a real just transition by addressing energy and security and protecting our bogs. The Labour Party has called for works in the context of retrofitting and energy efficiency measures for those homes that rely on sod turf to be accelerated. That will require financial investment through grant aid. There is no point in telling anyone who cannot afford to upgrade their home or to buy alternative fuels that they must change. The State needs to support them. The Labour Party is in full support of the Just Transition Alliance and of its call for the urgent and immediate establishment of a national commission. Indeed, this is one of the first issues that was raised with the Taoiseach by Deputy Bacik when she became leader of the Labour Party. Apart from informing us of the extension of the contract of the current just transition commissioner until the end of the year, the Taoiseach did not shed any further light on when the commission will be established. What we need to see now is a date for the establishment of the just transition commission and the mandate of the of the commission. It must incorporate International Labour Organisation guidelines and must align with the UN sustainable development goals. When the commission is fully established, we hope the Minister will use the experience gained in other jurisdictions, such as Scotland, Canada, Germany, Spain and New Zealand, to inform its work. The publication of detailed investment proposals and an action plans to deliver projects is necessary. Achieving that will require additional financing. In its most recent budget proposals, the Labour Party called for a doubling of the just transition fund and for increased investment in retrofitting. The midlands is not the only community at risk. We need a more ambitious response from the State. Accountability, implementation targets and transparency on decision-making must be central to the commission. The question of preserving intergenerational solidarity will also be critical to its proposed work, because a younger generation is growing frustrated with the failure of those in charge to address the climate crisis. In Ireland, we have a problem with rising emissions and our emissions are going in the wrong direction. We cannot adequately plan for a just transition without the publication of sectoral emissions ceilings. The Minister of State might confirm when those will be published. We face immense challenges in the areas of transport, agriculture, food production, afforestation and electricity generation, to name just a few. We need to see those ceilings and to get to grips with the challenge. Crucially, we need the State to play a leading role in the energy sector. Why are we not directly financing offshore wind through the ESB and through other semi-States to retain those natural assets in public ownership? I want to conclude on a point at that the Labour Party has made before. Our natural environment has suffered for too long from the impact of unregulated free markets and untrammelled economic growth. We must build an economic and class analysis into our response to the climate crisis, so that we do not see environmental policies in a silo. These cannot exist in a vacuum. We need a State that leads the charge on climate justice, developing a new model of climate-neutral growth through a just transition. That is why we need the commission now. Our economic planning and climate response must be in sync. These are two sides of the same coin. We need a new economy that generates wealth and that also supports emissions reduction. When my colleague, Deputy Bacik, became leader of the Labour Party, she said that in the coming months we will publish a new strategic economic plan for Ireland. It will put a clear emphasis on regional job creation and on a just transition.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will speak to my amendments. We debated this over and back with the Minister of State, Deputy English, on Committee Stage. He said that he would go back and reflect on some of the measures. This element of the Bill is a non-starter for us. We introduced our own sick pay legislation through Private Member's business two years ago. As Deputy Murphy quite rightly said, the pandemic now appears to be mostly over, yet we are still in a situation where we have not legislated for it. As we constantly said in the committee room, in every other EU country that has statutory sick pay, most have free GP care. It is imbalanced to talk purely about sick pay when other elements within society do not stand up in the context of the worker. It was also instructive to me, and I believe to other members of the committee, how much the weight of conversation in the committee room was about the employer, the employer, the employer. That is understandable but we really want to talk about the worker who is sick and who, therefore, feels that he or she has to go to work even when sick. Let us imagine being in that position where you really feel it is going to hurt you so badly in their pocket that you must pretend to be well to go to work. On that basis, we strongly feel that the Minister's intention to go from three to ten days over an ill-defined period is not strong enough. We want to start at ten days with the ambition to go to 30 days, which would be in keeping with a modern, decent republic. This is why we feel so strongly about it. I withdrew my amendments on Committee Stage, as did other colleagues, in order to resubmit them on Report Stage. I intend to press amendment No. 3 to a vote.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will repeat what we said on Committee Stage. Whenever an improvement to the lot of the worker is proposed, the Government always seems to speak of Armageddon and about how difficult it will be for employers and how businesses will fold, etc. Whenever we propose issues such as a basic rate of pay, a living wage or anything in this area we are always told it will place an unreasonable burden on employers, whereas in every other modern European country it is a basic provision. I restate to the Tánaiste that there are basic provisions even on this island. People in the North of the country have free GP care, something that we have not managed to organise for ourselves in the Republic. That is why this is lopsided. We cannot always think solely, as appears to be the contention of the Tánaiste's party and Government, about the burden on the employer. He cited the war in Ukraine and Border issues with Brexit. The sick worker who has to go to work on the basis of having a low-paid job must be at the forefront of everybody's mind. We are living in a country in which 23% of workers are on low pay. That is what has been driving our attempts to rectify the matter. As has been said, it is to the credit of the Government that it is attempting to rectify this issue but this does not go far enough to protect workers who should not feel they should have to go to work when they are unwell in order to feed their children. That is, unfortunately, the scenario.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 3:In page 5, to delete lines 23 to 25 and substitute the following:“(2) An employee shall be entitled to up to and including 10 statutory sick leave days in a year, or such additional number of statutory sick leave days (if any) up to 30, as may stand specified from time to time by order of the Minister under section 6.”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Paul Murphy is making a very important point but I cannot hear him.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 17:In page 6, line 27, to delete “3” and substitute “10”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 19:In page 6, line 29, to delete “3” and substitute “10”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 20:In page 6, to delete lines 31 to 35 The amendment seeks to delete the section that gives the Minister 12 months to improve the lot of workers. If it was in the mind of the Minister to move from the stated three days to five days or ten days, it should be open to the Minister to do that within six months and not to have to wait for 12 months. We propose that lines 31 to 35 would be deleted.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We debated this on Committee Stage as well. We feel this is a reasonable position for the Minister to be enabled to improve the situation and not to have to wait 12 months to do so. That is the purpose of the amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This provision in the Bill will do more damage than anything else to its potential for success. If I am sick and I am less likely to admit to that because I will get less money and I will be paid less, I will just go to work sick. As has been outlined, it is an expensive business being sick in this country. Not only do people have to pay for a GP visit, because we do not provide that for free, unlike in other countries, there is also the cost of whatever medicines are prescribed. It is not a cheap business being sick in this country. I can see a worker who is struggling to pay the bills deciding to go into work and pretend he or she is well. That is not something any of us wants to see that happening, but that is what will happen. We must go back to where the worker is coming from. I know the Tánaiste talks about the employer, and he is right to focus on the employer as much as we want to focus on the employee. However, if a worker who has bills to pay and children to feed thinks for a second he or she has to go to work even though he or she is sick, then this Bill will have failed. The most problematic part of this Bill is that it will be worth more to the worker to go to work sick than to avail of the provisions within the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 23:In page 7, line 4, after “day” to insert “,which shall be their full daily rate”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This amendment completely misses the disgusting nature of the intent of an employer not to pay sick pay. What kind of employer are we dealing with who would resist paying sick pay for his or her employee? In the original legislation we discussed previously, the penalty of 20 weeks seemed to me to be commensurate with the disgust we should have for such an employer. It is clear, given that the Tánaiste has come to the Chamber to amend it down to four weeks, that somebody from the employer side of things has had his ear or somebody else's. We genuinely believe this is not good enough and will be absolutely opposing the amendment.
