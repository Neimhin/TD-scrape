AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We have a quorum, so I call the meeting to order. Apologies have been received from Senator Healy Eames, who has said she will be late. At the request of broadcasting and recording services, I ask members to ensure their mobile phones are turned off completely and not just left on silent mode during the meeting. The broadcasting unit will broadcast the public session of this meeting live. The proceedings are carried on UPC channel 207. We will now go into private session to deal with minutes and correspondence.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock. Before we commence, I wish to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee. If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular subject and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against an individual or an entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it easily identifiable. I advise also that submissions and opening statements will be published on the committee's website following this meeting.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I would just like to make a few comments. I understand the reason for the order and the constitutional framework under which it is being introduced.It is appropriate to say that the very basis around which we train teachers means that, in effect, it amounts to a sectarian head count throughout our teacher training colleges, and it is important for us to investigate this properly. We still have far too heavy an influence from religious institutions over the education system. It is the fundamental ethos that is in the training colleges and the vast bulk of primary and secondary schools. Any progressive, forward-thinking and enlightened society would view what we are doing today - putting aside a number of training places in a college for people of a particular faith - as particularly weird. Religious background should be of no relevance to anybody if a person wishes to become a teacher. Unfortunately, we are still standing over a position where if a person is becoming a primary school teacher in this country, unless that person is willing to pay over the odds by using the Hibernia College online course, he or she must tick a box on religious faith. Applicants to the majority of primary schools must also answer a pretty invasive question on faith and what religious ethos the person will stand over. I have no difficulty with what is being introduced because it is, on the face of it, in line with the Constitution and without a constitutional change, our hands are tied. Nevertheless, we should have a conversation about what we are asking of our young teachers and continually providing for in this State and Republic. Effectively, the most important thing that seems to be asked of any individual is about religious background. That relates to teachers, students and other practitioners in the educational field. It sticks in my craw that we return to the issue repeatedly. I respect the position in which we find ourselves but will the Minister of State comment on whether an amendment is in train with regard to the Employment Equality Act? It would argue that State-funded religious institutions - either hospitals or schools - should not discriminate based on somebody's sexuality or private life if it could conflict with the ethos of the body. How would that have an impact on training colleges?
