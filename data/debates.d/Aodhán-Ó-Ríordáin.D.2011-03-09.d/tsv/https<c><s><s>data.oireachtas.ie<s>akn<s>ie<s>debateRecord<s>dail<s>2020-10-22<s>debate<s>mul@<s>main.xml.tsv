AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Tánaiste made reference to the Covid restrictions support scheme earlier. I know he was hoping for a chance to expand on the issue. The scheme is to run from 13 October. The details are to be included in the finance Bill which is to be published shortly. However, thousands of businesses are locked out from today. When will they be able to apply for the scheme? Can they apply from today? When will they receive a cash payment? As the Tánaiste knows, they have bills which must be paid immediately.
