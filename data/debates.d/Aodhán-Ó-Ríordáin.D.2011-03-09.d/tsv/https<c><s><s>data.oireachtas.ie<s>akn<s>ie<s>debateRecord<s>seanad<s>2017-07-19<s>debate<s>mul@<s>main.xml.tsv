AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that we take No. 21, the Education (Welfare) (Amendment) Bill 2017, before No. 1. Tacaím leis an méid atá ráite leis an Seanadóir Ó Céidigh mar gheall ar dhíospóireacht ó thaobh chúrsaí Gaeilge de. Tá sé thar am go mbeadh an díospóireacht sin againn anseo. Ba chóir go rachaidh sé ar aghaidh ar feadh dhá uair a chloig ar a laghad, mar a dúirt an Seanadóir féin. My last point is to support what Senator Bacik said about the recent report on conditions for children in direct provision. It is a matter of pride to this House that Members, collectively and across parties, have taken the matter of direct provision so seriously. A number of debates on the issue took place both in this Seanad and the previous one. Can we not, for the love of God, implement the report of the working group on direct provision, which was chaired by Judge Bryan McMahon? I ask that the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, be invited back to the House, but I know, because I was once in his position, that he is not necessarily the person with the last call on these issues. That is the Minister for Justice and Equality. There is a new Minister for Justice and Equality and he has expressed concern about, and interest in, this issue in the past. I ask the Leader to invite him to the House in the autumn, with the express intention of committing to implementing the McMahon report on the protection and direct provision systems. Many Members of this House want the direct provision system to be abolished, but we are simply asking that the McMahon report on the system, which is more than two years old and which was a compromise with the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, that were invited to take part in the working group, be implemented to the letter and in full. That is not too much to ask in this day and age. We are scarring the lives of children, in particular, who are still in the direct provision system.

AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move:That leave be given to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the further coordination of the activities of the National Educational Welfare Board or, in the Irish language, an Bord Náisiúnta Leasa Oideachais, in so far as they relate to matters connected with prevention of non-attendance on the part of certain students registered with recognised schools and for those and other purposes to amend the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 and to provide for related matters.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Next Tuesday.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank and congratulate the Civil Engagement group for bringing this piece of legislation before the House. I was involved in the original International Protection Act and many of these issues were raised at the time, but we were advised that all worries or concerns relating to the Bill were overstated, that this was the European norm and it had to happen and needed to be guillotined because of time sensitivity. It had to happen because of the direct provision report, and if it was passed, we would get a single procedure mechanism which every NGO and every international organisation was calling for us to have. After it was passed, the President, for the second time in his term of office, had to call the Council of State to see if it was constitutional. Now we have a situation of asylum seekers being handed 60-page documents to go through of which they have to make some kind of sense. The Seanad is now debating an amendment to the legislation in order to give justification to family rights of asylum-seekers. I have deep reservations about the capacity of the Minister's Department to deal with this issue. Running right through his Department is a suspicion of anybody who comes to this country seeking asylum. I think there is mistrust and a complete misunderstanding of the nature of the problem. I cannot remember a single meeting that I had with a senior official in the Minister's Department when I was in it as a Minister of State, working with the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, where the term "pull factor" was not used. I do not think the Minister's Department has any capacity to deal with this issue. The entire area of asylum, integration and immigration needs to be taken out of it because the Department comes to this issue with a justice and defence mentality, a law and order mentality, and does not come to the issue with a sense of humanitarianism or decency. The Department sees the issue as a problem. I have come to the conclusion that the Department believes that half the people who are seeking asylum, if not more, are just liars. I have to say, reluctantly, that that is the sense I get from working in the Minister's Department. It breaks my heart after all the time I spent in that Department and every direct provision centre I visited. I know the Minister lives close to one in Portlaoise. The parish priest there has to be greatly commended on what he has said about that direct provision centre. A group of NGOs was invited by that Department to sit around the table with Department officials to come up with a direct provision report, which was a compromise on everybody's part. On the day that the report was announced, I made the comment at the press conference that this was the report that would be implemented because the Department had signed off on it. The then Minister for Justice and Equality sat there and said that it gives food for thought. It is a disgusting disgrace that not a single letter of that report has been implemented by now. When we had the Action Plan for Jobs, we had three-monthly or four-monthly updates, great fanfare and press conferences to say what had been achieved and which recommendations had been fulfilled. What has happened in the two years since the direct provision report was published? A couple of easy to fulfil recommendations were followed through. Every NGO that took part in that process did so with the best will in the world, and many had been mandated to call for the abolition of the process and signed away that mandate when they signed off on that document as a compromise because they thought the situation would be improved. What happened? It was not implemented in full, mainly, I believe, because the people with concerns are people who are not politically powerful. It is a disgrace, and that is why I think the Department is completely incapable. It hurts me to say that because I know many of the people in the Department and worked very closely with them, but the ethos and sense in the Department is of no sympathy and no humanitarianism when it comes to this issue. I genuinely believe that it does not belong in the Department any more. I fully concur with what Senator Boyhan said. It is the height of hypocrisy for this independent Republic to go anywhere and talk to anybody else about immigration rights.What a joke. What an international joke we are to end up in the White House every year asking for something to be done for the Irish abroad when we will not regularise the undocumented here in this country on the same basis and we still have one of the most restrictive asylum systems. We are one of only two European countries which does not allow asylum seekers the right to work. It is the height of hypocrisy because no European country knows what a coffin ship is like more than the Irish; no European country knows what it is like to flee a country because of violence more than the Irish; no European country knows what it is like to flee a country because of hunger more than the Irish; and no European country has a more mean-spirited asylum system than the Irish. What I want to say on behalf of the Labour Party is that despite the fact we were involved in the original international protection Bill, and given the context at the time, we fully support this Bill. As the new Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister has the opportunity to implement the McMahon report on direct provision. It would be a stunning legacy for him to leave behind if we were finally to put paid to all of the wrongs in the system. There are 1,500 fewer people in the system long term than there were two years ago, and I understand this and great credit should be given to the House for raising the issue consistently, but I go back to the fundamental point that this issue does not belong in the Department of Justice and Equality because it is not fit for purpose to deal with it on a humanitarian basis. Its mindset is one of security and law and order and it is not one that truly understands the nature of why people must flee their country because fundamentally the Department does not trust them.
