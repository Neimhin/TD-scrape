AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the delegates for their presentation and Deputy Conaghan for his initiative in this regard.  We are discussing an issue of value judgment in education.  Much of the debate in regard to education has gone in a particular way in recent years.  As Senator O'Donnell said, we are almost reducing education to the formulation of economic units.  It is all about the jobs market and making oneself marketable.  However, the wonderful thing about education is that some subjects deserve to be taught for the intrinsic beauty they possess and the pleasure they can bring.  Music and art are examples of that.  Learning about them will not necessarily make a person more marketable when it comes to finding a job, but they have their own justification.  Unfortunately, these issues are sometimes sidelined in the context of disadvantage because there is a huge element of firefighting going in within the education system in response to numerous crises.  There can be a tendency in primary schools and among educators to relegate music, for instance, to the second tier of the curriculum.  We often see art classes being taken last thing on a Friday.How do we make arts education part of the mainstream in primary schools?  The initiative the delegates have described is fantastic, but how do we ensure that every primary school in the country has the ability to prioritise the arts?  How do we empower teachers to deliver what the delegates are delivering?  How do we deliver literacy and numeracy through the arts?  Rather than compartmentalising these subjects in certain parts of the day or week, we must seek to devise a classroom experience where the arts are so deeply knitted into how children are taught that they cannot be confined to a half an hour on a Monday or Tuesday.Have the delegates considered how there might be an engagement with the teacher training colleges in order to find new ways of prioritising the arts in the way children are taught?  Education is about preparing oneself for the workplace in some respects, but there is a whole dimension of one's life that is not carried on in the workplace.  It is about one's ability to pick up a book and read it for enjoyment's sake, to appreciate a piece of music or play an instrument, to go to the theatre and take in a play.  These are wonderful activities which are there to be enjoyed.  It is what life is all about.  I would be greatly distressed if our education debate were confined to the nuts and bolts of economic units.
