AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to the Chamber. I was shocked last week when a parent described how one of her children who has autism has not been in receipt of speech therapy since September. A principal in the locality told me that the reality on the ground is that unless a parent or a family is willing to set aside the time to scream and shout at the top of their lungs, they will not get the requisite attention from the education and health systems that their children deserve. She made the point that given that sometimes families can be collapsing trying to meet the needs of their children, to expect them to campaign as well for the assistance they so greatly need is completely unrealistic, unnecessary and unfair. We seem to have a system held together with straw. We still have an issue with maternity leave not being covered. Speech therapy is a patchwork of a service in the area that I am most familiar with on the north side of Dublin. I can only imagine what it is like around the country. What words of comfort would the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, have for the mother who spoke to me about her child, who has autism, and who has not been able to access speech therapy for her son since September?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I appreciate the detailed nature of his reply and his acceptance that it is not good enough that six children have waited for more than 12 months for an assessment. Does he concede, notwithstanding the investment that is clearly being made, that there is still a level of desperation being felt on the ground? Does he concede that there is not the connectivity between his words and the reality experienced by school principals, teachers and parents in certain parts of this city? Parents need to be in their homes to help their children through their formative years, which can be a difficult period so the last thing parents need to be are campaigners. Can he assure us that any parent whose child is in need of speech therapy will not have to wait for months for therapy to be resumed? Does he accept that a situation where maternity leave breaks that service is unacceptable?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Leader for a debate on GP care. I have received correspondence from Sutton, in my own part of the world, indicating that a GP there is now charging between €20 and €30 for blood tests. I also note the comments of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, suggesting that GP visits for children could cost between €5 and €10, which is a row back of the scheme brought in by the last Government. Even though GP care for children up to 12 years of age was provided for in the budget before the most recent general election, it has not happened yet. My worry is that free GP care is not being expanded and rolled out further. Instead, it is being curtailed, and individual GPs are making their own decisions as to how much they will charge for something as simple as a blood test. I understand that this particular GP is also encouraging people to go to Beaumont Hospital rather than provide the blood test in his own surgery. I would very much appreciate a debate on free GP care in this House. To the people of the great state of Alabama, I send congratulations from this House. They have managed to defeat one racist and homophobic sex offender and I hope the other racist, homophobic sex offender in the White House will soon have a similar fate.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Having taken on board the comments of Senator Reilly and the Cathaoirleach, I accept that it is not appropriate for a Member of this House to make the comments that I made in terms of labelling someone as a sex offender without due process. I want to withdraw my remarks and apologise for them.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move:“That Seanad Éireann:- recognises the vital role that special needs assistants (SNAs) play in Ireland's education system, providing essential support for some of the most vulnerable students in our classrooms;- acknowledges the overwhelming vote in October 2017 by over 8,000 SNAs as members of IMPACT in favour of industrial action;- regrets the failure of the Minister for Education and Skills to implement the recommendations of the Oireachtas education committee report on the role of the special needs assistants published in January 2016;- condemns the July publication of SNA allocations in 2017, which caused enormous uncertainty for SNAs;- demands that the Minister for Education and Skills guarantee that:- in future, SNA allocations will be announced in sufficient time (no later than May) to allow the supplementary assignment panel – and distribution of available hours to serving staff – operate to full effect;- arrangements will be put in place in respect of job security for SNAs;- an agreed procedure will be established for dealing with SNA grievances and issues.”I welcome the Minister to the House. On behalf of the Labour Party group, I am delighted to propose this motion in defence of the employment rights of special needs assistants. Before I do so, I acknowledge the attendance in the Visitors Gallery of members of IMPACT and some of the special needs assistants it represents very ably and with distinction. It might not be well known to many Members of this House - in fact, it might not be well known to many members of the Irish public in general - that IMPACT has balloted for industrial action out of complete frustration with the actions, or inaction, of the Department of Education and Skills. Most people would agree that when a profession such as that of special needs assistants is forced to ballot for industrial action, something has gone seriously wrong. SNAs are dedicated to the welfare of the students they work with. Anyone who has ever come across an SNA in any school in Ireland knows that this is their primary concern. When it comes to a situation where the union that represents over 8,000 SNAs feels it has to ballot for industrial action, and when 97% of those SNAs agree that industrial action is the route they feel it is necessary to pursue, then something is seriously wrong. I have some history with this issue, as do many in the Labour Party. I initiated an Oireachtas committee report on the role of the SNA in the last Oireachtas and this was completed by the then Senator Mary Moran and published in January 2016. I recall a number of years ago having a public meeting in my constituency on the issue and that meeting was stuffed out the door with people willing to tell their stories. What always comes back, and it happened again this afternoon at our briefing for all Members of the Oireachtas, whom I want to thank for attending to hear the story of SNAs, is that it is never, ever about money. Fundamentally, what SNAs are asking for is respect. We could spend hours talking about the respect or disrespect that SNAs are shown within the walls of the schools in which they work. Any SNA will tell stories they have heard or witnessed about menial tasks they have been asked to undertake, about the fact they are referred to by their first name while every other adult in the school is referred to by their second name and about the basic lack of value placed on them as professionals in an educational setting. However, we are not here to talk about that issue. We are also not here to talk about the number of SNAs in the system, which obviously was increased under the last Government and again under the Government. While that is to be welcomed, it is not the point. The point is the way that SNAs are treated by the Department of Education and Skills.Fundamentally, it comes down to the timing of the allocations. I know last week and earlier this month, it was relayed to IMPACT that that situation would change and that the allocations would be known from May next year so that SNAs can plan for September in future. That is to be welcomed but it is very late in the game for SNAs to know that and it is disappointing that they had to ballot for industrial action before they got such clarification from the Minister's Department. There is still a huge number of issues with the situation with special needs assistants. The Minister mentioned in his counter-motion that a review is being undertaken by the National Council for Special Education relating to the role of an SNA. IMPACT informed us this afternoon that it has no role, involvement or engagement in that review. It is staggering that, if the Department is to pretend that the SNA is respected, the body that represents the vast bulk of SNAs has no involvement in this review. The Minister can suggest to me that that is not the case. If it is not the case, why would senior members of IMPACT state it so categorically in an open forum this afternoon? Points were raised this afternoon which really shocked me and I thought I knew this issue inside out. The issues include SNAs at second level being asked to be on-site doing fundamentally menial tasks in June. Gardening and painting were mentioned. Just being asked to be on-site for the month of June was mentioned. That is something that anybody would find reprehensible from an employment rights perspective. They have no board of management representation. Everybody else in an educational setting has representation on the board of management. The parents and patron would have representation on the board of management but not the special needs assistants. They have no involvement with the care plan for individual students. When a care plan is put together by the school for the students who are under the care of an SNA assigned to help them during the day, the SNA is not involved in that care plan. It comes back again and again to the issue of respect. I know the Minister will not want to micromanage every school and the way every school or school principal deals with an SNA or group of SNAs in the school but leadership in education comes from the top. I suggest that leadership is sorely lacking. Another issue, which it might be suggested is small, that comes down to basic respect is the matter of bereavement leave. If one is a teacher, bereavement leave is five days whereas it is three days for an SNA. All these small things add up to SNAs believing that they are not respected, do not have security of work and cannot plan for the future or look forward to September with some kind of security of tenure. Until now, SNAs have not known if they would be back in a school in September; they wondered if they should apply for another job and considered that perhaps they should not because they might retain original positions. There is insecurity related to bills, mortgage repayments etc. that everyone has to pay. We ask the Minister to change the attitude that the Department has to special needs assistants, to acknowledge them as a vital component of our education system, to acknowledge that the special needs assistants we have, approaching 14,000, are vital in the roles that they have. They are not an add-on to the system. They are not a luxury. They need to be clearly defined. They need to be given the respect and value that they deserve at this stage. It is only fitting that the report compiled by former Senator Mary Moran would be at the top of any review mechanism that is in place.  We have a few fundamental questions. I know it is the way of things to table a counter-motion and that the Minister has spoken in his counter-motion about the number of SNAs who have been allocated and that is fine and to be welcomed. However, the employment rights and the value placed on individual SNAs is what we are speaking about today. It does not come down to the salary expectation that any SNA has. Whenever any of my Labour Party colleagues or I have a discussion with special needs assistants, money is never raised. It is always about the respect they are given from within the school and from the Department. We ask the Minister to expand on what he has said in his counter-motion with regard to the review. Will he engage with the practitioners and representatives in compiling that review? I find it incredibly frustrating when dealing with the Department that there always seems to be a review, committee or paper written by somebody else and the Department seems unwilling or unable to make a definite decision outside of having another body compile a report. There are many issues in the area of education on which we in the Labour Party group believe the Government is falling down. We have the ongoing issue of pay discrimination among primary and second level teachers which was raised again with me today. Noises from the Government are not helping with it. I received a phone call today from Councillor Mark Wall in Kildare about St. Paul's Secondary School in Monasterevin and its lack of certainty as to the progress of its school building. There are many issues with education coming down the tracks. We get action plan after action plan after action plan from the Department, yet the very good work which was compiled by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills seems to have been sitting on a shelf for almost two years. There is inaction when it comes to a cross-party, bipartisan approach to the future of the SNA. Let us get beyond the numbers of SNAs allocated by the Minister's Department because that has been acknowledged. We want to deal with the issue of respect, ensure we value special needs assistants and engage with them and their representatives in any review the Minister undertakes. We will call a vote on our motion. We are sticking with it as laid down. We reject the counter-motion and we want support for our motion from all corners of this House.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank all the Members who have spoken, particularly those who have spoken in support of the motion, Senator Robbie Gallagher from Fianna Fáil, Senator Máire Devine from Sinn Féin, Senator Grace O'Sullivan from the Green Party and the Civil Engagement group and my own colleagues, Senators Nash, Bacik and Humphreys who have laid out the reason this issue is so important. I wish to pay tribute in particular to the IMPACT trade union, representatives of which are in the Visitors Gallery. If any SNA is listening to this debate in any part of the country is not a member of a trade union, today is a good example as to why they need to join a trade union. Without the activity of IMPACT, in mobilising their members, this debate would not be happening and the Minister for Education and Skills would not be here to respond to the issues that have been raised. I thank the members of IMPACT for being present in the Visitors Gallery, for promoting the interests of special needs assistants and for continuing to do so. I take issue with some of the comments made by Government speakers. To suggest some level of surprise that an SNA has been given a menial task to undertake in a school is, as anybody who knows anything about special needs assistants, completely disconnected with the reality of what is happening in Irish primary and secondary schools. If that is a surprise to anybody, they do not know fundamentally what they are talking about. I suggest that it would be significant surprise to IMPACT to learn that it is being consulted in regard to this review because if so, it was not aware of it as late as 2 p.m. I am sure it will be surprised to learn that it is part of the consultation for this review, which we believe from the amendment to the motion will report back in March 2018.I am delighted to hear there is a SNA on the review group but that is not good enough. That is not a comprehensive review of the role of the SNA. If one is excluding members of the trade union which represents the SNAs from being on this review group or even in consulting with it in a meaningful way, I think the review is doomed to fail. However, we will give it a fair chance to report to the House. We will obviously be in the Chamber to discuss the group's report. I think everybody in this House fundamentally knows the value of the special needs assistant. SNAs do not ask for much. They do the most incredible of jobs, they empower the most vulnerable of children in our system, they give them a reason to smile and they look forward to seeing them every day. They make a connection with them on a human level, which is unparalleled. Without them many families would not be able to cope. They give the child a reason to go to school and to look forward to it. They build relationships that often last long after the child has left second level education. They are not asking for even a fraction of the world, they are not even asking for a single penny in extra salary, all they are asking for is respect and for their role to be valued. That is why so many Members of this House from different political backgrounds have looked at the motion and realised it is not a political football. We are not trying to have a go at anybody or have a political points scoring exercise. We are trying to defend the employment rights of SNAs with a trade union such as IMPACT. That is the reason that speakers from Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, the Green Party and the Civil Engagement group have seen the validity of our motion and rejected the Government counter-motion. I am quite sure that when the votes are cast, it will become a Seanad Éireann motion that shows the SNAs of this country that this House respects them. The IMPACT trade union and other trade unions that work with SNAs are working tirelessly on their behalf. It will be a good day for them to realise that the political system is backing them, that their union backs them and this House backs them. What they want from the Minister for Education and Skills is that he will back them too.
