AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We are here to discuss the proposed rationalisation of the VECs and agencies under the aegis of the Department of Education and Skills.  I welcome Mr. Martin Hanevy, assistant secretary general, Mr. Dalton Tattan, principal officer, and Mr. Matthew Ryan, principal officer of the Department of Education and Skills.Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, you are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence you are to give to this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.I now call on Mr. Hanevy to begin the briefing on the rationalisation proposals.
