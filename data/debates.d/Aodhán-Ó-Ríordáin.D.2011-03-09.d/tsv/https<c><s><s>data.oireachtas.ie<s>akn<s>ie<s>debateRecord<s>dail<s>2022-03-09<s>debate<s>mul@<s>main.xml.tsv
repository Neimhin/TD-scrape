AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We thank very much all the Deputies across the House who will support the motion and we commend the work of Senator Sherlock, who, on having examined the Government's proposals, committed to producing her own legislation, which she is now pursuing. The Government's proposals, which would require employees to wait up to 26 weeks before they could ask to work remotely and a further 12 weeks before a decision is made, that is, a full pregnancy of 38 weeks before an employee might actually be given the right, go to the heart of all workers' rights legislation in this Republic. A worker has the right to ask, but it will always be the employer's right to say "No". It feels as though the Government handed its legislation to IBEC and asked it to script it, and then presented it to the House and was surprised people would have an issue with it. We had a round-table discussion, organised by Senator Sherlock, at which we heard from Orla O'Connor of the National Women's Council of Ireland, Liam Berney of ICTU, Louise Bayliss of SPARK, Gareth Murphy of the Financial Services Union, Fleachta Phelan of the Disability Federation of Ireland, and Alan Eustace, all of whom argued that we need to grasp this opportunity that has been presented to us during the pandemic. We are not suggesting a young worker will not want to go into the workplace. I can appreciate that somebody who is starting out in life may have housing or accommodation difficulties whereby working from home may not really be an option for him or her, given that person may not wish to grasp the opportunity of working at the end of the bed, for example. If, however, a worker in good faith has the opportunity to work from home, why do we once again have to place all the power in the hands of the employer? It is as though there is a lack of trust at the heart of Irish legislation such that the worker will always try not to be honest. If we are honest with ourselves as a legislative body, however, we will appreciate that the productivity of the worker would improve if he or she did not have to run on this treadmill of traffic congestion and rush and push in the morning and of having to deal with childcare arrangements. Indeed, this is a gender equality issue, given it will encourage more women into the workplace and to seek empowerment there too. Furthermore, it goes hand in hand with the right to switch off. It cannot be that in Irish workplaces, whether at home or in the traditional work setting, workers must be constantly contactable, whereby they do not have the right to switch off and are expected to receive a message or email at any hour of the day or night. We are trying to expose the fact that what the Government has brought forward in this right to flexible working legislation is actually the right of an employer to say "No". There are 38 weeks before a worker can get a decision. The reasons for refusal are so wide as to make the workers powerless. In good faith the Labour Party has been working assiduously on this. Senator Sherlock, as our workers' rights spokesperson, has been drafting legislation. She had correctly pointed out the issues in the legislation. A number of weeks ago, the Tánaiste told me some employers were not happy with the Bill either. It is quite clear nobody on either side, workers or employers, is necessarily impressed with the Government's legislation. We cannot have a situation where somebody has to wait 26 weeks before applying to work remotely. We cannot have a ridiculous situation where people have to wait 12 weeks to get an answer. We cannot have the employers' rights of refusal to be so broad as to make the legislation worthless. As my colleague Deputy Sherlock has said, it is a gender equality issue and it is a workers' rights issue. It is about taking from the pandemic all we have learned and bringing it into the mainstream of the workplace and workers' rights. I hope the Taoiseach and representatives from the Government might listen to this. My greatest regret of ten years ago at the time of the previous crisis is that we did not learn enough from the financial collapse and build a more robust economy on the basis of workers' rights and human interaction. Having learned from what happened in the pandemic, we have an opportunity to do things much better. This is why we have tabled the motion. We do not want the Government just to support the motion; we want it to work on it and make the legislation better.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will speak of Ukrainian children who may come into our education system. A child coming to a new country, walking into a classroom and not understanding what anybody is saying faces a particularly difficult experience, especially if that child has run for his or her life. Children of Ukrainian-Irish families and children of a Russian background in our school system will also need support. Will the Taoiseach speak to those families and to the Government's intention to provide every support possible to Ukrainian and Russian children currently in our education system, those who may be coming into the system and to those teachers, SNAs and school communities who will be working with these families? Will he give an assurance that no resources will be spared to ensure their experience in the education system is empowering?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to disapply at separate future dates, in relation to recognised primary and post-primary schools, the exemption provided by certain enactments from the prohibition against discrimination on the gender ground in educational establishments, and to provide for connected matters.I thank my Labour Party colleagues for co-signing this Bill, which provides for all schools in receipt of State funding and recognised by the Department of Education to reflect society outside the school gate, which they serve. We have an unusual scenario in Ireland whereby 17% of Irish primary school children attend single-gender schools. At second level that figure is 30%. Since 1998, the Department of Education has not given sanction or recognition to a new single-gender school. Effectively, for the past 25 years the Department has decided we should be moving towards a co-educational model.It is strange to me, therefore, and I expect to anybody who comes to this country from elsewhere, that we are so obsessed with separating children. We love separating them on the basis of religion, gender and income. If we really are serious about our education system, there are a number of issues we must consider. We have to look at equality in education, eradicate illiteracy, end educational disadvantage and make education entirely free. We also need to get rid of the legacy issues in the Irish education system, including why we consider it so important that boys go through one gate and girls through another. It does not stand up to any analysis anywhere internationally that such separation is good for children or society. In my constituency, in places like Raheny and Marino, for example, parents are beginning to ask strong questions as to why their children need to be separated for school, with one gate for the boys and another for the girls. I see strong young women in Maryfield College in Drumcondra who are standing up against this old-fashioned, outdated practice of demanding girls wear skirts to school. They have managed to change the uniform practice in their school. It is time for the State to lay out a vision that all children and young people should go to the same schools and that we do away with outdated gender stereotypes. There is no reason why girls need to go to one school and boys to another. On that basis, our Bill proposes that, over a ten-year period, we get rid of the single-gender legacy issue for primary schools. We are trying to be as reasonable as we possibly can in providing for a period of ten years to make the change. We recognise that conversations are needed in school communities and between patron bodies. We acknowledge that the Department of Education has to lead this charge. After ten years, however, it is our vision that every primary school in the State will be co-educational. In addition, after 15 years, we want every second level school in the country that is in receipt of State funding and recognition from the Department of Education to be co-educational. If we are serious about gender equality, this seems to be the only area of Irish public policy about which we never speak. We talk about gender equality in sport, politics, the media and business, but our education system is separated on the basis of gender to a degree that is unparalleled outside of the Arab world and we seem never to want to tackle it properly. We are trying to be as practical and reasonable as possible in our proposals in this Bill. There is no justifiable reason to contrive a scenario where all the boys go through one gate and all the girls through another. It does not stand up any more. Let us have an education system that is truly reflective of the society outside the school doors. Let us believe in gender equality. If we pass this legislation, we will be in a position, after ten years, to ensure all our primary schools are co-educational and the same for all secondary schools after 15 years. Our education system will then properly reflect the society it tries to serve, which is a co-educational society in which there is gender equality.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move: "That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time."
