AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the delegates.  It is great to hear of the great work they are doing and to learn about the marching tradition.  I have family in Cavan and Monaghan, where bands and parading are more common than in Dublin.  People where I am from, Dublin, regard the whole marching practice as a complete and total oddity.  That is not a reference to either side of the community.  From an outside perspective, it seems to be a very strange tradition.  It is one about which people from my area need to learn more.From an outsider's perspective, I have always assumed we were dealing with two minorities in Northern Ireland, a nationalist minority within Northern Ireland and a Unionist minority within the wider all-Ireland context.  Both minorities have insecurities, and culture they feel they must celebrate and promote.  I understand that.Let me consider the profile of the areas in which the delegates work.  I always make this point because many of the images I saw from the flashpoint areas, such as those from the early summer or those from London, are similar to those from the very disadvantaged area of the inner city where I used to teach.  I refer to disaffected, disempowered young people looking for something to get excited about and to become empowered by.  Is the problem essentially one that arises in poorer or working-class areas?  While we are dealing with sectarianism and people's desire to reinforce a culture they feel may be under threat, is poverty not a central element of the problem?As the Parades Commission deals with various communities, is it potentially dangerous to designate them as Nationalist or Unionist, albeit unintentionally?  Is the commission very aware of this?  While integration and mutual understanding are very important in the longer term, do the delegates find themselves being very careful not to regard a particular area as having a certain religious or cultural background, which practice would effectively stigmatise that area and make any sort of religious or cultural tolerance almost impossible?I congratulate the commission on its work.  There is much more for us to learn.  I will be interested in the delegates' work over the next ten years as the anniversaries occur.  I was very taken by a documentary I saw on the beginning of the Troubles.  It showed how the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising began to stir emotions on either side of the divide.  This was one of a range of events in this regard in the mid-1960s.  Are the delegates keenly aware of this and of the importance and power of such occurrences?We very much appreciate the delegates' attendance and certainly learned a great deal from their presentation.
