AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I wish to raise an issue of concern to many people across Dublin in relation to schools selling off their lands and the resultant impact on local communities. I understand from this morning's newspaper and a conversation I had with Councillor Deirdre Kingston of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council that Clonkeen College, a Christian Brothers school, has sold its land. This is of huge disappointment to the local community because there has been significant State investment in the school, including an upgrade of the playing pitches that are now to be lost to the local community as a result of the school's decision to sell. Two schools in my constituency have made similar decisions. St. Paul's College, Raheny, was given land by Dublin City Council in the 1950s on the understanding that it be kept for recreational use but that land was sold to a developer several years ago, and St. Mary's Holy Faith, Killester, is currently selling its lands. It is disappointing that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, is taking a hands-off approach to this issue. Even though the State has invested money in these schools and had a relationship with them, he does not seem to have any interest in getting involved or commenting on the fact that local communities are losing facilities in the schools. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House when he is available and it is appropriate in order for the issue to be discussed because if there are two schools in my constituency and one school in Councillor Deirdre Kingston's constituency in which this has happened in a very short period of time, I am quite sure that every area of the country will have a similar problem in the months and years to come. I would appreciate if the Leader could facilitate that debate. On a lighter note, I wish two journalists from TV3 the very best in their retirement. To hear that Vincent Browne is to retire from his role as the presenter of "Tonight with Vincent Browne" is a little like hearing of the retirement of a teacher who used to give one detention all the time. There is the same emotion that he is moving on and a guarded regard for the fact that even though there were battles, one will be sad to see him go. I also want to acknowledge Ursula Halligan, who has announced that she is to leave TV3. My greatest memory of Ursula was not necessarily a journalistic one, although I do remember she forced Deputy Enda Kenny to trip over a flower pot while asking him how strongly he felt about the marriage equality issue. I also remember an incredible article she wrote that was published in The Irish Times. I vividly remember sitting outside a gym at around 7 a.m., reading online her article about her life, sexuality and journey to the realisation of who she was and openly weeping, touching my face and feeling tears coming down my cheeks as I read her words. It was a very powerful statement and she stepped outside the journalistic sphere for that referendum. What she did that week touched the hearts of a huge number of people in Ireland. I wish to acknowledge that she has moved on from her position in TV3 and wish her all the best for the future.
