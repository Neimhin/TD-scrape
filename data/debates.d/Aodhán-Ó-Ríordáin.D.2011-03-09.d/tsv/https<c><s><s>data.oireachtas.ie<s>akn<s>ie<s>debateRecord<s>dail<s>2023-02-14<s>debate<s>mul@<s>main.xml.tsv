AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister the reason students who have previously sat a year in a different course were excluded from the €1,000 discount on third levels fees when they are subject to the same cost of living pressures as everyone else.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I very much appreciate the comments of the Minister on the former Minister, Niamh Breathnach. I know her family will as well. One of the radical things she did as Minister for Education was to abolish fees, something from which I benefited, as did many of my colleagues and friends. The debate was lost over the previous 25 years when registration fees crept up. People are now spending thousands of euro a year on fees. Be that as it may, we are talking about a small cohort of students. It was a welcome measure. I know there is frustration in government that when something is announced there will always be a member of the Opposition who will say it is all very well but it should be tweaked more and the focus is on the negative. What the Minister did was welcome and things are going in the right direction. The Minister is making all of the right noises in terms of reducing third level fees to where they were 25 years ago. Does the Minister not feel that an additional measure or gesture could be made from Government to reduce the fees of a small cohort of students by €1,000, in line with everybody else?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Over a period we want to achieve, at all levels of education, be it primary, secondary, third level and further education, a situation whereby nobody has to consider costs when it comes to furthering their education journey. It should never come into the conversation. It is depressing that people always have to think about the cost of education to a family when it should instead be about trying to fulfil their potential. However, when there is a price tag attached and question marks over whether a family or individual can reach that price, we have failed collectively. If he cannot address this now, can the Minister ensure in the next budget recycle, as we move towards a new announcement in September, that all of the loopholes will be dealt with and this cohort of students will benefit? If the Minister could not do it this time, can he commit to reviewing the current system in order that students who start first year again can be included in a further scheme?
