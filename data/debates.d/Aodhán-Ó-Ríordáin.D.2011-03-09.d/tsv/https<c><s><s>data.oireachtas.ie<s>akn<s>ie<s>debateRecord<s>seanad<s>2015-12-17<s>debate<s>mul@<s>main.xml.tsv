AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	Ba mhaith liom i dtús buíochas a ghbháil leis an Seanadóir as ucht an t-ábhar tábhachtach seo a chur ar an gclár díospóireachta. Is fíor go bhfuil cúraimí Gaeltachta agus oileán leagtha ar an Aire Stáit sa Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta.Cuireann an Roinn fóirdheontas ar fáil chun seirbhísí iompair a chur ar fáil chuig na hoileáin a bhfuil cónaí orthu thart timpeall an chósta. Tá na seirbhísí seo comhdhéanta de sheirbhísi farantóireachta paisinéara agus lastais. In theannta sin, tugann an Roinn fóirdheontas chun seirbhís aeir a chur ar fáil chuig na trí Oileán Árann, ar a n-áirítear Inis Mór, faoi chonradh oibleagáid sheirbhís phoiblí, nó PSO, mar a deir an Seanadóir féin. Mar chuid de seo, cuireann an Roinn cúnamh ar fáil don seirbhís bainistíochta do na haeradróim atá lonnaithe ar na hoileáin. San iomlán, tá seirbhísí taistil fóirdheonaithe á maoiniú ag an Roinn do 19 oileán i nDún na nGall, Maigh Eo, i nGaillimh agus i gCorcaigh. Cinntíonn an tacaíocht sin go mbíonn córas taistil sábháilte rialta ar fáil do na hoileáin don bhliain iomlán. Leis an gcúnamh sin bíonn feabhas ar chaighdeán maireachtála na n-oileánach a thacaíonn le pobail inmharthana agus a chuidíonn le turasóireacht. Anuas ar an méid sin, tá an Roinn, ó nios luaithe i mbliana, ag maoiniú na struchtúir bhainistíochta ar na hoileáin neamh-Ghaeltachta. Bhí buiséad de €5.9 milliún ar fáil don Roinn sa bhliain 2015 le caitheamh ar chúrsaí taistil do na hoileáin. Meabhraím don Seanadóir agus don Teach gur caitheadh 57% den bhuiséad sin ar sheirbhísí iompair do na hOileáin Árann. Maidir le hÁrainn, nó Inis Mór, tháinig deireadh leis an gconradh farantóireachta paisinéirí don oileán sin ar 31 Eanáir 2013. Chuaigh mo Roinn i mbun phróiseas tairisceana poiblí sa ghnáthshlí, chun conradh nua cúig bliana suas go dtí an 31 Eanáir 2018 a aontú. Ní bhfuair an Roinn aon tairiscint i leith na seirbhíse laistigh den sprioc-am, áfach. In éagmais tairisceana, bhí comhráití idir oifigigh na Roinne agus an farantóir a bhí ag cur na seirbhíse ar fáil, chun plé a dhéanamh ar an bhféidearthacht teacht ar réiteach chun conradh nua a aontú ar na téarmaí céanna is a bhí sa chonradh roimhe sin. Faraor, níor éirigh leis na comhráití sin mar nach bhféadfadh an Roinn géilleadh d’éilimh an fharantóra go mbeadh ardú substaintiúil ar an bhfóirdheontas ar sheirbhís atá, de réir cosúlachta, eacnamaíoch gan fóirdheontas. Pé scéal é, lean an farantóir ar aghaidh ag cur na seirbhíse ar fáil ag an am. Ansin sa bhliain 2014, bhí sé ráite ag an bhfarantóir céanna nach mbeadh aon rogha aige ach éirí as an tseirbhís a chur ar fáil ó Shamhain 2014 mar bhí caillteanas á dhéanamh ag an gcuideachta agus ní fhéadfaí Ieanúint ar aghaidh. Chinn an Roinn go mb'fhearr tairiscintí poibli a lorg sa ghnáthbhealach do chonradh níos faide a thiocfadh chun críoch ar an 31 Deireadh Fómhair 2017, an t-am céanna a chríochnódh an conradh le Aran Ferries Teo do sheirbhís Inis Meáin agus Inis Oirr. Fuarthas tairiscint amháin ó Aran Ferries Teo. Cuireadh coiste le chéile chun measúnú a dhéanamh ar an tairiscint sin. Bhí cruinniú idir an Roinn agus an comhlacht ar 22 Deireadh Fómhair 2014 mar chuid den idirbheartaíocht agus tar éis go leor plé rinne siad féin cinneadh go bhfágfaí rudaí mar a bhí, gan aon chonradh leis an Roinn, agus go leanfadh Aran Ferries Teo ag cur na seírbhíse ar fáil tríd an ngeimhreadh chomh maith leis an samhradh. Tuigtear dom go bhfuil an farantóir sásta Ieanúint leis an tseirbhís bhliantúil i gcónaí ag an mhinicíocht chéanna gan fóirdheontas ón Roinn. Tá éisteacht tugtha ag an Roinn don chuideachta agus tuigim go bhfuil an deacracht atá ann faoi Iáthair ag eascairt as na fodhlíthe até le cur i bhfeidhm ag Comhairle Contae na Galllimhe. Ba mhaith liom a shoiléiriú don Seanadóir go bhfuiI an tAire oscailte d’aon chéim réasúnta a thógáil a chuideodh le réiteach a fháil ar an gceist ata ardaithe aige. Tuigim nach bhfuil an farantóir ag éileamh fhóirdheontais ón Roinn ach go bhfuil sé ráite aige nach mbeidh sé in ann seirbhís a chur ar fáil sa gheimhreadh má chuirtear na fodhlíthe i bhfeidhm. Is léir don Aire mar sin go mbaineann an cheist áirithe atá faoi chaibidil ag an Seanadóir le Comhairle Contae na Gaillimhe agus an farantóir. É sin réite tá an tAire Stáit le freagracht as na hoileáin, sásta tathant ar na páirtithe leasmhara éagsúla teacht le chéile chun a chinntiú go leanfar leis an tseirbhís farantóireachta chuig Árainn. Is féidir liom a chinntiú don Seanadóir go leanfar le gach iarracht chun a chinntiú go mbeidh seirbhis farantóireacht rialta do phaisinéirí chuig an oileán i rith na bliana agus go bhfuil an Roinn ar fáil aon am le haghaidh comhráití.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir as an méid sin. Tá sé ag iarraidh a rá go gcaithfimid a bheith réasúnta agus níl i gceist anseo ach cruinniú a shocrú idir na páirtithe uilig. Labhróidh mé leis an Aire Stáit. Dar liom féin, is plean réasúnta é sin ar bhealach agus b'fhéidir gur chóir dúinn dul síos an bhealach sin. Beidh mé ag caint leis an Aire Stáit agus inseoidh mé dó an méid a bhí le rá ag an Seanadóir.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	As the Senator is aware, the Government approved the publication of the heads and general scheme of the adoption (information and tracing) Bill 2015 last July. The Bill is intended to facilitate access to adoption information and operates on the basis of presumption in favour of disclosing information in so far as is legally and constitutionally possible. The Bill will, for the first time, provide a statutory basis for the provision of information related to both past and future adoptions. It will provide clarity around the information that can be provided and the circumstances in which it can be provided. Efforts have been ongoing for many years to address the issues related to the provision of a statutory entitlement to identity information, in particular an original birth certificate to adopted persons. The overall policy objective in bringing forward proposed legislation on adoption information and tracing has always been to provide access to as much information as possible to adopted persons. The adoption (information and tracing) Bill 2015 provides that where an adoption was effected prior to the commencement of the Bill, the information required to apply for a birth certificate will be provided for an adopted person when he or she has signed a statutory declaration agreeing to respect the privacy of their birth parent and not to contact their birth parent or ask anyone else to make contact on his or her behalf. There will be no requirement for an adopted person to sign a statutory declaration where birth parents have indicated a preference for contact or have consented to the release of the information or where it is established that the birth parents are deceased. The Bill also provides that where an adoption is effected after the commencement of the Bill, an adopted person will be entitled to their his or her certificate once he or she is aged 18 years or over. The Bill also provides that the Adoption Authority of Ireland will be responsible for collecting, restoring, preserving and the safekeeping of adoption records, including information on informal adoptions and persons whose birth was incorrectly registered. It will set out the information that must be retained by the authority for future adoptions and, in so far as it is available, for past adoptions, persons whose adoption is registered in the register of inter-country adoptions, informal adoptions and incorrect birth registrations Persons who were the subject of incorrect birth registrations will be given access to service provision. The Bill was referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for pre-legislative scrutiny and the committee published its report recently. The committee’s key recommendations were that the definition of "compelling reasons" be further clarified and more tightly defined in the Bill. In cases where non-disclosure is sought citing compelling reasons, this should be supported by medical evidence. Consideration should be given to excluding the statutory declaration provision from the Bill. This could possibly be replaced by an alternative provision where the applicant is required, before the birth certificate is released, to attend one preparatory session to discuss and explore the issues concerning privacy and respect. Consideration should be given to reducing the lead-in to a much shorter time period and to holding a shorter, more intense information awareness campaign over a six-month period, to include engagement with social media and a wide range of community groups which can help to raise awareness about the new register. In the case of the illegally adopted, consideration should be given to establishing a dedicated unit to investigate those cases actively and a review of service requirements arising from the Bill should be undertaken. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, welcomes the report of the Oireachtas committee and believes it is a valuable contribution to the debate on this important Bill. He has examined the recommendations of the committee very carefully and will shortly finalise the Bill in the light of the committee’s recommendations. The heads will be submitted to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel very shortly with a request to draft the Bill as a matter of urgency. In view of the size and complexity of the Bill, the Minister does not want to offer any guarantee about how quickly it can be finalised. However, he wishes to assure the Senator that he will work closely with the Attorney General to facilitate the Bill's completion as soon as possible.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the Senator's commitment to this issue and her own personal connection with it. I will endeavour to discuss the issue with the Minister, Deputy James Reilly. I am sure that whatever progress can be made on the Bill before the ending of the term of Parliament will be made.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who regrets that she cannot be here, I am very pleased to present the Bankruptcy (Amendment) Bill to the House and look forward to hearing Senators' contributions. It is a very significant reforming Bill, and I will highlight its main objectives. The Bill proposes three key changes to bankruptcy law in Ireland, as follows: the normal duration of bankruptcy is reduced from three years to one year; the normal duration of a bankruptcy payment order - the payments a court may direct the bankrupt person to make towards his or her creditors - is reduced from five years to three years; and a bankrupt person's legal interest in his or her home will, in general, transfer back to him or her automatically three years after bankruptcy adjudication, if the official assignee in bankruptcy has not taken steps to sell it before that date. These are important changes. They recognise that bankruptcy is not an easy option and that the large majority of bankrupt people never intended to end up in bankruptcy and have already co-operated in an open manner with the bankruptcy process and handed over their income and assets towards repayment of their debts. For these people, the reforms contained in this Bill offer a second chance. They will be able to exit bankruptcy and return to normal economic activity much more quickly, in line with the position in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is good for them and the economy. The Bill ensures significant sanctions to deter and penalise anyone who tries to abuse the bankruptcy process or to conceal his or her income or assets from creditors. In such cases, the High Court will retain the power to extend the bankruptcy term to up to eight years, and to extend the duration of a bankruptcy payment order to up to five years. A new provision will allow the High Court to extend the bankruptcy term to up to 15 years, where it is satisfied that there has been particularly serious non-co-operation or concealment. The Bill modernises key aspects of bankruptcy procedures. It will achieve the following: abolish the outdated requirement for an extra High Court hearing, the so-called statutory sitting, in all bankruptcy cases; enable the official assignee to disclaim onerous properties, which would effectively impose net costs on the taxpayer; and ensure that the official assignee has clear powers to demand and investigate electronic records relating to a bankrupt's assets and affairs. While these changes are procedural, they are, nevertheless, vital, given that they will remove unnecessary costs and delays, free up court time and resources and allow more efficient and effective bankruptcy administration. The Bill provides for appropriate transitional arrangements; therefore, people already in bankruptcy will also get the benefit of these reforms subject, at maximum, to a six-month transitional period. The Minister for Justice and Equality has already acknowledged in the Dáil two major contributions to the thinking behind this Bill. One was the Private Members' Bill, sponsored by Deputy Willie Penrose, which was published in March this year and the provisions of which have been incorporated into this Bill, subject to some necessary amendments. The other was the report on bankruptcy reform by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which was undertaken last summer at the Minister's request. The joint committee held a public consultation and examined over 100 submissions before providing the Minister with its report in July which, likewise, recommended reducing the bankruptcy term to one year. The Minister wishes to again express her appreciation to the joint committee for its extensive work, as well as the Oireachtas joint committee on finance and the many stakeholders and individuals who made valuable submissions. The Bill to reform bankruptcy law will not operate in isolation, but will complement the significant reforms the Minister has already introduced to personal insolvency law, with the enactment earlier this year of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act and the commencement in recent weeks of its new independent court review of the so-called “bank veto”, where creditors reject a personal insolvency proposal. A number of review cases have already been lodged with the courts. The Government has also taken important steps in recent months to reduce costs and increase accessibility of insolvency and bankruptcy procedures. This includes the Minister's decision to waive court and insolvency service fees for insolvency cases, and to substantially reduce bankruptcy costs. It also includes the implementation of a nationwide network of dedicated mortgage arrears services in Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS, centres. MABS and the Insolvency Service of Ireland, with the co-operation of the Courts Service, are already ensuring a presence at all Circuit Court hearings around the country for repossession, to provide information and support for those in mortgage arrears on their homes. This is a very important initiative. On behalf of the Minister, I urge anyone worried about debts, particularly anyone at risk of repossession, to contact MABS which will put them in touch with the help they need. I will outline the thematic provisions of the Bill. Under section 10(a) of the Bill, the normal duration of bankruptcy will be reduced from three years to one year, as recommended by the joint committee in its report. This will also correspond to the position in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The joint committee report expressed concern that reducing the bankruptcy term should not benefit bankruptcies which appeared to be deliberate or fraudulent. The Bill responds to this concern by retaining provision for a considerably longer bankruptcy term of up to eight years where the court is satisfied that the bankrupt is not co-operating with the bankruptcy, or has tried to conceal assets or income. The Bill also allows for longer extension in particularly serious cases of non-co-operation or concealment. Bankruptcy payment orders are court orders made on the application of the official assignee which require a bankrupt to make payments for the benefit of his or her creditors from any surplus income or assets after reasonable living expenses for the bankrupt and any dependant. Section 12 will reduce the normal maximum duration of a bankruptcy payment order from five years to three years. However, the maximum five-year duration will still apply in cases where the court is satisfied that the bankrupt has not co-operated with the bankruptcy, or has tried to conceal assets or income. When a person becomes bankrupt, his or her interest in any property he or she owns, including his or her home, passes automatically to the official assignee, whose duty is to sell it, if feasible, to repay creditors. Section 61 of the Bankruptcy Act protects any spouse or civil partner of the bankrupt, by requiring the official assignee to apply to court for leave to sell the home if it is a family home under the Family Home Protection Act 1976, or a shared home under the Civil Partnership Act 2010. The official assignee will try to dispose of the bankrupt's interest in the property, preferably to the spouse or civil partner. However, in many cases, and particularly where the property is in negative equity, no purchaser can be found. Section 10(c) of the Bill proposes a practical solution in such cases, by providing that the bankrupt's interest in the home will automatically revest in him or her three years after the bankruptcy adjudication, unless the court orders otherwise, the bankrupt and the official assignee agree otherwise, or the official assignee has sold it or applied for a court order authorising sale before that date. A similar provision already applies in England and Wales. This applies to the bankrupt's home at the date of bankruptcy adjudication, whether it is his or her family home, shared civil partnership home, or principal private residence as a single person. This will also allow for more efficient and cost-effective administration of bankruptcy cases, particularly those with very limited resources. Given that the bankrupt's interest in his or her home remains subject to any mortgage, the position of the mortgage lender is not affected. The Bill introduces at section 11 a new power for the court to extend the bankruptcy term up to a total of 15 years on application by the official assignee, where the court considers it just to do so in cases of particularly serious non-co-operation or concealment by the bankrupt. This arises because a relatively small number of bankruptcy cases feature particularly serious and flagrant levels of such conduct by the bankrupt, for which there is currently no adequate deterrent. The new 15-year maximum term is modelled on the approach in the United States and the United Kingdom. In the USA a bankrupt's debts are only discharged if he or she has co-operated with the bankruptcy trustee, which is equivalent to our official assignee. In the United Kingdom legislation allows the bankrupt to remain subject to a bankruptcy restriction order in cases of non-co-operation, which continues bankruptcy restrictions for up to 15 years. Section 4 will abolish the requirement under the Bankruptcy Act to hold an additional sitting of the High Court in every bankruptcy case some weeks after adjudication, which must be attended by the bankrupt, the creditors and the official assignee. The original purposes of the statutory sitting are now superseded. It is widely seen as an outdated formality which is a major strain on court resources. It also creates unnecessary legal costs and workload for creditors and the official assignee and further stress to debtors who are largely unrepresented and have already gone through a public adjudication hearing. Its abolition will free up considerable time for the courts and the official assignee and will also benefit the parties involved. Sections 6, 7, and 15 will clarify the wording of several provisions in the Bankruptcy Act to put it beyond doubt that electronic as well as paper records are covered by the powers of the court or the official assignee to demand accounts and records for the purposes of investigating a bankrupt's affairs. This is important to assist the official assignee in investigating a small number of high-asset cases in which a bankrupt may have concealed assets. The next item is the power of the official assignee to disclaim onerous assets, which is an important provision. Section 8 will allow the official assignee effective power to refuse to accept responsibility for any property of the bankrupt which is likely to generate substantial costs and where there are no funds in the bankruptcy estate to cover these costs. When the official assignee takes over a bankrupt's property, he or she becomes legally responsible for any costs and liabilities arising from it. These can include unpaid rates, property tax, management charges, essential repairs, ongoing security and insurance for properties which may not be generating any revenue. At the same time, the official assignee has no power to compel any contribution from the secured lender who is entitled to receive any proceeds from the sale of these properties. Consequently, these costs risk being imposed on the State and the taxpayer. The current provision for disclaim in the Bankruptcy Act effectively only applies to liabilities arising under a lease, which does not cover the many types of liability mentioned above. In the United Kingdom this problem was addressed by the Insolvency Act 1986, which gives the official assignee a broad power to disclaim any onerous property. It means that such costs are, more appropriately, the responsibility of the secured creditor who will receive the benefit of the property concerned. The proposed amendment in the Bill follows the same approach. It will generate considerable savings for the State and the taxpayer, as well as improving the overall efficiency of bankruptcy administration.
In terms of transitional arrangements, any bankruptcy already existing when the Bill comes into effect will also benefit from the changes introduced by this Bill, subject to a six-month transitional period. This reflects the six-month transition period that was provided previously when the bankruptcy term was reduced from 12 years to three by the Personal Insolvency Act 2012. It is needed to ensure a smooth transition and to enable the official assignee to make any necessary applications to the court for extension of time in cases which raise issues of non-co-operation or attempted concealment. Under the transitional provisions and assuming that there are no grounds for extension, the following occurs. First, an existing bankruptcy which is to terminate three years after adjudication and is due to terminate less than six months after the commencement date of the Bill will terminate on its due date. Other existing bankruptcies will now terminate one year after adjudication or six months after commencement, if that is the later date. Second, an existing bankruptcy payment order due to expire five years after it was made by the court, if it is already due to expire less than six months after the commencement date, will terminate on its due date. Other existing bankruptcy payment orders will now expire three years after they were made or six months after commencement, if that is a later date. The provision for re-vesting of the bankrupt's interest in his or her home applies to a bankruptcy at the date the Bill comes into effect. Re-vesting would take place, subject to the exceptions that I have already outlined, either on the third anniversary of adjudication or six months after the commencement date, whichever is the later. I will briefly mention the specific provisions of the Bill. The technical content and effect of each section is set out in the Explanatory Memorandum.
 Sections 3 to 5, inclusive, abolish the mandatory requirement for a statutory sitting. They replace references to the statutory sitting in other sections of the Bankruptcy Act. Sections 6 and 7 amend sections 19 and 21 of the Bankruptcy Act. They clarify that the powers of the official assignee and the High Court to require the production of a bankrupt person's accounts and records extend to electronic records. Section 8 is the provision for the official assignee to disclaim onerous properties. Section 9 clarifies section 61 of the Bankruptcy Act regarding the protection of a family home under the Family Home Protection Act or a shared home under the Civil Partnership Act 2010. These changes will aid the interpretation of section 10 of the Bill regarding the re-vesting of the bankrupt's home. Section 10 contains the important provision for reduction of the bankruptcy term and re-vesting of the bankrupt person's home with the relevant transitional arrangements. Section 11 provides the new power for the court to extend the bankruptcy term for up to 15 years in cases of particularly serious non co-operation or concealment. Section 12 reduces the normal duration of a bankruptcy payment order from five years to three years, with the relevant transitional arrangements. If the court is satisfied that there has been non-co-operation or concealment by the bankrupt, however, the maximum duration remains at five years. Sections 13 and 14 are consequential amendments and both replace references to the statutory sitting. Section 15 is a further amendment to clarify that electronic records are included in section 123 of the Bankruptcy Act, which provides that it is an offence for a bankrupt person to withhold, conceal or falsify records of their affairs. As every Senator in this House is aware, the background to the economic crisis means that those now entering bankruptcy, or already in bankruptcy, have already struggled with unsustainable debt and managed on very restricted incomes for several years. The measures in the Bill will provide the people concerned with a much-needed light at the end of the tunnel and an earlier return to normal economic activity. As the Small Firms Association underlined in its submission to the joint committee's bankruptcy review, reducing the term to one year will, in particular, provide that vital second chance for a small entrepreneur to restart in business. At the same time, the Bill includes strong provisions to ensure that any bankrupt person who tries to conceal his or her resources from creditors or evade his or her obligations will end up with a longer bankruptcy term and a longer bankruptcy payment order. The Bill makes important changes to modernise bankruptcy procedures, reduce unnecessary costs and ensure the official assignee has effective powers to focus on the small minority of bankruptcies in which there may be issues of fraud and concealment. The Bill is a further example of the Government's commitment to bringing forward reforms to ensure a more enlightened, less punitive and less costly approach to addressing intractable debt, and a fair balance between the interests of debtors and creditors. I commend the Bill to the House.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank Senators for their interest in the Bill and for their contributions to the debate. This is a significant, reforming Bill which will complement the reforms already introduced to personal insolvency legislation. The most important element of the legislation is the reduction of the bankruptcy term from three years to one year, a fundamental change which follows the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality as well as the efforts of my party colleague, Deputy Willie Penrose. This will ease the impact of bankruptcy on people who have already been struggling with unsustainable debt and living on very reduced incomes for several years. The provision for revesting the family home, if steps have not been taken for its sale within three years of bankruptcy, is another practical and humane solution. At this stage, a bankrupt would normally be discharged from bankruptcy and cleared of any unsecured debts which can help in making mortgage repayments more affordable.The High Court's new power to extend the bankruptcy term to 15 years in serious cases of non-co-operation or concealment of assets is significant and will address the small minority of situations where a bankrupt person seeks to hide assets or income from creditors. Another very important change is the new power for the official assignee to disclaim properties to avoid a situation where standing liabilities must be borne by the taxpayer when any proceeds of sale are retained by secured creditors. There are also the traditional provisions which ensure people already in bankruptcy can benefit directly from the changes introduced by the Bill with a transitional period of up to six months. It is essential to underline that bankruptcy is never an easy option and is not the right solution for everyone. Bankruptcy does not wipe out mortgage arrears. Personal insolvency solutions may work better for some households which is the reason section 14 of the Bankruptcy Act requires the High Court to consider whether a personal insolvency solution would be more appropriate to a debtor's circumstances before agreeing to the application to be adjudged bankrupt. Senator Aideen Hayden asked about personal insolvency reviews. The court review contains an express provision exempting a case from the requirement to show consent of a class of creditor if there is only one creditor. This is an important features of the review. Where there is only one creditor, the court passes directly to considering the fairness criteria of the review and does not need proof of consent from one class of creditor. I appreciate Senator Averil Power's support of the Bill. As I indicated earlier, with regard to her question on the transitional arrangements and the risk of backlogs, the Bill will put in place arrangements for a smooth transition for all existing bankruptcies. The official assignee and the insolvency service have been fully consulted on the transitional arrangements and we are satisfied the provisions of the Bill are manageable. Additional measures in the Bill to reform and streamline bankruptcy procedures will also free up resources in the courts and for the official assignee and will further ensure no backlogs arise. Senator Paschal Mooney raised a number of issues, but he is no longer in the House.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I apologise. How dare I suggest he is no longer in the House and that he is no longer interested in the debate?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I know what that feels like. On the points Senator Paschal Mooney raised and the statistics he quoted on those in bankruptcy losing their family homes, a small study was carried out by official assignees in respect of initial cases in bankruptcy. It is important to note many of the families had surrendered their homes to the banks before they entered bankruptcy. Certainly, personal insolvency solutions protect the family home better than bankruptcy. The Government has always emphasised the home is at risk in bankruptcy but the 70% statistic needs to be seen in context and may overstate the risks. With regard to measures taken on mortgage arrears, there is a decline in mortgage arrears exceeding 90 and 180 days, which is to be welcomed. The most serious category of home mortgage arrears are those which exceed two years, and while arrears remain far higher than we would wish to see there is a clear positive trend. This group of arrears has stopped increasing and the latest quarterly statistics show even the most difficult category of arrears is reducing, which is a welcome indicator. I accept the points made to the effect that more needs to be done. I appreciate the efforts of individual Senators and Deputies and thank Senators for their contributions. The Bill is a very important and far-reaching reforming legislation. It is well balanced and will bring immediate practical advantages to many households which have gone through some very dark and difficult years. I welcome the general support of the Bill expressed by Senators. I again apologise to Senator Paschal Mooney for not realising he was sitting behind me. I might have a very short life in politics if I do not realise who is behind me.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	Not everybody will be eligible on the same day. They will be dealt with on a staggered basis.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I reiterate the point that under the transitional provisions, assuming there are no grounds for extending an existing bankruptcy which was due to terminate three years after adjudication, if it is already due to terminate less than six months after the commencement date, it will terminate on its due date. Otherwise, it will terminate one year after adjudication or six months after commencement if that is the later date.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No problem.
