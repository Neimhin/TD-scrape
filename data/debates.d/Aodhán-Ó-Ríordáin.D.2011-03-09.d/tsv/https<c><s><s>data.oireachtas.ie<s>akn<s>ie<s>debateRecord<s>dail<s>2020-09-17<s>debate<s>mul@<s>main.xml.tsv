AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It might be appropriate that the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, is taking this because he is in charge of the national drugs strategy. The issue of drugs is an important issue throughout the country but on the north side of Dublin, it causes great heartache. In June 2019 on a visit to political leaders in Dublin Bay North, the assistant Garda commissioner confirmed that a Garda station was to be located in the Dublin 13 or Dublin 17 area to serve the vast expanding community in Clongriffin and Belmayne. It is expected an extra 50,000 people will be inhabiting the area in the coming years. We have had several successful campaigns in that area for the establishment of a second level school. We now have an Educate Together second level school and we are happy about that.I was involved with the local community, including the community in Clongriffin through the Clongriffin Community Association, in having a petition to ensure we would get a Garda station for the area based on community infrastructure. We were delighted when the assistant Garda commissioner announced that negotiations with the Office of Public Works, OPW, on a particular site at the corner of Northern Cross were ongoing and that a Garda station would be located on the site in the coming years. Aligned with that, a Government commitment was made during the general election that a Mulvey-style commission would be established on the north side and in Drogheda as a reaction to a murder spree in both those geographic locations. What I was trying to do, and what Deputy Ged Nash, who was then a Senator, was trying to say at the time was that the response to drugs and gangland murder should not be one of Garda resources only but also required an in-depth discussion about education, empowerment, oral language, youth development and housing along the lines of what happened with Kieran Mulvey's commission in the north inner city. We wanted that approach to be replicated on the north side and in Drogheda. After months of making repeated calls for such a commission in the Seanad - I was a Senator at the time - the then Minister for Justice and Equality agreed the Government would do so if returned to office. This commission is desperately needed. While I acknowledge these are difficult times and establishing a commission at this time would be problematic because of the national crisis we are in, poverty, disadvantage and drug crime still exist and people still have murder on their minds. I would like an update on that promised, pledged and proposed Garda station. At what stage is the process? When will the station be opened? When can the community of Dublin 13 and 17 be satisfied that the campaign, which they were thrilled to see reach a successful conclusion in June 2019, will result in the next stage of the process and the opening of the doors of a fully staffed and resourced Garda station in this expanding area on the north side of Dublin?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for his response but the language in it does not give me much comfort. It states: "... I understand from An Garda Síochána that proposals for a new station will be considered as part of the next Garda accommodation programme". The assistant Garda commissioner announced in June 2019 that it would happen. I worry when I see words like "proposals" and "considered" in the Minister of State's reply. I appreciate his comments about the proposed commission for the north side and Drogheda. This issue is not about police alone. We cannot police our way out of a murder triangle, so to speak. A commitment to establish a commission was made by an outgoing Minister for Justice and Equality of a party that is still in government. As such, that should be considered and we are waiting for that to happen. The issue of whether it will happen is not up for discussion. A commitment was made in the heat of the general election campaign. That is what it took for a commitment to be made to establish a Mulvey-style commission for the north side of Dublin, and not just to discuss policing. It is all very well to talk about the policing element but there is so much more to talk about, for example, education, oral language, literacy, diet, access to employment, housing, transport, health and other issues. That is what the Mulvey commission in the north inner city was about. That commission was successful to a degree. It has successfully cut through the red tape and created immediate access for the community by allowing their concerns to go straight through to the decision-makers rather than, unfortunately, all the bureaucracy. I need a firmer commitment on the Garda station, which was a commitment made by the assistant Garda commissioner. I also need a date for the establishment of the Mulvey-style commission on the north side and in Drogheda, to which the Minister of State's party committed in the general election. It is still in government and, indeed, still holds the Ministry for justice.

It is only fair we share the time. While everybody wants to support the Bill tabled by Sinn Féin, and the Labour Party also appreciates the opportunity to speak on the issue of housing, I am disappointed the Minister is no longer in the Chamber. We have, however, had some constructive engagement with him in the past, particularly on one of the housing strategies the Labour Party is trying to pursue, which is a rent-to-buy scheme. The Minister of State will appreciate that, particularly in high-rent areas, it is difficult for couples or individuals to rent and to save for a deposit at the same time. We were trying to reintroduce a previous scheme whereby an individual could, through the local authority, rent for three years, with all that rent going towards a deposit, and walk away from the scheme after three years if they so wished or put that towards a deposit and get on the property ladder, the idea being that one did not have to rent and save simultaneously. Many of these schemes were reasonably successful previous to the crash but were then discontinued. We want to work proactively with the Department and try to get some of these State-sponsored schemes up and running again to benefit people. I will say this much about the Minister's response. I served in government for a particularly short period of 18 months, and one of the big lessons I learned there was that when Government says something is not possible, unconstitutional or not legal, all those barriers can be overcome if the matter is important enough. There are any number of things we were once told were not possible, potentially not legal or potentially unconstitutional, concerns which were all swept aside once the Covid crisis hit. I refer to rent freezes, eviction freezes and the nationalisation of health services. I wish to outline how serious the situation is by referring to the Daft rental report for quarter 1 of 2020. It states that rents increased by 3.8% nationally year-on-year, which marks the lowest rate of inflation since late 2012. However, while rents fell nationwide by 2.1% between March and April of 2020 in the teeth of the Covid crisis, between their lowest point in the early 2010s and the peak of quarter 1 of 2020, they increased by between 52% in Connacht-Ulster and 107% in Dublin. As for rent-a-room trends in quarter 1 of 2020, in Dublin city centre, the average rent for a single bedroom was €715, an increase of 8.2% year-on-year. The average rent for a double bedroom in the city was €820, an increase of 4.6% year-on-year. In south-east Leinster, the average rent for a single bedroom was €389, an increase of 16.1% year-on-year. In Limerick city centre, the average rent for a single bedroom was €429, an increase of 16.3% year-on-year. In Waterford city centre, the average rent for a double bedroom was €399, an increase of 9.6% year-on-year. In Galway city centre the average rent for a double bedroom was €1,260, an increase of 19.7% year-on-year. According to the Daft housing report of July 2020, the average national rent was €1,412. The average rent in Dublin was €2,030 in July 2020. Monthly rents were on average 0.5% lower in Dublin but higher than March levels elsewhere. Rent has increased in Laois by 4% year-on-year and is now at an average of €1,002. Rent has increased in Longford by 3.3% year-on-year to €737 on average. Rent has increased in Kilkenny by 4.2% year-on-year to €999 on average. Rent has increased in Limerick county by 3.4% to €925 on average. In Longford, the monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment has increased by 8% year-on-year to €556 on average. In Carlow, the monthly rent for a one-bed apartment has increased by 9% year-on-year to €724 on average. I will give just one more example because I know that other Deputies wish to make contributions. In Dublin 24, the average monthly rent for a one-bed apartment increased by 5% year-on-year to €1,425. The point I am trying to make is that people in opposition are genuinely trying to find solutions and coming into this Chamber from a good place. I challenge the Minister's contention that when legislation is put in front of him, people are playing games, are not serious or are not dealing with crisis situations facing families and individuals day by day. When answers come that refer to constitutionality or legality, I do not necessarily take them at face value because of my experience. With a bit of imagination and the same sort of energy and belief we all came together with at the beginning of the Covid crisis, we could overcome a significant number of issues. With that in mind, I would like the Minister of State in his contribution to refer to the rent-to-buy scheme the Labour Party is trying to pursue.
