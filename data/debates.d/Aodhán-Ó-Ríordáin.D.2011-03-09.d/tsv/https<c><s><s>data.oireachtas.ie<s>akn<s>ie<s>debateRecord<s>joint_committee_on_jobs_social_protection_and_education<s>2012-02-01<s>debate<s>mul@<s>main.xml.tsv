AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Any cut in the education budget will hurt.  The constraint under which we operate is that 77% of the education budget - pay and pensions - is protected under the Croke Park agreement, and I support this agreement.  If class sizes are to be protected, it is a case of how to make other savings.  Anything that is touched will be difficult.  I met a number of guidance counsellors and have tried to identify alternative funding for the €9 million spent on chaplains.  In DEIS schools, there has been a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio to 18.25.  However, some DEIS schools say they will not be able to absorb the change in the guidance counselling system with that reduction.  Do the delegates agree?  That was the motivation behind it.Regarding the overall service provided by guidance counsellors, I refer to a letter from Gay + Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, supporting the Institute of Guidance Counsellors' position.  How bad is homophobic bullying, is it getting worse and how are guidance counsellors addressing the issue?  This is not necessarily related to the main topic but I ask for a brief response on how it is being addressed.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the delegates for their presentations.  I discussed this issue with Ms Flanagan last night.  I have had first-hand experience of this initiative in the school in which I taught and concur with the comments made about disadvantaged schools.  This has created a level playing pitch.  While previously French lessons were only available in middle-class schools, the average DEIS school now provides this service.  Children of immigrant families in Sweden have a right to learn the language of their parents, whereas in Ireland we are curtailing a modern languages initiative.  The reality is that we do not do languages well, the biggest example being the Irish language.  Given the amount of time spent by teachers training in the instruction of the teaching of the Irish language and teaching it in primary and secondary schools, every leaving certificate student should be fluent in Irish.  However, that is not the case.Similarly, we are well behind the curve in European terms in modern language teaching.  I will not go through a political statement regarding cuts and strains from the economic position, as we have been through it before and spoke about it last night.  The tragedy is we always discuss these issues in the context of cuts and we never have a long-term view of what language learning will be over time.There was a comment on teacher training.  Is there a potential in the six-month period to discuss that long-term strategy and mainstreaming modern languages?  I often get criticised for making the following point.  The two biggest overarching priority value judgments made in Irish education are the Irish language and religion.  If those are mentioned or criticised by us at any stage, we are in for it.  I know this and am a great advocate of the Irish language.  We must have a different view of our priority system and our value judgments in Irish education.  Although what is happening now is regrettable, will it provide a chance to re-evaluate what we do in education and where languages lie in that regard?
