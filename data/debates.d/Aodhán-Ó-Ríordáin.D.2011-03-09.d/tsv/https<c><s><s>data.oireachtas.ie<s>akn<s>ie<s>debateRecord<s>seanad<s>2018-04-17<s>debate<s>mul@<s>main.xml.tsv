AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I join others to extend the Labour Party's sympathy to the family of Big Tom. It is fair to say he was a music legend in his part of the world, but also nationally and internationally. I met him on a number of occasions at Monaghan GAA matches and I think that is where he got his nickname as he was a formidable midfielder in his club football days. I pass on the Labour Party's condolences to the McBride family. I wish to raise two issues. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to discuss the 42 new projects? This was welcome news for many people across Dublin, in particular, and in my own part of the world who are seeking an Educate Together second level school in Dublin 13. The Minister for Education and Skills might come in and discuss that and other projects about which there is concern that they will not be progressed as a result of that announcement. The second issue for the Minister for Education and Skills involves concerns about the imminent closure of a Traveller school. It is not a school for Travellers, but 100% of the intake are Travellers. It just happens to be that way. They have been told only last week that they are to close immediately in June, which will have a detrimental impact on the students in the senior cycle.I contend that the school needs to be phased out rather than closed overnight in June and I would like the Minister to come in to discuss that. I had sought a Commencement debate on it but have not been successful in getting one. I will raise two issues for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. The first relates to the strategic housing development process trying to fast-track housing. I understand the reasons behind it because of the nature of the housing crisis but we need to discuss the effect the strategic housing development process is having on zoning across Dublin city and wider afield. It is effectively open season for development on Z15 lands, in particular, institutional lands and schools. In many communities, that might be a positive but in others it is not. The protection of Z15 must be considered by the Government because An Bord Pleanála is not taking it into account. Lastly, I need to talk about the Shanowen shakedown protest that took place outside Leinster House this afternoon. I welcome that the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, went out and spoke to the students, which is to her credit. However, the rising rent costs for students in this city and across the country is troubling and the students have recommended that an amendment be made to legislation to facilitate a rent cap for students. Rent increases of that nature are detrimental to their capacity to have a student life and proceed with their studies. In fairness, the Minister of State did come out and talk to them. I would like an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.
