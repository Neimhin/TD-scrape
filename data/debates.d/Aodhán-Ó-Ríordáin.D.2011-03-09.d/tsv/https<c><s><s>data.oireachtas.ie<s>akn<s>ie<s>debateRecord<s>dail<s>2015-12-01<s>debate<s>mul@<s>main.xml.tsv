AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	The Government, as the Deputy knows, published a roadmap to Ireland’s ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on 21 October 2015. The roadmap details the legislative changes to be undertaken to enable Ireland to ratify the convention, along with the estimated timeframe involved and a clear and unambiguous deadline for ratification by the end of 2016. As announced, the Government has inter alia approved the drafting of the equality/disability (miscellaneous provisions) Bill to make a range of miscellaneous amendments to statute law necessary to enable ratification. Work on the general scheme of this Bill is underway, with a view to submission to Government very soon. The Deputy will also be aware that we recently published a comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities and that we are at phase 2 of a three phase consultation process that will lead early in the New Year to the adoption of a new disability inclusion strategy. I am committed to continuous improvement where equality and human rights are concerned and the development of this new strategy is an opportunity to bring about real improvements for people with disabilities.  While clearly there is a substantial legislative agenda across a number of Departments to get through, as set out in the roadmap, and a lot of work to be done to prepare a new inclusion strategy that can have a real and measurable impact, I can assure Deputy Mac Lochlainn and the House that we have the drive and enthusiasm to get it done. I am glad that ratification of the convention is a common goal. All political parties support ratification and I am pleased that the Deputy put this issue on the agenda for discussion today. Civil society groups and stakeholders are also keen to see the convention ratified. Equality is about creating the circumstances that ensure that every individual has equal access to the enjoyment of their rights, with employment playing a central role in that regard. We will maintain the momentum on ratification of the convention, as set out in the roadmap, to make sure that the rights of all persons with disabilities will be protected in our laws.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I assure the Deputy that nobody is having a word in anyone's ear urging caution. The reality is that Ireland takes a different approach to these matters. There are many countries around the world which will ratify this convention but it will have no meaningful effect. Ireland does these things differently.This means that effectively when Ireland ratifies a convention it has material effect. Other countries can ratify it but it is a meaningless statement. Ireland signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and is one of three EU member states yet to ratify. I agree it has taken too long and have no difficulty in accepting that, but different countries take different approaches. We take our international obligations very seriously and we do not ratify until we can guarantee compliance. We sign conventions as a declaration of our commitment that we want to apply the convention concerned in Ireland but we ratify when we can guarantee to our international partners that we are meeting our commitments. We could ratify in the morning, but we still have a number of steps yet to take. Under the Constitution, the conduct of international affairs is the responsibility of Government, and this includes ratification of international conventions. However, the sole prerogative of legislating for the State is vested in the Oireachtas. This is also reflected in Article 29.6 of the Constitution, which states that no international agreement shall be part of the domestic law of the State, save as may be determined by the Oireachtas. That is how we do things in Ireland. When we ratify, it has meaningful import.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I can confirm the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill will be enacted by the end of the year. While I take the Deputy's point about the ratification of the convention, I have stated the reasons that Ireland has a different approach to other countries. In terms of the equality agenda, in every area I and the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, deal with, from LGBT rights to people with disabilities, to Travellers and to migrant issues, employment always comes up as a central issue for all people on the edge of society who want to get involved in the mainstream. In particular, this includes dignity at work, access to the labour market and protection within work. That is why the comprehensive employment strategy was key to the Government's work in this area. If a person has a disability that does not restrict them from entering the workforce, or if a person is in the workforce and acquires a disability, the person can be a part of the workforce. We feel passionately about that, which is why we place so much emphasis on it. That is a key part of this Government's commitment to people with disabilities and will continue to be so.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputies Joe Costello and Maureen O'Sullivan for raising this issue. This morning I accompanied Mr. Tony Duffin and other members of the Ana Liffey Drug Project on a walk through the streets north and south of the River Liffey for an hour and a half.What I came across was particularly shocking. I saw drug paraphernalia, human excrement, the result of a drug user's withdrawal symptoms, blood and various other types of drug litter. What I witnessed today is still very much playing on my mind. I had been on a walk-around previously with Mr. Duffin and was very much taken aback then. I was taken aback again today by what I had witnessed. I will give the official response and we can then discuss the issue in more detail. I thank the Deputies for raising the issue of the recognised problem of street injecting in Ireland. The establishment of supervised injecting centres has been proposed by the Ana Liffey drugs project. Such centres are essentially drug consumption rooms where drug injection is facilitated in a clinical setting under the supervision of nurses and counsellors. Service users are supplied with clean injecting kits and health care professionals are on hand to make an intervention in the event of a drug overdose. These centres save lives.  Supervised injecting centres seek to attract hard-to-reach populations of chronic injecting drug users. They are particularly effective in reaching out to marginalised groups, namely, those who use drugs on the street or in other risky and unhygienic conditions and those who have remained out of reach of or who are resistant to higher threshold services.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and I have reviewed the evidence on supervised injecting centres and intend to submit a formal proposal to the Government before Christmas. The aim of any supervised injecting centre is to reduce the incidence of public street injecting and the negative impact it has on those who inject, in terms of their dignity, health and ability to access health and social care services, as well as on the wider community and public service providers such as gardaí and ambulance personnel. The aim is also to reduce the number of drug-related deaths resulting directly from overdoses. No decision has yet been made on the number or location of such facilities. I intend to include additional heads in the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill to provide for supervised injecting centres. Drafting of the Bill is under way in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The Bill will restore the Government's powers to make regulations to control new drugs. As Deputies will know, these powers were curtailed by the Court of Appeal judgment earlier this year. It is anticipated that the Bill will be published in early 2016 and provide for a legislative unblocking of any impediment to the introduction of medically supervised injecting centres. I agree with Deputy Joe Costello when he says this is not a panacea. It is not the only response available to us. There are lots of overlapping concerns, including homelessness, isolation, marginalisation and disadvantage. A humane response to the issue of street injecting is to take the small cohort of very vulnerable drug users who are outside any mainstream drug programme off the streets, away from corners, bus shelters, parks and playgrounds and provide them with a safe, secure and compassionate setting where they can inject, as they will do anyway. The aim is to curtail the possibility of their contracting HIV or hepatitis C and to save lives. Nobody anywhere in the world who has injected in a medically supervised injecting centre has died of an overdose. There are 88 such centres across Europe and several in Australia and other parts of the world and they work very effectively. I expect the legislation to be introduced in the House early next year, after which we will have to talk about management, the way any such centre would be organised, where they would be located and the funding mechanisms which would have to be put in place to run them effectively. I envisage one centre being opened in Dublin city centre initially, but representations are being made to my office to have supervised injecting centres opened in other urban centres, including Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Deputies for their support. I thank all Members of Dáil Éireann for supporting this initiative. A memo has been sent to all Departments seeking their observations which should be with us by 15 December. Upon their receipt, we will proceed with inserting the relevant section into the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill which will be presented to the House in the new year. What I saw this morning shocked me. I saw syringes discarded dangerously on the steps of the Customs House and in alleyways. I also saw blood and human excrement. This is our city and the people concerned are citizens of this Republic who are, for their own reasons and because of their vulnerability, forced into a situation where they feel they have no option but to access an area behind a dumpster to engage in this activity. We have to look at this issue from the perspective of the entire community and within it drug users who need dignity and a safe, compassionate place where they can inject heroin in a controlled way in order to take the first step on the road to recovery, safe from contracting HIV or hepatitis C and from the danger of taking an overdose. It is a compassionate response which will be welcomed by the citizens of Dublin and Ireland who are nervous about the unsightly nature of open injecting. The retailers of Dublin city are also pushing for this measure. I do not agree with the suggestion that there should be a mobile clinic because there is a better chance of developing a long-term relationship with a facility if it is located in one fixed spot. However, that is a discussion we must have after the legislation has been passed. Once the Bill has been enacted, we can get into discussions about regulation, funding, control and consultation.  I thank the Deputies for their support and hope to see an historic new section in the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill in the new year which will provide for an injecting centre in Dublin initially and perhaps, in the coming years, in other parts of the country.
