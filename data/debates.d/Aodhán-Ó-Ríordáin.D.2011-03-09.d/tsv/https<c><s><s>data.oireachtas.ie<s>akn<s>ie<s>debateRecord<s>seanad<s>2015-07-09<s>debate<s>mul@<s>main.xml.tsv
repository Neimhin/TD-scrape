AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I hope my visit to the House this afternoon will be more productive than my visit here this morning. Before addressing the content of amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and amendment No. 19, I hope I may be allowed to make one or two brief introductory remarks. We had an unusual Committee Stage and an unusual journey to get to Report Stage. I appreciate that the rules under which we operate on Report Stage may restrict Senators in the contributions they can make. I want to make it clear that I am more than happy to co-operate with Members in terms of recommitting groups of sections, as has been advised to us as the appropriate procedure, to ensure we can have a full discussion on each and every aspect of the Bill and the amendments I am recommending be made to it. Given the additions I am proposing to the Bill, the Long Title has been amended to reflect these changes, including references to the relevant EU directives, the Pensions Acts 1990 to 2014, the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2012, the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2011 and to matters related thereto. The references to the EU directives will be helpful to my Department in its discussions with the European Commission in relation to our transposition obligations - the point being that part of what we are proposing to do is to make technical changes to the existing equality legislation to reflect in specific areas the evolving jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, our own courts and the Equality Tribunal in equality law cases. That is the context for amendment No. 1. A Chathaoirligh, will I proceed to deal with amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 19?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 2 introduces a definition of the "Act of 2000" as we need to refer to the Equal Status Act 2000. Amendment No. 3 deletes the definition of "Minister" as we do not need this as we are amending existing legislation that already has this definition. In amendment No. 19 we are making consequential changes to the Short Title, collective citation and the commencement provisions. The Title of the Bill will change so that once enacted it will be known as the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015. This change is needed as we propose to amend both the employment equality and the equal status streams of equality legislation and to amend relative provisions in the Pensions Acts.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The principal equality directives have essentially the same definition of indirect discrimination. I will quote from the Framework Employment Directive 2000/78/EC, which contains the following definition: "indirect discrimination should be taken to occur when an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put persons having a particular religion or belief, a particular disability, a particular age, or a particular sexual orientation at a particular disadvantage ...".There is more in the text of the directive but that quote captures the key point, and I will quote from this one directive only in the interests of brevity.  The wording of the directives was not followed when the directives were transposed into Irish Law. The words "would put" was replaced with the word "puts", as follows, for example, in section 19(4) of the Employment Equality Act: "Indirect discrimination occurs where an apparently neutral provision puts persons of a particular gender (being As or Bs) at a particular gender at a particular disadvantage in respect of remuneration compared with other employees of their employer." The reason for this is that there was a view at the time the Acts were drafted that the term "would put" could lead to persons taking cases where they did not have locus standi or were not members of the particular ground under which they were claiming discrimination. Therefore, the word "puts" replaces the words "would put".The case law is now clear: to claim indirect discrimination, a person must assert membership of a particular class of persons to whom the Acts apply and must demonstrate actual personal detriment. Speculative or theoretical claims are not permissible. It is proposed, therefore, that the definitions of indirect discrimination in Irish equality legislation be amended to follow precisely the EU definitions. Amendments are required to the Employment Equality Acts, the Equality Status Acts and the Pensions Acts, as is evident from the text of amendment No. 4. Essentially, we are replacing the indicative with the subjunctive. We are bringing our legislation into line with the actual language used in the EU directives but not making any change to the actual law as it is applied in practice. In addition, arising from amendments Nos. 4, 10 and 11, this issue comes up in respect of amendment No. 7. However, as the main issue in that amendment relates to advertising, we will discuss it with the next group of amendments but without my repeating this element of the explanation. The nature of the Equality Acts is such that technical adjustments are required in individual sections that relate to more than one of the substantive amendments I am recommending. I hope, therefore, that Members will bear with me.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The group of amendments includes amendments Nos. 5, 7 and 9, but, due to the structure of the Equality Acts, part of amendment No. 8 is also relevant. However, as that amendment mainly deals with a different issue related to the position of Swiss and EEA nationals, it has been grouped with amendment No. 18 with which it will be discussed. We are considering a group of amendments that relate to advertising. Section 10 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibits discriminatory advertisements. Section 85(1)(d) allows the Equality Authority, now the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, to refer a publication or display to which section 10 applies to the director of the Equality Tribunal, soon to be the Workplace Relations Commission, for adjudication and decision. However, there is no provision to allow an individual who considers that he or she has been discriminated against in an employment opportunity to take a case. The Equality Tribunal brought this issue to my Department’s attention, with a request that the current provision be amended so as to allow an aggrieved individual to submit a complaint. The tribunal pointed to a case in which the Court of Justice of the European Union stated: “The fact that an employer states publicly that it will not recruit employees of a certain ethnic or racial origin constitutes direct discrimination in respect of recruitment within the meaning of Article 2(2)(a) of Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, such statements being likely strongly to dissuade certain candidates from submitting their candidature and, accordingly, to hinder their access to the labour market.” The judgment refers to the race directive and access to the labour market. Therefore, the changes to the legislation being proposed include access to vocational training and membership of certain bodies, in addition to access to recruitment and promotion. To ensure the amendments proposed do not allow for what might be termed an “officious bystander” to take a case, that is, where that person may not be a potential candidate for the particular vacancy or membership that may be involved, the approach taken in the drafting of the amendments is to amend sections 8, 12 and 13 of the Act to ensure there is a real connection between the person claiming discrimination and the advertiser.  The definition of the word "advertisement" in section 2 of the Employment Equality Act is being expanded to include a public statement as per the judgement of the European Court of Justice. We are not proposing a similar amendment on the equal status side and this question needs further consideration as the court judgment does not refer to the relevant directive. This is a question that is being examined further in consultation with the Equality Tribunal and, if deemed appropriate and necessary, can be addressed in future legislation, but I do not anticipate that we will have completed this examination in time for our consideration of this Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	When the framework employment directive, Directive No. 2000/78/EC, which outlaws age discrimination in employment, was transposed into law by the Equality Act 2004, reliance was placed on the wording of recital 14 of the directive which states: "This Directive shall be without prejudice to national provisions laying down retirement ages". The conclusion is that it was not necessary to amend section 34(4) of the Employment Equality Act 1998. Section 34(4) states: "Without prejudice to subsection (3), it shall not constitute discrimination on the age ground to fix different ages for the retirement (whether voluntarily or compulsorily) of employees or any class or description of employees...". However, the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union has since established that national provisions laying down retirement ages could amount to age discrimination if they cannot be justified under the specific terms of the directive, in particular Article 6.1. Article 6.1, entitled, Justification of differences of treatment on grounds of age, provides that: "Member States may provide that differences of treatment on grounds of age shall not constitute discrimination, if, within the context of national law, they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim including legitimate employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives, and if the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary". The Court of Justice of the European Union has in the course of a series of judgments applied this test to national compulsory retirement schemes. The High Court, the Labour Court and the Equality Tribunal have applied this test in Irish cases. As a result, the text of section 34(4) which seems to give carte blanche to employers to set any age as a retirement age does not reflect the law as it is actually applied. It is, therefore, proposed that it be amended to reflect the law as it actually is, that is, as developed in the jurisprudence. Similarly, section 6(3)(c) of the EEA also requires amendment. Section 6(3)(c) provides: "(c) Offering a fixed term contract to a person over the compulsory retirement age for that employment or to a particular class or description of employees in that employment shall not be taken as constituting discrimination on the age ground". The Court of Justice of the European Union in its case law has also held that the provision of fixed-term contracts on the basis of age constitutes age discrimination and would require justification under Article 6 of the directive.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am informed that we do not have a national framework in this area. Effectively, there is no discrimination on the basis of age if the offering of the fixed-term contract reflects the practice or the nature of the business over a period of time. It is unusual for a termination to take place in the context of this legislation, but we are effectively transposing requirements from EU directives into national legislation, thus tidying up many things that need to be tidied up. While the thrust of the Bill was actually to deal with employment equality legislation, we are using this vehicle to transpose others in the Bill before the House. I understand from where the Senator is coming. Effectively, the amendment employs legalistic terminology on what is known to be the case already.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The provision brings the Bill in line with the law as it stands. There is effectively no change other than streamlining existing legislation to ensure clarity.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Section 12(7) of the Employment Equality Act and section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 provide different fees, grants and admission arrangements for vocational training and access to education may apply between Irish and EU citizens on one hand, and citizens of other states on the other. The State is obliged under EEA agreements and EU-Switzerland agreements to ensure the benefits extended to EU nationals are also extended to EEA and Swiss nationals in the absence of explicit provision to the contrary in the agreements. In practice, the same benefits are extended to such individuals but the Acts do not reference them explicitly. These amendments are required to provide for an explicit reference.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am going to miss section 37 when it has been enacted. It has been a part of my life for the last three years. This was a long and tortuous process and many of us worked hard on a cross-party basis to bring the Bill to this stage. We are now at the heart of the Bill. I am conscious that it has not been possible to have a real debate on the text and options previously because the Government has not been in a position until now to bring forward its proposed amendments to the Private Members' Bill. To fill that gap and to outline the rationale for our proposed approach, I propose to rehearse the history of the Bill. While some Senators will be familiar with the history, it is important that the details be accessible in the Official Report. The Private Members' Bill as published has been examined carefully by my Department and the Attorney General. It may appear that we are deleting and replacing all of the existing text but we are not. There are technical and drafting reasons for the approach being taken to amending the Bill but our conclusion on foot of a lengthy examination is that the Bill as published is largely constitutionally sound. There is a specific concern that the proposed new section 37(1)(c) in section 2 of the Bill as published, which would allow the Minister for Justice and Equality, in consultation with the Minister for Health or the Minister for Education and Skills, to issue direction or guidelines, could constitute an unlawful delegation by the Oireachtas of its legislative responsibilities. Instead of this provision we propose to provide for a list of considerations to be taken into account by employers, as set out in the proposed new subsection (1)(c).The objective is to ensure the bar is set sufficiently high that employers must provide objective justification for any action taken against an employee and must show that the action is related to, and proportionate to, the actual damage to the ethos of the institution and is rationally and strictly related to the employer's religious ethos. The reversal of the burden of proof in the following paragraph (d) is not necessary as section 85A of the Act contains this provision already. On the substance of the Private Members' Bill and the specific amendment, it is critically important we get this right. The existing section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act, as amended by section 25 of the Equality Act 2004, provides that:A religious, educational or medical institution which is under the direction or control of a body established for religious purposes or whose objectives include the provision of services in an environment which promotes certain religious values shall not be taken to discriminate against a person for the purposes of this Part or Part II if--(a) it gives more favourable treatment, on the religion ground, to an employee or a prospective employee over that person where it is reasonable to do so in order to maintain the religious ethos of the institution, or(b) it takes action which is reasonably necessary to prevent an employee or a prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution.The provision was previously contained in the Equality Bill 1996 which was referred by the President to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution. While the court held the Bill to be unconstitutional on other grounds, the constitutionality of what is now section 37 was upheld as a reasonable balance between the competing constitutional rights involved. While we can seek to find a new balance, the better to meet the rights of employees, the Supreme Court's decision outlines the need for a balance to be struck. It is not simply a matter of deleting certain elements of the existing Act. We must recognise the right of the religious institutions concerned to prevent the undermining of their ethos and for that reason, I am not able to accept amendment No. 14. It would render the remainder of the amendments apropos section 37 meaningless as they would not link back to paragraph (b). There are going to be disputes and, aside from intervening to an extent that does not potentially raise constitutional concerns, it is unclear how deleting section 37(1)(b) will provide any guidance on how to resolve disputes between employees and employers. It would remain the case that an employer had the right to take action against employees who acted against the employer's best interests and disputes would, following deletion of the existing provision, fall to be resolved in the generally applicable labour relations law. I hope the Senator will accept my rationale. While the provision that is now section 37(1) was found in 1997 to strike a reasonable balance between the rights of employees, on the one hand, and freedom of religion, on the other, there is legitimate concern that, in practice, it has not worked. Primarily its operation is regarded as having a particularly chilling effect on LGBT people in the education system. However, it also affects lone parents and divorcees who are restricted in discussing their private lives with their colleagues in the safety of their staff room. I have more to say on the specific amendments proposed to amendment No. 13, but I will stop there.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Senator Zappone seeks to delete a significant section from the Act. I wish we could do so. I also wish we were not dealing with the existing education system and Constitution or the reality in which we find ourselves. Yesterday, when I met many of the groups represented in the Gallery, I made the point that the education system perpetuates inequality by its very constitution. Since its establishment, the State has abdicated responsibility for education by outsourcing the education system. It was decided to have a State-funded education system, rather than a State education system. Schools were established and the State placed them out for tender and asked patron bodies to oversee the running of them. I do not like this but it is the reality within which we must operate. Unfortunately, whatever manner or means we employ to regulate this area, it will never be perfect and education will never be as equal as we would like it to be. I meet many deputations who raise the issue of equality in the education system. For example, parents ask why they must baptise children to send them to a local school. I am deeply uncomfortable with the idea of having a number of denominational schools in a given area, with children going into school through different school gates. We consistently separate children on the basis of religion and gender. Moreover, because the education system is fundamentally based on the idea of competition, it is inevitable that children who are more disadvantaged lose out and those who are more advantaged gain.  I fully agree with the approach proposed by Senator Zappone because the current position is unjust. While the Bill focuses primarily on employees, what is the child of a lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, LGBT, couple, a divorcee or a single parent expected to feel in this scenario? I am keenly aware of this issue but what does one do when one is charged with responsibility of legislating within constitutional confines? That is the position in which this Government finds itself and any other Government would find itself. I would love to delete the section, as proposed in the amendment, but I predict that if we were to do so, we would be on the losing side in a case before the High Court or Supreme Court. It is inevitable that a court case will be taken in response to this legislation because that is what people tend to do in these circumstances. This will mean we will be back working off the original section 37, rather than the amended section we are trying to introduce today.  Senator Bacik stated that the mechanism we are trying to insert in the Act would make it almost impossible for any employer to suggest that anyone, on the basis of his or her nature, is undermining anything. By continuing to allow more than 90% of the infrastructure of primary level schools to remain in a religious ethos, we will perpetuate inequality. That is a fundamental reality of the position in which we find ourselves and that position is backed up by the Constitution.  People tell me how wonderful the education system is in Finland and what wonderful literacy statistics it produces. In Finland, there is one school in each school district, which means there are no primary, secondary, boys' or girls' schools. Schools in Finland are like palaces because they reflect the Finnish value system and the beliefs of Finnish people. Regardless of who one meets from the Finnish political system, whether left-wing, right-wing, centre-left, centre-right, far-left or far-right, all of them will tell visiting deputations, and I was a member of one such deputation, that the concept underpinning their education system is equality. Fundamentally, all of them believe in equality. In contrast, the Irish education system is underpinned by patronage and neither the child nor the employee is at its centre. Ideology and the rights of patrons to perpetuate their ethos are at the core of our education system. This approach also impacts on medical institutions.  While we are waiting for a revolution in this area - I will be at the front of it - we must deal with the current constitutional reality. Unfortunately, the constitutional constraints within which we operate mean that the best we can do is raise the bar. Notwithstanding these constraints, what we are doing is no mean achievement. I do not want anyone to conclude that my comments are undermining what the Bill will achieve for people working in the school system or a medical institution who believe they cannot be themselves. I am keenly aware of this issue, having dealt with it myself. While I would love to be in a position to delete section 37, to do so would create an open goal for those who want to do down this agenda and inevitably result in us having to deal with the existing section until we radically overhaul the education system, which could take forever. The European Union is happy for us to constitute our educate system in any way we wish. This is the system we have and I am trying to operate within it. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I was unnerved for about 30 seconds when I found myself in agreement with Senator Mullen but then I was gratefully relieved by the rest of his contribution.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On amendments Nos. 1 and 3, it is important to note that the existing section 37(1), in permitting favourable treatment on the religion grounds or action to be taken in relation to the undermining of the institution's religious ethos, does not permit discrimination on any of the other grounds allowed in the Employment Equality Act 1988. However, it has had a chilling effect and it does not offer much guidance on the question of what undermining the religious ethos might mean in practice. We do not have any recent case law to guide us. A central feature of the Private Members' Bill in addressing this issue and which, on legal advice, we consider must be retained, is to distinguish between religious institutions run wholly for private purposes and those providing an educational or medical service to the public which is financed by State funding. We are advised that this is an important distinction that must be provided for to ensure the constitutionality of the Bill. There are competing constitutional rights involved: freedom of religion and freedom of association for religious groups, the freedom to establish and maintain their own institutions of various kinds, and the right of employees to be free of discrimination. There is a balance to be struck and the advice available to me, to present it in a positive way, is that the State has a stronger standing and arguably a duty to ensure persons whose salaries are paid directly or indirectly from the public purse are protected and that, in such circumstances, a stronger intervention in the employee-employer relationship than would be appropriate in the case of purely private religious institutions is justified. For that reason, I am unable to accept amendment No. 1 and amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 13. I hope the Senators will accept my explanation and understand we cannot run the risk of the Bill being found to be unconstitutional on this point. I fear that amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 13 would go too far. Are we discussing amendment No. 2? 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Okay. Members can predict what I will say on amendment No. 2.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Senator Norris is holding the space over there. The suggestion that Ireland did not transpose the employment directive properly in section 37(1) has been addressed by the Attorney General in advice to the Department, quoting the text which is relevant here, Article 4.2: Member States may maintain national legislation in force at the date of adoption of this Directive or provide for future legislation incorporating national practices existing at the date of adoption of this Directive pursuant to which, in the case of occupational activities within churches and other public or private organisations the ethos of which is based on religion or belief, a difference of treatment based on a person's religion or belief shall not constitute discrimination where, by reason of the nature of these activities or of the context in which they are carried out, a person's religion or belief constitute a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement, having regard to the organisation's ethos. This difference of treatment shall be implemented taking account of Member States' constitutional provisions and principles, as well as the general principles of Community law, and should not justify discrimination on another ground. I am not seeking to defend the text of section 37(1) but there is no point starting from a false premise. Short of referring to section 37(1) in the text I quoted, the meaning could not be clearer. Article 4.2 was negotiated specifically by the Irish delegation at the time to ensure that the law as set out in section 37(1) would not be altered by the directive and would continue on the basis of a specific protection for its terms. The Commission, as guardian of the treaties, did subsequently institute infringement proceedings in relation to this specific issue and having considered the response from the Irish authorities closed the file on the matter. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We will have to agree to disagree. I do not agree with the Senator. My suggestion would be that an individual, privately funded church or congregation of people who have a particular belief system could legitimately take a case on the basis that it is a private institution, privately funded with a particular belief system and therefore is constrained by what we are trying to do here and could potentially win that case.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	A thousand thoughts come to mind. On the amendment, teaching in a religious ethos school is not just about the teaching of religion. It should run through every subject taught and throughout the entire day. Technically, a teacher in a Catholic school is supposed to teach history, geography, mathematics etc. through the Catholic ethos. This is not only about the teaching of religion. In regard to the programme for Government, our determination was to establish a form of patronage and pluralism. The determination then was to examine the entire infrastructure of the school system in Ireland and the reality of there being 4,000 school buildings in a country with a population equal to that of Manchester. It is unsustainable to have that number of school buildings and so on in a country which, as I say, has a relatively small population in comparison with other countries in the European Union. However, some people did not play ball. They wanted to keep things as they are. In this regard, in terms of influence over children and education, this is the last hurrah for people of a certain mindset. On amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 13, in my mind what it seeks goes too far. We have to accept that under the Constitution religious groups are free to establish their own institutions and can determine that religion or belief of employees is a genuine occupational requirement, even if the teaching of religion is not a direct feature of the particular post. I am unable to accept this particular amendment. This is an issue, and one not only relevant to religious institutions.What about a lobbying group that believes in human rights which has a reasonable expectation that someone working for it shares its belief system? What about someone working for a gay rights group, a women's rights group or a political party? Is it a reasonable expectation that an individual working in such an institution should share its mindset? It is not easy to nail down, which I totally accept. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on one's point of view, we have to accept that the Constitution is quite clear on this point.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome Senator David Norris to our side of the House.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate from where Senator Katherine Zappone is coming. I am reminded of the G. K. Chesterton quote about Christianity, that it would be great if anybody bothered to try it. Addressing amendments Nos. 4 and 11 to amendment No. 13 together, there is a weight of volumes setting out the belief systems of individual churches and other religious groups. There are theological and practice differences not just between but also within particular denominations. There is a line which we should not cross. The State should not, as a matter of principle, involve itself in seeking to define - even indirectly - what individual denominations do or do not hold central to their ethos. If we want to achieve a genuine separation of church and State - I share this objective with the Senators - we should not start with the State putting a mechanism in place to regulate how religious groups define what they believe in.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The State should not find itself having to police these definitions in any way. Even if the State were to take that step, I suspect that, in practice, any such statement would be formulated at a sufficiently high level of abstraction to be of no particular use in dealing with the requirements we are setting out in amendment No. 13. I hope the Senators will accept the reason for my reluctance and not press the amendments. It would be great if we could have this done this evening.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I demand clarification on that.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I had to resist the temptation to speculate on the number of individuals that constitute an orgy.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Possibly we should put down an amendment to clarify the matter. Amendments Nos. 5, 7, 8 and 10 take different forms and address the matter in different ways, but they have in common a focus on the employee's right to privacy. My Department has consulted with the Office of the Attorney General and I am happy in light of the consultation to accept the spirit of the amendments. Comparisons are invidious so I ask Members to forgive me, but in so far as a choice must be made, the style of amendment No. 5 conforms to the crisp and precise style in which the legislation is drafted. It captures the objective of the group of amendments without repeating the detail which I am advised is unnecessary. With the agreement of the House, I propose to accept amendment No. 5. On that basis, the other amendments might not be pressed. I understand I should move a verbal amendment at this stage as the insertion of a new subparagraph (iii) in subsection (1C)(c), which is proposed to be inserted by paragraph (b) of amendment No. 13, will require that the existing subparagraph (iii) is updated to subparagraph (iv). It is a consequential technical amendment arising from the acceptance of amendments Nos. 5 to No. 13. Perhaps the House can confirm its agreement to this change in the version of the Bill as proposed by the Seanad to be published after today's debate. Therefore I propose that in paragraph (c) of subsection (1C) proposed to be inserted by paragraph (b) of amendment No. 13, the existing subparagraph (iii) is renumbered as subparagraph (iv).
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 9 is a difficult one. Elements of what it seeks to achieve are contained within the text on privacy which we discussed earlier. I signalled acceptance of the amendment from Senator Zappone which is in concert with the broad principle of what Senator Averil Power is also seeking to achieve. Other elements cross the line into territory where the Supreme Court is likely to decide that the text should be struck down. As such, we have to be very careful. No employee is free to act against the interests of or campaign against the values or ethos of the employer. That is a fact that goes beyond considerations of whether the employer is a religious institution. For example, civil servants above a certain grade are not free to participate in politics or campaign on issues of political controversy. A similar situation exists for An Garda Síochána. I would like to be able to give definite advice on where the boundary might lie in respect of a range of possible circumstances but it is not possible to do that. The right to privacy encompasses freedom of expression, assembly and association to an extent but not to the extent that the exercise of these freedoms includes campaigning against and, in particular, visibly campaigning against one's employer or the employer's values and beliefs. While I appreciate the motivation behind the amendment, I am, unfortunately, unable to accept it.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I disagree with the Senator. We are not afraid of something that is not there but are legislating for something that very much is there. We must be very mindful of it. While many school staffrooms are very inclusive places where people can be who they want, not every schoolteacher or medical professional feels the same, and we must ensure the chilling effect, as it has been described, ends. Senator Norris reminded me of a situation in which I was machine gunned with questions about my private life by students in my class who assumed I was gay because I was teaching in a girls' school. Then I got engaged and they saw a photograph of her.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	They said: "God, Sir, your girlfriend is massive." In Sheriff Street, the word "massive" is a compliment. It is very different from Monaghan, where telling somebody their wife or girlfriend is massive has a different connotation. I had to spend a little time explaining that one. I digress. To speak bluntly to Senator Power's reservations, one cannot be seen to have been undermining anything if one answers a question factually. "Are you married?" "Yes, I am." That is not undermining anything, only stating a fact. It is not proselytising, undermining or campaigning. If somebody asks me, as a teacher, if I am running for election, the answer is yes. If somebody asks if I am running for the Labour Party, the answer is yes. If somebody asks if his or her mother should vote for the Labour Party, that is where the line is.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is a well-established line. One person's interpretation of what a ring means is different from somebody else's. As Senator Bacik has clearly said, one's family status or civil status cannot be taken into consideration in these matters as undermining anything.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is explicit. There are nuances in schools and wearing a T-shirt with a particular political slogan on it would be considered inappropriate. There are many professions, such as the Garda Síochána and the Civil Service, in which expressions of political preference or ideology would not be appropriate. There is a line. If one answers a factual question and gives information that can be substantiated, it is not undermining anything. It is a statement of fact. “Are you married?” “Yes, I am.”
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is a statement of fact and it is explicit in the legislation that a person is not undermining anything by being who he or she is and having a marriage into which he or she has entered.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	The intention of these amendments, which were introduced following consultation with the Department of Social Protection and the Department of the environment, Community and Local Government, is to prohibit, in the provision of accommodation, discrimination in regard to a tenant or prospective tenant on the basis that the person is or is not in receipt of rent supplement, or that the person's income in whole or in part is or is not provided by a State as a relevant social welfare payment or by housing assistance payment. However, this will be without prejudice to the landlord's rights under any rule of enactment regulating the provision of accommodation and to the right of a person providing accommodation to require that rent supplement be paid directly to him or her. HAP is paid directly to landlords under separate legislative provisions, which do not need to be repeated in these provisions. The new "housing assistance ground" is drafted such that it applies only to the provision of rental accommodation, so as to avoid any unintended consequences. However, advertising is expressly captured because of the way in which the definition of "prohibited conduct" in section 2 of the 1998 Act operates. It is absolutely appropriate that a person who is in receipt of a rent supplement or assistance payment and can meet the rent set by a landlord should not be discriminated against simply because of the source of his or her income. We have a serious housing crisis in Dublin city and elsewhere in the State. This is a reform for which my Department can and has taken responsibility. It does not pretend it will solve our housing problems, but it is a small and necessary step in the right direction. I commend the amendments to the House.
