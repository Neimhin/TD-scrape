AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	While I thank the Minister of State for his presence, I had hoped somebody from the Departments of Health or Education and Skills would be here.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I hope the Minister of State will pass on my concerns in relation to the Beechpark services of the HSE. Since a school in my constituency - Scoil Chiaráin in Donnycarney - contacted me about this service, I have been contacted by other schools about it. The authorities at Scoil Chiaráin have been told that Beechpark will not provide any more speech and language therapy services to children of primary school age in this term. No guarantees have been received with regard to the next term. There are 18 children in the unit at the school in question. According to the letter I received from the school, "twelve children will now rely solely on their class teacher for SLT support". This is an untenable situation. Beechpark has provided work for the children to do within their mainstream classes, which is not the best way to proceed with children who are so vulnerable and needy. According to a letter I have received from a parent at the same school:Our son is on the ASD spectrum and is currently attending an outreach ASD class in Scoil Chiaráin C.B.S. on Collins Avenue. We were recently informed that our son will not be receiving any in-school Speech and Language support during this new school term. The reason being that Beechpark, the HSE providers, are unable to fill a senior SLT position due to the on-going embargo on recruitment. Therefore their current SLTs are being stretched to the limit, resulting in our son losing out on crucial language therapy. It is imperative that our son has every opportunity to continue to develop his social and communicative skills. We are very concerned as to how this loss in support will hinder his development, going forward.The letter I have received from the school states:Twelve children will now rely solely on their class teacher for SLT support. Our children are enrolled in our outreach classes with the hope that they will be able to integrate full time with mainstream. How can this happen when their supports are being withdrawn? Communication is an essential area of development for children with autism.Essentially, I am asking why there does not seem to be any co-ordination with regard to special education between the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills. It is needed if we are to tackle this issue. Everyone understands the economic situation, but that is cold comfort for parents whose children desperately need these services. We are faced with the prospect of saying to the parent of a child on the ASD spectrum that he or she will have to stay within his or her mainstream class for this term, and possibly the next term, because one of the senior speech and language therapy positions within this service cannot be filled as a result of the recruitment embargo. If we believe in education as a great liberator and if we believe in the potential of every child, regardless of his or her learning difficulties, surely we cannot stand over this position. I have been told by the representatives of disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged schools in my constituency - the school in this case is a disadvantaged school - that they know of children who have been waiting for two years to access the services they need, including occupational therapy services and the speech and language therapy services that are provided by Beechpark. When they finally get those services, it is a great thing for the school. In this case, Coláiste Chiaráin has been told some of its pupils will have to do without certain services because of the recruitment embargo. I am sure the Minister of State will agree that the children in this unit deserve an awful lot better. I will be interested to hear his response.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	With all due respect, if I go back to the parents with this answer, they will not be very impressed. They will not be impressed with an indication of the overall economic situation, which they have been told of to death, and they will not necessarily be impressed by a review group. The situation is that a senior speech and language therapy position is not being filled. Reviews are wonderful, but the problem is there are 12 children on the autism spectrum who are being told to go back to class. They are being told, "Here is some work you can do in your classroom with your class teacher". It is completely unfair, not just to the children and their parents, but also to the teacher, who is completely incapable of dealing with the situation presented to him or her. I would ask for a more sympathetic and more realistic answer from the Minister. These are very needy and vulnerable children who have fantastic capabilities and potential. This school received a letter from Beechpark on 20 December stating that the senior speech and language position at the school cannot be filled and that it would not have any service in the first term of 2013 and possibly in the term after that. That is an unsustainable position. A school has to plan for an entire year. The Minister of State will probably agree with me that it is far from an ideal position. I would ask for more than a commitment to a review because a review does not take account of the specific situation in which we find ourselves, where the children are being left without the services they need.
