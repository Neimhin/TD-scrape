AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I wish to raise the recent ballot taken by special needs assistants, SNAs, to take industrial action. Of SNAs who voted, 97% voted in favour of industrial action because of the ongoing uncertainty caused by late allocation made by the Department of Education and Skills. This is particularly irritating to the SNAs because an Oireachtas education committee report started by me and then completed and published by the former Senator Mary Moran outlined quite a number of issues that SNAs are raising. We had quite an extensive consultation with SNAs themselves about the work practices and the uncertainty they face. Once again, the Department has failed to deal with the issues raised in that report, and this late allocation issue still undermines the certainty that special needs assistants feel in the workplace. A number of teacher unions are not signing up to the most recent pay agreement, the Union of Students in Ireland is taking to the streets over the proposal for a student loan scheme and now, another branch of our education workforce is threatening industrial action. I therefore ask again for a debate on education matters in this House with the Minister at the earliest opportunity. Another issue I would like to raise, if I may, on a cheerier note is the push for marriage equality in Northern Ireland and in Australia, which, as was said to President Higgins on his visit there, is the most Irish country in the world outside of Ireland. A postal survey on this issue is taking place in Australia at present. The final date for posting of those ballots is, I believe, 27 October. In order to raise awareness of the ongoing push for marriage equality in Northern Ireland and in Australia, a football match will take place this Sunday in Tolka Park at 2 p.m. between politicians and Dublin Devils Football Club, a gay men's football team. It is open to all to come along and cheer on whichever team they wish to cheer on. It is a fund-raiser for marriage equality in Northern Ireland and will also raise awareness among Australian citizens in Ireland who wish to post their ballots back. As we still celebrate the fact that we in this Republic were the first country in the world to vote openly for marriage equality, we have an opportunity and an obligation to do what we can for other jurisdictions, other parts of this country and other countries in the world. We must encourage them to do what they can to bring in marriage equality where they are.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Can we have a saucer of milk for the Leader?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Were they trustworthy?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Did the Leader trust them?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is one thing I am not. I am only a Blueshirt when it comes to the Dubs.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is very welcome. As previous speakers noted, all Senators acknowledge her commitment to the issue of child care and her achievements in this area in the Government's first two budgets. Previous Governments also made improvements in this area, for example, through the introduction of paid paternity leave, a measure in which I was involved. While we are in a better place than was previously the case, we are coming from a disgracefully low base in the area of child care. It is often said by Barnardos that we spend approximately €10,000 per annum on every primary school child, €12,000 per annum on every secondary school child, €16,000 per annum on every third level student and practically nothing on children of preschool age. People approach this debate from different vantage points but the political debate has always focused on the costs of child care to parents. It is as if this is simply a cost issue and the introduction of a tax credit would make matters easier. Other considerations, including the experience of the children and workers in the preschool setting, are sometimes lost. As we know, particularly in areas of disadvantage, the early years are crucial to a child's development. The terms "child care" and "preschool education" overlap and people can become confused or unclear about what they are talking about when it comes to child care and preschool education. The impact of early childhood care and education on brain development is significant and the capacity of children to learn during these years is immense. Furthermore, damage done to children in these years is often irreversible. When I speak in this Chamber or in other forums I often cite statistics showing that a poor three year old child will have about 400 words in his or her vocabulary, whereas a three year old from an advantaged or rich background will have about 1,200 words in his or her vocabulary. It is difficult to address this gap when the child attends primary school.  We have not come from this debate from the perspective of the child but instead focused on parental cost. This is understandable and it is an issue with which the Department is dealing. As previous speakers stated, the potential negative experience of a child is being compounded by the lack of morale in the system caused by conditions in child care workplaces, including poor pay, and job insecurity. It is difficult to maintain motivation in any workplace if one is at the bottom of the pecking order in terms of payscales, certainty of employment and all the other issues raised by other speakers.  It is great that representatives of SIPTU, the trade union behind the campaign on child care workers, are present. On the issue of the sectoral employment order, I understand the Minister and her officials are open to the proposed measure. I acknowledge, however, that this is not her call to make alone because Government-wide support will be required for such an order to be made. While I have great faith in the Minister's instincts, political values and ethics, many of us have questions as to whether those who surround her at the Cabinet table share her views on employment rights, workers' rights and equality in the workplace. As previous speakers noted, a gender equality issue arises because the vast majority of workers in the child care sector are female. This is vulnerable but crucial work. If one wants to damage a person in the long term, one should inflict the damage when he or she is aged under four years because it will be lasting. I am not in any way suggesting this is what is happening in the child care sector. However, if people are not properly paid and treated with respect, we should not be surprised if low morale seeps through the entire system. The House discussed special needs assistants in primary schools who work with the most vulnerable students in the system. These workers feel undermined and uncertain about their career prospects because the Department treats them as an add-on to the system, rather than a central part of it.  We need to focus on three elements, namely, what is best for parents and how we tackle the costs of child care for parents; what is best for the child and his or her development; and what is best for the child care worker. These three elements do not necessarily have to compete. If staff are highly motivated, well paid and trained, professional and respected, the children in their care will benefit, as will their families. I stand with previous speakers, SIPTU and child care workers on this issue. The sectoral employment order is the primary reason for my contribution to this debate, a view echoed by other speakers. If the Minister were to provide a commitment to introduce an employment order, this debate will have been worthwhile. In terms of what the Minister and her officials are trying to do, as she will be aware, the Seanad can often surprise us because once we get our teeth into an issue on which we all agree, Senators can be forceful in supporting a Minister. This could benefit the Minister as she continues to make improvements in this area.
