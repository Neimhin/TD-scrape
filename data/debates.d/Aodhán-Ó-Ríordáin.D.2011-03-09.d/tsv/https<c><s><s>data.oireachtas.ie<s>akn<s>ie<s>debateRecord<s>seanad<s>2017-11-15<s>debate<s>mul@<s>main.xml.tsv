AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The instinctive nastiness of the Taoiseach's politics has been laid bare over the past 48 hours and the Government sank to new depths when issuing rhetoric around the homelessness crisis. I think every Member of the House would agree that homelessness is the biggest issue this country must face. When dealing with a serious issue, one would assume no Minister or Government would engage in victim blaming. However, over the weekend and this week, we have had the suggestion that our homelessness levels are normal, last night it was suggested that talking about homelessness is bad for our international reputation, and now we have the deplorable suggestion that homelessness is down to the bad behaviour of those who are homeless. This is the inevitable consequence of the nasty rhetoric of defending those who get up early in the morning and saying that, for those who are vulnerable, it is in a way their own fault at the end of the day. It is outrageous. Rather than having a Government which holds its hands up and states it is doing its best but that it is a difficult and complex problem on which it will work harder and better to find solutions, we are told that our homelessness rates are normal if one considers the international comparators and that we might have a better international reputation if we stopped talking about it. Inevitably, other people working in the sector are saying that it is their own fault at the end of the day. The rhetoric from the communications unit is outrageous. What is worse about the unit is that €5 million is nothing compared to the price of demonising the most vulnerable people in this country of ours. I genuinely do not want this to turn into party political football.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	However, this is the inevitable consequence. I am blue in the face from listening to demands in this Chamber for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to come in here. It is a waste of all our time.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We need the Taoiseach in here to account for his comments and to tell us his vision for ending homeless. It is outrageous that we have two members-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Hold on. This is the party that gives the rest of us lectures about social issues and Christianity.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This morning two members of the Catholic church were on the radio. Brother Crowley and Fr. Peter McVerry are appalled at the rhetoric of this Government. It is disgusting that we are now blaming the homeless for homelessness. It is unbelievable. I am asking the Cathaoirleach and the Leader quite respectfully-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Most of us have been reasonably calm up to this point. However, we are now being told that giving tents and food to the homeless on the side of the street is wrong, that it is their bad behaviour that is causing the problem and that we should stop talking about it because it is bad for our international reputation. It is beyond time we had the Taoiseach in here to answer for his nasty rhetoric and get back to the substance of the issue and stop blaming those who are the victims of it.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry but the homeless are the ones that are being pointed at and being blamed.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is it my bad behaviour now? Am I behaving badly?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Hear, hear.
