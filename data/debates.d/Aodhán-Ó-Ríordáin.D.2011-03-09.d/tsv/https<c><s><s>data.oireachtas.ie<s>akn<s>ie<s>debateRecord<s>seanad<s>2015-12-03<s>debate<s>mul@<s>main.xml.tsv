AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I am not going to read out the report for the Senator. I am not going to go through the 26 recommendations that are covered and those that are not. I am here to speak on the Bill. If the Senator wants me to speak to amendments, I will do so. If he wants me to go through the entirety of the working group report on the protection process, I will not do so. The report is an historic document because it marks the first time in the history of the direct provision system that this issue is actually being reformed. I will not go through each and every recommendation. Many of them are works in progress. I am here to speak on the Bill and to the amendments that have been proposed.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This is the protection Bill. It deals with a large number of the recommendations set out in the report of the working group on direct provision. The system of direct provision has been a disaster for the families involved. It was a six-month solution that turned into a 12-year or 13-year solution. Nobody who is engaged in this process ever suggested the direct provision system be abolished. I never said it. Nobody I know who has a sense of what the issues are would suggest that it be abolished. If we abolish direct provision, many asylum seekers will end up homeless. That was the reality in 2000 when the system came into operation. There were reports of people seeking asylum in this country sleeping in parks. The system of direct provision was entered into to provide short-term accommodation for individuals who are in desperate need. I could stand over that system if the accommodation was of an excellent standard, if the system was family-centred, if the individuals within the system were treated with dignity and if applications were dealt with speedily, transparently and fairly. I cannot stand over it if the accommodation becomes somebody's long-term home. Is the Senator is suggesting we put everybody who seeks asylum in this country on the housing list or in homeless accommodation?That will be the direct result of the abolition of the direct provision system. The overarching problem with the system of direct provision is the length of stay. I have always said I can stand over a system in which people live with dignity and respect for a period of months in a centre that looks after them and cares for their needs. I cannot stand over a system which effectively becomes an institution in which families and children grow up. The length of stay is the issue. If we abolish direct provision we must prepare for 3,000 applicants a year on housing lists throughout the country and parks filled with people sleeping on benches. That is what we had in 2000 and I will not return to it. I will stand over a system of direct provision as a short-term solution which solves people's accommodation needs as they seek an application for protection in this country. If it is positively received they will have leave to remain and if it is not they must leave. This is the reality. It comes as no surprise to me that those who protest about the abolition of direct provision have slogans with no effect on real life. In fairness, Senators have worked very hard on this issue. There is no far-right lunatic conservative voice in this or the other Chamber demanding a tougher stance. We are all looking for a humanitarian response. Throwing out one-liners and hashtags to abolish direct provision is fine but it is not a solution. This is the solution. This is why I say we should pick through the individual amendments and work collectively to achieve something and not waste our time on grandstanding.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	What is the alternative? The Senator does not have one.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	What is your alternative?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	You do not have one.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	All of these are Government amendments apart from amendment No. 231 in the name of Senator Denis O'Donovan. They relate mainly to the insertion of references to an international protection officer instead of an authorised officer. Authorised officer had been used initially as a standard formulation. The new insertions better reflect the functions to be carried out by such officers under the Bill. Not surprisingly, therefore, according to amendment No. 1 the old references to authorised officers or persons are deleted. As work is ongoing on the definition, which will be shaped by the functions under the finalised Bill, I will not move amendment No. 3 but instead will come back to it at a later point if it proves necessary. I will not move amendment No. 159 for similar reasons. Amendment No. 231 proposes the insertion of a reference to a valid search warrant. I wish to clarify the purpose of this section is to address a number of loopholes which emerged in the existing section 5 of the Immigration Act 1999 relating to the State's capacity to remove from the State persons who have no entitlement to be here. The existing provisions of section 5(1) of the 1999 Act, which I restate in the proposed replacement section, already permits the arrest of persons against whom a deportation order is enforced on various grounds. The proposed text of the new section 5(11) of the 1999 Act permits entry to a dwelling for the purpose of making the arrest. The provision follows very closely the term of section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999. That section also permits entry to a premises without a warrant. In both cases there are safeguards in that the consent of the occupier will be required, save where the person to be arrested normally resides there or the immigration officer or member of An Garda Síochána believes on reasonable grounds that the person is within the dwelling. Clearly, the provision does not permit speculative entry without consent. It should also, therefore, be borne in mind that if a person leaves the State when he or she is supposed to this situation does not arise.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	My information is that the grouping comprises all Government amendments, with the exception of amendment No. 231 in the name of Senator Denis O'Donovan.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Senator is making a reasonable point.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is a timing issue. Amendment No. 230 has to be passed. Our intention is to not move the amendment and then come back to it at a later stage.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This is a group of Government amendments relating to the use of the term "legal assistance" instead of "free legal assistance", as used in the published version of the Bill. The term "legal assistance" is defined in section 2 of the Bill as including legal aid legal advice. Therefore, we are adjusting the wording across the Bill to reflect this.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	These Government amendments are correcting cross-references and numbers across the Bill and, therefore, are of a technical nature.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will go through the responses. The view is not to accept amendment No. 6. The term "Representative" is not used in the Bill and therefore does not need to be defined in section 2. The only reference in the Bill is to a legal representative, which is defined. Amendment No. 7 refers to page 10, line 27. Is that correct? I need your assistance, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I can give an individual answer to each amendment, but unfortunately my answers are detailed in respect of their position in the Bill and their numbering. I may need your guidance.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will address amendment No. 7 first. The relevant term does not need to be defined. It is not a term used in the text of the Bill. All children who arrive in the State are protected by the provisions of the Bill and the best interests of the child are paramount. Amendment No. 8 is next. The Bill reflects the EU directive in respect of where a stateless person is not defined and therefore the amendment is not being accepted. I will not accept amendment No. 19. The applicant will be asked his or her date of birth as part of his or her initial interview. That is how the situation will be dealt with. Amendment No. 20 is next in the grouping. My view and the view of the Department is not to accept the amendment. We are concerned that the suggested amendment is too narrow. A child may be accompanied by a responsible person. That is not covered in the suggested amended text. Amendment No. 26 would replace “information” and substitute “information, including legal advice” as the basis on which the Child and Family Agency shall arrange for the appointment of an employee or other person to make an application for international protection on behalf of a child in respect of whom he or she is providing care and protection. This reflects the reality that legal advice may be relevant in the operation of the subsection by the agency in respect of an individual child. Amendment No. 27 is next in the group. Is that correct?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I do not have a note on that matter. I am awaiting a note on that amendment. The Department's view is to accept this. The paragraph should be amended to include the legal advice. I want to ensure I have that absolutely correct.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I want to be certain I have the right amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	My notes refer to lines 36 and 37, but it is the same amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I do not have a note on that matter. I might come back to amendment No. 27, if that is okay. Amendment No. 136 refers to page 39. Is that correct?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The idea is that section 34(3) already provides that interviews shall be conducted by persons who are sufficiently competent to take account of the personal or general circumstances surrounding the applicant's origin or vulnerability. We will not accept the amendment. Amendment No. 138 is next. The idea is that section 35(c) provides that the report of the personal interview, together with the report under section 38 in respect of the child's application, is prepared by a person with the necessary knowledge of the special needs of minors.Amendment No. 142 is-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The view is that the section provides that the report of the personal interview, together with the report under section 38 in respect of the child’s application, is prepared by a person with the necessary knowledge of the special needs of minors. It may be emphasis or it may be terminology, but the view is that the Bill, as is, is sufficient in that regard. The next amendment is amendment No. 138.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 142 is-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The view is that-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The view is that section 34(3) already provides that interviews shall be conducted by persons who are sufficiently competent to take account of the personal or general circumstances surrounding the applicant's application or applicant's origin or vulnerability. Section 35 provides that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I think that is amendments Nos. 141, 142-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes. Amendment No. 142 affects line 12.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will not accept the amendment because section 35 already deals with these issues.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	As Senator Ivana Bacik has outlined, the entire thrust of the Bill is that the best interests of the child or unaccompanied minor is absolutely to the forefront of what we are trying to achieve. I understand the sentiments behind the amendments that were tabled and have no issue with them. However, we have confidence that the Bill is robust in that respect and will serve the best interests of the child or unaccompanied minor in all circumstances. While I appreciate that everybody across the House wants to ensure the Bill is absolutely robust, as has been stated by Senator Ivana Bacik and others, the Bill is framed in that context already. Therefore, individual amendments to underline that fact are not necessary. The Bill does that in its entire form.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am minded that many of these amendments are focused on the status of children. I am not in a position to accept the amendment because the Bill reflects the EU directive where a stateless person is not defined. However, I concur with many of the sentiments that Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh has outlined. The entire composition of the working group that was established to investigate and report back on conditions and the entire nature of direct provision has the rights of children and child welfare at its very heart. In fact, the composition of NGOs and individuals who took part in the working group was central. I will comment on one of the issues that has been outlined by the Senator already, when he spoke about welfare payments that are made to children in direct provision. It is my understanding that the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Justice and Equality are making arrangements to work proactively, in a very short space of time, to ensure the recommendations made in the working group's report on those payments are followed through in very short order. I can appreciate where he is coming from. The idea that a child in the protection system would live in a direct provision centre for years on end is not something we can stand over, and that is the point of this Bill, although there has been criticism of it today.The point is that this issue has been kicked around in these Houses for 12 years or more. A section of the wider Bill has been removed in order to deal with the protection issue.  Senators should be aware that the number of new asylum applications in Ireland is rising again. Applications which numbered in the hundreds in recent years are now in the thousands as a result of the biggest movement of people since the Second World War. The Bill is seeking to change, reform and fix a broken system. The aim is to ensure anyone who seeks protection in this country is dealt with in a speedy and humane fashion. That is the intention of the Bill and children are at the heart of that intention. I concur with the Senator on one point in the context of the referendum that was held in 2004. My party and the Senator's party stood in opposition to that move at the time but the provision is enshrined in the Constitution now and that is the reality of the situation. At that time, the Senator may recall, some of the sentiments expressed were shocking. I remember an Irish-African family were reportedly booed in a polling station when they went to cast their vote. Some of what was said during that referendum campaign, at the height of the boom, was remarkable. It was an unfortunate move on the part of the then Government but in terms of asylum and immigration policy and a collective will to reform this area, no political party in these Houses is standing on an anti-immigration, far-right platform. It is to the credit of this democracy that we do not have the types of debates that are happening in other parts of Europe. We should try to hold onto that and build on it because we cannot be complacent in that regard. These are my comments on the amendment but my commitment to the Senator, in terms of the payments, is that there will be clarity on that matter from the Department of Social Protection very soon.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Again, I concur with the sentiments expressed by Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh and understand the motivation behind his amendment. However, the technical reality is that children in direct provision are currently in a legal lacuna, as no application for protection can be made on their behalf, but section 15(3) of the Bill addresses that issue.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I reject that assertion because I have visited approximately 14 direct provision centres and statistics show that since the publication of the working group report, its recommendations are being implemented. The number of asylum applications that have been processed and leave to remain permissions granted has grown by around 60% in that period of time. The recommendations of the report are being implemented. There have been approximately 80 deportation orders revoked since July. The direct provision working group report is being implemented. Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh asked for an outline of the number of recommendations being built on within the Bill and I can go through them now if the Senator wishes, although I know we do not have much time left and must deal with many amendments. My commitment to the Senator and this House is that the scandal of direct provision, in terms of the length of time people are living in those centres, will be addressed. The report of the direct provision working group is the only game in town. It is the only document that we are working off. That is the report and it is being implemented.  If the Senator visits the direct provision centres, he will meet families who are getting their papers and who have seen a change in the speed with which the Department operates. An additional €6 million was allocated in the budget to facilitate the recruitment of extra staff to carry out these duties and the statistics show that what we sought to achieve is being achieved. Those who have been more than five years in the direct provision system are having their applications worked on and processed faster. I am glad to see that the rates for people being granted leave to remain have greatly increased and deportation orders have been rescinded in the numbers that I have already outlined. People in direct provision centres know it is happening and I am glad to be part of the process. I am also glad that these Houses have stood up to the plate collectively, as a political entity, to make it happen and it is happening.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	They are very different things.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Changed and scrapped are two very different things.
