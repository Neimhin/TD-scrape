AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There is something sadly inevitable about this debate and the controversy in which the Tánaiste finds himself. I was hoping that today he would stop treating those in the political system and the people of Ireland like fools. He has chosen not to stop. His explanation is just not credible. He waltzed in here this evening and to the cheers of his party colleagues equated giving this document to his friend to exchanging documentation as part of the Northern Ireland peace process. He seems to want to paint himself as a victim. He said there is nothing inappropriate about informal contacts of this nature per se. He said that friends, acquaintances and supporters may claim to be closer to him than they really are, and that this is clearly a big part of the story. Of course it is a big part of the story. It is the entirety of the story. As Taoiseach, with the immense responsibility placed on him, the Tánaiste handed a document stamped "CONFIDENTIAL" to a friend of his who asked for it and who was the head of a rival organisation to the Irish Medical Organisation. The Tánaiste has said with a straight face that he was trying to enhance the possibility of this deal getting over the line. I want to ask the Tánaiste about the nature of his relationship with Dr. Maitiú Ó Tuathail. Has he communicated with him since the story broke on Saturday or since he became aware of it?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It would not be too much of a jump to suggest that either in the Tánaiste's mind or in Dr. Ó Tuathail's mind, or from the point of view of people hearing what the Tánaiste has just said, statements coming from the Tánaiste and Dr. Ó Tuathail were co-ordinated over the weekend. The Tánaiste sent out his statement after a full day of putting it together. Dr. Ó Tuathail sent out his statement the next day. The Tánaiste spoke to Dr. Ó Tuathail three times about the statements both parties were going to release.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Tánaiste's judgment is really being called into question here. He is in the middle of a huge controversy about inappropriately handing someone a document that he should not have had, and he is chatting to him about it.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In a message to his colleague Dr. Ó Tuathail wrote "Leo constantly pulling strings for me. You’ve no idea". Is he over-egging the nature of his relationship with the Tánaiste? What are these strings which Dr. Ó Tuathail suggests the Tánaiste pulls for him constantly?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Tánaiste said in his speech that he finds some of the allegations against him "offensive". A lot of people in Ireland would find it offensive for the Taoiseach to give his pal a document he should not have. Let us move on. I still find it remarkable that the Tánaiste decided to make contact with this individual over the weekend. The Tánaiste sent him a document. Was anybody else involved in sending this document? 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Did the Tánaiste's PA know what was in it?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Tánaiste managed to put somebody else in an impossible situation in which they were sending a document which was not for circulation. Did the Tánaiste instruct her to do this? Did he ask her to do it? He must understand what he did. The words "CONFIDENTIAL - NOT FOR CIRCULATION" were written on the document. The Tánaiste asked his PA to send it to Dr. Ó Tuathail. Did he ask her or instruct her? Was she in a position to say "No"?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is like the Northern Ireland peace process.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is according to the Tánaiste's speech. Has the Tánaiste or anyone in his office ever given a document marked "confidential" to a person or body in a manner which was "not best practice", to use the Tánaiste's own words, before this instance or since?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Earlier today the Taoiseach said that the Tánaiste said "No" to him. He also said "No" in answer to Deputy Pearse Doherty's question. When he answered my question, maybe because of the way I worded it, he said it had not happened to his knowledge. What is the Tánaiste's answer, "No" or "Not to my knowledge"?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am asking on the basis of the kind of operation he runs - his close advisers, his circle, the one or two people he has had around him for years and years. Has a confidential document been sent in a manner which was not best practice, either with or without his knowledge?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We are getting a "to the best of my knowledge" answer again, whereas the Tánaiste previously stated "No" and the Taoiseach previously stated "No".
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	As has been outlined, the former Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, was asked for this document and he basically said "No". Why does the Tánaiste think the Minister for Health said "No"? Why did he say "Yes"? Why did Dr. Ó Tuathail write, "To be fair. Leo always delivers"?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There are a million and one holes in that tale. The NAGP was a basket case. It was not a credible organisation at that stage. The previous year, its entire council had resigned. Within weeks of the Tánaiste giving it this document, it had collapsed in on top of itself. Its motivation in getting this document was not to promote the document. That is obvious because it did not promote the document. In the words of Dr. Maitiú Ó Tuathail himself, "no doubt it will take the wind from the IMO's sails... I would love to destroy IMO too." Is it not really the case that the NAGP was falling apart? There were all sorts of questions about its corporate governance, its dealings and how it managed its affairs. It was getting desperate. As the Tánaiste has acknowledged, it began to threaten him and members of his party. The Tánaiste helped his pal who asked for the document. Either the Tánaiste is complicit or he is a stooge. Which is it?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Again, the Labour Party finds utterly incredible the Tánaiste's explanation to this House and the Irish people that what he was trying to do was to promote the agreement, an agreement the NAGP did not promote among its members and which some of the NAGP members were saying it would use against the IMO. There are references in the text messages to what it was going to do with the 17 roadshows the IMO had planned. The Tánaiste stepped outside his area of responsibility. He stepped into a negotiated deal between the Minister for Health, the IMO and the HSE. It was a sensible enough agreement which was not signed off on for another month when it came to the acceptance of the members. The Tánaiste's buddy or pal, the guy with the Leo t-shirt, asked him for a copy of it and he said "Yes". Does the Tánaiste not feel that either he was reckless in his behaviour, considering the organisation with which he was involved, or that his explanation to the House this evening has no credibility whatsoever?
