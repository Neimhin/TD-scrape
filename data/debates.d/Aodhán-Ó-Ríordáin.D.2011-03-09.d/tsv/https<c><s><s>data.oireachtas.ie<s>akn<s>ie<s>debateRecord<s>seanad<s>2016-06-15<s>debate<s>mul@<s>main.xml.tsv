AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to address the House. I have just returned from Paris where I spent a few days and want to advise Members of this House that we should be very proud of the travelling supporters who are doing the country's name great service as supporters of the Republic of Ireland soccer team and also the supporters of the Northern Ireland soccer team in the European championship. I extend best wishes to them. I wish to raise two issues. I was taken aback by the response of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to Senator Lynn Ruane's Commencement matter today on the nature of addiction and drugs issues. It appears that the Minister is intending to separate the Misuse of Drugs Act into two pieces of legislation, which I do not think is necessary. What is needed in this House is a more elongated debate on the nature of addiction, drugs and drug crime and to put the issues on a proper footing, which would be in keeping with the international move towards decriminalisation and having a health rather than a criminal justice response.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On my second point, I stood in this House on a number of occasions as Minister of State and what impressed me most about it was that it stood and spoke with one voice. The House was never more powerful than it was on the issue of direct provision. I believe Members will know, regardless of their political background, that this House was very impressive and managed to move that debate onto a higher platform when Members all stood together and tried to move the issue along. Once again, I was very taken aback when I saw a deletion from the programme for Government. It was a line from the draft programme for Government which referred to implementation of the McMahon report. Many Members of this House had difficulties with the report and possibly felt it did not go far enough. They believe the direct provision system should have been abolished, but at least the McMahon report was the first proper report on the direct provision system in 15 years and it would have gone a long way towards helping the lives of those in the system. The recommendation made in the draft programme for Government that the McMahon report be implemented was deleted and does not feature in the actual programme for Government. I ask that the House again use its campaigning zeal to seek reform of the direct provision system. Collectively and regardless of political backgrounds, all Members believe these reforms and the McMahon report need to be implemented in full.
