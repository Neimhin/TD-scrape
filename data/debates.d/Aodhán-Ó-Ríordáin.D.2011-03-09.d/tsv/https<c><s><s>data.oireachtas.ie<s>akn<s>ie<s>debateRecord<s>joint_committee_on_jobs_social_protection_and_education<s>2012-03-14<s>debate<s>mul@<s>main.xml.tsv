AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the delegation for its attendance and presentations.  I have a brief point regarding the issue of unregistered teachers versus unqualified teachers.  There is a big difference between the two.  It is my experience as a former primary school principal that there are occasions when principals in certain parts of the country are desperate to get anybody to stand in front of a class, look after children and stay with them, especially anyone who has any qualification to fulfil those duties.  If that person happens to be retired, that can be the reality many principals face.  Otherwise they must split up the class, thereby impacting on the children.  We need to have a realistic debate about retired teachers.  I do not believe a retired teacher should ever be chosen over a newly qualified person who wants to get into the profession and improve his or her skills.  However, we must recognise that sometimes newly qualified teachers do not want to go into certain schools.  If there is a retired teacher who is familiar with the school, the type of school or the children concerned and who can look after them in a particular way, that should be recognised.I refer, briefly, to redeployment.  The characteristic spirit or ethos of certain schools was discussed and how a particular teacher might not match that ethos.  Will the delegates give an indication as to what type of teacher would not match the characteristic ethos of a particular school?  Why is it so important?Again, on redeployment, I am aware of a situation where a certain bishop is in charge of a panel in a certain part of the country.  He does not accept transfers, he refuses them.  If a person is from a particular part of the country and wants to transfer to the area in question he or she cannot because the bishop says, "No".  Surely we need to have an open investigation into how panels should be organised and how redeployment can happen.  It should not come down to one individual giving a blanket "No" to every transfer that comes across his desk.
