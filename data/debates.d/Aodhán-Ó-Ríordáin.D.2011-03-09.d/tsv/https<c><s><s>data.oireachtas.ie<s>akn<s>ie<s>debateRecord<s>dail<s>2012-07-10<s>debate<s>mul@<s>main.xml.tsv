AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I have raised this matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, previously and he has engaged with the IIF, but not enough is being done.  Last night, I met residents in the Artane area who were still suffering the consequences of floods in 2008 and 2009 and on 24 October 2011.  If one cannot get house insurance, one's home is effectively worthless, as no incoming buyer can get a mortgage without house insurance.This situation is out of the control of residents.  Many of the areas were not affected in the 2002 Dublin floods and whatever has since occurred is probably a question for the local authority, but the residents are unable to get flood insurance for their homes.  Will the Minister of State ask the IIF to engage more readily with local authorities in finding solutions to the flooding problems that clearly still exist?  This is not just a local constituency issue, given the fact that the situation in Cork is on many people's minds as well.  The problem affects other constituencies.  The city council does not seem to be undertaking a process to reach a solution in respect of the River Naniken in Artane.  Will the Minister of State update us on the councils' negotiations with the IIF?  Residents need house insurance if their homes are not to be made worthless by a situation that is beyond their control.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The indication is that the IIF, while making underwriting decisions on insurance, considers the claims history of the property and any flood protection measures implemented by the Office of Public Works, OPW, and local authorities.  Clanmoyle Road in Donnycarney is an example in my constituency and I am quite sure it is replicated nationwide.  Extensive works have been done by the city council but the position has not changed for those householders.  The council has indicated to me that a hydraulic analysis of the River Naniken is required but there is no funding to do it.  What happens then?  Works are required but there are no funds, although applications have been made to the OPW with little success.  What is the householder to do when there is a need identified by the city council but works have not been carried out and people are left with no home insurance?I ask the Minister of State to engage again with the insurance federation, the local authorities and the Office of Public Works to ensure that any identified needs necessary to expedite this problem can be carried out.  When a process is place, the works can be presented to the Irish Insurance Federation.  This cannot carry on and residents in my constituency and throughout the country should not be looking at dark clouds and wondering if the problem will happen again.  That is the exactly what is happening in my constituency and I am sure it is the same in other Deputies' areas.
