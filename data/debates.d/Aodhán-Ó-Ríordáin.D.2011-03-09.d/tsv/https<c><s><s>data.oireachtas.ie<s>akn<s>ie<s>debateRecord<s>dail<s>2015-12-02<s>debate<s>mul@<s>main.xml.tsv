AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputies for their contributions, many of which I have much support for and some of which were a little bit off tone. Several years ago, Deputies Ciara Conway, Dominic Hannigan and John Lyons, Senator Ivana Bacik and I came together to draft legislation to amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act 1998.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Over several years, painstakingly, through the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Office of the Attorney General, with amendments and counter-amendments and discussion from all sides of the Houses, we have come to the position today where we can amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 to remove the chilling effect for people who work in religious-run State institutions which are-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is not my intention.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is absolutely not my intention.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Shortall took half an hour for her contribution and I find her recent conversion to a liberal Ireland quite fascinating.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The point is on the amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On the amendment itself, the point is that this is the vehicle which we are trying to achieve tonight. What has been brought into this vehicle of amending legislation is an issue concerning the Equality Act. I have a huge amount of sympathy with the points made and what campaigners such as Paddy Monahan, John Suttle and others, who I have been dealing with and speaking to over a number of years, are doing, but there are technical reasons this amendment cannot be accepted.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is not my intention in any way to talk down any clock. I am trying to give the House the time and the decency of the explanation that has been prepared to have a decent and proper understanding of what we are trying to achieve. As an aside, as someone who has been the focal point of heavy criticism in Catholic, right-wing and conservative newspapers and who has been shouted about and criticised from pulpits in churches across the land, I find it remarkable that somehow my or my Department's analysis of this legislation is considered to be coming from a conservative viewpoint. I ask the Deputies to allow me the time to give a constitutional angle and the technical reasons for our arguments.  The objective of the amendment is to provide for the repeal of the current section 7(3)(c) in its entirety. Section 7 generally prohibits discrimination in respect of the admission policy operated by an educational establishment except where it is a primary or post-primary school operating in an environment which promotes certain religious values. In such circumstances, under subsection 7(3)(c) the school may favour the enrolment of students from a particular religious denomination in preference to others or refuse to admit a student who is not of that denomination. However, any preferential admission policy in this regard is only permitted to the extent it is essential to maintaining the religious ethos of the particular school.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The provision reflects the freedom of religion guaranteed in Article 44 of the Constitution as interpreted by the Superior Courts and, in particular, the right of every religious denomination to manage its own affairs and maintain institutions for religious or charitable purposes. I am advised that deleting this provision would infringe that freedom of religion for religiously run institutions.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The broader issue of school admission policies and the creation of greater choice for parents who do not want a religious education for their children is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills. As Deputies will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, is addressing these issues in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----and that is where the issues surrounding school admission policies will be addressed as well as by creating real choice for parents through putting a wider variety of schools in place. For that reason, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I can give a further explanation if required by Deputies.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It will take a number of moments but Deputies may accuse me of running down the clock.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It was argued in the Article 26 referral hearing of the Employment Equality Bill 1996 that what became section 31 contravened the guarantees of freedom of conscience and free profession and practice of religion contained in Article 44.2.1°-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----and that it contravened the ban on imposing any disabilities or making any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status. Effectively, not to delay the issue further, the point is that a constitutional issue is at play here. It is not in any way our intention to have a situation persist where children are precluded from attending their local school. It is my firm belief and personal view that the issue at the heart of the education system is that it is one which is dominated by patronage and not child-centred.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	However, that is not an issue for this Bill. This Bill is purely to amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----and other sections to ensure that the chilling effect on members of the LGBT community, divorcees and single parents who work in our schools and hospitals under religious patronage can be eliminated. I am proud of this Bill-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----having spent four years of my career-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----along with other Deputies in the Labour Party-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----bringing it to to the eventuality it will become tonight.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	At 9 p.m., that chilling effect ends.
