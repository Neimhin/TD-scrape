AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I must apologise for my voice which has been affected by some dental work, but I will try to struggle through. I wish to raise the important issue of the new referral procedure for children in the north side of Dublin to the Mater child and adolescent mental health service. Mater CAMHS deals with the mental health needs of children aged from birth to 16 in Dublin North-Central. Sixteen and 17 year olds are also continuing to use the service. Dublin postcodes 1, 3 and parts of 7, 9, 11 and 6, Dublin North-West, Glasnevin and part of Cabra are also covered. The services provided are psychiatry, clinical psychology, social work, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, administration, registrars in child psychiatry, trainees and students in all disciplines.  The referral process is for children from birth to 16 years with persistent mental health problems such as emotional, behavioural, developmental and other psychiatric disorders. It also concerns problems that impact on functioning at home, in school or in relationships that have not been resolved by primary care level intervention, including the National Educational Psychological Service. We are talking about deliberate self-harm, suicidal thinking, depression, mood disorder, complex and severe anxiety, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, significant emotional and behavioural difficulties, post-traumatic stress disorder, complex behavioural problems, conduct disorder, complex behavioural response, psychosis, eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder and complex developmental problems. Local school principals dealing with these very vulnerable children in an acutely disadvantaged area, which is the team A area in Dublin North-Central, are being told they can only get referrals to use the Mater CAMHS service through their local general practitioner. Children in Dublin 2 or 4 can therefore be referred by their local school principal, but children in Dublin 1 and 3 have to go through their GP. This is completely unfair, unwarranted and unnecessary. We are asking school principals to bring a parent and child to their local GP before they can make an essential and sometimes immediate intervention to save a child's mental health or potentially save a child's life. People working within the service are saying this is completely unworkable. Why is a child in Dublin 1 being treated differently from a child in Dublin 2 or 4? The referral process should be uniform throughout the system. Will the Minister ensure principals in the team A area for Mater CAMHS will continue to be allowed to refer vulnerable children to this most important service?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for his response. I note he said that "the service can confirm that in advance of its referral criteria being brought in line with national policy, it will continue to consider all referrals, including those from schools". The problem though is that the Mater CAMHS is telling local school principals something different. While people within the service are quietly telling principals that they think this is unworkable and they want the previous criteria to remain, the Minister's message and the message local principals are getting from Mater CAMHS are two very different things. I ask the Minister to ensure local schools dealing with these vulnerable children are aware they can still refer such children to the local Mater CAMHS and that the situation has not changed. Will the Minister also communicate that to the service itself? We do not want mixed messages to be coming from the Minister and the local Mater CAMHS. According to a presentation for principals by that service, the HSE is recommending that referrals come through the local GP. Two very different messages are coming out here, so we need clarity. We are dealing with very vulnerable children in serious situations who will potentially need life-saving interventions.We cannot play around with words in the circumstances. Principals and school communities need to know what protections they have and what line of responsibility they have. Mixed messages from CAMHS or the Department do not help. If the Minister could clarify the matter or ensure that it is clarified, it would be deeply appreciated.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Why do I have confidence in the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter? I have confidence in the way he is closing St. Patrick's Institution for Young Offenders and ending slopping out in Mountjoy Prison. I have confidence in the way he has criminalised forced labour and his belief in equality, especially in the areas of women's health and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, LGBT, rights in the workplace and society. I have confidence in the legislation he introduces, especially in the area of personal insolvency, and his decision to introduce a Garda authority. However, some of my confidence in the Minister has been shaken by the handling of this issue in recent months, the matter of direct provision centres, the potential of the legal services Bill to prevent top barristers and solicitors taking on pro bono work because of the multidisciplinary structures it will apply and the delay in properly recognising Traveller ethnicity. Much work remains to be done and more reform is needed. While I have confidence that the Minister can achieve this, some areas need his urgent attention.
