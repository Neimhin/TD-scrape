AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I join others who have raised the issue of the availability of Spinraza and welcome the decision made by NHS England, the chief executive of which, Mr. Simon Stevens, said: "This promising treatment has the potential to be life changing for children and their families." Obviously, he is referring to children who suffer from SMA. I have received messages from families who believe they are being managed in the run-up to the local and European elections on 24 May, given the absence of the announcement on this matter that was due to take place this week. As stated, Ireland and Estonia are the only two EU countries that do not fund this treatment. As other Senators stated, we need to have an honest debate about the matter. I know that such situations are not easy to deal with, that the Government has to strike a deal and that the process can be difficult, but the lives the children are leading are extremely difficult, much more difficult than anybody can possibly imagine. Therefore, a debate on the availability of Spinraza would be greatly appreciated. I understand there will be another protest next week on 22 May calling on the Government to fund the provision of Spinraza. I refer to a shooting in Donaghmede yesterday. Unfortunately, a shooting outside a shopping centre at 5.20 p.m. or early in the evening does not seem to receive much media attention anymore. That is a shocking indictment of our society. Shots were fired outside Donaghmede Shopping Centre at 5.20 p.m. yesterday. The Government is almost disinterested in crime levels in that part of the city. Whenever we raise the issue in this House, as I have done on countless occasions, I am told that the provision of Garda resources and the potential construction of a new Garda station in the hugely expanding area of Donaghmede, Clongriffin and Belmayne are not matters for decision by the Minister but by the Garda Commissioner, yet when the assistant Garda Commissioner said there was absolutely no justification for the reopening of Stepaside Garda station, Cabinet Ministers were able to make it their business to open it. Why is Stepaside more important than an area on the northside when it comes to the provision of Garda resources? Shots being fired at 5.20 p.m. outside of a shopping centre in Donaghmede is not normal. Shootings do not happen in a normal society and they cannot be treated as normal. It is not a case of business as usual because anybody could be caught in the crossfire. With the greatest of respect, I ask the Deputy Leader to facilitate a discussion in this House with the Minister for Justice and Equality on crime in the capital city.
