AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the gentlemen for attending the committee.  I would like to make points on macroeconomic policies and on youth unemployment.  However, I will start with a criticism because I note the document talks about the partnership years and how the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and member unions were strongly critical of deregulation and so on.  It states that voices were heard but seldom heeded and it was provided with opportunities to express its contrary views on privatisation.  I have a criticism of unions which now say they were not heard or listened to during the partnership process.  I wonder why they stuck around because during that time when inequality was deepening and there were 150,000 people on the live register, 50,000 of whom were long-term unemployed, there were  opportunities to offer an opposing viewpoint but that was not done.  It is difficult when we have gone through the process and have had an economic crash to listen to union leaders criticise Government policy when those union leaders were sitting at the partnership table eyeballing and swapping croissants with Bertie Ahern and various Ministers during the boom time.Having said that, I would like to ask specific questions on the macroeconomic situation.  I was at a meeting on Monday morning with some employers.  It was a jobs roadshow and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, were in Clontarf Castle to talk about the jobs action plan.  One of the points raised was the need to focus on import substitution.  Rather than talk about exports so much, we need to talk about import substitution, as in the production line and the manufacturing line, and about substituting in the domestic economy that which is being imported.  Are there any comments on that issue?On the issue of broadening the tax base, I ask the witnesses to discuss their reference to a higher tax regime.  Given that many employers say they are subventing local government in terms of commercial rates, water charges and so on, is Congress in favour of a property charge to take the pressure off the commercial sector?  My view is that a fair and progressive property charge is a wealth tax and is the most effective way of implementing such a tax.The issues of youth unemployment and young men have not received enough focus.  It should be noted that young men are not succeeding as well as they should.  It is not a young man versus a young woman situation but it is an issue.What are the views of the witnesses in respect of the national literacy strategy, implemented by Government, and the new SOLAS proposals, the further education proposals and VEC proposals and their likely effects?
