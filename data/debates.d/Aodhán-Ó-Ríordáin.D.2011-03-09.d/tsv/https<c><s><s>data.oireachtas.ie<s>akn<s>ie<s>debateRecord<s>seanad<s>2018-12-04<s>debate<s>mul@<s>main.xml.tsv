AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoirleach agus leis an Aire féin as a bheith anseo go pearsanta chun an t-ábhar seo a phlé liom. An tseachtain seo caite bhí mé istigh i nGaelscoil Cholmcille. Bhíodar ag ceiliúradh Bliain na Gaeilge agus bhí mé an-tógtha leis an méid a bhí ar siúl ann, idir cheol, drámaíocht agus amhránaíocht. Gach uair a bhím i láthair sa scoil ar Bhóthar Oscar Traynor cuireann an fhoireann ar fad ina luí orm go bhfuil sé thar am dóibh foirgneamh buan a bheith acu. Tá siad ag feitheamh anois níos mó ná 20 bliain. Cé go raibh an méid sin amhránaíochta agus drámaíochta agus ceol ar siúl ag na páistí, bhí sé soiléir do gach duine go raibh na háiseanna agus an halla atá acu i bhfad ró-bheag don scoil sin. Tá an scoil ag iarraidh fáis agus dul i méid agus tá an-chuid daoine ag iarraidh a bheith ag freastal ar an scoil ach tá an scoil ag fanacht níos mó ná 20 bliain ar fhoirgneamh nua. Gaelscoil Cholmcille is doing fantastic work. It is a very popular local primary school. Last week I visited the school again and it was impressed upon me once more the fact it is waiting more than 20 years for a permanent building. There is a site next door which Dublin City Council has plans to develop. The long-term solution is right there facing the school. The school is adamant that a process be put in place and that it would have a chance to maximise its potential as a primary school. I know the Minister will share with me his vision that every child will attend a school with a permanent building and can look to the future with a level of confidence. The confidence within the school has been ebbing away over the last number of years. When there are announcements of new schools being developed and recognised - nobody has an issue with this - this school seems to be on the end of the list when it comes to achieving what it wants to achieve. I am interested in hearing the Minister's reply. While he is new to his post, the Irish language is of particular importance to him and he wants to do what is best for everyone. On behalf of the parents, staff and board of management of Gaelscoil Cholmcille, I note that a positive response would be greatly appreciated.

The Minister can appreciate how disappointing it is from the school's point of view, having waited so long for a permanent building only to get an indication from the Department that it does not foresee an opportunity to replace the building because it is a two-storey semi-permanent structure with a lifespan of 25 to 30 years. I accept what the Minister says about the two permanent classrooms but I note that there is a site beside the school which is to be developed by Dublin City Council. It is a major development with potential for 500 housing units. There is a perfect opportunity here for the Department to engage with Dublin City Council regarding the site in order to find a permanent answer for the needs of this school. I implore the Minister. To say that a temporary building has a 25 to 30-year lifespan, considering that it is already ten years old, does not provide much succour to the people who care about the school. I ask that the Department engages with Dublin City Council to find a long-term solution for this much-loved and needed school in this community. I ask the Minister to engage more imaginatively to find a permanent solution. This school and its current and future pupils deserve no less.
