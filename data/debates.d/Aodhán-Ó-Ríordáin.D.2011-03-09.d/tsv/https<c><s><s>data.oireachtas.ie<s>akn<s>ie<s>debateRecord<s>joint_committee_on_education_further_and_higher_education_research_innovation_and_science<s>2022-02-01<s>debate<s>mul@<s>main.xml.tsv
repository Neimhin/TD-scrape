AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for their attendance. This is my legislation.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am just grateful to the Houses of the Oireachtas for facilitating a Bill like this. It was chosen through the random-selection process as a Private Members' Bill on a Thursday evening and the Minister gave 12 months for it to be assessed, and here we are. It is a great credit to the Oireachtas that a Bill like this can get to this point. I will start with a point of agreement. All of us agree that it is better that children should access a local school and that no criteria should ever have to be needed to differentiate between children.However, if I were to ask any of the people here, whether the members, the witnesses or the secretariat, what school their fathers and mothers or grandfathers and grandmothers went to, they would probably feel that was an irrelevant question and would perhaps be slightly insulted by it because I might be perceived as trying to paint a picture of who there are. I understand that this provision in the legislation was included because of the lobbying by the fee-paying sector, which wanted to maintain some sort of royal line of succession within their school communities. It is up to them to undertake that lobbying and for them to answer as to why they wanted to do it. The argument that this approach is one that not many schools adopt does not stand up. To suggest, based on experience, that only about 15 schools are adhering to or enforcing this approach, then that is still 15 schools too many. For people living in the communities around those 15 schools, it is irrelevant to them if they are on the rough side of this discussion. Everyone should enter the school admissions process as equal citizens in this republic. It should not matter where someone’s father went to school or who he was. It is completely offensive to the equality agenda of a republic for consideration to be given to the school that someone’s father or mother went to, or, indeed, the school that someone’s grandfather or grandmother went to. It is absolutely offensive. How is anybody expected to compete for a place in those circumstances? I accept that we should not have a situation where young people are competing for places, but how are they supposed to compete for a place or try to access a place on an equal basis, if they are not from the area or the country or if their parents or grandparents did not attend secondary school? What if this were to be the only opportunity that someone’s family has ever had to break out of a cycle of educational disadvantage, attend secondary school and in that way break out of disadvantage? Yet a person in that situation could be disadvantaged in trying to enter that school because his or her father or grandfather did not go to it. It is so patently elitist and wrong that I cannot believe that anyone would try to defend it on any level whatsoever.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This provision was included in the legislation because of lobbying from a certain cohort that wanted it to be put under the radar. When the 2018 Act was passed, it was progressive legislation and most attention was paid to the abolition of the baptism barrier. We all felt it was progressive legislation, but I made these arguments in the Seanad when it went through. I was voted down and that is what happens. We are now in a position, however, where we are asking people to defend it. I cannot, for the life of me, understand how the best argument that people can come up with is that not many schools actually use this criterion now. Other schools could use it and all schools could use it, if they wanted to do so. Every school could say to child A versus child B that the father of child A went to the school. A great deal of inequality in Ireland is based on education. Nothing perpetuates inequality more than the Irish education system. Much of it comes down to what schools people have gone to, the advantages they have had, the area they have come from, etc. The committee will have to tackle the issue. To enshrine inequality in legislation, however, and to give more rights to those families who have had the advantage of attending secondary school, because their parents or grandparents did, is offensive to the idea of a republic. It is offensive to the idea of an education system that lifts everybody. Therefore, the argument that this type of approach does not really happen very often is a ridiculous one to my mind. I return to the situation of those children who need education more than anybody else. The possibility that such children would be asked even once in any process where their parents or grandparents went to school or that such a situation could arise in any circumstances in any school is something that should not be in any legislation and especially not in a proposed Bill on school admissions.Those are my views. I will be interested to hear what the witnesses have to say. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am happy with the response. I would again like to point out that even if this only affects a small number of people, for them it is overwhelmingly significant. The defence is that this is not normally utilised within the school experience. If someone is on the rough end of this it does not matter how many schools across the country use it or not. The school that person wanted to attend did use it and the fact that his or her parent or grandparent did not attend the school was the reason he or she did not get in. That potentially has a life-forming impact. While we may say it is only a handful of schools, it could grow and grow. The fact it is there in legislation gives it legitimacy. There is legitimacy from the Houses of the Oireachtas to discriminate on the basis of what school someone's parents or grandparents went to. I know I might be using strong language here but I do find it offensive. There is a middle Ireland assumption that everybody's grandparents went to secondary school or that everybody's parents went to secondary school but not everybody's did, including those from outside the area or the country or from a tradition where their grandparents or parents were not afforded that opportunity. This goes to the core of what inequality really feels like. Middle Ireland needs to understand that. Those overseeing the management of our schools and our education system need to understand that too.
