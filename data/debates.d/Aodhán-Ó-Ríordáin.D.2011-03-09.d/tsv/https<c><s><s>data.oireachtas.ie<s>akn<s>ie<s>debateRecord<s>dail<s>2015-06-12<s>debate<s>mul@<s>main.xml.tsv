AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy McGrath for giving me the opportunity to address the issues associated with the Bill he has published. The provision of sustainable water services is of critical importance to citizens and the economy of our country. As Members will be aware, modernising and improving water services delivery in Ireland is a key policy objective in the programme for Government. The establishment of Irish Water has been one of the most significant elements among a wide range of public sector reform measures achieved by the Government. The move towards the utility model will deliver major benefits to our people and to our economy in a number of ways, notably through providing a more structured and co-ordinated approach to the delivery of water services on a national basis; achieving economies of scale in service delivery and more efficient procurement of materials and services; reducing unacceptable levels of waste from the drinking water distribution system with an estimated 40% of treated drinking water being unaccounted for prior to the establishment of Irish Water; and reducing the overall costs of delivering water services. The establishment of Irish Water within Bord Gáis Éireann, which has now been renamed Ervia, was an important step in assisting the utility to leverage the existing core expertise available to Bord Gáis as a modern and efficiently run utility. Ervia and Irish Water estimate that establishing Irish Water within the BGE group has saved potentially tens of millions of euro. In the longer term, the establishment of Irish Water will lead to a more efficient service due to economies of scale, and to a higher quality and more resilient service due to increased capacity to invest and innovate. The reform of water services is not only important to delivering better value for money to our citizens but is also critical to supporting economic development and growth. By 2030, the world is expected to need 40% more water than will be available. We are distinct from most countries due to the level of fresh water available, a benefit we can turn to our advantage by creating a world class water sector that can attract water-intensive industries such as ICT, pharma-chem and agrifood to Ireland. These industries already sustain well over 200,000 jobs between them. This Bill aims to amend the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 to provide for the following: Irish Water to be subject to freedom of information legislation; creating a dedicated independent ombudsman for resolving disputes related to Irish Water; ensuring that Irish Water will not be transferred to private ownership or public private partnership without such ownership or partnership being put before the people via referendum; and requiring that the Minister direct Irish Water, within two years of its establishment, to provide for the provision of an insurance policy to all of its customers with respect to water leakage and damaged infrastructure. A number of the proposals in this Bill have already been comprehensively dealt with through legislation introduced by the Government. First, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, included Irish Water under FOI legislation. The Water Services Act 2014 then included the requirement that any proposal to change the ownership status of Irish Water would first be put to the people. Protecting the interest of customers of Irish Water has been a high priority for the Government throughout the water reform process. To ensure this protection, the 2014 Act provided that the Commission for Energy Regulation, which had previously been assigned the function for water regulation, was required to establish a dispute resolution process for Irish Water customers. I will now deal with the specific proposals contained in the Bill. Irish Water is already subject to FOI legislation. Under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) Regulations 2014, Irish Water has been subject to the provisions of the FOI Acts from 17 July 2013. In regard to the independent ombudsman for water, it was a policy decision of the Government to establish Irish Water as a public utility, and this is reflected in the legislation passed by the Oireachtas. The legislative framework the Government has put in place to establish Irish Water and the CER, as the economic regulator for Irish Water, means there is a robust process for the protection of customer interests and clearly demonstrates that the customer was at the centre of Government's thinking when framing the legislation. As can be seen from the extensive activity being undertaken by the CER, this process is operating effectively. In addition, the CER has been given a specific statutory role under the Water Services Act 2014 in regard to dispute resolution for Irish Water customers. This will involve a similar service to that operated by the CER for the gas and electricity sectors, whereby it can investigate customer complaints that Irish Water has not resolved. I do not believe the creation of a dedicated independent ombudsman for resolving disputes related to Irish Water, as suggested in this Bill, is therefore warranted. Similar to the approach it has taken in the electricity and gas industries, the CER has also required Irish Water to submit a customer handbook outlining the minimum customer service standards it will provide to its customers. The customer handbook comprises Irish Water's customer charter, codes of practice and terms and conditions of supply. Along with these measures, the CER will engage with both Irish Water and the Environmental Protection Agency to develop complementary complaints processes to ensure customers are directed in an efficient manner to the appropriate organisation with their complaint or query. In this regard, it should be noted that Irish Water is also subject to statutory supervision by the EPA and the Health Service Executive in respect of any environmental and human health aspects of its water services provision. In regard to the ownership of Irish Water, it has been made very clear that the Government is totally opposed to the privatisation of public water services and there is no question of the service being privatised. The Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord Gáis Éireann, conforming to the conditions contained in the Act and registered under the Companies Act. The Act provides that Irish Water is registered as a private company limited by shares under the Companies Act, with one share in Irish Water issued to Bord Gáis Éireann, now Ervia, and the remaining shares allocated equally between the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance. As Ervia is a fully State-owned company, Irish Water is, accordingly, in full State ownership. Subsequently, an amendment introduced in the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 prohibits each of the three shareholders from disposing of their shareholding in Irish Water and thus places a statutory prohibition on the privatisation of Irish Water. To copperfasten this prohibition, the Water Services Act 2014 provides that any proposal by a future Government for legislation that would involve any change in the State's ownership of Irish Water, as outlined, would require approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas and subsequently any proposal would have to be put to the people via a plebiscite before such legislation could even proceed. Also, there is a further statutory provision which safeguards water services infrastructure in public ownership. Section 31(12) of the Water Services Act 2007 prevents Irish Water from entering into any agreement or arrangement with another person which involves or may involve the transfer of assets and infrastructure from Irish Water to that person. In regard to an insurance policy for customers, it is not the function of Irish Water to provide any type of insurance policy for customers in terms of leaks or damaged infrastructure. Under the Water Services Act 2007, responsibility for repair and maintenance of the internal water distribution system from the main stopcock to the house and within the house rests with the homeowner. This is similar to the situation with other utility services, such as gas or electricity. The proposal in the Bill to change responsibility for internal repairs and maintenance would have significant implications from a financial perspective for Irish Water and could have wide-ranging impacts for other utility service providers. I do not believe, therefore, that the proposal in the Bill is an appropriate approach to take on this issue. This morning's debate provides an important opportunity to remind the House of the significant progress that has been made in implementing the Government's water sector reform programme. This programme is based on three pillars: the establishment of a national utility to provide water and waste water services on a national basis; the establishment of a sustainable funding model for water services, underpinned by domestic and non-domestic water charges and the ability of the national utility to borrow from capital markets to increase infrastructural spending, and to increase annual expenditure from approximately €300 million per annum when Irish Water was established to at least €600 million per annum; and the introduction of independent economic regulation of Irish Water, which has been assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation. With each new challenge in our public water system that Irish Water confronts, the underlying need for reform becomes increasingly clear and justification for reform becomes stronger. Public water services were and remain in need of change in the way they are delivered, as does the way they are funded. The previous system of providing water services through local authorities was not working properly, despite the best efforts of the dedicated and experienced staff involved. Local authorities were restricted in their ability to borrow, so they could not invest adequately in the system. The time taken to make decisions to invest was often slow, bureaucratic and inefficient. Planning for new water services largely stopped at the county boundary, so there was limited opportunity to achieve economies of scale on a regional or national basis. We saw and continue to see the results of this fundamentally flawed approach in almost every city, town and county. There are major issues around the quality of water supply and the capacity of the existing system to supply treated water in the quantities needed by households, business and industry. For example, there are almost 20,123 people on boil water notices from 21 supplies, and more than 955,000 people depend on drinking water supplies that are at risk of failing the required standards. Almost half the water treated, at significant cost, escapes through leaks and is unaccounted for. For example, Irish Water was able to establish that 22 households were leaking over 1 million litres a day into their driveways. That is enough to serve the daily needs of the town of Gorey. There are 44 towns where largely untreated sewage is running into our rivers and seas, including popular seaside towns such as Cobh, Youghal and Bundoran. This cannot be allowed to continue or it will be hugely damaging to our vital tourism sector. In Dublin, more than 800 km of piping is over 100 years old. There is an insufficient water supply for the greater Dublin area. Earlier this year, Irish Water published a project need report, which identified that projected demand for water in Dublin alone is expected to increase by over 50% by 2050. This is far beyond the capacity of the existing sources which serve the region. Nationally, our population is increasing, our economy is growing and our climate is changing. These realities bring new demands and challenges for our water system, the reality that a single national utility is best equipped to manage. By 2030, our river basin management plans will have been reviewed a further three times and the quality of our water bodies will have to be improved. Our rivers, lakes and other water bodies need greater protection, not just for the protection of public health and our natural environment, but to ensure that our thriving tourism industry can continue to prosper under the banner of Ireland's image as a clean, green country. The three pillars of reform - a national utility, a new sustainable finding model and the introduction of independent economic regulation - have been implemented and are leading to major changes in how we plan and deliver water infrastructure and services. Irish Water has introduced fundamental reforms to the planning and delivery of water services. It has adopted a new approach to asset management, for example, which has resulted in a significant change of approach to infrastructural delivery. Central strategic planning is now based on accurate asset performance data and full control of all investment decisions. The utility is now planning investment consistently across the asset base rather than large-scale, one-off investments. An example of this is the proposed Ringsend wastewater treatment plant upgrade, where an alternative approach to a treatment plant extension will save the company €170 million in capital investment. The utility has also standardised certain operational procedures, leading to benefits in performance and energy costs. It is conducting plant and process audits, which are identifying repair needs, assisting in planned maintenance programmes and providing for efficiency scoping. It has introduced utility systems to manage spend, improve value for money and capture the condition and performance of water services infrastructure. Under the service level agreements, annual plans and the 2014-2017 transformation plan, Irish Water has begun implementing other initiatives that will standardise and modernise operations, asset management, customer service, procurement improvement, and assets data intelligence. Examples of this are the hand-held devices that council staff will be given so that they can be given work orders quickly to fix water problems and report back when they are completed, and the single national laboratory service for testing water samples. The greater economies of scale which are possible through having one national utility rather than 31 separate local authorities have resulted in €12 million in procurement savings in the company's first year alone.In the area of electricity supply, a major cost in the production of water, Irish Water's current renewable and efficient energy initiatives aim to reduce costs by 33% by 2020. In April 2014, Irish Water became the main contact point for customer queries and reports regarding water supply outages and water quality through its customer call centre.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This development was another milestone along the road to achieving a single, standardised national service throughout the country, with a greater focus on those who use the public services. Such progress would not have been possible without strong co-operation between Irish Water and local authorities, which have decades of experience of providing water and wastewater services with great care and dedication. The 12 year service level agreements, now almost a year in existence, have proven to be a strong partnership between the local authorities' expertise in operations and the considerable network and utility management experience within the Ervia Group. This was most evident during Storm Darwin in February last year, when the two parties collaborated effectively to address emergency situations and maintain clear lines of communication with each other and with the public during a time of pressure on the public water system. The scale of the roll-out of the metering programme has been particularly impressive. By any measurement, the domestic metering programme has been a success. Unparalleled anywhere in scale or ambition, Irish Water has installed almost 700,000 meters in just over 21 months.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The utility surpassed its end of year target in 2014 six weeks ahead of schedule, and is delivering a programme that is sustaining approximately 1,050 jobs throughout the country, providing the kind of economic stimulus we need. Some 80% of these jobs are held by people in one of three social inclusion categories, namely, the unemployed, employees of small and medium enterprises, or graduates-school leavers-apprentices. This far exceeds the Government's original target of 25%. As well as facilitating usage-based charging, which international evidence shows can reduce domestic consumption by up to 10%, the metering programme is detecting customer side leakage. Irish Water estimates that about 6% of all water produced is lost through customer side leakage. The presence of meters is helping Irish Water identify leakage that is now being fixed through the interim first fix free scheme. The interim phase of this scheme covers leaks from the boundary of the property to a point as close as possible to the dwelling, but will not include leaks internal to the dwelling or other buildings on the property. This involves identifying customer side leakage between the meter box and the point of entry into the house, offering repairs of these leaks to customers. The utility has offered over 2,500 customers leak investigations under the interim scheme, and plans on issuing 7,500 notifications regarding larger leaks, with notifications prioritised in order of size of leak to maximise potential water savings. It plans to conduct the associated leak investigations and qualifying repairs.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I too welcome the students in the Visitors Gallery, including the teachers, some of whom I recognise. I thank all Members who have contributed to this debate. As I outlined earlier, the Government cannot support the Bill tabled by Deputy McGrath. Although I appreciate the sentiment behind the Bill, as I have already stated, the legislative and policy framework put in place by this Government, in particular the Water Services Act 2014, provides for what is proposed in the Bill.The Government is in favour of measures that lead to increased transparency in relation to public administration generally and as such Irish Water has been subject to freedom of information legislation since 17 July 2013. The Commission for Energy Regulation has been given the role of independent economic regulator for Irish Water and its primary statutory purpose is to ensure the protection of customers' interests. This role is underpinned in statute. Section 39(1) of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that the commission shall perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of customers of Irish Water. The CER has also been assigned a specific statutory role under the Water Services Act 2014 in respect of resolving disputes that may arise between Irish Water and its customers. This will involve a similar service to that operated by the Commission for Energy Regulation for the gas and electricity sectors, with the CER investigating customer complaints which Irish Water has not resolved. The creation of a dedicated independent ombudsman for resolving disputes related to Irish Water, as suggested in this Bill, is, therefore, a duplication of effort and expense. Reference was made to the suggestion that the establishment of Irish Water could be a precursor to privatisation. This issue has been raised before and it has been shown to be without foundation. The Government has made it clear that Irish Water will remain in public ownership. In fact, this is laid down in statute in the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 and the Water Services Act 2014. Any change in the State's ownership of Irish Water would require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas and, subsequently, any proposal would have to be put to the people via a plebiscite before it could proceed. A final proposal relating to insurance is contained in this Bill. Irish Water is not statutorily required to provide any type of insurance policy for customers in terms of leaks or damaged infrastructure. Responsibility for repair and maintenance of the internal water distribution system from the main stopcock to the house and within the house rests with the homeowner, as set out in the Water Services Act 2007. This approach is similar to the position in respect of other utility services such as gas or electricity. Changing the legal responsibility for internal repairs and maintenance would have significant implications from a financial perspective for Irish Water and could have wide-ranging impacts for other utility service providers. Therefore, I cannot agree with the proposal on this issue. The Government is confident that the strategic national approach Irish Water has taken to all aspects of water services provision in Ireland will deliver benefits for the customer. It is evident that Irish Water has many challenges to confront and resolve. This will be done with the aim of providing a world-class service to the customer and this remains at the centre of the Government's reform programme. As has been clearly outlined today, the Government has already put in place the measures required to address the objectives of this Bill in a comprehensive manner. On that basis the Government is opposing the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the report by the joint committee. Although important in itself, this will aid in the decision process to be engaged in by Government in the context of recommendations to be made in the forthcoming report of independent working group on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers. I understand that report will be presented to Government this month. I thank Members of the joint committee for their diligence in going about their business in relation to this topic, in respect of which, as this House knows, I have had a long-standing interest. Quite properly, members made on the ground visits to four direct provision centres in Galway, Limerick, Meath and Dublin, and these were a cross section of the 34 asylum accommodation centres across the State in which 4,500 persons currently reside. The Deputy is correct in saying that approximately one third of those are children and approximately one third of those have been in the system for more than five years. Since my appointment as Minister of State last year, I too have visited centres in Waterford, Dublin, Sligo, Laois, Mosney, Galway, Limerick and Clare to see for myself the conditions in which these residents live. The dry facts set out in official documents and reports cannot properly convey the day-to-day realities which they face, which mostly revolve around waiting and hoping. None the less, I am glad the report also acknowledges that many owners, management and staff seek to alleviate the consequences of the direct provision system. I also appreciate that the committee held two hearings on this matter, the first on 22 October 2014 involving asylum seekers and NGOs and the second on 1 April 2015 which I and two officials from the Department of Justice and Equality attended. At my appearance on 1 April, I made my own views on this subject clear to the committee. I cannot and will not stand over the system of direct provision.  In its report, the committee focuses on recommendations which fall within its remit but also makes recommendations on various aspects of the direct provision system for consideration by other relevant sectoral Oireachtas committees. I think this unusual approach is inevitable given the quite broad nature of the State's responsibilities in the area of international protection.While my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I fully support the independent working group under the chairmanship of a former High Court judge, Dr. Bryan McMahon, we do not know what recommendations will be made in its pending report. Equally, we have not sought to influence its conclusions. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to assume the report will address many of the issues raised in the joint committee's report. I understand the working group's report will amalgamate reports from three smaller and more focused subgroups dealing with specific themes: conditions in centres, supports for asylum seekers, and improvements in the processing of protection claims. While I do not wish to anticipate the working group report, which is due to be presented to the Government this month, I will address the four recommendations in its report that the joint committee considers to be within its remit: that a pre-Ombudsman independent complaints system be provided for residents under the house rules of the direct provision centre; that the legal remit for the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman or Children be extended to include the direct provision system, as well as the administration of law relating to immigration and naturalisation; that responsibility for centre inspections be given to an independent body, such as HIQA; and that the Freedom of Information Acts be extended to cover the direct provision system, as well as the administration of the law relating to immigration and naturalisation. The issue that is the subject of the first recommendation - the apparent need for a pre-Ombudsman independent complaints mechanism - came to the fore in the judgment issued by the High Court in November 2014 in the CA and TA case. Although the High Court found that the direct provision system did not breach human rights, it did find that certain aspects of the house rules dealing with guests, signing in and the lack of an independent appeals mechanism were unlawful. Although the issue was discussed at the working group, I understand it will not form part of its recommendations. Nevertheless, revised house rules which address the court's findings have been issued in the meantime. The rules now provide for the option of a final appeal to an independent complaints officer. I should record here that the judgment in the CA and TA case is under appeal. The second recommendation concerns the extension of the legal remit for the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children to include the direct provision system and the administration of law relating to immigration and naturalisation. As things stand, this is a matter of legislation which falls within the remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Section 5(1)(e) of the Ombudsman Act 1980 and section 11(1)(e) of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 provide that neither ombudsman shall investigate any action taken by or on behalf of a person in the administration of the law relating to, inter alia, asylum. This has been interpreted to include the direct provision system. I note that the view of the current Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, as expressed to the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions on 11 March 2015, is that decisions on matters other than immigration status, including decisions on issues regarding accommodation, administration processes and internal complaints processes, are in his remit. The first point to be made on this recommendation is that it is not intended under any circumstances that either ombudsman will serve as a first instance appellant authority in relation to day-to-day administrative complaints mechanisms. It is a requirement that a person who wishes to appeal to the Ombudsman must first try to solve the problem with the public body concerned using a formal local appeals mechanism. I have already referred to the changes in the house rules providing for a final independent complaints mechanism, even if that falls short of recourse to the Ombudsman. The current administrative processes which lead to decisions on asylum claims are substantially set out in legislation. First instance protection decisions are made by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and are subject to appeals before the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Both offices are legally independent of the Minister for Justice and Equality and their decisions can be judicially reviewed by the courts. The Government would have to consider carefully how the addition of another independent body into this process would affect a system that is already complicated. Pending consideration by the Government of the report of the independent working party, there are no plans to change those legislative provisions to give either office the power to investigate asylum-related matters. With regard to the second recommendation, and on the issue of processing, I point out that earlier this year the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, published the general scheme of an international protection Bill, the aim of which is to reduce waiting times for asylum applicants. The key provision of the Bill will be to replace the existing multilayered protection determination system with a single procedure, the aim of which will be to enable timely and efficient protection decisions. This single procedure will identify at a much earlier stage people who have no entitlement to stay in the State and can safely return to their country of origin. Further on this specific recommendation, notwithstanding the legal situation, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, and the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, have administrative arrangements in place with both ombudsman offices to assist and provide information on matters brought to their attention. I will now turn to the third recommendation, which is that responsibility for centre inspections should be given to an independent body such as HIQA. While it is understandable that HIQA is cited as an example of an independent inspection body, it is not the only one. Moreover, its remit is strictly covered in legislation. It is important to point out that RIA, which is the unit in the Department of Justice and Equality responsible for the administration of the direct provision system, already engages an independent private body to carry out inspections of its centres. All centres are subject to a minimum of three unannounced inspections a year. One inspection is carried out by QTS, which is an independent company under contract to RIA, and the other two are carried out by RIA officials. All completed inspections are published on RIA's website and this adds to the transparency of the system. Researchers, Deputies, residents of centres, NGO officials and everyone else can examine these reports in detail. It has to be said that asylum accommodation centres do not exist in isolation. They are subject to RIA inspections and other State inspections. They are, for example, subject to inspection by fire officers and, in relation to food issues, to unannounced inspections by environmental health officers. This is not to say that the inspection regime cannot be improved, as it can. I await the working group findings in this regard. The fourth recommendation relates to the freedom of information regime, which has long applied to INIS and RIA. By virtue of the Freedom of Information Act 2014, it has been extended to Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal with effect from 14 April last. The usual provisions and exemptions of the Freedom of Information Acts apply in relation to commercially sensitive matters. There are no special provisions relating to immigration-related matters. In order to be as transparent as possible, RIA currently makes available on request contract details for all contracts to the end of January each year in respect of all financial information up to the end of December two years previously. For example, at the end of January 2015, the records were updated to the end of December 2012. These records provide a context for the moneys paid for each contract, such as the length of the contract and the number of people for which services are contracted. I believe the joint committee has performed a very useful public service with its report. That report, along with the report of the working group, will fully inform the Government in the decisions it will have to make in reforming a system which has been the subject of much-deserved criticism. I look forward to listening to this afternoon's Dáil debate on the report.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Deputies for their contributions. As I said previously, this is one of the issues that goes beyond politics in this House. I have been impressed by the level of interest that Deputies and Senators from different parties have taken in this discussion on this area of direct provision. However, references to welfare fraud do not help when we are discussing the issue of direct provision in this country. We have had a love affair with incarcerating people. We did it in mental institutions in the 1950s. We did it in the Magdalen laundries and industrial schools, and we continue to do it with the direct provision system. I know Department officials do not like those comparisons, and they know that when the original decision was made to establish direct provision centres - there were 60 initially and now there are only 34 - it was in response to a particular situation. The amount of time that it was envisaged somebody would stay in a direct provision centre was six months and now people have been living there for more than ten years, and there are children who know nothing else but a direct provision centre. That has belittled them and stripped them of their dignity. I am very taken by the human stories that, individually and collectively, we have come across in direct provision centres. One man in Limerick has been completely broken by what we have done to him. Obviously, his circumstances in the country where he came from resulted in him being very vulnerable but we have compounded that and broken him. I feel a great sense of duty to that individual, and to the other 4,500 people who are living in the system, one third of whom are children and one third of whom have been living there for over five years. I would stay in some of the centres but I would not spend a night in some of the others. I recall seeing in one centre a corridor of eight sleeping units separated by curtains. I would not stay in it, and I would not expect anybody else to stay in it either. While every other country in Europe seems to be strangled with the conversation around immigration and xenophobia, this House and this country can be proud of the fact that we have not allowed the issue of asylum, immigration or integration strangle our political debate, and it does not come to the forefront of election discussions. However, I am awaiting the publication of the report. Decent, honourable people who are as critical of the direct provision system as anybody could sit on that working group. The reason for its establishment was to assemble the people who know the system best as well as officials who are overseeing the system and officials from different Departments who need to be discussing issues with them such as education, the environment and social protection, and allow them come to conclusions. On one particular issue I am led to believe that 15 individual meetings took place. That is why, when I was expecting originally that we could assemble the group in September and have a report by Christmas, it has proved almost impossible to do it in that timeframe. While I was hoping to get the report last month, it now appears it will be ready this month but if we want to do something, we have to do it well. It would be my intention, and I am sure the intention of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on receipt of the report to bring it to the Government first, publish it and then implement it because all the hard work has been done. All the convincing of officials has been done and as Deputy Murphy rightly said, it is now the responsibility of the Government to implement it during this term. In this post-referendum era when we are all talking about equality, there are other groups in society who want to know what this new feeling of equality will give to them. They are members of the Traveller community, people who live in socially and economically deprived areas, young people, old people, people new to our country, and certainly people living in direct provision centres. While my individual responses to the report may have left some Deputies less than inspired, and I appreciate Deputy Mac Lochlainn's endeavours in this regard which reflect very well on his chairmanship of the committee and the members also as this is an issue they have taken on and feel so strongly about, when the report is published and people see what it contains we can finally turn the page on what has been a shameful period in Irish history that we cannot defend. On the day I became Minister of State with responsibility for new communities in the Department of Justice and Equality I said this was not a system I could stand over. It is a system that belittles and dehumanises people. We cannot stand over a system where people are languishing for years, with a sense of having no future. A number of things have to happen. What kind of system could I oversee? What kind of system could we stand over? It was initially envisaged that direct provision would be a system to tackle the homelessness crisis. I can envisage a system where there is an excellently run centre, with proper oversight, links to the community and proper cooking facilities for families. It can be suggested by people who do not understand the importance of proper cooking facilities that they are unimportant but they are very important to a mother and father who need to prepare food for their children. We need proper family orientated dwellings. We must do away with the idea, which I have seen in some centres, of a wardrobe in a single room separating the children's and the parents' sleeping conditions. That is outrageous. We must do away with that and have proper family living facilities but we must only ever envisage that somebody would be there for a matter of weeks or months, and certainly not more than six months and certainly not for a period of years. The asylum system should treat these people with respect and dignity and we should not have a situation where people are languishing in it for years. It is the responsibility of Deputies in this House to make contributions to this debate, not to respond to uninformed, ill-judged, unresearched comments from constituents. They should base all their comments regarding the asylum system or integration issues on facts. That is very important when we are dealing with people who are vulnerable. We have a fantastic opportunity now, in this post-referendum era and as we face into the commemoration of the 1916 Rising, to reassess our values as a Republic, and this is one of the areas which has been a stain on our reputation over the past number of years. When the report comes to Government, and I have been told it will be this month, although I was expecting it next week - there may be a slight delay on that - the responsibility then is not just to publish but to implement. If people such as representatives from the UNHCR, SPIRASI, the Children's Rights Alliance and the Jesuit refugee group, as well as representatives from academia and people with a history in the trade union movement, have taken the time, under the stewardship of Bryan McMahon, to come up with a report over this number of months, and they see it is workable, it is then the responsibility of Government to act and to ensure it is implemented in a timely fashion. Regardless of how humane our system of direct provision is here, nobody wants to live in these centres. They want to live a full and productive life, and we must be conscious of that. Currently within the system there are 500 people who have leave to remain and do not need to be in direct provision, but we have an issue in terms of housing. We have 500 individuals who have been granted permission to start a life in Ireland but they do not have the facilities to do so because of a housing issue and other supports they believe are necessary to transition. That transitional period will be key to how we facilitate people to move out of direct provision and remain connected with the community in which they have been living for some time and where their children may be in school. Helping them to integrate into that community and society and having supports available for them so that they can make that transition will be key as well. Regarding issues to do with education, young people in primary and secondary education can, as the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has already indicated, move on to third level. I do not accept the argument that asylum seekers should not be afforded the right to work. My personal opinion is that we are standing outside the European norm when it comes to facilitating asylum seekers with the right to work. That will remain an issue of contention and debate but the manner in which we have conducted this debate is a credit to this House, the political parties who serve in it, the Seanad and the committees which have raised this as an issue that we should pursue and correct.Rather than taking credit in this House for the way the debate has been conducted, the greatest credit we will get is for implementing the report that will be given to the Government in the next few days. We can then finally put to bed the scandal of direct provision. Hopefully, those within the system can see a brighter future and we can have a system of which we can be rightly proud in a country that calls itself a republic.
