AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes, I am happy to proceed.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Tánaiste will be aware that there were two announcements in the Baldoyle area over the past six months that are to result in the loss of over 540 jobs. Will the Tánaiste work with local representatives to discuss this issue? What plans does his Department have to deal with this, to ensure there will be no further job losses in the Baldoyle area and to ensure that those affected by these announcements will get all the supports they need?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I wrote to the Tánaiste a month ago seeking a meeting with all local representatives to discuss the situation in Baldoyle. In the past six months there have been two separate announcements of job losses, affecting more than 540 people. I wrote to him again to seek a meeting with our local representatives. Does the Tánaiste feel that our local representatives, Deputies from all parties, are part of the solution? We are, obviously, in daily contact with many of the people who are affected by this issue. We want to ensure that Baldoyle represents a viable investment opportunity in the future. With two such announcements in a short period of time, the least I would have expected from the Tánaiste is that we would have had that meeting of all representatives. Two letters later and we are still no closer to that meeting. I again ask him to use the opportunity of this forum and this interaction with me to commit to having that meeting so that we can work together to avoid further job losses in Baldoyle and to ensure we get support for those affected by the job losses that have been announced.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Tánaiste's remarks and his commitment to having a meeting. He will appreciate that I might be a bit frustrated. In two letters from me over the course of a month, I did not get anywhere. Then in an oral exchange in this Chamber I have now got a commitment to a meeting. However, I will take that in good faith and we can certainly work together. If two such announcements involving more than 540 job losses happened anywhere else in the State, I am sure that a slew of Ministers would be travelling to that location to say how hard they were working to ensure that there would be no further announcements and that they would give as much support as they possibly could to the workers affected. Some of the remarks made, particularly the Sudocrem announcement about the site in which it was operating, were particularly concerning. I hope the Tánaiste will appreciate that we are trying to protect the futures of the workers involved and also to ensure that the remarks made by the withdrawing companies will not be replicated in the coming period.
