AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that the issue of the accusations of abuse in Blackrock College has to be dealt with sensitively. I believe that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other members of the Government are dealing with it with the greatest of sensitivity. There is an acknowledgement that an investigation or inquiry is needed. What is the Minister's view on the necessity of such an inquiry? What type of form would such an inquiry take, seeing as the Department of Education would be to the forefront of any inquiry into what happened at Blackrock College and other religious-run schools?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the Minister's response but, in tabling this question, I had assumed there would be a good chance that by the time we spoke today an inquiry would have been announced. I understand that she is to make contact with Opposition spokespeople as to how best this inquiry could be formulated. I also understand that it is the Government's intention to have an inquiry. I am happy that the Minister is committed to having a survivor-led inquiry. It is important that the Government takes advice on any ongoing Garda investigations. The Minister spoke about how things have changed since the period in which some of these abuses took place, yet it is clear that some of those who were overseeing these institutions at that time are still in place. There are accusations that people who were involved in abuse still reside in these institutions. There are also accusations that people in positions of authority were approached 20 years ago and were told to return only if they had a solicitor. While the regulations and legislation and the oversight by the Department may have changed in the interim, the personnel who oversaw this and had responsibility for the care of children are still in place. What we need, at least from today, and I acknowledge that there will be statements on this later, is clarity on when and how this inquiry will be established and when it will take place.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I reiterate that I believe the Government is dealing with this in a proper manner.The Minister is dealing with it with the sensitivity it demands. However, weeks have passed and there needs to be a sense of when this inquiry will take place and what its nature will be. We must also ensure that none of this can ever happen again. While the Minister rightly points to changes in the system over the past number of years and decades, this needs to feed into the citizen' assembly on education to ensure that this deference to religious institutions and fee-paying schools in the system can be broken and that every child in every school is protected by the State. I look forward to the Minister's engagement and, hopefully, if not by the end of today, we will have clarity on how and when this inquiry will take place by the end of the week.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State will know that in October a lot of disquiet was expressed by school communities about the potential change in the AON process. I understand from her negotiations with the INTO that a pause was put on that process. I want to get a sense of where the process now stands.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The reaction I and other Deputies involved in this sphere got was very negative regarding the new responsibility schools felt they had to oversee, the workload being imposed on them and the lack of expertise teachers and principals have in terms of overseeing the process, especially when trying to account for a child's disability, including motor skills. On that basis, the issue has been raised in the House. Various education partners raised concerns with the Minister of State and Minister. In fairness, a conversation took place and I understand from the INTO statement the process was paused. Given that the process has been paused, what status does the pause now have? Will the idea be abandoned, changed in some way or reverted to?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State was coming to the second point I raised. It is not just about the workload, but also the expertise. Every Deputy in the Chamber will appreciate that principals, teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and everyone else who works in a school community are heroes. They are often undervalued, the first to be criticised and face a great deal of negativity, but what they do for children of all backgrounds every day of the week is inspirational. If one ever wants to be uplifted in one's political work, then take a trip to the local school to get cheered up. Regarding expertise, teachers and principals have told me that properly assessing the needs of a child is the role of an educational psychologist. A teacher or principal does not have the expertise, or should not be expected to have the expertise, to assess the motor skills of a child. The Minister of State was about to address this point.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Next week, the Labour Party will bring forward a Private Members' motion on the issue of drugs and the decriminalisation of the drug user. The Government has promised a citizens' assembly on drugs for early next year. Is the Tánaiste in a position to clarify when the proposed citizens' assembly on drugs will take place? It is needed. In many communities, the drugs crisis is spiralling out of control.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister for Education was in touch with my office to state she has other commitments this evening. Therefore, I appreciate the attendance of the Minister of State. I am interested in hearing what he has to say on behalf of the Government. The Minister of State will appreciate that when Deputies get 20 or 30 emails on a particular issue, they know something has gone drastically wrong.A review of the schools in Raheny parish is taking place. When I made contact with the office of the archbishop, the representative informed me this is one of a number of reviews. I understand 29 schools in 11 parishes, of which Raheny is one, are under review. I was told there is an independent facilitator whose role is to consult, listen and be part of the information flow. This is a process done in tandem with the patron body and Department of Education. Given that I used to be in that position as a school principal, as a rule I do not get involved in individual school issues regarding the future. It is an issue for an individual school and its patron body. These matters do not need to be politicised unnecessarily. However, this has a political component to it because the Department of Education is involved. The process is being so mishandled that, regardless of one's view on the future of primary schools in Raheny, everybody would feel as if they are not being heard, the independent facilitator is not doing the job properly and there has to be a restart. Anybody who knows anything about my politics will know that I believe in divestment and that having a disproportionate number of schools under one particular patron is not healthy. Anybody who knows anything about my political view would know that I do not believe single gender schools, in particular at primary level, can stand up to scrutiny. In Raheny there are two single gender schools and a mixed infant school and, I understand, after a period of consultation there is a proposal that one school would divest and the two remaining schools under Catholic patronage may be reconfigured along co-educational lines. Speaking to the representative of the archbishop, I asked him plainly whether there is an absolute guarantee that anyone who wants to have his or her child educated through the Catholic ethos in Raheny will have capacity for that to continue into the future. He said, categorically, "Yes". He said that to me, but that is not the understanding or knowledge of many people who have contacted me. I ask that the Minister of Education take control of the situation because clearly if people are forced to contact a local representative, they feel they are not being heard. We also need to hear the views of those who do not have children currently attending schools in Raheny but who live in the area. They may have a one, two or three-year-old child and would like to know if they could have some say as to what the reconfiguration of schools would be. To put it bluntly, this situation has got out of control. It is not working for anybody, including staff or parents. I ask the Minister for Education to intervene and ensure that the independent facilitator of the process does his job effectively because currently there is a lot of concern and insecurity about the future of schools and people feel as if they are not being listened to.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There are two issues. One is that the independent facilitator has indicated that he will "read the room". No matter what side of the debate one is on, whether one wants divestment, co-educational schools or for things to remain exactly as they are, an independent facilitator saying to a group of parents or anybody that it will be his determination what the temperature is by just reading the room is not particularly scientific and does not give anybody any sense that this will be done in a fair manner. Second, I contend that the parents of a two-year-old have more skin in the game than the parents of somebody in sixth class. Yet, the parents of a child in sixth class, who is leaving a school next year, have more of a say in what the future of the school will be than somebody whose child is aged two, three or four, lives close to the school and intends to send their child to that school. The views of such parents are not being canvassed, yet they live in the area and surely have a view. This is why I am asking the Minister to intervene and communicate with the independent facilitator. We cannot ask people to have faith in a process when a determination will be made by facilitator who is going to read the temperature of a room. What if my child is aged two, three or four, I live in Raheny and have an interest in what happens to the future of these schools? Surely we should find a mechanism in the school catchment area to canvass the views of those who live locally and whose children will soon be of school-going age . As I said, those parents have more of a stake in this process than somebody whose child is in sixth class and is leaving the school and has no other children going through the school.Those are two reasonable points and the Minister of State needs to hear them and communicate them back. Otherwise, we are going to have a divisive process – indeed, we already have one – that will satisfy no one. Schools are magical places. We need to ensure they remain so and not have division.
