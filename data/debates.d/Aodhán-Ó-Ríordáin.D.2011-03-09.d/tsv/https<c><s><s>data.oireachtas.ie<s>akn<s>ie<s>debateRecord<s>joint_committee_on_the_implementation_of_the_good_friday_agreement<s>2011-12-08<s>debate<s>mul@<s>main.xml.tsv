AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank our guests for their interesting contributions.  I think what people appreciate from sports people is honesty.  Jason Sherlock was my favourite Dublin player because he was a very honest player, and even though I am not really a rugby fan, it is also why Brian O'Driscoll is a favourite of mine.  I am trying to think of an honest soccer player.  Kevin Kilbane was mentioned earlier and he was a very honest player.  Fans always respond to honesty so we have to be honest in what we say.I was at the integration centre's pre-budget launch a couple of weeks ago and Fintan O'Toole was saying that we in the South have a terrible history of being completely unable to deal with difference, and that we have a history of incarcerating people who are different that is worse than any other state in the world.  That legacy remains today.  I grew up in a house in Dublin where rugby was a game played by people who went to private schools.  My father taught in a school which famously expelled Liam Brady for playing soccer.  I go to GAA matches a lot and I hear some of the pretty poisonous things said about some of the very small minority of ethnic players who play in Croke Park and a level of homophobia which is absolutely outrageous.  We have a problem and it is not just a Northern Irish thing.  We have a problem across the island with difference and with embracing it.The strides that have been made by the IFA are remarkable.  I have never been to Windsor Park.  I would appreciate an invitation and we would all like to go to a game at some point and see it at first hand.  The atmosphere has changed completely from what I can see on the TV screen.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes it is a good suggestion.  Mr. Ringland mentioned earlier that there is a potential for having two soccer teams on this island which would almost be exclusively from one religious background or the other.  I would defend the right of somebody whose particular personal identity fits in more with the Republic of Ireland team than with Northern Ireland to choose the former.  However, if this is being manipulated by a particular association, that has to be rooted out and challenged.My view of the Celtic and Rangers issue is that there are two very well resourced soccer teams in Scotland that benefit commercially from sectarianism.  We even had a sports manufacturer promoting a jersey of one of those teams and its tag line was "Identify Yourself".  That is making money out of sectarianism.  I wonder if both sides in Glasgow deliberately target Irish players in order to promote their idea of being representative of one side or the other.  Racism and sectarianism makes money for people.  We have to be aware of that.Emblems and anthems were mentioned before, along with the problem of racism, sectarianism and political identity.  It is impossible to divorce politics from sport.  I wish we could, but we cannot, because once a person represents a place with some kind of border around it, then that is a political thing.  How do we address the issue of anthems and emblems in a way that empowers people and brings them along with us?  I go to many games in Ulster.  My wife is from Monaghan, God love her.  It is not an easy team to support, but we go to many county grounds in the North of Ireland and the anthem is played, and I find myself, as a Dublin person, wondering how embracing this is.  Then again, Mr. Ringland made the point about the anthem of the Irish rugby team, and there is a similar problem with the Irish Football Association.  Gerry Armstrong made reference to that recently, when he stated it is not necessarily as embracing to those of a Nationalist background when only one anthem is played.  How important is that, or is it a red herring?  Are there more fundamental problems that we need to deal with?I appreciate the presentations made and I want to thank Mr. Mullen for the work he does on eliminating racism.  Everybody probably knows at this stage, because I say it often enough, that I taught in a disadvantaged area in the north inner city of Dublin.  The problem I discovered is that if somebody is discriminated against every day of his or her life, as a working class person, then discrimination towards somebody else comes almost naturally, because there is a perception that somebody else is scrambling around for scarce resources.  It is about empowerment and education.  It is often more about fear of poverty than it is about instinctive racism.
