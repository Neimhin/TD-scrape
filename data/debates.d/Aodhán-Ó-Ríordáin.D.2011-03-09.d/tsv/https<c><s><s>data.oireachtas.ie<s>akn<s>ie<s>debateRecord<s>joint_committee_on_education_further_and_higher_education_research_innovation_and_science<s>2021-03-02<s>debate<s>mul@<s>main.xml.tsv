AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire agus leis an Aire Stáit as a bheith linn um thráthnóna. Tá mé in ann a chinntiú go bhfuil mé i dTeach Laighin. I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for some of the recent announcements of measures that we have been calling for and they have now delivered. We had a long discussion about passing the pupil-teacher ratio reduction on to DEIS schools. That was announced. We asked that the Minister waive the leaving certificate fee. That has been done. We asked that school profiling not form part of this year's calculated grading system. The Minister has ensured that. We also asked that she provide guidance for second level schools in advance of their return in order to deal with the issue of mock examinations. That has been done as well. It is only fair to put on the record the Minister's delivery of measures that were called for. The students returning to school have lost out on in-class teaching. It is important to emphasise the phrase "in-class teaching", given that teaching has been ongoing, albeit remotely, which has its own difficulties. Will the Minister speak about the Department's analysis of the effects of this loss on children? What scientific research has the Department undertaken to ascertain what damage has been done to children by not having in-class learning? As a result of that analysis, what supports does the Department believe need to be put in place? I do not necessarily want to talk about a feeling the Department has. Rather, I want to hear about actual analysis that has been undertaken.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Research has been undertaken and there is an acknowledgement within the Department that damage was done to children through unavoidable school closures. In the UK, there is a £1 billion catch-up fund for children and young people. Is it the Minister's intention to advocate for a fund that would do some of the work to help children who have been damaged - I use that word, but another term would be "negatively affected" - by the lack of in-class teaching to catch up? Can we expect a catch-up fund from the Department to finance the repair of the damage that has been indicated by its reviews?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There is a lack of school places in north Dublin for students transitioning from primary to second level. Is the Department aware of this issue? Is it taking moves to address it? We receive a number of queries in our office about this issue every year. This year the problem is particularly acute. I do not know if it is Covid related, but there is certainly a scarcity of places in second level across north Dublin and I wonder if the Minister could respond to that.
