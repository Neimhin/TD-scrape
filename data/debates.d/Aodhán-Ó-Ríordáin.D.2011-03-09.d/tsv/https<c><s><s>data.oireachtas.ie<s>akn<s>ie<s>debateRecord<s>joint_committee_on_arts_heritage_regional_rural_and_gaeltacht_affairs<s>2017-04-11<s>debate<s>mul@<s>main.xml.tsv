AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am very uncomfortable about what is going on here. I am very uncomfortable with this line of questioning.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This is the committee to ask the representatives from the National Museum about the current state of play in the museum. The Chairman seems to have a number of very heavily researched questions to fire at these two individuals. If I was in their position I would refuse to answer because it is clear that the Chairman is coming from the position of having knowledge from an individual as to how cases were handled or were not handled. These two individuals are trying to run a national institution, they have a lot on their plate. I do not know how well they are paid or even if they are paid to do that job. To be before a committee like this and to field the questions the Chairman is throwing at them, I do not know if I am on my own here, but I am deeply-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----troubled by what is happening here.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is it the proper forum for such questioning?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am conscious that Senator O'Donnell wants to come in, but the Chairman is effectively raising issues of intimidation - I want to be very careful about my language here - and inappropriate sexual behaviour. Would Ms Heaney mind if I asked her how long she has been in this position?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In regard to the issues the Chairman is raising, I do not know if they have been resolved, settled or are ongoing. I have no knowledge of them. I think it possibly would be more productive - this is my instinct and other speakers can make their points - to speak of what happens from now on, with a newly appointed chairman and people working with the museum as to how they address the broad set of cultural issues.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Even if we had, I do not think I would be speaking about it here.
