AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is extremely fitting that Limerick has been mentioned in the previous contribution. I do welcome the fact that the University of Limerick has announced it will be a sanctuary university. It is UN World Refugee Day. However, I wish to raise an issue which perhaps the Taoiseach himself could come into the Chamber to discuss, namely, the comments made by a Fine Gael councillor in Limerick, Stephen Keary, who is due to become the next Mayor of Limerick. It is fantastic that the University of Limerick will become a sanctuary university and it is wonderful that we have laudable statements on UN World Refugee Day but that individual has made racist, anti-immigrant statements in recent weeks. Our own Labour Party councillor in that part of the world, Elena Secas, who is of Moldovan extraction, is disgusted by what he said. The new leader of Fine Gael does not seem to find the capacity within himself to censure the councillor, criticise him or perhaps even expel him from the Fine Gael Party, or at least make sure that his name does not go forward to be the first citizen of Limerick.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Hold on, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This is the era of new politics. We now have a new Taoiseach who, in the context of the person that he is and his background-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----for many people represents a new opportunity for this country. We have five appointees to positions as Ministers of State not one of whom is a woman. We also have a councillor in Limerick making racist comments. This individual is due to be Mayor of Limerick and there is absolutely no word from the Taoiseach on the matter. I would like to discuss the-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----comments made by this individual at a public forum in Limerick over which he is standing. These were anti-immigrant and racist comments-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	----and on this of all days we have to call him out.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I want to know what the Leader believes the response of his party and the Taoiseach should be-----
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----to a councillor who is making racist and anti-immigrant comments.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is he welcome in Fine Gael and should he be Mayor of Limerick?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is about allowing people to have their say.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	"A major drain on the State."
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	"Stick a chain on them."
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is the reality of it. In my party he would have been kicked out.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am out of order? This joker down in Limerick is out of order.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I have read his remarks and I do not believe he has apologised.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	With the greatest respect, I hope nobody is listening to this man.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Do we take racism seriously or not?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I second the amendment proposed by Senator Higgins. This is an issue from which politicians - not in my party but others - have run away for many years. It took more than 20 years for the Supreme Court judgment of 1992 to be enacted and legislated for. That legislation almost brought down the Government. It forced the resignation of a number of members of that Government and a new political party was formed as a result. Senator Higgins has proposed a substitution facility whereby if somebody is not in a position to attend a committee hearing, somebody else can stand in in his or her place. It seems to be perfectly reasonable to have quite a number of people involved in the process. I agree with Senator Higgins that the formation of this committee leaves a lot to be desired. At the very least we are now talking about the eighth amendment and the potential for a referendum. It is quite remarkable that a committee dealing with this most sensitive of Irish political subjects would not allow a substitution mechanism. It is rumoured that the Leader will be the Chairman of the committee. We will see what happens tomorrow. I put him on notice that my party will not support any outcome that goes any way short of full repeal of the eighth amendment. I look forward to hearing other political parties' view on that.
