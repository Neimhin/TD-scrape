AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	In recent years Ireland has enjoyed some level of relative industrial peace. At this stage, however, we have reached a grave situation. We are facing strike action by second-level teachers and by An Garda Síochána. Today's advertisement in the national newspapers seeking members of the public to go in to schools to perform supervision and substitution work is, at best, misguided and, at worst, completely misunderstands the nature of schools and how they operate. Yesterday the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, thought it was a good idea to say that the public would never view members of An Garda Síochána the same way again if they were to go on strike. That is an outrageous statement. It is clear that the Government, in particular Fine Gael, has no comprehension of how industrial relations work or how best to deal with trade unions or the public sector in general. I suggest to the Leader that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, should be invited to the House to discuss his announcements in the budget of a public pay commission to report by next summer. Surely we must realise that the situation in which we find ourselves is grave, that schools will close and that gardaí will not be on the streets. The response from Government seems to be a complete misunderstanding of the sensitivities involved, of the public sector and of how to deal with industrial relations. The response has been a "face them down" attitude which is not going to work. What the House does not need is any more hyperbole; therefore, I ask the Cathaoirleach and the Leader to respectfully request the Minister to attend to the matter to overcome the situation where our schools are going to close down and where gardaí are not on the street. If that was to happen in any other European member state, the assumption would be that its government had completely lost control of the situation. I ask that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform come to the House to expand on his one line statement in the Budget Statement as to what is his vision for the public sector. It might contribute to a conversation on how we might avoid the situation of our schools closing, of gardaí not being on the street and of bitterness and rancour being in our schools and in our police force for years to come. If the Government's tone is to continue along the line of what the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, said yesterday, I worry that the situation will completely unravel
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Will she come to talk to us?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Will she come to talk to us specifically about pay restoration?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No, with respect, I asked the Leader a direct question.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Shock.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister of State and the work done by Senator Mark Daly and others. I also welcome those from the deaf community who join us; the young people and the signers who are interpreting for those in the Visitors Gallery. Sometimes in this Chamber one knows something special is about to happen because of the attendance of Senators, the Visitors Gallery is full and because there is something in the air. In view of the campaign which was undertaken by those who feel passionately about this, there is something in the air. This issue is about silence, empowerment and citizenship. If the Leas-Cathaoirleach will allow, I shall speak directly to the young people here who have been mentioned by other Senators. Often it is very difficult to stand up for oneself, but it can be even more difficult to stand up for others. If you were here earlier, you would have heard a conversation in the Chamber about the Traveller community. Speakers across the House spoke about the necessity to stand up and recognise the Traveller community and do better by them. If you had been in the Chamber this morning you would have heard Senators across the House speak about the issues in Aleppo and Ireland's responsibility to do something about what is happening in Syria and to open our arms and the State to those who need us most. It has been said that when it comes to issues that you feel strongly about as young people, you should ask yourself, "If not me then who, and if not now then when?" As young people, you have taken on this issue; you have brought it to the heart of the Oireachtas and you have made all of us who walked into this Chamber this afternoon know that something special is happening. You should be absolutely commended for this and you should realise the power you have. Martin Luther King said, "Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter". Much has been said about the 1916 Rising and the commemorations. Perhaps only now are we beginning to realise the depth of the wound caused by the recession in the State, which is about eight or nine years old, and the depth of the wounds it has caused to a generation of Irish people who may know nothing else but this financial crisis. We can now reimagine the type of country in which we want to live. It is about citizenship, but how can you be a citizen if you are forced to live in silence? This is not a case of Government or politicians granting something to a section of our society, because the empowerment in these situations is very important. It is about all of us, collectively, recognising the importance of citizenship. Let us realise what is happening across the world, in the United States of America and across Europe, including the United Kingdom. Politics is turning into a section of Irish society pointing fingers and blame at others and saying the reason they are unhappy is because of that group or those people. What you are doing today is allowing people to come in and be part of the common citizenship. Often, this House and politics struggles to connect outside of these walls. What you have done and what the deaf community is asking for is to become part of that common citizenship. I contend that the system should be bending over backwards to recognise a mechanism to break the silence. The Labour Party supports the Bill absolutely. I am glad that everyone in the House, across party lines, agrees - as happened this morning with the Syrian issue and as happened this afternoon with the Travellers' rights, and is happening now with regard to Irish Sign Language recognition. It brings a level of political legitimacy to the House and also gives a message to young people, old people, citizens who are in the Chamber, on the power they have. If you really want to make a change and believe in it enough, there is nothing you cannot achieve.
