AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We are now in public session and will deal with new EU legislative proposals.  There is quite a list of them.  First, we will consider a communication from the European Commission on the goods package and nine related EU legislative proposals.  They are: COM(2011)763 concerning the new legislative framework, NLF, alignment package, implementation of the goods package; COM(2011)764 concerning the pyrotechnic articles directive; COM(2011)765 concerning the electromagnetic compatibility directive; COM(2011)766 concerning the non-automatic weighing instruments directive; COM(2011)768 concerning the simple pressure vessels directive; COM(2011)769 concerning the measuring instruments directive; COM(2011)770 on the directive concerning safety components for lifts; COM(2011)771 on the market and supervision of explosives for civil uses; COM(2011)772 on protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres; and COM(2011)773 on electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits.The Commission proposes, in one package, to align a number of existing technical directives, which deal with specific products, to the 2008 goods package by using the recast procedure.  Recast is essentially a codification procedure with some minor, but no substantive, changes allowed.  The objective of the measure is to introduce harmonised definitions in terms which are commonly used throughout EU harmonisation legislation and aims to give a consistent meaning throughout that legislation.  Such measures are intended to improve the functioning of the Internal Market.  In view of the information provided by the lead Department, it is proposed that these proposals do not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.The next three items are also related to each other and concern the Horizon 2020 strategy.  They are: COM(2011)809 establishing Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014-2020; COM(2011)810 laying down the rules for the participation and dissemination in Horizon 2020 – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014-2020; and COM(2011)811 establishing the specific programme implementing Horizon 2020 - the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014-2020.These three related proposals aim to establish and set down the implementation and distribution rules for the European Union's new funding programme for research and innovation post-2013, namely, Horizon 2020.  The basic principle of Horizon 2020 is to adopt a much more strategic approach to research and innovation.  It also attempts to simplify procedures for participants radically.  The proposed budget for Horizon 2020 is approximately €80 billion.  Negotiations on the proposal will commence in February 2012 and are likely to continue through to the Irish Presidency of the EU commencing in January 2013.  Horizon 2020 is seen as being strategically important in assisting Ireland's economic recovery.It is proposed that these specific proposals do not warrant further scrutiny at this time.  However, in view of the potential importance of research and innovation to Ireland's economic recovery and the resulting importance of Horizon 2020, particularly in view of the proposed funding available under this programme, it is also proposed that the joint committee will write to the Department requesting that it be updated on the progress on the proposals and that this issue be considered for inclusion in the committee's work programme.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Is it agreed that a departmental representative should be requested to provide us with a supplementary briefing on this matter?  Agreed.We will now summon the witnesses from Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland before the joint committee.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	The joint committee will now discuss ways of promoting entrepreneurship.  I welcome the following witnesses from the IDA: Mr. Barry O'Leary, CEO; Mr. John O'Brien, divisional manager of corporate services, planning and financial management; and Mr. Brendan McDonagh, planning, EU and tax.  I also wish to welcome the following witnesses from Enterprise Ireland: Mr. Frank Ryan, CEO; Mr. Greg Treston, divisional manager, scaling and high potential start-ups; and Mr. Tom Hayes, divisional manager, entrepreneurship and regions.Members of the joint committee are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2) (l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.With that in mind, I now call on Mr. Frank Ryan to make his presentation.
