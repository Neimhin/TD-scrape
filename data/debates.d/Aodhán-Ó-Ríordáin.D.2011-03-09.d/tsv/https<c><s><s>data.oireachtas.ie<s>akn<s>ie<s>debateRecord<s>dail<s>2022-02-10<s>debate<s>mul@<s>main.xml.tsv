AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I want to know what engagement the Minister has had with the trade union movement on the draft right to request remote working Bill 2022.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The issue the Labour Party has with the Bill as drafted is that the provisions state that a worker would have to wait 26 weeks before requesting permission to work remotely and then potentially 12 further weeks for an answer. That is 38 weeks, which is the length of a pregnancy. The grounds for refusal from an employer are so wide that the Bill is effectively meaningless. We want a right to flexible work, not a right for an employer to refuse it. This is why I ask what sort of engagement the Minister has had with the trade union movement. I do so because it feels as if this Bill is being written with employers in mind, and not workers. He will appreciate and be aware that remote working has brought a lot of benefits to society for those families that wanted to embrace it. It does not suit everybody and not everybody wants it but female participation in the workforce has increased by 3.5% during the pandemic.Does the Minister agree that his legislation is weighed in favour of employers and not workers? 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Nobody likes the Bill is effectively what the Minister is saying. I take what he said in good faith and if he is willing to look at the timelines and the grounds for refusal, that is fair comment. We will work with him on that but he will have to appreciate that the power balance in any of these situations very much lies with the employer. Workers are unlikely to feel very confident in going through this process if they feel it will diminish their opportunities for advancement in the workplace in the long term. As the Minister will be aware, there are any number of family and environmental benefits to working remotely. The gender equality issue also weighs heavily when we are entering this space because remote working does benefit gender equality in the workplace. We are happy to work with him and we hope he can be true to his word.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Two weeks on from voting down the Labour Party's plans to address the cost-of-living crisis, the Government will announce some token measures today. The package that is emerging is around €450 million, which is a drop in the ocean compared with what ordinary families are having to grapple with. The official Government advice from Ministers is to shop around for better value but those suffering under record rent prices cannot shop around; they need a rent freeze. Those looking at soaring energy bills that are up by 30% cannot shop around for better deals; they need real intervention. Those in low paid work cannot shop around; they need a pay rise. Those forced to commute back to the office cannot shop around; they need the right to flexible work. Those wondering how they will feed their families know that shopping around will not help when bread, milk and butter are all rising in price, having gone up by between 10% and 15% over recent weeks. What we know about the Government's cost-of-living package is that it will not go far enough, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform admitted as much this morning. The Government has already committed to a €100 rebate on electricity bills at a cost of €210 million. If that it is doubled, it will bring it to €420 million. By our calculations, an extra two week's of fuel allowance would cost €21 million, but the Government has not widened eligibility. Figures provided to my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, show that more than 20,000 people who applied for the fuel allowance last year were refused. Already this year, of more than 7,000 applications received, more than 3,000 were rejected. In the budget, we called for eligibility to be extended to an extra 100,000 households, but once again, the Government's response is too little and too late. Bringing forward the working family payment increase by three months will cost around €6 million to €9 million and benefit over 50,000 families. However, for the hundreds of thousands of families struggling with the cost of childcare, education and healthcare, there is nothing of substance emerging. Instead of investing in public services, this Government is interested in tax cuts, in throwing €600 million at people who do not need it. The VAT windfall was €1 billion ahead of projections. In January alone, the VAT take was €400 million ahead of what was collected in January 2020. We have the opportunity and this is about choice. There has been no shortage of solutions put forward to ease the burden on workers and families.  It is time the Government shopped around for some new ideas. Will the Tánaiste commit to an immediate increase in the minimum wage? Will he admit the budget last October got it wrong? Will he now commit to a real mini-budget that will do more than tinker at the edges and provide real relief to workers and families?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	What the Tánaiste is engaged in is Bertienomics. He is trying to convince people that the Government can cut their taxes, tinker around with public services and it will all be fine. What the Labour Party has suggested is that there should not be tax cuts. The Tánaiste may think that is an easy thing for an Opposition party to say but it is not. We are telling the people of Ireland straight that if they want to have a proper decrease in their cost of living, the State should provide it and we should not wait for the market to provide solutions on rent or on childcare, and we should not be married to the market as much as this Government. We believe in direct State investment and support. This Government will not introduce a rent freeze. It just will not do it. It will not support a proper publicly funded childcare system, as in every other European country. People in Northern Ireland do not have to pay for schoolbooks or for GP visits but this Government does not have the same vision for citizens in this part of the island. What we in the Labour Party are saying is that we do not want play cheap politics. We do not want to do the auction stuff on tax cuts. We believe in State intervention. What the Tánaiste is trying to do is make cheap political jibes while people are battling for bread, milk and butter.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Exactly; childcare. Spending €10,000 a year on childcare. That is the point.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	By the Labour Party.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Thank you.
