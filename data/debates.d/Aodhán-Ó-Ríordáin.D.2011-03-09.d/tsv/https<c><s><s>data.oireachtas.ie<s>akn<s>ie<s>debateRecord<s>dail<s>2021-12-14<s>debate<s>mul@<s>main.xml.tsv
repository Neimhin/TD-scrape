AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Those of us who campaigned vigorously for the repeal of the eighth amendment were told at the time that, in terms of legislation underpinning reproductive rights for women in this country, there would be a review within three years. That gave an awful lot of comfort to those who were a little disquieted by some of the elements of the legislation. That review has commenced and consultation has started but there is disquiet over the intention of the Cabinet not to revisit the legislation itself. Can I ask the Taoiseach bluntly whether he has ruled out any changes to the legislation that underpins the right to terminate a pregnancy in Ireland?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The programme for Government commits to assist owners of latent defect properties by identifying options for those who have been impacted by defects to access low-cost long-term finance and to bring forward law reform to improve the legal remedies for homeowners dealing with defects. Last night, I had a meeting with the Construction Defects Alliance. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Department have put together a working group which is investigating this issue, as the Taoiseach is aware. We are anxious to know whether the working group is still on schedule to report by the second quarter of 2022 so that any financial implications that may arise from the working group can be included in the budget for next year.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach stated last week that NPHET had not been gagged after the announcement that all Covid communications and requests for interviews were now to be put through the GIS. Who decided that is the way it will be? He also stated last week that he had checked back on what happened the weekend before last and that nobody was stopped from going on any media programme. Is that still his position? Is an investigation under way into who leaked the NPHET decision in the first place or was that just a fabricated row for the Government to distract from the communications omnishambles of the past two weeks? I remind the Taoiseach that I appeared on a media programme last night in respect of the high efficiency particulate air, HEPA, filters grant that has just been announced by the Government. That RTÉ programme could not get a Government representative to appear on it to discuss the issue.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Sunday Independent reported last weekend that the Cabinet was secretly briefed about massive job losses and warned that tens of thousands of jobs could be lost when the EWSS ends next April. Can the Taoiseach confirm this is the case? Is the Government carrying out an analysis of companies that have been getting this support and what supports will be put in place to save jobs? The rising cost of living has been mentioned and it is having a major impact on workers and businesses. Private sector unions are to seek pay claims of up to 4.5% next year to reflect the surge in inflation that is eroding what people can afford and standards of living. As the Taoiseach knows, issues around energy bills have been well ventilated in this House. Will the Taoiseach reflect on the fact that going back to normal is not what many people in this economy need? A total of 23% of Irish workers pre-pandemic were in statistical low pay, according to the OECD, and 40% of young people under the age of 30 were in insecure work. That is not an economic model we want to return to and that is not the type of competitiveness that does young people or vulnerable workers any good at all.
