AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I wish to raise two issues. The first relates to the Tánaiste's contribution to the Seanad last night. I believe it is time we invited the current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, to the House. His Department seems to be completely incapable of giving factual information to the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach will have to correct the record of the House for a third time because of information that was given to him by the Department of Justice and Equality. It also appears that an email that was discovered, which was the centre of the controversy, was not communicated to the Tánaiste for a full week. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, made a bizarre outburst in the Dáil last week when he accused my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, of conducting a smear campaign against him. As we are trying to get the bottom of this situation, all the while remembering that Sergeant Maurice McCabe is the person we should be most concerned about in terms of a smear campaign, I respectfully ask again that the current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, be invited to this House to account for his Department's handling of the current situation. I ask for a debate with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne, who currently has responsibility for the national drugs strategy. When the new strategy was launched in July, a commitment was given that a 12-month working group would be established on the issue of the decriminalisation of drug use. That was a welcome development, and as the Leader and the Members of the Seanad will know, myself and Senator Lynne Ruane have drafted a piece of legislation which would give effect to the decriminalisation of addiction and drug use. We were willing to go with the new strategy and to give it the time and space it needed to bed itself down although we did not necessarily believe in having a separate strategy towards the end goal of decriminalisation of drug use. It is now November, almost December, however, and there is no sign of this working group being established. I respectfully ask that we invite the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne, to the House to discuss the establishment of the working group on the decriminalisation of drug use. It is a very serious issue. I believe there is broad agreement around the House as to how we could look at this issue, and there is great humanity in this House when it comes to the issue of drug use and addiction. We are determined that this working group will be set up, that it will do its work efficiently, and that at the end of a 12 month period it will come to conclusions that would hopefully lead us to adopt a drugs strategy such as that in existence in Portugal. However, four months on, we are no closer to having that working group established. I would like the Minister of State to come in so that we can work with her to ensure that we get that working group established and to work for those in our country who are suffering from the effects of addiction.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will give the Leader a YouTube moment if he wants one.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Who wrote the email?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Who wrote it?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Jesus, Mary and Joseph. A political witch-hunt.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is Frankfurt's way.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Can the Leader confirm that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, will address the House on the current controversy?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. While it is a worthwhile report, I feel the issues in it tinker around the edges. The last time the Minister of State was in this Chamber, we had a long discussion about third level funding and about income-contingent loan schemes or the potential for their introduction. She made the point that she was waiting for the Joint Committee on Education and Skills to come up with proposals to react to the Cassells report. Once the committee did its work the Minister of State said she would react to it. I do not think that washes anymore as a political answer. It is time for the Minister of State and her Department to take leadership in this area. I am still exasperated at the her ministerial colleague in the same Department, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, who still will not state he believes in equality in education in terms of pay and will not commit to the vision of free education. The Union of Students in Ireland, USI, has launched a campaign and the Labour Party has launched a campaign to have a vision for free education at all levels, namely, primary, secondary and third level. The Minister of State's response to our debate was that the Joint Committee on Education and Skills should be allowed to do its work and then to come back to her. That is not good enough. The Joint Committee on Education and Skills is not in charge of education policy in the country. The Minister of State and her Department are. She should be driving the agenda, not the Joint Committee on Education and Skills. If the committee has not got down to doing the work, is not conducting hearings and is nowhere near producing a report on it, the Minister of State must step in as the visionary for higher level education in this country. Hiding behind the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, regardless of the standard of contributor to that committee, is just not good enough. We need from the Minister of State a strong commitment to a vision for free education. No one suggests this can happen overnight, in one budget or even in a number of budgets. It might be possible over five years or perhaps over ten years. However, were that vision to be announced by the Minister of State and her ministerial colleague in the same Department, we might be able to work together to achieve it. Until this point, however, the Minister of State has been hiding behind the Joint Committee on Education and Skills and saying it is up to it to come up with proposals. It is not; it is actually up to the Minister, her ministerial colleague and their Department to set out that vision as to how third level education should be funded and to set out the vision for free education. That is something I believe we should all be able to share and work towards with the Minister. My final point is when we were in government with Fine Gael, one of the biggest rows we had was over the issue of grants for third level. The contention of the Labour Party is that PAYE workers are constantly taking up the tab for others who find access to third level grants, be they maintenance grants or other grants, because of the magic wand of accountants that certain self-employed professions are able to employ. I recall an example of one individual who had €250,000 in a savings account but was still eligible for a full suite of grants for his children to attend third level education. A PAYE worker would not be able to do that. These matters are assessed on need but the suggestion that we would have any kind of a capital assets test, in whatever way, was hugely resisted by the Minister's own party in government and we did not get very far on introducing that. In a system where approximately 45% to 50% of students are availing of some level of grants and it costs approximately €300 million a year to administer these grants, I would have assumed that the most vulnerable of students would be the ones who would avail of these grants and not those who have accountants who can move the money around. Unfortunately, that remains the case. I have two questions for the Minister of State. Does she believe in free education and will she stop hiding behind the Joint Committee on Education and Skills in order that she can verbalise that vision and work towards it? What is the position in respect of the capital asset test and can we look forward to a day when PAYE workers will not always be asked to pick up the tab for those who can avail of accountants who can hide assets and therefore get the grants they do not deserve?
