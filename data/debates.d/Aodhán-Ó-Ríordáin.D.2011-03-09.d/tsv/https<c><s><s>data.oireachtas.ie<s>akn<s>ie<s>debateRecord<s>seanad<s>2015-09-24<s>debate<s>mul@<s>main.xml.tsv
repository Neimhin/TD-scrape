AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	Section 6 is a standard provision which ensures a convention judgment in respect of which an enforcement order has been issued shall have the same force and effect as a judgment of the High Court. The purpose of the amendment is to make this section subject to section 7 of the Bill. The reason for this is as follows. Section 7 makes special provision for the payment of interest on foreign judgments, with subsection (4) of that section specifying that it is only the provisions of that section which will apply to the payment of interest in such judgments. The background to this is that an award of interest on a claim is an integral part of the judgment and therefore it is appropriate that the interest provisions of the country where the judgment was given shall apply and not the Irish provisions.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The new section 9 has the effect of giving an explicit jurisdiction to the Master of the High Court to grant protective measures to a judgment creditor where that creditor seeks such measures in the context of applying to have their convention judgment enforced. In the absence of such a power, there would be a risk that a judgment debtor would be given the opportunity to put assets in Ireland beyond the reach of the creditor before enforcement could take place. Article 7 of the convention makes it clear that interim measures of protection not governed by the terms of the convention and their granting or otherwise are matters to be regulated by national law. Under national law, in the absence of an express provision, the courts would not have jurisdiction to grant these measures in respect of convention judgments.  Following further consideration of this matter, it has been decided that it would not be in keeping with the spirit of the convention if, in the context of an enforcement application, every effort was not made to ensure enforcement would be effective. For that reason, a provision akin to that in respect of the Brussels I Regulation and the Lugano Convention regimes is proposed to be introduced for Hague Convention purposes. Amendment No. 4 is a consequential amendment attendant on the insertion of the new section 9 and relates to the collective citation of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts 1961 to 2015.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The effect of the amendment will be to remove the need for a commencement order in order that the Bill will enter into force immediately on enactment.
