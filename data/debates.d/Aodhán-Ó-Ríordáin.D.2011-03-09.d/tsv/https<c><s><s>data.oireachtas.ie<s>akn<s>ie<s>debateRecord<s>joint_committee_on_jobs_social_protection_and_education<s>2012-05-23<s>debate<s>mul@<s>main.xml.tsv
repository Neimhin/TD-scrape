AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I welcome both groups to today's meeting.  From youngballymun we have Ms Eleanor McClorey, CEO, and Ms Hazel O'Byrne, projects officer.  From the National College of Ireland we have Dr. Philip Matthews, president, Mr. Dan O'Connor, member of the review board, early learning initiative and Dr. Josephine Bleach, director, early learning initiative.  The witnesses are all very welcome.  As they may be aware the committee covers issues under the remit of three Departments and our members are particularly interested in educational disadvantage.  We are pleased the witnesses could attend today to discuss their initiatives.I will inform those present of the position on privilege.  I will read out the rights of witnesses before they get to say anything.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.Before I invite the witnesses to make their presentations I will outline for the committee the basis on which the invitation was made.  A report is being done by me and other members – Deputy John Lyons is involved as well – on educational disadvantage outside of the formal school system.  We sent an invitation to the Department to talk about DEIS but that is not necessarily the focus of the report because educational disadvantage is social disadvantaged transferred to schools.  On that basis we wish to talk to the witnesses about the community element of their work, the research element of it, the breaking down of educational disadvantage in the community and preschool and after-school activities.  That is the focus of the report.  We do not wish necessarily to get into what happens in school time because children do not live in schools and it is the communities from which they come that have a massive role to play in addressing the problems that exist in terms of educational disadvantage.  With that preamble I invite Ms McClorey to begin her presentation.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for two interesting and excellent presentations.  Deputy Smith will be the first member to ask questions, to be followed by Deputies Conaghan, Mitchell O'Connor and Butler.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I will bank some questions and come back after a while.  Is Deputy Conaghan finished?  Is he happy?
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	It was not a general question.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Is Deputy Conaghan happy that he has made his contribution?
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We will return to our guest to respond to the issues raised.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	It was referred to earlier.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	The final contribution will be from Deputy Murphy, after which the witnesses can respond.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We have asked a question and it is only fair that we give-----
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	The point has been made.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	A vote has just been called so we may have to move on.
AodhanORiordan	Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	It is probably a good time to conclude as a vote has been called in the Dáil Chamber.  Sometimes we think we have heard everything that is to said about educational disadvantage, only to learn to learn new information.  Those statistics from the Hart-Risley report on the vocabulary differential between rich and poor children are really striking.  It is a key indicator of how we are not tackling the issue properly at an early age.  Ireland, until a few years ago, had almost zero investment in pre-school education, and that is the sector that would see the greatest benefit.  I am aware that youngballymun did a presentation on that.There has been a suggestion that people should visit these projects and we might speak to the groups, either individually or as a collective, to organise that.  Collective visits have not been overly successful in the past as a particular date may not suit people.  If the groups are willing, I am sure Members would like to visit and see the work.  A report is being compiled and we would appreciate submissions from any member of the committee.  The idea is to take educational disadvantage out of schools and start talking properly about what makes the biggest impact.  The groups present today are making a big difference with their work and we very much appreciate them taking time to come here and present to the committees.
