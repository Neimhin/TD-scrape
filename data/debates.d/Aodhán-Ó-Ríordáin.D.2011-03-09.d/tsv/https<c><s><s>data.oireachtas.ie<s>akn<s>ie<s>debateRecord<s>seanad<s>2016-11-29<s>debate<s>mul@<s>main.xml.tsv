AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The First Minister is extremely welcome and I am delighted to address her on behalf of the Labour Party group in the Seanad. The international labour movement has perhaps had an uncomfortable relationship with national movements in the past. Indeed, our own founder, James Connolly, who was from Edinburgh, once said one could change the symbols of a state but that would never be enough. The First Minister's own national movement for self-determination contains much to admire, certainly in this part of the world where we have seen such sectarian tension, violence and bloodshed. The First Minister's movement for national self-determination has seen none of those things and, in fact, the referendum two years ago was inspiring for us in Ireland to witness. There was a fantastic engagement, in particular with young people, and the vote did not become in any way a sectarian headcount. Rather, it became something that has perhaps unified Scotland. As somebody who is deeply worried about trends across Europe and the world, I find it inspiring to be in the First Minister's presence today. I see what is happening in the USA, Britain and across Europe, but when I hear the First Minister speak, I am inspired that things can perhaps get better. The very first issue she raised in the House today was the refugee crisis. I find that deeply moving. I find the fact that she is so in touch with her own history, our history and our responsibility to that history incredibly moving and inspiring. While nationalism across Europe now has a very bad name, the First Minister's nationalism and her sense of her nation's history is to be greatly commended. I admire her stance on things like TTIP and marriage equality. I admire her determination not to allow her country, the UK and the rest of Europe break away from what has been a good and honourable movement since the mid-1940s.Let us remind ourselves that the European Union arose at a time of great division, war, pain, death and suffering. It appears that it is now turning in on itself on the basis, in respect of the Brexit campaign, of a racist lie on the part of those who pretend to care about public services but who really have a xenophobic heart. The Scottish First Minister is ranged against it, for which we commend her. At this time of great uncertainty and fear, a time when people are facing off against each other and leadership is needed, she is a shining light not only on these islands and across Europe but also across the world. As the inevitable reaches its conclusion and Scotland takes its place among the nations of the world and its self-determination becomes a reality, it should know that in these Houses and this country it will have the closest of allies, not just on the basis of national self-determination but also because of what we must give to the world, namely, our belief systems and values. At this historic juncture, what people in Ireland and Scotland believe in is more important than ever before. I congratulate the Scottish First Minister on her address and offer her our solidarity.
