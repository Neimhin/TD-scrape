AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 8:In page 6, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:
“Fees payable on declaration
3. The Act of 1956 is amended by the substitution of the following section for section 30:
“Fees payable on declaration
30. (1) Subject to subsection (2), whenever any person is by this Act required or empowered to make a declaration for the purposes of this Act, regulations made under this Act may require that such person shall pay, on the making of such declaration, such fee as may be prescribed.(2) Regulations to which subsection (1) applies shall not require the payment of a fee exceeding the maximum fee chargeable pursuant to regulations made under the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Provision of Services) Act 1993 for the issue of a passport to a person aged 18 years or over.”.”.I do not wish to speak to the amendment at length. I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's take on it.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will withdraw with a view to resubmitting. However, it is certainly accepted that the cost involved is quite prohibitive for quite a number of people who are applying. However, on the basis of the Minister of State's response, I will withdraw for resubmission on Report Stage.
