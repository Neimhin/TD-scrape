AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentations. I thank them and their members for keeping our schools open. Without the schools being open, our country cannot function. I would like the witnesses to bring a message back to the members they represent of the gratitude of this committee and the people of Ireland. I have a question for Mr. Boyle before I ask for other responses. Mr. Boyle said he had not met with the Minster in quite some time, even though he has met representatives of NPHET and the Department weekly. When was the last time Mr. Boyle met the Minister?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is once since the schools reopened?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will make some general comments and ask for general reflections. With regard to public health teams and the HSE giving contradictory advice to different schools regarding close contacts, Fórsa has made its comments known about face coverings and PPE. Do the teacher unions have similar concerns? Will Mr. Boyle speak to the DEIS situation in respect of the pupil-teacher ratio, which has not been carried on to the infant or vertical DEIS schools? Will Mr. Pike speak to the issue of the 72 non-contact hours, which SNAs are required to do and on the issue of having SNAs on site during a pandemic? How wise or unwise does Mr. Pike feel that may be? What are the big lessons, from each of the witness's perspective, for post-Covid education in Ireland? What can we learn from this crisis? We did not learn enough from the last one, but what can we learn from this one in order that we can really repair education and make it fit for the people who work in it and for the people who learn in it?
