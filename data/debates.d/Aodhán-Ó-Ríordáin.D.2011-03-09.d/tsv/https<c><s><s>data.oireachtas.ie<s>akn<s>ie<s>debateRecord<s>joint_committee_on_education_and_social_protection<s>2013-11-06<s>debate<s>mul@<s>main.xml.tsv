AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I wish to draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given. They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I advise witnesses that the opening statements they have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. This meeting is devoted to the important issue of the youth guarantee. The committee considered this matter earlier in the year, on foot of which we decided to submit a political contribution to the European Commission. Since then, as agreed by this committee, work on this matter has been undertaken by Senator O'Donnell who, following today's meeting, will endeavour to draw up recommendations for the committee regarding the implementation of the guarantee. The youth guarantee is an EU initiative that was agreed by member states earlier this year. Once implemented from 2014, it will assure young people aged 18 to 25 a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship of work experience within four months of becoming unemployed. The Department of Social Protection is developing an action plan to implement the guarantee in Ireland from next year. I welcome the witnesses: Mr. John McKeon, assistant secretary, and Mr. Terry Corcoran, principal officer, from the Department of Social Protection; Ms Nuala Whelan, Ballymun Job Centre; Mr. James Doorley, National Youth Council of Ireland; Ms Cora Horgan, Tipperary Regional Youth Service; Mr. Joe O'Connor, Union of Students in Ireland; and Ms Fiona Dunne, Irish Congress of Trade Unions. I invite Mr. McKeon from the Department of Social Protection to make his opening statement.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I am conscious that we are ten minutes into Mr. McKeon's presentation. Is it possible for him to summarise the rest of it?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. McKeon for summarising the last part of his presentation, which everybody should have. I now invite Ms Nuala Whelan to make her opening remarks on behalf of Ballymun Job Centre.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I thank Ms Whelan. I will now turn to the National Youth Council of Ireland, then Tipperary Regional Youth Service and finally to the Union of Students in Ireland and ICTU. I invite Mr. James Doorley to make his opening remarks on behalf of the National Youth Council of Ireland.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I invite Ms Cora Horgan to make her opening remarks on behalf of Tipperary Regional Youth Service.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I remind members and guests to turn off their mobile phones because it is interfering with the coverage of proceedings. It would be a shame if the witnesses' presentations were not televised and available to the media and on the Internet. The quality of them needs to come across. If people turn off their phones completely it will make their presentations better. Finally we have a joint contribution from the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I want to give Ms Dunne some time as well. Mr. O'Connor is six and a half minutes into his presentation. Will he summarise the rest of it to give adequate time to her?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We have one hour and 20 minutes left. I ask members to focus on questions rather than statements. They have three minutes each and they should indicate the groups or individuals to whom they are directing their questions. We want to get as much out of this conversation as we can but we must be out of the room by 3.40 p.m.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Mr. O'Connor was asked a specific question.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Most of Deputy Aengus Ã“ Snodaigh's questions are directed at the Department. In the interests of time, rather than asking every group to respond to every question, I ask delegates to indicate their interest in responding to questions.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. O'Connor wish to add anything?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Ms Dunne indicated. I will then allow further questions.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I will allow two members to contribute, Senators O'Donnell and Moran.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	There is a vote in the Seanad.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We could suspend for a few minutes, but I will take Senator Moran's contribution before making a decision.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	In deference to the Senators, particularly Senator O'Donnell who is working on this subject, I propose that we suspend until 3 p.m. before resuming this conversation. Is that agreed?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Does the Senator wish to ask it when we resume?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Would Senator Brennan like to ask his question now?
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I now invite any of the witnesses who wish to respond to the questions from the three previous speakers to do so.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I reiterate the note on privilege that we give out at the beginning of the meeting. Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given. Witnesses are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Others wish to contribute and there are only 20 minutes remaining. I will go to members of the committee first.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I would prefer if we did not use the entity's name. Perhaps there could be a generalised comment on public bodies taking people on internship schemes.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	I will not read the warning a third time.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	There is a great tradition of matchmaking in Kerry.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	We are nearly out of time and I want to give others a chance to make a final contribution.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Doorley is next.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Thank you. Ms Horgan is next.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Thank you. Ms Whelan is next.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	Mr. O'Connor, finally.
AodhanORiordan	 Vice Chairman	2011-03-09	None	That concludes our discussion. I wish to thank the representatives from the Department of Social Protection, Ballymun Job Centre, the National Youth Council of Ireland, Tipperary Regional Youth Service, USI and ICTU for their helpful presentations to the committee. Senator O'Donnell will continue with the work in this regard and the matter will come before the committee again in due course.  The joint committee now stands adjourned until tomorrow morning at 10.30 a.m. when we will give further consideration to the general scheme of the Gender Recognition Bill 2013. The meeting will take place in room A, LH2000.
