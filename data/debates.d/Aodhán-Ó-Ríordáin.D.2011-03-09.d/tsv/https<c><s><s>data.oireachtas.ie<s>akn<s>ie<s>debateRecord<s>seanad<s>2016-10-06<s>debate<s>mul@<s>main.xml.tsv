AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister. It is incredibly apt that students from a primary school have just arrived into the Visitors Gallery. As I presume they are from a primary school, I wish them a very happy trip to the Houses of the Oireachtas and hope they learn loads. If they have questions for the Minister, they should be sure to pass them to me and I will ask them before the end. The Minister is here to make sure students get their homework done properly every night. I appreciate the Minister's presence and want to be as constructive as possible. He has published an action plan for education which is to be commended. We need to have a roadmap for where we want to be and what we want to achieve. Education is something about which many people in Ireland feel very strongly. When one travels around the world and visits other jurisdictions to see what they are doing in education, sometimes the statements they make or their ambitions can strike a chord because perhaps such ambitions are missing in Ireland. I spent some time in West Dunbartonshire in Glasgow visiting a very disadvantaged community. They speak about wanting to see the absolute eradication of illiteracy. The total eradication of illiteracy is their motivation and ambition. Would it not be wonderful if in Ireland the national obsession in the education system was with the total eradication of illiteracy? One in three children leaving disadvantaged schools has basic reading problems and about 17.9% of the adult population is functionally illiterate. We have an issue with literacy which the previous Government did a huge amount to try to address.  The people of Finland will state the aspect which underpins their education philosophy is equality. It is not a principle of one party or another or of the left or the right but what they have collectively agreed. They have decided and all accept that equality in the education system is what is best for all children. The problem in Ireland is that we do not really have a word or phrase that underpins our education philosophy. I do not believe we do. In Ireland we have a publicly funded education system that is not a State education system because we outsource it to schools, boards of management and patron bodies. What inevitably happens is that competition gets into the mix and the system perpetuates inequality.We separate children on the basis of religion and gender. Where else in society do we believe it is acceptable to separate children on the basis of gender at the age of four years? Is it any surprise that gender stereotypes evolve in society when children in so many schools are separated on the basis of gender? It is probably more of an urban than a rural phenomenon. The construct of the education system allows it to happen. Only last week the Ombudsman for Children asked for the relationship between the State and the education system to be re-evaluated. It is time for us to set out a roadmap, in conjunction with the Minister's action plan for education, to lance the boil of the constitutional impediment to a genuine State education system. When we try to engage on issues related to school books or transport or try to bring about an education system like that in Northern Ireland, representatives of the Department of Education and Skills almost faint at the suggestion we have actual day-to-day engagement and a role in managing the day-to-day affairs of schools. They are horrified by the idea. The action plan for education is unlike any other action plan for education in Europe because we have a constitutional impediment to day-to-day involvement in the running of schools. This goes back to religious and baptism issues and all the rest of it. In the full light of day in a modern republic, this set-up appears to be absolutely crazy. I tried successfully to amend section 37 of the Employment Equality Act. What was it about? It was about trying to ensure LGBT, divorced or unmarried and cohabiting teachers would not be discriminated against by their schools. I could only amend the legislation. I could not have it repealed completely because of the constitutional reality in terms of where we stood in the education system. The 1995 Hart and Risley study proved how a three-year-old from a welfare-dependent family had one third of the oral language capacity of a three-year-old from a professional family. The Minister was in the north inner city recently. He quite rightly said the relationship between the school and wider community was paramount. We cannot achieve everything in the school system. Children do not live in schools. However, the reality is that we need far more certainty on the ABC programme which the Minister was in Darndale recently celebrating and it was great to see him there. We have rolled out 13 such programmes throughout the State. They work with schools and the wider community to tackle acute disadvantage. We need more certainty from the Minister in that regard. Obviously, he has a role in working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in that regard. The issue of special needs assistants, SNAs, in the education system is central. A report was compiled last year by Senator Mary Moran on the role of SNAs. It highlighted the uncertainty they faced, the nature of their career path and the fact they should be an essential part of the education system, rather than their role being chopped and changed from year to year as budgetary priorities went up and down. The issue of teacher diversity must be addressed. A teacher is capable of being a powerful role model. How are we addressing the issue of getting more working class and Traveller children, as well as more children from ethnically diverse backgrounds, into teaching roles? How powerful would it be for the average Irish primary school to have a teacher from the Traveller community, a disadvantaged background or an eastern European background? That does not happen often and there are many and varied reasons for it, but can we engage with the teacher training colleges to determine how we can improve the position, given that it is such a powerful role? It is a question of the ambition we have for the society we are trying to construct. It is not simply about producing economic units. I realise the Minister has come from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. I appreciate that his mindset has had to be recast over the summer months. The purpose is not simply to become an economic unit. That is not the point of education but to believe and understand the beauty of poetry, language, music, dance, sport and the basis for why we are alive. That is what education is all about. These are more profound than simply becoming an economic unit. I wish that ambition was written throughout the action plan for education with a view to moving towards the goal of empowering young people to be the best they can possibly be. We need to focus more on equality as being fundamental to our educational vision and try harder to lance the boil within the Constitution. That is something we have to grasp. Why not say we want to eradicate illiteracy in society? If the Minister does that, the Labour Party will support him.
