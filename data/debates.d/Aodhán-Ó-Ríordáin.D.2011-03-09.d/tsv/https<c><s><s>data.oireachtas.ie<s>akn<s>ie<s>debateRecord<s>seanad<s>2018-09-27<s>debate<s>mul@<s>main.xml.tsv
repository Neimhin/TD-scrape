AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for being here. I very much appreciate it and know that she will feel strongly about the issue I am about to raise. I also appreciate that her Department is working as best it can to find a resolution to the issues I raise. I welcome in the Gallery Ms Fiona Bailey, the mother of Sam Bailey. I met the family of Grace O'Malley from Mayo last week. Last week there was a demonstration outside Leinster House, of which I think the Minister of State was aware, about the 25 children in this country who suffer from spinal muscular atrophy type 2. It called on the Government to speed up the process of making the wonder drug, as it is called, Spinraza available to these children. It is a vitally important intervention that these children greatly need. What the families are asking for is the exact timeline for negotiation between the HSE and Biogen, the manufacturer of this drug. The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, who I know is engaged in this issue and seeks a resolution of it, tweeted last week to one of the parents involved in this campaign that the issue is currently with the HSE, that there needs to be engagement between the HSE and the company, that he will make sure it happens and that he knows how important it is to families. What the families are really asking for is clarification as to where the process is. It is understood that Biogen made an offer on 29 July and that a high-level meeting on the issue may be held in the Department tomorrow. Spinal muscular atrophy type 2 is a particularly difficult condition with which to live. The families are doing their absolute best and they appreciate that there are people working in the Department who are doing their best to ensure we can come to a resolution of this issue. I know from my time as a Minister of State in that Department and from working in these Houses that no one in politics tries to be a blocker or to increase the suffering of children. The 25 children are doing well but, having spoken to their families last week and again this morning, I understand they fear facing into winter, even at this time of year. The impact winter could have on children with this condition is frightening.This drug could make all the difference. It is freely available in 20 countries in Europe, but for some reason, two do not have it, one of which, unfortunately, is Ireland. We know the process and campaign the Government went through to find a solution for children with cystic fibrosis in the case of Orkambi. It was much appreciated. I think it is within the Minister of State's capacity to give the families affected by this condition some hope. They want clarification of where the Government is in negotiations with the company. Can we hope and expect Spinraza to be freely available for the children in question in that they can look forward to having more complete lives and fulfilling their potential?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the answer and the fact that the Minister of State has outlined the process involved, but what the families really need to know is when it will happen. I know that the Minister of State may not be in a position to give me that answer now, but I ask her to impress on the Minister the importance of this matter. I understand the HSE has yet to make the final decision, but I think the Minister of State appreciate that the families listening to this debate, including a mother who is in the Visitors Gallery, want to know when it will be made. Will the Minister of State impress on the Minister the importance of the matter? Is he in a position to meet representatives of the families? Will he give an assurance, as he did, in fairness, through social media last week, that he cares passionately about it? Will the Minister of State ask him for clarity on the timeline involved? That is what the families really want. While they appreciate that negotiations are ongoing, that there is a cost issue and that these matters are technical and complicated, the issue is of critical importance to the children. Will the Minister of State impress on the Minister the importance of meeting the families to outline the timeline involved? We cannot live off an answer that a final decision has yet to be made, with no sense as to when it will be made. As a compassionate politician, the Minister of State will appreciate this. I ask for clarity on the issue. I know that the Minister will listen to the Minister of State and wants to engage with the families to bring the matter to a successful conclusion.
