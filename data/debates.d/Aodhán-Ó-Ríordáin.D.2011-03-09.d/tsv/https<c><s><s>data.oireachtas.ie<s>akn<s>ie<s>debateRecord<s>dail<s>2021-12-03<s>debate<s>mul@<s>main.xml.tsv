AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I tried to put this question concerning the decriminalisation of drug users to the Minister for Justice, but it was redirected to the Department of Health, which I am sure will be of interest to those who have criminal convictions for possession of controlled substances for personal use. I will be interested to know the Department of Health's view of the potential for the decriminalisation of the drug user.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There are several issues with the response from the Minister of State. The use of language in this debate is extremely important. I referred to the decriminalisation of the "drug user", while the response from the Minister of State refers to the "decriminalisation of drugs" and continues with a reference to the legalisation of drugs. Decriminalisation and legalisation are completely different issues, as are decriminalisation of the drug user and decriminalisation of drugs. I am talking about the person, and the decriminalisation of the person. If the Minister of State had come in here at the beginning of the pandemic and said that the solution to Covid-19 was to arrest everyone who gets it, everybody would have thought she was out of her mind. People at the start of the pandemic would have regarded people working on the front line or living in poor conditions, for example, as victims of this virus, not as people who should be penalised by the State. It would be a ridiculous response from the State to arrest people because they have Covid-19, but that is exactly what the State does in respect of people with addiction issues. We arrest them for possession of something they are addicted to. It does not work. We have the fourth highest overdose rate in Europe. People are dying and the response-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----must be much more compassionate than misinformed answers on the floor of this House.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry. The Minister of State's proposal is that people will get a criminal sanction if they are caught a third time. What is the difference? If someone is acutely and profoundly addicted to something, surely the hundredth time that he or she has an intervention because of that addiction should have the same response as the third time. What is utterly heartbreaking about this is that the people affected are powerless. If they had more power and more value in society, we would not be treating them like this and they would not be ending up in graveyards at the rate they are. It is because they are disproportionately poor that they are treated by the State in this fashion. I suggest to the Minister of State that the proposal for a citizens' assembly on drugs be fast-tracked, she put to one side her current proposal on how to deal with people in addiction and look instead to the Portuguese model, which is much more humane and has successfully reduced the number of people in addiction programmes by 50%. Crucially, it has also reduced the number of people dying from overdoses by 75%.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	We have the fourth highest overdose rate in Europe. The Minister of State should please understand the difference between decriminalisation of drugs and decriminalisation of the drug user.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	They are completely different things, and the Minister of State needs to understand that.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I want respect for those dying as a result of this issue. I also want a citizens' assembly on drugs.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is that the response? This over and back and "Why did you not do it"?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Where is the citizens' assembly?It is in the programme for Government. Is that the Minister's response?
