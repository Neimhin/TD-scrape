AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	I am pleased to be here on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald. As I indicated on Second Stage, the Government is fully is committed to implementing all of the recommendations made by Mr. Justice Quirke and will be providing all of the health services recommended in his report. I am unable to accept amendments Nos. 1 and 5. As I have stated, the women who were in Magdalen laundries will be able to avail of their GP of choice, whether he or she is a participant in the general medical card scheme or a fully private GP. However, if the Bill were amended as suggested and provided health services as outlined in section 2 of the 1996 Act, it would mean that chiropody and physiotherapy would not be provided in the Bill as there is no such provision in section 2 of the 1996 Act. Moreover, the counselling services in the Act are specifically described as counselling services in respect of hepatitis C. Since none of the women has hepatitis C, amendment No. 5 would be of no benefit to the women. The effect of these amendments would be to cause confusion and provide a more restricted service than is currently provided in section 2 of the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	My responsibility and that of the Department is to implement fully the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke. I do not necessarily want to do this but there is a statement from JFM research, National Women's Council of Ireland, which sets out a list of things which are not in the Bill. Of the ten listed, Nos. 1, 3, 6, 7 and 9 flatly contradict the recommendations because they are provided for in the Bill. If people are going to send out statements on what is and is not in the Bill, I wish they would stick to the facts because it is easy to make a statement understanding how passionate and emotional people feel about this issue. Frankly, as the Senator is listing things that are not in the Bill, of course it will upset people. At first glance, that Nos. 1, 3, 6, 7 and 9 are wrong, is remarkable, and-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	-----No. 8 is not relevant yet. I will state categorically what our job is here. Mr. Justice Quirke recommends that legislation be introduced to give effect to his recommendation with regard to the provision of health services. In his report Mr. Justice Quirke was of the opinion that the women of the Magdalen laundries should be provided with access to a comprehensive suite of health services. Mr. Justice Quirke's recommendation that the women receive medical services equivalent to those provided by the holder of a HAA card has been given effect in this Bill. However, he also stated that not all of the services described in the hepatitis C guide may be directly relevant to the Magdalen women and any comparable guide for the Magdalen women would require suitable adaptation. This is Mr. Justice Quirke's report. It should be noted that the services provided in section 2 of the Bill are precisely those recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke on page 35 of his report. I ask Senators to compare the Bill with the report. They include general practitioner services, prescribed drugs, medicines, aid and appliances, dental, ophthalmic and aural services, home supports, home nursing, counselling services, chiropody, podiatry and physiotherapy. All of these services are specified in section 2 and will be made available free of charge to the women who were in the Magdalen laundries. I appeal to Senators and those sending out press releases to look at the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	They will have exactly the same facilities as the hepatitis C people; there is no difference according to the 1996 Act. If there is confusion, unfortunately it is unnecessary confusion. If I am coming across as being quite strident I apologise, but I feel strongly that we must have clear, concise proper information for the women.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely incorrect.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	They get the drugs as provided for in the reimbursement list. It is the same as the hepatitis C-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is absolutely incorrect.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is in black and white in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Not in legislation but-----
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No. 5, which is in regard to counselling for the woman herself, is being made available in the Bill but not to her immediate family. Hepatitis C was different because of the potential for cross-contamination.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Some kind of advocacy services outside of counselling, but not specifically in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely incorrect. It is in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That statement is incorrect. It is in the Bill, black and white.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	After the Bill is implemented they will be available.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely incorrect. It is in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is in the Bill.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	At least six of those points are flatly wrong. They are in black and white in the Bill. I appreciate why people might be upset or concerned when a press release of this nature comes out but, as legislators, we can only deal with what is in the Bill in black and white, not what is in a press release.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	No.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Obviously, my previous comments have been misconstrued by Senators. I do not want anybody who has gone through this lifetime abuse, if one wants to call it that, to have that situation compounded by misinformation. I sat through the debates in the Dáil, sitting beside officials and listening to contributions from people who clearly had not read a single word of the Bill. They walked into the Dáil and decided that whatever the Government was doing was wrong, and they got very hot and heavy and made speeches without referring to a single item in the Bill. Anyone on the outside watching this debate would assume the Government is not implementing the Quirke report and is implementing something completely different. A political opportunity was used by speakers in the Dáil in order to give that impression. This is my second time in the House discussing this Bill. What I am saying now is similar to what I was saying on the last occasion in respect of the provisions of this Bill. When it comes to dealing with legislation, I have to say that, on the various different issues, I have had very good interaction with the Members in this House. I assume we are on the same side on this. There comes a stage when the campaigning ends and the winning begins. That is the same in every single campaign that anybody has ever been involved in. There comes a stage when the winning begins. This Bill is where the winning begins in terms of what Mr. Justice Quirke has asked for. I cannot say more. I am not asking the Members to look at a press release from the Department of Justice and Equality or to look at a statement that Minister X, Y or Z has made. I am asking them to look at the green piece of paper they have all been given, which is the Bill in front of them, which they have been asked, as legislators, to pass through this esteemed House. The Bill states:Provision of health services without charge to relevant participants2. (1) The Health Service Executive shall make available without charge to relevant participants—(a) the general practitioner medical and surgical service specified in section 58 of the Act of 1970 [the same as with hepatitis C],(b) drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances for the time being on the Reimbursement List within the meaning of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 [as noted by Senator Moloney],(c) the nursing service specified in section 60 of the Act of 1970 [the same as with hepatitis C],(d) the home help service specified in section 61 of the Act of 1970, following an assessment of needs made by a registered medical practitioner or a registered nurse that the service is so required [the same as with hepatitis C],(e) the dental, ophthalmic and aural services specified in section 67 of the Act of 1970 [the same as with hepatitis C],(f) a counselling service, following a referral made in that regard by a registered medical practitioner, relative to a relevant participant’s admission to and work in any of the institutions specified in the Schedule [the same as with hepatitis C],(g) a chiropody service... and(h) a physiotherapy service... [the same as with hepatitis C].All I am asking Senators to do is to look at what is in the Bill and to acknowledge that the only difference relates to quite specific circumstances which directly relate to hepatitis C and which do not relate to the Magdalen women. Mr. Justice Quirke's report is being implemented in full, and no Government, Parliament, Seanad or Dáil should stand over anything less. If I appear to be irritated by the misinformation, it is because I do not want people whose life experiences have been trawled through the media and in public comment in the last while, and who are trying to come to terms with their life experience, to have that situation compounded by misinformation and press releases and statements which are factually incorrect. I plead with Senators to look at the report and to look at the only bit of paper that is important in this context, namely, the Bill. I ask them to make their assessment, as myself and Senator Gilroy have done, by going through the subsections which list the ten services which we were told were not in the Bill but which we know are there because we have dissected them one by one. If Members do not believe me, I will make this offer. If the Cathaoirleach wants to adjourn the House for a few moments, if that is possible under the Order of Business, the officials here would be quite happy to nail down in a detailed manner the individual questions the Senators have. However, I would say this. I have been here before and have outlined this before. I would ask those who are making statements to refer to the Bill and we can get some really solid work done here today.
AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	Some of the issues that were concerning Senators have been outlined by officials outside the Chamber. If the Senators have any remaining questions that they want put on the record of the House, I am quite happy to reply to them.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	If the Senator asks a question, I will give a "Yes" or "No" answer.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The only difference is, as Senator Norris already outlined, the medication or services that were specific to hepatitis C. That is the only difference because it would not be relevant to the Magdalen women. That is the only reason and it is the only change.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I concur completely with Senator O'Donnell's understanding. I can confirm that Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's understanding is completely correct as well, in terms of dental and ophthalmic services. The only difference is that some of these provisions in relation to hepatitis C are not relevant to Magdalen laundries. That is the only reason. There is no other motivation behind the changes in legislation. Whatever the women were entitled to in terms of hepatitis C, the Magdalen women are also absolutely entitled to, as is correct. The only difference is for certain circumstances and certain services which are not relevant because they are specific to women who were suffering from hepatitis C.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On the last point, some of these payments are made over a continuing period until the ladies pass away so it is not as if we have to continue with these payments. The remarks about the Justice for Magdalenes group are well made. It has done sterling work and has been campaigning on a great injustice that was done to these women for a very long time. It is an Ireland to which none of us ever wants to return. When we debated this issue previously, I said there are many issues that still have to be dealt with in Ireland, particularly about the status of women, and also our love affair with institutionalising people which we still do to this day. We have spoken previously in this House on issues in this regard. When a press release or a statement, which is factually incorrect, is issued, as Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, I have to point to what is correct and what is incorrect. We have to refer to the Bill. I would make the point that there is in all things in life and in politics a time when the campaigning ends and winning begins. I genuinely feel that this is where the winning is beginning for women who deserve no less from the State. It is the intention for these provisions to be made available a month after the Bill is signed into law by the President. We have lost another week but if that week makes Senators more at ease with the Bill that is passing, then it is a week worth taking.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I agree with the views expressed by Senators that the service would be a very useful facility to provide to Magdalen women who have capacity issues. The Department of Justice and Equality is in discussion with the Citizens Information Board with regard to the provision of personal advocacy services to Magdalen women and will have further discussions with the Department of Social Protection in this regard. Section 5 of the 2007 Act has not yet been commenced and will require commencement in order for such a service to be provided.While I believe it is important to make the option of advocacy available to women who need it, it is also important to recognise that the role of a personal advocate under the 2007 Act is limited to assisting an individual to apply for a social service. The personal advocate does not have power of attorney or cannot otherwise manage the affairs of an individual. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill 2013, to which the Senator refers will provide an important additional safeguard for some of the Magdalen women who need more than an advocacy service. The Committee Stage debate on this Bill, which makes detailed provision in respect of a range of options - including decision-making assistance, co-decision makers, decision-making representatives and the public guardian - is due to be taken in the Dáil. The provisions to which I refer will cater more fully for the range of situations likely to arise in respect of Magdalen women who have capacity issues.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Senators' points are well made and we will do the best we can in that regard.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Again, I take on board the points made by the Senators. We will hopefully have more to say in respect of this issue on Report Stage.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	While I understand the motivation behind the amendment, unfortunately I cannot accept it. This is because it would make no sense for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to be asked to report if the Bill is used to implement the ex gratia scheme, when that scheme is not contemplated by the legislation at all. As the Senators are aware, the recommendations in regard to the scheme have been already implemented in full and as recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke. All women who worked in the relevant institutions receive payments of between €11,500 and €100,000, depending on the length of time they spend in those institutions. They also receive top-up payments to ensure their weekly State benefits of up to €100 until they reach 66 years of age and then the equivalent of the State contributory pension, €230.30 per week, for the remainder of their lives. To date, more than €18 million has been paid out and payments will continue to be made to the women for the rest of their lives. The Bill makes provision for all of the health services recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke but it does not implement the ex gratia scheme or various other things recommended by him. I reiterate that all of the recommendations made by Mr. Justice Quirke will be implemented in full and that the introduction of legislation will not be required in most instances.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This House has a proud record of pursuing issues that are of importance to it. We have engaged in an informative and robust debate on the Bill today. I would be both proud and honoured to return to the House at any time - at the invitation of Senators - to discuss any aspect of the legislation or the ex gratia payments being made to the women. I am sure also the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, would be happy to come here to discuss any relevant matters with Senators.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	There are enough avenues within the Houses of the Oireachtas for Members to hold the Government to account and to find out facts and figures in terms of the payments and how the provisions of the Bill are being implemented. I refer, for example, to parliamentary questions, the Topical Issue debate, or in this House by means of a Private Members' motion, commencement debate or other means. I do not believe an amendment to the Bill is necessary in this regard. I am quite sure Members of the Oireachtas have lots of avenues to hold the Government to account, and likewise the Bill, and to allow for Members to stand up in various ways to ensure the women get what they are entitled to.
