AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am. I can confirm that my captors are treating me very well here in Leinster House. I thank the witnesses for their presentations. I will keep my comments as brief as possible. Professor Cunnane mentioned a very inspirational discussion on funding, the Cassells report, etc. I was hoping that others will also get an opportunity to touch on that. What has been learned from Covid in the sector? What has it exposed? There is a temptation for people to say "When we get back to normal" but for many people and many sectors, normal was the problem. Could the delegates speak to what normal was the problem in their sector, what can be learned from it and how we can make sure we do not waste a good crisis? I am aware that the delegation has already touched on the engagement on equality and ensuring the existence of a student body that is representative of Irish society, including new communities, disadvantaged communities and the Traveller community? Could the witnesses speak to that? Could they refer to gender equality, which is also important? Could they speak about funding, what has been learned from the pandemic, the normal to which we do not want to return, and the issue of inclusivity?
