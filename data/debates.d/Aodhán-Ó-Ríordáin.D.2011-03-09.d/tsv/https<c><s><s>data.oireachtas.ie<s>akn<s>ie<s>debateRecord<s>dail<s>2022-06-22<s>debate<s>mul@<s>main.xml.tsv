AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	My amendments are Nos. 14, 15, 17, 18 and 50. Amendment No. 14 states, under the broad heading of "Academic freedom", that "Nothing in this Act shall be construed as modifying or restricting the principle of academic freedom as provided for in section 14 of the Universities Act 1997.” Amendment No. 15 inserts on page 16 between lines 3 and 4 "support and recognise the application of the principle of academic freedom", and we feel strongly that the principle of academic freedom needs to be implicit throughout the Bill. Amendment No. 17 attempts on page 17, line 4 after "frameworks" to insert “support the autonomy [as has been said previously] and decision-making capacity of designated institutions of higher education". Amendment No. 18 is to insert the line "to freely express its views on matters concerning the higher education sector". The principle of autonomy and academic freedom is central to what we are trying to achieve in the language we want to insert in the Bill. We spoke a lot about this on Committee Stage, where, as the Minister said, we had a progressive and constructive interchange. Amendment No. 50 inserts:(6) Nothing in this section shall be construed as permitting an interference with the autonomous capacity of each designated institution of higher education to determine— (a) which courses and programmes it develops and maintains, or(b) the number of students that will be accommodated on any course or programme or within each designated institution of higher education.”.Again, the autonomy of individual institutions and academic freedom are the main points in all those amendments. 
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the point the Minister makes on amendment No. 18. There is nothing in the Bill that precludes an institution expressing its view but we are trying to say here that having it explicitly referenced in the Bill gives more cover to somebody who was minded to express their views.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I support the amendment. The point about teacher training is well made. Most teachers are now trained by a private online training college, which is owned by a book company. The Minister was in my part of the world not long ago at the Marino Institute of Education. When we are trying to change the nature of teaching and teachers, ensure the teaching profession is reflective of the children being taught and encourage those from different backgrounds, including disadvantaged, Traveller, migrant and disability backgrounds, to provide that public service remit, having most of our teachers coming from a college outside of the public sphere is not something we should welcome. The amendment tabled by Deputy Conway-Walsh is deserving of support.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will address amendment No. 19. We suggest that, between lines 9 and 10 of page 17, it be included that one of the functions of an tÚdarás shall be to "advise the Minister in relation to the adequacy of the level of public funding that is made available for higher education and to advise on future funding requirements". All of these amendments are on a similar theme. Amendment No. 33 speaks to the same thing and proposes to insert "the funding status of individual designated institutions of higher education". Amendment No. 42, which is also in this grouping, is similar and refers to "the funding status of individual designated institutions of higher education". They are all on funding, which has been the subject of the overarching debate we have had over many years since the Cassells report and before it. The public funding of higher education is absolutely key and the Bill has to reflect that. That is why we have proposed these three amendments. If passed, an tÚdarás would have a function in this area. The other amendments speak to that issue as well.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Minister was doing so well.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 14:In page 16, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:
“Academic freedom
9. Nothing in this Act shall be construed as modifying or restricting the principle of academic freedom as provided for in section 14 of the Universities Act 1997.”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 15:In page 16, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:“(c) support and recognise the application of the principle of academic freedom,”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 17:In page 17, line 4, after “frameworks” to insert the following:“and to support the autonomy and decision-making capacity of designated institutions of higher education”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 18:In page 17, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:“(n) to freely express its views on matters concerning the higher education sector,”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 19:In page 17, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:“(o) advise the Minister in relation to the adequacy of the level of public funding that is made available for higher education and to advise on future funding requirements,”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 24:In page 18, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:
“Direction and guidelines to be published
13. The Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and to be published on the Minister’s website—(a) any direction issued under section 11, and(b) any guidelines issued under section 12.”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 33:In page 32, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:“(c) the funding status of individual designated institutions of higher education,”.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 34:In page 32, to delete lines 24 to 36, and in page 33, to delete lines 1 to 6 and substitute the following:“(5) The Minister shall, for the purpose of preparing a strategy, consult with—(a) representatives of students attending designated institutions of higher education,(b) designated institutions of higher education or their representative bodies, and(c) such other bodies or persons as the Minister considers appropriate.”.On Committee Stage, many of the amendments we and other tabled focused heavily on the student voice being implicit and present throughout the Bill and, likewise, that of trade union representatives. Amendment No. 41 in the same grouping reads as follows:In page 34, to delete lines 33 to 35, and in page 35, to delete lines 1 and 2 and substitute the following:“35.(1) An tÚdarás shall prepare a performance framework for the higher education and research system (in this section referred to as a “performance framework”) at intervals of not less that once every 5 years and may publish the performance framework in such manner as it considers appropriate.(2) An tÚdarás shall, for the purpose of preparing a performance framework, consult with—(a) representatives of students attending designated institutions of higher education,(b) designated institutions of higher education or their representative bodies, and(c) such other bodies or persons as the Minister considers appropriate.”. Amendment No. 49 proposes that "In developing a funding framework under paragraph (a), An tÚdarás consult with the designated institutions of higher education or their representative bodies".
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 42:In page 35, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:“(b) the funding status of individual designated institutions of higher education;” .
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 51:In page 38, line 19, after “section 139” to insert “or to adequately explain non-compliance in accordance with section 139 (7)*,”. Amendment No. 51 seeks to have "non-compliance" explained adequately. Any reference to "non-compliance" as dictated in the Bill needs to be explained comprehensively. This a reasonable suggestion. Amendment No. 67 would seek to insert "or the adequacy of any explanation for non-compliance provided pursuant to section 139(7)*”. Amendment No. 96 is in a similar vein and seeks to insert "in order to enable the provision of an adequate explanation for any non-compliance". Again, non-compliance cannot be something passive. It must be accounted for. Amendment No. 102 seeks to insert "in order to enable the provision of an adequate explanation for any non-compliance". Amendments Nos. 139 to 141, inclusive, seek to insert "Where a designated institution of higher education departs from guidelines, codes or policies prepared under subsection (1), the designated institution of higher education shall be afforded an opportunity to provide an explanation" with regard to the parts of the guidelines, codes or policies it departs from. Again, "shall" is that important word. Amendment No. 141 speaks to the same.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 53:In page 38, line 21, after “requirements,” to insert “and”.The final part of this section, relating to conditions of funding, states, "to comply with such other conditions as may be determined by the Chief Executive Officer.". We want that removed. We do not see the need for the CEO to have such influence in this matter. That is why we want the word "and" inserted at the end of section 38(2)(f) and the word "and" removed from the end of (g).
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 54:In page 38, line 22, to delete “thereunder, and” and substitute “thereunder.”.
