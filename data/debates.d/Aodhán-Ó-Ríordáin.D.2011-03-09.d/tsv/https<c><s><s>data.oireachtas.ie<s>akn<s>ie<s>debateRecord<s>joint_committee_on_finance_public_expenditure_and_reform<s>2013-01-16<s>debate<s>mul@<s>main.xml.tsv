AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I wish to ask the Governor about a financial transactions tax. Eleven eurozone countries have recently signed up to proceed with a tax on their financial transactions. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has said that such a tax would put 33,000 jobs in the IFSC at risk and that he would not do it without the co-operation of the UK. At a recent event in Dublin I spoke to Ed Balls, MP, who said that even as an opposition politician he would not agree with a financial transaction tax in the UK without the co-operation of New York. In June 2010 the Governor said that such a tax would do little for improving the efficiency or safety of the financial system and would not generate as much revenue as some would suppose. At a level of 0.1%, how much would such a tax raise? Does he still hold the view that it would do little for improving the efficiency or safety of the financial system in Ireland? I would like to get as tight language as we possibly can on the Government's ambition to exit the EU-IMF programme in 2013. Does the Governor believe such a target is achievable and credible?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Do I have any time left?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The Governor has not answered my question about how much it might raise. I understand those 11 eurozone countries have signed up to a rate of 0.1%. How much would that raise in the Irish context? He has said the consequences for job losses or the impact on the economy would not be as grave as some people suggest. I ask him to flesh out the consequences it might have and how much it might raise in Ireland.
