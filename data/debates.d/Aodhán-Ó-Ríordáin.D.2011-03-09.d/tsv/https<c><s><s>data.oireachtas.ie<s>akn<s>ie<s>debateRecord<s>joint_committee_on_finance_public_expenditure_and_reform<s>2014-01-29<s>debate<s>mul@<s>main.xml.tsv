AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the delegates. The report is interesting, as is much of the information given in response to questions. We had all assumed the Central Bank was in the business of ensuring people were not exploited. When the Central Bank engages with people on the receiving end of these loans, whom it states it is trying to protect, how do the delegates describe an APR of 287%?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Is there an adjective Mr. Sheridan would use? Would he describe it as excessive?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I would describe an interest rate of 287% as pornographic, but that is just me. Mr. Sheridan talks about people who want short-term loans, but if they want short-term loans at that range, between 23% and 287%, it means that they have something in their lives they want to finance at short notice. It could be the cost of a funeral or Christmas expenses and concerns something they cannot afford but that they must get over. There could be an element of trauma attached to it. Is this the experience of Mr. Sheridan?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	They will take money at any cost in order to get through this period.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I must look at it in those terms because Mr. Sheridan has said he has engaged with lenders and that is the basis of his report. I assume he talked to the MABS which has done a lot of work with the Traveller community on the reasons moneylending becomes a problem in that community. Surely he has some appreciation of the reasons people need short-term loans and, at difficult times in their lives, they are wide open to being exploited by some of these guys.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	That is always the argument made against doing anything. With any legal vice in society, people say that if we touch or regulate it too much, it will move underground. Is that a good enough excuse?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	It is not an encouraging balance that we are trying to strike here. To go back to the issue of those who need short-term loans, the suggestion from the witnesses is that they would resist an interest rate cap. Surely anybody listening to this conversation or studying these figures would say that any interest rate that creeps up to 287% has to be challenged, controlled and driven down. People are only going to engage with a regulated industry that they can trust and that they fundamentally believe will not exploit them. I do not think the argument about the potential for driving people into the underground market holds much water. Do the witnesses believe there is room for manoeuvre on this? The legislative body of which we are all Members has a responsibility to help the witnesses out and we must take that responsibility seriously. However, we are not in the business of allowing people to be exploited. What we are doing here essentially is saying that it is very sad that Mrs. Murphy is being charged over 200% for a loan to get her through a devastating period in her life but, hey, that is just the way it is. That seems to be the general consensus from the body politic and the Central Bank.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Does that mean that 88% said "No"? What did the others say?
