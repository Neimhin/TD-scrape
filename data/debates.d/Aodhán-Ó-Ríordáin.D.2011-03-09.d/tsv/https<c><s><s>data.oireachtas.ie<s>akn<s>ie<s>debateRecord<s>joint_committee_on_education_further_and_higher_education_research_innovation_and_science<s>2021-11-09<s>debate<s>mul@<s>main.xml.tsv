AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	The witnesses are welcome. I appreciate their presentations. I think it is the view of the committee that this is our one chance in a generation to reform the leaving certificate when we come out of this pandemic. The examination has remained largely unchanged from the time we were all traumatised by it, back in the day when we sat it. We have to address a number of things, but two in particular. The first is what school is like for the young people or children going through it. Are they studying things they are interested in? The second is how those things are assessed. You could have a great experience in school studying and learning things you are interested in, but the model of assessing what you know is brutal. Alternatively, you could have a situation where you are not that interested because what you are being asked to learn does not reflect who you are, where you are from, your background, heritage and culture or the interests of those in the locality you are from. You are asked to study things that are alien to you and then to go through an assessment process that is brutal and that does not reflect your abilities and how you learn. Some 15% of students who go to DEIS second level schools do not make it as far as leaving certificate. We have a reasonably high level of retention until leaving certificate year. I think it is approximately 91%, which reflects pretty well internationally, but it is 85% in DEIS schools. I have a few statistics. The number of DEIS schools where not a single student studies higher level English at leaving certificate level is 31. There are 39 DEIS schools where not a single student does higher level Maths and 41 where not a single student does higher level Irish. In terms of higher level Irish, that is 41 second level schools where not a single student can become a primary school teacher. That is either because not everybody is good at Irish or because the school has determined that it cannot justify the resources for somebody who may be good at Irish. This happened during the debate on assessed grading for the leaving certificate when members of this committee were strongly against the idea of school profiling. What if a student is one of the small number who have the ability and who want to power through and break through disadvantage and poverty? How will he or she do it when the entire context of what is happening at his or her school militates against it? We have a second level system based on competition. Schools compete against each other and have the whole reputation thing going on, so they have open days. I am supposed to direct questions to individuals but I like to direct questions to those who are interested in answering them rather than putting people on the spot. How do we assess those things? First, how do we produce a school experience that is reflective of young people and what they know and want to learn? Second, how do we produce a model that can assess that? Third, how have we come to a situation where schools are failing young people because of the competition model we have insisted upon? There are 41 schools in the Republic that cannot produce a primary teacher because not one single student either has access to or has been empowered enough to do higher level Irish.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Probably the strongest statement I heard today was from Mr. Hennessy in terms of giving the leaving certificate back to the students. Does Ms Ward want to comment?
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	Exactly.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	My time is up but I would be grateful if Mr. Hennessy could respond.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chairman.
