AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On International Women's Day the Government is to be commended for publishing the text of the proposed referendum to repeal the eighth amendment. Every day I think of the children I taught in an all-girls' school on Sheriff Street. They inspire me. Knowing that - I hope soon - with the votes of the people, they will have full bodily autonomy in the future is something that should be celebrated. As the famous song "Bread and Roses" goes, women and men will be "marching marching" to mark today's announcement by the Cabinet leading, I hope, to a referendum on 25 May. All sides of the House have a role to play in that regard. Next week the Taoiseach will visit the White House and it is appropriate that he do so. He has diplomatic responsibilities that need to be respected. I hope he will take the opportunity to speak about things which are important to Irish people. However, there will be another event held in New York next weekend. I am thankful that Mr. Colum Eastwood of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, is boycotting the White House event. Instead he will attend an event called "Irish Stand" to be held in New York to try to give voice to the real experiences of the Irish nation and the immigrant nature of Irish people who have been all over the world and who now stand shoulder to shoulder with other peoples in America who feel under threat, be they Mexican or Muslim Americans. It is important that any political representative who finds himself or herself in America next weekend use that opportunity to stand up against the racism, misogyny and homophobia emanating from the White House and not find himself or herself rubbing shoulders with those concerned at fundraisers. Instead he or she should stand in solidarity with the true meaning of what it is to be Irish - standing up for things which are universally important. What is happening in America is being reflected across the world, including in Britain with Brexit, Austria, Germany and Italy. It is not good enough for politicians to speak about equality at home and then to rub shoulders with members of the National Rifle Association, Republicans and Congressmen such as Mr. Pete King in New York who effectively is writing and supporting such xenophobic and racist policies. As we celebrate Irishness next week and what it means to be Irish, we should remember that the Irish were once at the bottom of the social ladder in America. We should, therefore, be very mindful of those who are now suffering discrimination and from rhetoric which is very hurtful and painful for them and who need the Irish to stand up for them. What they do not need is a bunch of Irish politicians in America fundraising and staying quiet when this rhetoric which is so hurtful is used.
AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, the ruling of the Chair is unbelievable. I drafted the amendment in three different ways on different Stages to try to secure representation by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the governing body of the technological universities and each time it has been rejected. It is unbelievable that when one tries, with the best of intentions, to work within the process by introducing an amendment that would ensure representation for the leading trade union body in the country, which is a reasonable aspiration, it is rejected regardless of the way in which it has been drafted. I ask the Minister to respond.
