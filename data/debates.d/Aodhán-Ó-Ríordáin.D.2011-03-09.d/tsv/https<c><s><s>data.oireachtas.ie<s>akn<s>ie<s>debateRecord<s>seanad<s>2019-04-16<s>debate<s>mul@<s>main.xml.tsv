AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I think we have collectively dismissed the idea of using a single-use plastic bag for our money. A biscuit tin is a far better idea than a plastic bag. I am keen to put that on the record in terms of climate action.I support Senator Gavan in what he said about CE supervisors.  If it has not already been seconded, I second the proposal that we do not take Committee and Remaining Stages of the Aircraft Noise (Dublin Airport) Regulation Bill 2018 today. It is not necessary to ram through the legislation this evening. It is not fair, not right and not good parliamentary procedure, as the legislation needs to be teased out over a prolonged period.  When we talk about politics in this House, football may not be regarded as very important, but it does touch the lives of many people. I have just come from a briefing I hosted with Niall Quinn and others from the football family. One of the statistics that jumped out at me was that 30% of players in the League of Ireland had no qualifications beyond the junior certificate. That brought home to me why football was perhaps not powerful politically because the people who played the game were not powerful politically. They do not have a high level of education, as shown by the statistic I have given, and do not have many friends in the Houses. Other sports are more powerful politically as seen, for example, in the guaranteed and ring-fenced €55 million a year for the horse and greyhound sector. I think it received €89 million last year. While we argue over Sport Ireland's withdrawal of €2.7 million, it is nothing when compared with the millions and billions funnelled through Departments and these Houses. Once the circus moves on from the controversy over the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, its board and its former chief executive officer who is in the spotlight, politically we need to mind this sport because it is not being minded by those who are entrusted with the task of minding it. It needs many more political friends. Those who play the game generally come from disadvantaged communities and are more vulnerable; they are people whom politics does not necessarily reach or touch or represent, as well as others. While today's news about the board is welcome, we need to take a new direction to have a fresh start for a sport that is so important to so many in this country.
