AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister and the Minister of State. We have all been very impressed with the Cork Life Centre, in particular. It has been in front of the committee and we have met the representatives on a number of occasions. I do not think there was one member of the committee who was not incredibly impressed by the service it provides. I met Mr. Don O' Leary yesterday and he was anxious that there would be some light at the end of tunnel in terms of what the centre is trying to do. The Minister, Deputy Foley' presentation speaks again of a review. Unfortunately, for people in the Cork Life Centre, that is not going to give them an awful lot of comfort. I am intrigued by the phrase "out-of-school provision" and not "alternative education". When dealing with the Department of Education, you always have to be very cognisant of the fact that it knows language very well. The Department knows language very well, so the choice of the phrase "out-of-school provision" is a deliberate one. It gives a connotation of something that is odd or unusual. It has negative connotations in terms of what the provision does, that is, it is out-of-school rather than being part of the educational provision by the State. Will the Minister speak specifically on the Cork Life Centre? What support will be provided to ensure those young people can continue? Can I ask specifically about this phrase "out-of-school provision" which the Department has chosen to use? Does the Minister agree that it does not really fit well with those who are working in alternative education? For those who attend services such as the Cork Life Centre, it is school and it is their educational experience. They are being provided with an alternative to what many people might consider the mainstream, but it is not "out-of-school". I have an issue with that phraseology.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I notice the Minister did not use the phrase "alternative education". I do not know if that was deliberate or not. Regarding the Cork Life Centre and the fears and concerns they have, is the Minister in a position to give them comfort as to their future?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I know the Department, the Minister and the Minister of State will join me and other members of the committee in thanking and congratulating school communities around the country. Those communities came out of the traumatic period of the pandemic and all the challenges that had to be overcome in that regard and are now embracing the new challenge of thousands of children without English as a first language falling into their care. Those children are suffering from all sorts of trauma as a result of what they have witnessed and where they have come from as they settle into a new environment. They have concerns about their family members at home. The teaching profession and those who work in schools, including SNAs, secretaries, caretakers and boards of management, have stepped up to welcome those thousands of students to their schools. We totally accept it was never going to be perfect. There were always going to be teething problems. However, there are a number of issues. It has come to my notice, for example, that in certain circumstances a child may be in a school for a number of weeks and with very short notice, the student and his or her family may be relocated to another part of the country. A number of families were going to schools in my constituency and with short notice were moved to Youghal. I understand these things have to happen and that in an emergency scenario not everything is going to be done perfectly. Will the Minister speak to how such situations are communicated and managed? How is a school informed of those sorts of situations? A particular young person in the neighbouring constituency of Fingal has special educational needs and is utilising the available resources in a school setting. The change of location for that young person is going to be even more challenging as they move from one setting to another. What communications are the different agencies having about the individual needs of children when they are being moved from one part of the country to another? What kind of communication takes place with the school and the education partners? Does special educational need come into that discussion? We previously thought that the child and the family may be moved elsewhere. Should we reconsider that? I hope my next point does not come across as unfair but I feel strongly about this issue, as the Minister will be aware. A Ukrainian child who is now trying to access a secondary school place will be disadvantaged by the fact that certain schools retain 25% of their intake for the children and grandchildren of past pupils. A Ukrainian is very unlikely to have a parent or grandparent who attended a secondary school in a locality in Ireland. Does that not again expose how unfair that provision is?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I hope that in the circumstances of the settling down period this person has had with the supports around them, it will be considered best not to move to a different part of the country because a break in the resource the child is getting is not ideal.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that.
