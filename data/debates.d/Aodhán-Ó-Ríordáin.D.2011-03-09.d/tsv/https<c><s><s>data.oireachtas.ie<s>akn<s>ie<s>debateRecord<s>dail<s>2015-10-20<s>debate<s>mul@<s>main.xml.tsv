AodhanORiordan	Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin)	2011-03-09	None	Quite a number of issues have been raised. In regard to Hungary, many of the comments from Hungary have upset people, including many Irish people, considering that, in the 1950s in particular, Ireland reached out the hand of friendship to Hungarian refugees. The official position is that it is not helpful in a European context to comment on a position adopted by any particular partner because each member state will have its own national challenges and concerns from its own perspective. We should understand that, just as we expect Irish views to be respected by others. However, all actions by the authorities in any member state should respect and reflect the high human rights standards we have in Europe. I hear the Deputy's comments in regard to Turkey. Turkey is a hugely important partner for all of us in the European Union, a point that has come into even sharper focus as we formulate our collective response to the current crisis. It plays a geographically and politically central role in its region, and as an EU neighbour and candidate country. It is currently host to well over 2 million refugees; therefore, it is hard to imagine solutions to the crisis which do not involve it substantially. The importance of the EU and Turkey working together was clearly recognised in a joint EU-Turkey action plan, which was welcomed at the European Council last Thursday. No one is under any illusion that it would be anything less than challenging to step up our co-operation, but it is important to engage with Turkey and to help bring about change in that country. Many of the issues the Deputy raised are relevant. We hope that rapid progress can be made over the coming period on the issues set out in the action plan. It is worth recalling that Turkey is an EU candidate country which has been in accession negotiations since December 2004. Fourteen out of 34 chapters have been opened for negotiation, of which one has been provisionally closed. We must also remember that enlargement is a conditional process. The October European Council endorsed the action plan and called for the accession negotiations to be re-energised. However, this will only be in accordance with a negotiating framework and the relevant Council conclusions. Our funding for refugee camps is handled mainly through the UNHCR World Food Programme. We have already decided to donate an additional €30 million to our core funding over the next three years. We are also actively considering additional contributions in the various new EU funds.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I am keen to make the point at the outset that it is to the credit of the House and the political system in the country that we do not have a political debate in Ireland based around resistance to refugees coming to Ireland. That is to the credit of the House and the political parties operating within it. As Deputies will know, throughout Europe there is major resistance and growing xenophobia. However, in Ireland the pressure and lobbying is for a humanitarian response, with people wanting us to be more generous. There is no political capital to be gained from the opposite point of view, and that is to our credit as a political collective. No general election or any election has ever been dominated by the issues of migration, emigration or refugees. I hope that continues in future. Deputy Ferris asked a direct question in respect of Shannon. This was referenced before by Deputy Wallace. Foreign military aircraft may be permitted to land in the State on condition that they are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives, do not engage in intelligence gathering and do not form part of any military exercise or operations. The US is granted blanket permission for overflights by unarmed military aircraft. Civil aircraft are prohibited from carrying weapons or munitions through Irish airspace and airports unless an exemption has been obtained in advance from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. I am aware of a recent press release regarding the landing at Shannon Airport of an armed aircraft similar to a type of aircraft which took part in an airstrike. This took place in September 2013. Contrary to notification the aircraft was found to be armed with a fixed weapon and did not, therefore, comply with the normal conditions that apply to foreign military aircraft overflying or landing in Ireland. As the then Tánaiste informed the Dáil on 15 October 2013, this case was raised at the highest possible level with the United States Embassy. The embassy official explained that this isolated incident had taken place as a result of an administrative error. Assurances were given that steps had been taken to prevent any recurrence. I neglected to answer Deputy Martin's direct question about economic and monetary union and banking union. We welcome the focus in the report on completing banking union, backstops, bridge financing and revisiting a common deposit reinsurance scheme. It was regrettable that the reference to a banking union did not feature in the conclusions. However, we will continue to push for this in further discussions.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	How much time do I have?
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I have attempted to address many of the questions raised over the course of the question-and-answer session. Deputy Boyd Barrett asked me whether I accept that the invasion and bombing of Iraq destabilised the whole region. On a personal basis, I do, and the question now is what we do from here on.  I do not think we have seen anything near the peak of this crisis. This is the largest movement of human beings across Europe since the Second World War. In terms of our voice, we raised it within the corridors of power in the EU and will work as a collective within it. I would not want the Deputy to be under any illusion that we do not do that. As a collective we are stronger and our voice within the EU will be heard.  I am conscious that our response stepped up to the mark and went beyond what was expected of Ireland in terms of our acceptance of 4,000 refugees. It focused the attention of other countries which were not doing as much as they should have been doing. I accept that part of the issue in that region is an historic reaction to what happened in the past and that is why we cannot make the same mistakes again.
AodhanORiordan	Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	This crisis will not be solved today, tomorrow, next week or next month. It will be with us for quite a long time. I thank Deputies for their comments and questions. I am pleased to have the opportunity to wrap up the debate on the outcome of the October European Council and touch on some of the issues on the agenda, including some that the Taoiseach did not have time to cover.  Many of the contributions focused on the migration crisis, or the refugee crisis, as it should be more appropriately termed. It is an issue of major concern to everybody in this House and in Ireland. I reiterate a point made by the Taoiseach, namely, that we want a comprehensive EU response based on solidarity which balances a compassionate approach with practical measures. I am pleased to say that Ireland is playing a full part in this response. In addition to our humanitarian assistance, development aid and the provision of naval vessels for search-and-rescue efforts in the Mediterranean, the Government agreed on 10 September to establish an Irish refugee protection programme and to accept up to 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers overall under the EU resettlement and relocation programme. This will not come at any cost to the ongoing issue of addressing the direct provision scandal in Ireland. Anybody living within those centres should not be under the impression that they will be at a disadvantage because of our humanitarian response to the refugee crisis. The report of the direct provision working group is being implemented. A new cross-departmental task force is being established and is working with NGOs, religious bodies, local authorities and the Red Cross to deal with the operational and logistical aspects of the support programme. A network of emergency reception and orientation centres is being established for the initial reception of asylum seekers arriving under the relocation programmes. The Government is also engaging with the public on their generous pledges of support and has tasked the Red Cross with drawing the offers together. A website has been launched to enable members of the public to formally register their pledges. I will move on to a different international issue which the Taoiseach did not have time to touch on. The European Council took note of the publication of the official Dutch report on the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight airline flight MH17 over Ukraine. While there was no detailed discussion at the European Council, Ireland underlined the conclusion to reiterate the EU's commitment to hold to account those responsible for this appalling tragedy. The situation in Ukraine remains one of concern, although there have been signs of some stabilisation recently. While this is to be welcomed, Ireland's position is that all parties must adhere to the terms of the agreement set out in Minsk if there is to be meaningful progress in addressing the conflict. Turning to climate change, the French President updated his colleagues on the conference that will start in Paris on 30 November, bringing together the international community to agree new and enhanced commitments to address climate change. The EU has already set out an ambitious position in advance of this conference, which is known as COP 21. Ireland strongly supports an ambitious, legally binding and global agreement with broad participation as the core outcome of the Paris COP. As part of the EU, Ireland is committed to playing its part in reaching that historic agreement. I note budget 2015 includes a contribution of €2 million to the green climate fund, which represents the first step in Ireland's longer-term financial engagement. This is in addition to our Irish Aid activities which involve working closely with developing partner countries on resilience to climate change and to which we contributed some €33 million last year. I thank Deputies for their questions and contributions and for the attention of the Acting Chairman.
