AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I will be brief. At the end of the political term, it is important to reflect on where we are and where we are going. As others have done, I wish everyone across the Chamber a rest over the summer months, most importantly the staff who have facilitated us every day we are here. Democracy is very important. Any of us watching television last night, whether it was the Brexit debate in Britain or what happened in Helsinki between Trump and Putin, will have realised that democracy is very fragile. In these Houses at least, we should always say to ourselves that, whatever arguments we may have, left and right, we have an opportunity here to do a great deal of good when we work together. We should never underestimate the importance of that. Democracy is not something we can take for granted and we should never be complacent about it. We should never assume we will always have it in Ireland and we must work every day to ensure people believe in it and in our democratic institutions. People should believe their Parliament, local authorities and politicians work for them. When we see what is happening across Europe, the United States and Britain, we should be proud of what we are achieving in this Oireachtas. Our country is wounded and we are coming out of a very difficult time. While we have made improvements and can, hopefully, look to the future, my brief experience here since 2011 suggests that politics works best when we work together. There have been great examples of that from every party and Independent in the Houses. I hope everyone enjoys their rest and I look forward to working with and, indeed, against certain people when we come back in September.

AodhanORiordan	Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister and her officials for engaging with me and the Labour Party in facilitating the passing of this legislation. I thank all Members for supporting it. I do not want to make value judgments or blame anyone but there may be a five year old in a school whose parents are not empowered to, or are going through circumstances where they cannot, attend to the child's educational needs. They may love their children deeply but circumstances can sometimes get in the way. With the passing of this Bill, however, the State and Tusla can encourage those parents and engage with the family to ensure the educational rights of a child under six are upheld. It is fundamentally important that every child gets the best start, and poor attendance patterns which start when a child is aged five can last a lifetime. We are not trying to impinge on families or hurt them but we have to uphold the education rights of children. Their attendance at school is important and we cannot wait until they are six to address these issues. I thank the Minister on a personal and political level. She understands, instinctively, the power of education and she has a vision of the five year old in her mind, as well as knowledge of what an education can do for them. That is what this Bill is trying to achieve. The State can now intervene in a compassionate and empowering fashion with the child and the parents to ensure the child can have his or her education rights upheld. I appreciate what the Minister and her officials have done and I accept that her amendments had to be made to achieve what we want. I look forward to it being passed into law by both Houses so that five year olds and younger children in our education system can be protected.
