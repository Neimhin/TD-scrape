        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">Last June, following the statement issued at the end of the European Council meeting, the Taoiseach and Government colleagues trumpeted the outcome as being a game changer for this country. We were led to believe that the decision to allow for the direct recapitalisation of Spanish banks without placing the burden on the shoulders of the Spanish people had positive benefits for the Irish people and that the agreement would be applied to Ireland retrospectively. It was only to be a matter of by how much our burden would be lifted, not if it would be lifted.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> Four months on, the Taoiseach is back in Brussels. He has been there a number of times since. He recently took almost all of his Cabinet colleagues to meet the Commission. Unfortunately, there has been no progress on a comprehensive deal on bank debt for Ireland. The lack of action in the intervening period by the Government has allowed the momentum to be lost. A dangerous vacuum has developed. Unfortunately, it has been filled by the finance Ministers of Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, who have put an entirely different interpretation on the outcome of the June summit than that which was presented by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> Tough talk at home and silence where it matters has left Ireland without a deal as we face into another exceedingly difficult budget. Resolute action is necessary. The Taoiseach needs to be heard in Brussels as well as in Belmullet and in Berlin as well as in Ballyhaunis.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_27">The Taoiseach is meeting the other Heads of Government from his political family, the European People's Party, EPP, and the Tánaiste is likewise meeting our political family in Europe, the Party of European Socialists, PES. At that meeting, President Hollande of France among other socialist leaders will be preparing politically for the Council meeting later today. My understanding is that they will be confirming that the decision they took on 29 June will be upheld, the details relating to that decision will be fully explored, the recognition contained in the communiqué of that decision in respect of Ireland will be vindicated and confirmed and all of the necessary detail surrounding the decision's implementation will continue to make progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> The three finance Ministers, in particular the German Minister, are facing into election periods. They made a statement on their interpretation of a particular agreement. The finance Ministers did not attend the June meeting and will not attend today's meeting. The Heads of Government will. In recent weeks, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Tánaiste have visited Berlin, Paris and the capital cities of the larger countries to press Ireland's case and get recognition of the necessity of applying the deal agreed in principle at the June Council to Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">I am glad that the Minister raised the <i>Time </i>magazine issue. Since June, the Taoiseach has spent more time on a lap of honour congratulating himself on having Ireland included in the text without making any real effort to work with the leaders of the other countries. He has not met a single leader in the intervening period.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">I would have preferred it had he toured the capitals of Europe in an attempt to flesh out the deal instead of running around the world's media organisations in the hope that they might have a spare front page at a dead time of the year so that he might present it as a major achievement for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> The Government was elected on a promise of burning bondholders and removing the burden of bank debt from the shoulders of the Irish people. It has singularly failed to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">The Minister knows about that as he made certain promises on third level fees and grants.</p>

          <p eId="para_66">Bhí clár ar TG4 aréir, clár a leirigh scannal mór sa chathair seo. I do not know if the Minister saw the documentary last night but it lifted the lid on what must surely be one of the worst ever planning scandals in this city or the country. The documentary, "Iniúchadh - Oidhreacht na Cásca", has exposed a record of skullduggery and secret dealings between the management of Dublin City Council and developers who want to demolish what is now the national monument on Moore Street and develop a monstrous shopping mall on O'Connell Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> Is the Minister aware that these backroom deals involved gross misuse of the compulsory purchase order process to the advantage of one developer, Chartered Land, which at the time was not even the registered owner of the lands in question? Will the Government call for full disclosure from Dublin City Council management about all these matters, including full texts of the secret agreements? Will the Minister and the Government call a halt to this scandalous episode?</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> The vandalism of the site which developers propose to pursue cannot go ahead without the permission of the Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan. He has had this matter on his desk for some months and he can refuse to give the go-ahead to Chartered Land to build on and encroach upon any part of the national monument, the historic last meeting place of the 1916 leaders on Moore Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> In addition to seeking full disclosure from Dublin City Council, will the Government this morning indicate that the envisaged development will cease and Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, the Minister in question, will refuse permission for it? Will the Government and this Dáil act to preserve, enhance and develop the national monument?</p>

          <p eId="para_70">This week my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, launched the reform proposals for local government. These are the most dramatic initiatives of their kind since the formation of local government in 1898. Some commentators have said that this is a usurpation or diminution of powers, with one commentator stating that the Minister had become the undertaker of local government. I refute that.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> I have not seen the television programme to which the Deputy referred and cannot comment on the detail but I suggest that the Deputy relay the matter to her colleagues on the city council. Sinn Féin councillors would no doubt share her concerns and I suspect other people on the council would do so also. The place to start an inquiry is with the elected members of Dublin City Council, who should hold the officials of Dublin City Council to account and get information on the issue. The idea that we should rush in on the basis of a television programme and step over the elected members of Dublin City Council is a denigration when I thought Sinn Féin supported local government.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">That is an evasion if ever there was one. I do not accept that the Government can simply stand idly by when matters of this scandalous nature come into the public domain. The Minister is well aware that issues pertaining to the national monument have been the subject of widespread debate, including in this Dáil. The Government has a responsibility not just to the city of Dublin but to the entire country to ensure that the mindless vandalism of a national monument and historic site should not be allowed to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> It is a matter of concern for the Government when the kind of shady dealings and very strange occurrences in the largest local authority in the State are laid bare not just in a documentary but in commentary. The city council has a responsibility in this but the Government is in charge and the matter is not localised; the preservation and development of Moore Street and the adjacent lanes beside the GPO is a matter of national concern. The Government has a responsibility to act. The matter is on the desk of Deputy Jimmy Deenihan. It is simple matter as he just has to give the word that the shopping mall development will not go ahead and the Government will undertake to acquire the site and develop it in an intelligent, thoughtful and appropriate way. It should give due regard to the women and men of 1916 and could prove to be a significant attraction and resource for Dublin.</p>

I was taken on detailed and personal tour by James Connolly-Heron, the great-grandson of James Connolly, the founder of the Labour Party, which took a number of hours. I am very well aware of the issues involved. I am also very well aware of the responsibilities the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, has in regard to this matter. The Deputy is trying to link two things together which are not necessarily linked. The allegation of wrongdoing is a serious allegation made in the programme. The first responsibility we, as democrats, have is at local authority level. It has direct responsibility for the city manager and for what he is or is not doing. The Minister will make his decision in due course and I can assure the Deputy she will be more than happy with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">Yesterday the Minister and his party colleagues launched their campaign for a "Yes" vote in the upcoming children's referendum. Like everyone else, I welcome this referendum and look forward to a day when the children of the State will be given the protection they deserve and when stories of abuse and neglect by families and the State will become a thing of the past. However, this week it seems that day is much further away than it was before.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> Like other Members, I read with disgust and dismay the findings in Judge Reilly's report on St. Patrick's Institution of children being stripped with knives, bullied by staff members and being forcibly moved to isolation cells using head and arm lock control. This is barbaric behaviour and it would remind us of the treatment of prisoners in Abu Ghraib in Iraq, about which we heard so much about over the years, but it is happening on our own doorstep.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> There are even questions for the Minister, Deputy Quinn. Basic record-keeping in regard to school attendance for young people in St. Patrick's is non-existent. This means those young people's lives will be restricted. They will not have had the chance improve themselves during their time in that institution and they will leave it at a distinct disadvantage. All this has being going on right under our noses.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> I am aware that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, instructed the director general of the Prison Service to address these issues within the timeframe set by the inspector but I am very concerned as to whether it is quick enough and at how these abuses are only coming to the fore now. If the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and his Labour Party colleagues truly believe children should be seen and heard, they will act on this immediately. That makes me wonder how it is that the Minister, Deputy Shatter, received this report three and a half months ago but it has only come to light this week. Why did the Ombudsman for Children's concerns in regard to St. Patrick's Institution fall on deaf ear for two years?</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> The Minister's party leader has stated that this must be addressed but what everyone wants to know and what I would like to hear is when and how. The 2014 timeline for ending the detention in that prison of those aged under 18 must be brought forward. Will the Government do this and will it act for children who want to be seen and heard but who are prevented from doing so in the cruelest possible way?</p>

          <p eId="para_89">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter which, I think, is a concern to everyone in this House and is a legacy none us can be proud of. The Minister, Deputy Shatter, informed the Cabinet on Tuesday of this matter and the report. We agreed instantly to his recommendation that it should be published immediately, which he did the following day. His statement is very extensive and it is available to Members of this House if they want to get the full chapter and verse in regard to an outrageous scandal and reflection on all elected persons in this House and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> Some things have been done. Sixteen year olds are no longer being detained in St. Patrick's. I am pretty sure, although it is subject to confirmation, that some categories of 17 year olds will be transferred to the Oberstown campus before mid-2014 when all young people under the age of 18 will be detained on that site. We are moving to get everyone under the age of 18 out of the Mountjoy complex where St. Patrick's is located.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> The other issue raised, the way in which the Ombudsman for Children was treated, reflects badly on aspects of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Prison Service. I can assure the Deputy that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Minister, Deputy Shatter, are working closely to address immediately the issues he highlighted.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">I thank the Minister. It is vital the timeframe for removing those aged under 18 years from St. Patrick's should be brought forward very quickly. Judge Reilly said he would revisit the prison in November to check on implementation of the findings in his report. I hope that when he does, he will be able to report that the implementation is taking place and is happening quickly. Will the Government correct the record at the United Nations Human Rights Commission where the former Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality said these complaints were basically the fanciful whims of children and could not be listened to? It is vital for the reputation of our country and the respect of human rights that the record is corrected.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">I can assure the Deputy that all necessary steps required to deal with this issue will be taken. This Fine Gael-Labour Party Government is the first one to establish a dedicated Department of Children and Youth Affairs under the management and control of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has probably introduced more reforms in the area of justice in less than two years than any of his predecessors. He has been extremely fearless in confronting interests which perhaps hid behind certain allegations or certain assertions. He will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure Ireland is fully compliant with its international obligations in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_97">We read in a newspaper today that an international firm has been hired by the Government to raise the ceiling on bankers' pay.

          <p eId="para_98">The programme for Government set out that the Government would conduct a fundamental review of remuneration at banks subject to State support. The exact wording of the programme for Government is: "All remuneration schemes at banks subject to state support will undergo a fundamental review to ensure an alignment of interest between banks, their staff and the taxpayer." This is another example of the Government implementing its programme for Government and its commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> The Minister for Finance has written to the Opposition spokespeople to inform them of the review, which has been ongoing within the Department. Mercer has now been appointed to bring the review to a conclusion. The review will cover pay levels across all covered banks and at all levels within the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> The headline in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> caught everyone's eye but if it had stated that the €500,000 cap on bankers' pay could fall, it would not exactly sell very many newspapers. Let us await the recommendations of the Mercer report.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. The Bill is a welcome development, although it is long overdue. Generic substitution and reference pricing have been talked about for a long time but no action was taken by previous Governments. This is something we in Sinn Féin have advocated over many years. In welcoming the Bill, I also welcome the agreement between the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association announced on Monday by the Minister for Health in so far as it goes.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">Exactly how far it goes we are not sure because we do not have the detail. The deal is projected to save in excess of €400 million over the next three years, beginning with €16 million to the end of this year and €116 million next year. I ask the Minister of State for a breakdown of how these figures have been arrived at. More detail on the agreement should be made available. The Minister predicted far greater savings this year. What has happened? Has the pharmaceutical industry successfully used its muscle yet again? Why is the projected return for the rest of this year as low as €16 million?</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> The Minister will not thank me for reminding him that this was one of the issues raised by his former Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, who expressed frustration at the lack of progress on the reduction of medicine costs. I hope Deputy Shortall speaks in this debate and sets out her experience and concerns at some length and with the freedom of one who is no longer in office in this coalition. What she says may shed some light on how the agreement was handled and progressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> The Bill is an important step on the road to reducing the costs of medicines. The HSE spent an estimated €1.9 billion in 2010, the last full year for which we have figures, on medicines and non-drug items supplied to patients under the GMS and community drug scheme. This included approximately €384 million paid to community pharmacy contractors in respect of dispensing fees and retail mark-ups. The expenditure more than tripled between the years 2000 and 2010, which is a worrying statistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> In his remarks on the pharmacy agreement yesterday, the new Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, Deputy Alex White, cited a current figure of more than €2 billion per year. It is a huge challenge to reduce that cost. I wish the new Minister of State well in that task and in his other responsibilities. For years, Sinn Féin and others have been calling for greater use of generic drugs and for control of profiteering by pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors. Successive Ministers with responsibility for health from 1997 failed to act. I welcome that some steps are being taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> A survey in <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>last August showed the HSE and patients here are paying up to 12 times more than the National Health Service for the same generic drugs. I did not need <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>to tell me because I live only four miles from the Border. Patients and taxpayers are quite simply being ripped off by the pharmaceutical industry. It has been facilitated by successive Governments' relationship with the industry. For the industry to claim, as it did, that the massive price differential is accounted for by specific packaging required by this State is beyond belief and an insult to people's intelligence. It is quite incredible and in no way explains the colossal North-South differential in the price of patent or generic drugs or between these islands and across member states of the EU. Anyone who took a holiday overseas in better times is able to attest to this if they needed to get prescription drugs in pharmacies in various European settings.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> I have repeatedly raised with the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, the need for action to require greater use of generic drugs and to address drug prices overall. The survey showed the situation was even worse than suspected and that it was long past time for the profiteering of the pharmaceutical industry to be confronted once and for all. I hope we are of one mind on that point. I would much rather say we are of one intent in terms of the urgency required.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> The Bill focuses on generic substitution and reference pricing. It is a necessary measure, if just one of a range of measures that need to be undertaken. It is a complex Bill and needs to be processed carefully to ensure there are no unintended consequences. The prime consideration at all times must be the health of the people, the rights of citizens as health service users and the provision of the best possible health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> One of the concerns raised about the Bill is the issue of continuity of supply. It has been raised with me, as an Opposition spokesperson on health, and I am sure other Members have been engaged on the matter. The pharmacy companies have a role, to which I will return, but the Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU, has raised a concern about section 24(2), which provides for the HSE to review the reference price at least once a year but not more than once every three months. The IPU is worried the HSE will err on the side of more frequent reviews - once every three months -and this could lead to problems regarding stock-holding for wholesalers and pharmacists, in turn affecting continuity of supply of medicines to patients. They have asked for the three month period to be replaced by six months. I would like to hear the Minister's view. It can be addressed on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> There are concerns also about the need for the HSE and the Irish Medicines Board to keep pharmacists fully informed and in due time about the addition, removal, retention or refusal of an item on the reimbursement list, about changes to the list of interchangeable medicinal products, or about changes to a reference price. I hope the Minister examines and responds constructively to the detail of the IPU submission with regard to these matters. I know the difficulties recent decisions have presented to pharmacists in a variety of settings throughout the country and in my constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> Important points have been raised with regard to ensuring the welfare of the patient is written into relevant sections of the Bill, as well as the taking into consideration of the impact of reference pricing on the continuity of supply of medicines. How far have the Department and the HSE explored the possibility that the reliance in the Bill on competition to reduce prices could have unintended consequences? I alluded to this point earlier. These points are important if the Bill is to be adjudged fit for purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Could it worsen the situation if the presence or absence of necessary medicines on the Irish market is unduly dictated by the profit motive of manufacturers or wholesalers? That is an important question.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> Some parts of the Bill are written in impenetrable legalese and require clarification. Could sections 5(12), 5(13) and 19(6) be translated? Section 13 refers to regulations to be made by the Minister. Could the Minister clarify the nature of the regulations referred to? I hope the Minister will address some of these matters in his summing up, but we will address them in detail on Committee Stage when we have a complete sense of what the Bill intends to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> Other measures to address the cost of medicines in our health care system need to be considered. Sinn Féin would go much further than the Bill and urge consideration of the establishment of a State wholesale distributor of drugs. The cost savings of such an undertaking regarding the Exchequer outlay on medicines and medical products could be very significant. After all, public health and not private profit must be the primary consideration in the supply of medicines.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> The expansion of the role of pharmacists to include medicine use review, to help ensure that patients get optimum benefit from medication and that waste is reduced, should also be considered. Significant waste is caused by over-prescription of medication, from blister pack to blister pack. Tackling this calls for a holistic response by everyone who has a role to play. Can that be accommodated in the Bill? The Minister for Health should initiate the carrying out of a comprehensive national audit of drug prescriptions, in hospitals and in the community. We know that over-prescription is a major problem. We do not have an overview of how prescribed medicines are taken. In many cases they are not taken and go to waste. GPs and consultants have a major responsibility in that regard, yet the Bill deals only with pharmacists. Can this matter be dealt with in the Bill or does it require further legislation? If it does, we must do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> In Monday's announcement of the agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, it was stated that a national task force on prescribing and dispensing has been established to deal with the prescribing and dispensing of medicines. I welcome that. We are told it will address this issue from the perspective of quality and patient safety primarily, but that it can be anticipated that the work of the task force will also deliver significant cost savings through more cost-conscious prescribing. We are told also that the work of the task force will be wide ranging and will include providing advice, guidance and support to prescribers and dispensers to help them improve prescribing practices, and assessing the suitability of maintaining supply of certain items with limited efficacy where more appropriate items are available. These are important commitments. I welcome them, but they must be kept and honoured in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> The former Minister for Health and Children, Ms Mary Harney, introduced the notorious prescription charges for medical card patients. It would be remiss of me not to mention this. We all agree, and I said it at the time, that the cost of medicines to the State and to individuals is too high and we acknowledge that there is wastage and over-prescription of medicines. We all agree that measures must be undertaken to address these problems. The very last way to address this, however, was to punish those who are least able to pay. I do not accept the notion that the charge is merely a token, and I did not accept it then. It can build up to a significant sum on a monthly basis. </p>
          <p eId="para_182"> In opposition, the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, as Fine Gael spokesperson on health, opposed the charges and promised to abolish them when the opportunity presented itself. The Government has been in office for 19 months and we are still waiting. I earnestly urge a revisitation of that measure. It is part of the legacy of Mary Harney and the former Government. The Fine Gael and Labour parties roundly and rightly opposed it when in opposition. Age Action said of the prescription charges:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_183">Over-prescribing and inappropriate prescribing is a problem in Ireland but the Minister needs to address this issue with the doctors who write the prescriptions, rather than hitting their patients. The patient is not the person writing the prescription so penalising them will do little to change prescribing practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The prescription charge has had no impact on prescribing practices. It is time for the charge to be abolished. The Age Action statement is still relevant. The problem of over-prescribing needs to be addressed, first and foremost on health grounds for the benefit of individual patients and, second, because it is important to address this issue as a contributor to the costs of medicine in our health care system.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> The pharmaceutical industry also needs to be reined in. Earlier this year, the giant multinational GlaxoSmithKline was found guilty of massive malpractice in the United States, incurring fines totalling $3 billion. This malpractice included marketing drugs for unauthorised uses and holding back safety data. There can be no mistake about the gravity of what was being done. The courts in the United States did not make this decision lightly. The $3 billion fine was meant to underscore the seriousness of what was involved. It was not only patients in the United States who were at risk from the withholding of safety data and the marketing of drugs for unauthorised use. It affects each of us as citizens and our families. There needs to be an immediate investigation into the granting by the previous Government of an absolute indemnity to GlaxoSmithKline, the manufacturers of the swine 'flu vaccine, Pandemrix, which caused the sleeping disorder, narcolepsy, in a number of Irish children. When the Joint Committee on Health and Children met on 8 September 2009 to address the swine 'flu issue, I and other members, including the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, then in opposition, expressed serious concern about the indemnity granted to GlaxoSmithKline.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">When I asked the Minister in September 2011, six months after he took office, if the nature of that indemnity was such that GlaxoSmithKline will be legally absolved from any accountability for the drug causing narcolepsy in Irish children, he did not reply. I have had no response to that question to date. I would welcome that matter being addressed by the new Minister of State. It is not a party political issue but something that is in the interest of all citizens. The safety of our citizens is at stake and GlaxoSmithKline, like many of these major conglomerates in the pharmaceutical sector, needs to know that it does not have a green light to do as it pleases in every situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> I welcome the Bill, although I wish it was part of a comprehensive and radical reform of our health services based on public good, not private profit. The Bill demonstrates the potential for real savings in preference to the savage cuts to services now being imposed by this Government. We addressed those cuts at some length over the past two evenings but, sadly, it appears they will proceed. The passage of the Bill, as far as it goes, should be facilitated. I will play my part in that and, if possible, help to improve it on Committee and Report Stages. The Minister's responses to my questions would help greatly in achieving a better understanding of all that is intended in order that we can play a fully informed role on the remaining Stages.</p>

          <p eId="para_190">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is an important Bill. It is also very technical and detailed. Is it necessary to go into so much detail for setting prices for the drugs that patients require? Obviously, the Department of Health believes it is necessary to be so technical, but it means one must concentrate hard when trying to wade through the Bill to find out exactly what is meant by each section.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> This debate is being held in the context of the deal that was concluded between the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, the Department of Health and the HSE earlier this week. It seems to have taken a long time to arrive at this agreement, which is supposed to result in savings of €400 million over the next three years. We hope those savings will be achieved. It will go some way towards easing the number of cutbacks that are causing suffering for patients in the health services. That remains to be seen. An interesting aspect of the deal is the automatic approval for new drugs coming on the market. That has huge cost implications. I worry that this time next year, as new drugs are automatically approved and come on line, the HSE will be lamenting the cost of those drugs. This year, for example, two new drugs will cost approximately €30 million. In the next year or two will we hear the HSE saying that the cost of new drugs is undermining its ability to save money under this process and see the process running into the sand, with further cutbacks being imposed on patients and hospitals, because the savings cannot be achieved?</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> It is important that new drugs are introduced and made available to patients. They could offer life-saving opportunities to patients or an improved quality of life for patients who have terminal illnesses. I am concerned this will become a football again, with further cuts being imposed. There must be some way to deal with it, whereby realistic pricing can be imposed on the pharmaceutical companies and the deal can be revisited to ensure new drugs do not have that potential impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> It is very interesting to see all the commentary about the deal and this legislation, with many of the articles discussing the savings the deal will generate over the years. One then also sees commentary about how important the pharmaceutical companies are to our economy by providing 25,000 jobs. The underlying implication is that we cannot be too hard with these companies because they support so many jobs in the economy and if we do push them too hard, they might up sticks and leave. I doubt the pharmaceutical companies make the decision to base their operations in Ireland based on the fact that they can get good prices for their drugs in a market of 4.5 million people. They are using their location here to access a market of 495 million people.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> That line about the importance of the pharmaceutical companies should not be taken or encouraged. I do not believe that if we drive a hard bargain with those companies and reduce the cost of medicines, they will all suddenly decide to leave with the loss of 25,000 jobs. The implication is that we depend on them so much that we must take it easy on them. In the years to come the HSE and the Department of Health should put that argument to one side and concentrate on what they should be doing, which is achieving the best possible value for the patients who depend on the medicines. That issue must be tackled. It is probably a sign of the culture that appears to have taken hold of this country. We tipped our hats to the bankers and gave them an easy deal for years. After that it was the developers and now it is the pharmaceutical companies. We must take a much stronger stance to achieve the best outcome for patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> The Bill focuses on reference pricing and generic substitution. The Minister said that reference prices will be set at levels which will facilitate rather than jeopardise supply. That again smacks of allowing the pharmaceutical companies to maximise their profit-taking from supplying drugs in this country. Reference prices should be set on a basis that they provide a reasonable profit for the company, make it feasible for us as a society to provide the drugs and make it affordable for patients who depend on them and, perhaps, do not have medical cards. I would be very concerned if we were allowing profit maximisation to take place in setting the reference prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> On generic substitution, the legislation provides that the general practitioner, GP, can specify on the prescription whether substitution should be allowed. It also provides with regard to the reference pricing that if the patient requests a drug that has a higher reference price, they will have to pay the difference. If a GP specifies a drug and a pharmacist offers a cheaper substitute and the patient opts to take it, are they still liable for the increase in the reference price? I cannot see where that is dealt with in the Bill. It might be there but, given the technical nature of the Bill, I did not see it. However, it would appear to be very unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> Generic substitution offers the possibility of reducing the cost of medicines. In a number of European countries it is part of their formal policy to ensure they can reduce costs. I note in the Minister's contribution and also in some of the commentary the question of the safety of generic drugs is raised. That is a red herring. It is possibly related to the fact that the people who develop the brand names like to convey the idea that the generic substitute might not necessarily be as good as their product. There were a couple of comments in the Minister's speech about the safety of generic medicines. That might serve to strengthen the perception that generic substitutes might not be as good. We need to make a cultural change among patients so that when they are offered a generic substitute they will accept that it is as good, has gone through the same testing and has all the same components as the branded drug. As politicians, we can lead that cultural change. The Minister and the Department can lead it as well. It is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">Why, then, the emphasis on safety in the contributions? It should be taken as read that systems for testing drugs and approving them are robust enough to ensure there are no safety issues. In the past manufacturers of patented drugs could get 98% of the price of the drug when it came off patent. Such deals were done in a way that showed the Department and the HSE were not strong enough when dealing with the companies and gave them favourable contracts and pricing regimes. We must take a harder line if we are to achieve the real savings and ensure the overall cost to the Exchequer and society is achieved through the workings of this Bill. That will come through after the Bill has passed and we will see it happen over time.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">I too welcome the opportunity to speak today on this Bill. Previous speakers have referred to many of the issues that are involved. This is a huge area and a serious issue that addresses the supply chain of vital medicines being prescribed by GPs for the health and welfare of the people. We should not lose sight of that during the debate; we are talking about the health and well-being of our families and communities. We sometimes talk about health care and think about large conglomerates and big business but when it comes into our own kitchens or bedrooms, it is a sensitive and important area. The Bill is technical in nature but the drafters and the HSE advisors must know best here. Perhaps we can tease it out a little on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> South Tipperary is almost the home of the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland, there is a huge pharmaceutical presence there, with companies like Merck Sharp and Dohme, Clonmel Healthcare, GlaxoSmithKline in Dungarvan over the border, Boston Scientific, Abbott Vascular and many more. They play a huge role in the community in south Tipperary, providing well paid employment and investment in the community. All these companies run various schemes to support community initiatives in Cashel and Clonmel and that is appreciated and recognised. I have been through these plants and the technology in them is fascinating. The investment that has been put into these workplaces is amazing and the process, from the raw materials right through to the production of the capsule we take, is amazing. We welcome these companies and want them to stay.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> We must, however, also respond to pricing for customers. We cannot have a knee-jerk reaction but we must rein in costs and spending at this point particularly in view of the debate we have had in the last two nights on the Sinn Féin Private Members' motion and the general debate on home helps and cutbacks. We must strike the balance in every Bill. To quote some of the figures, in 2011, the HSE spent €1.9 billion on medicines and non-drug items for patients in the community. This includes mark-ups and dispensing fees paid to farmers and wholesalers. In addition, hospital expenditure was approximately €300 million. That is staggering by any measure. HSE expenditure on medicine and non-drug items is huge. We must recognise that and we all came under huge pressure when the former Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, was trying to rein in these costs. There are powerful lobby groups in the pharmaceutical sector. Anyone with that level of investment and employment can call the shots because they are needed in the country. It is a gateway to Europe but nevertheless they have massive investments and they must be balanced against our approach to driving down pricing.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> This is a timely Bill and it sends out the message to these people that they must change their policy on generic drugs. Almost €2 billion was spent in 2010 on the GMS for drugs, a huge amount. It increased by 140% in the decade from 2000 to 2010, when everything went crazy in this country. We never thought we would see a poor day again during the boom but everything slid past and prices escalated. Now we are left to try to deal with these legacy issues. We cannot afford to continue paying that sort of money. We must also ensure continuity of supply and it is vital we have the latest medicines that have been tested and approved and that will improve people's health and well-being. That can never be forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> The Bill has had a long gestation period with a lot of debate on the areas of generic substitutes and reference drugs. It is now time to act in a manner that avoids knee-jerk reactions so continuity of supply is maintained and above all the health and well-being of patients and all other citizens is protected and enhanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> The IPU is worried about the review period of three months that the Department has set in the Bill. There must be review periods but the union is worried that we have all been lobbied and that this is too narrow a window that might affect continuity of supply. Perhaps some aspects could be reviewed every three months and the rest could be pushed out to six months. We need the review and we cannot have another decade like the one between 2000 and 2010, when everything just slid by.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> The pharmacists should be thanked for the work they have done over the years. At this point they are working to overcome the delays in issuing medical cards. I know of countless cases where medical cards have not arrived but the pharmacists with their local knowledge knew the people and dispensed the drugs without payment. I compliment them for that and for being ready and willing at weekends and during the night to be available to supply drugs. We must protect those local, family-run pharmacists and chemists at all costs. I have nothing against bigger chains like Boots but I do not want to see smaller, family-run business being forced to shut; they are all good employers and practitioners, who have invested huge amounts in their education and the establishment of a practice. They must be protected while we deal with charges and costs because these are valuable employers in the towns where they operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> I differ from Deputy Ó Caoláin on the prescription charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">We have to look at it in a holistic manner and cannot bash the large companies with which we have to deal. Those of us who have canvassed houses, and we all have to do it in order to become Members, will have seen a large amount of medicines on the dresser in some of them, to the extent that one could almost be in a chemist shop. That is dangerous because much of it may be out of date and the elderly and people who are not well may make mistakes in terms of an overdose. The 50 cent charge is a pittance. Nothing should be totally free. I mean that. I do not want to be hard on people but having discussed the matter with the then Minister, Mary Harney, I thought the charge would be more. We are trying to educate people to the fact that there is a cost for drugs, tablets and prescriptions. There is no better way to educate people than to tell them there is a cost. That is the way is has to be done. </p>
          <p eId="para_208"> I appreciate the time made available to me. I wish the Minister of State well and hope the Bill gets a speedy passage and is dealt with sensitively to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the people. We must also safeguard the local family run pharmacists and businesses as too many of these businesses are being lost across society. All big is not wonderful. We must protect them as they are employers, ratepayers, taxpayers and provide a valuable service to the community.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T11:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_209">I thank the Technical Group and Deputy Finian McGrath for sharing time with me. The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012 is very important as the whole sector needed to be examined. There are huge difficulties in this area because the cost of drugs had risen enormously in recent years. One has only to look at the motor industry and some of the more expensive brand names of cars. When other car manufacturers upped the game they were able to provide cars that may not have had the same elaborate flagship brand as other manufacturers but the quality of the product supplied was just as good. The drugs industry is the same. One can find similar examples in the farming sector with the purchase of sprays where, in the past, one could have bought a gallon of spray costing €120 per gallon. However, due to competition one can now buy a gallon of spray that would do the same job for €30 or €40. There is no reason to believe the same is not happening with the purchase of drugs. Drugs were being priced beyond reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> The introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing has the potential to deliver significant savings to the State. When the Government is trying to save money for the State it must be supported and complimented. I apologise to the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, whom I meant to acknowledge at the beginning of my contribution. I congratulated him in the past but I do so again and wish him well in a very demanding role. I am pleased he is present for the debate. </p>
          <p eId="para_211"> We must ensure a safe and fair delivery of medicine to the people who require it. We must ensure, as Deputy Finian McGrath stated, that this is not seen as an attack by the Government on the pharmaceutical industry or on those who sell the drugs over the counter, the local pharmacies and chemist shops, who have an excellent record of working well in the communities with the local general practitioner. In the majority of cases, especially in the smaller towns, the person behind the counter of the chemist shop knows the name of the patient when he or she walks through the door; he also knew their parents and children and knows the general practitioner. That knowledge and relationship is important when it comes to the safe delivery of drugs to patients who require them. We must ensure this is not seen as an attack on anybody, including the pharmaceutical companies. I recently visited an excellent pharmaceutical premises, in Killorglin, County Kerry which in recent years has invested huge sums in its factory. The company provides much needed jobs and drugs which are being shipped worldwide. I know it is not the Government's intention to endanger those jobs or to come done on the pharmaceutical industry but in life one has to modernise and economise and look at things in a different way when it comes to saving money. In this regard the drugs industry must be tackled in the same way as any other industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> I compliment all those taking care of patients who need drugs, be it the local general practitioners who look after the elderly, or family resource centres, which are a new development, which take care of the elderly and young people in the communities. We have an ageing population which brings health difficulties which may not have been as prevalent in the past. It also bring financial difficulties. One has to look at the bigger picture and hope they can be taken care of and the necessary drugs provided to maintain them for a long, healthy and happy life.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> In regard to reference pricing, section 24 of the Bill provides for the setting of a price for a group of interchangeable medicinal products in regard to the listed items which fall within the group. It also provides for the regular review of the reference price for a group of interchangeable medicines by the HSE, and it outlines the criteria to be taken into account by the HSE when it is setting or reviewing a reference price. This is a very important point because one would always be concerned about a major purchaser of drugs, such as the HSE, where huge amounts of money change hands. It would be important to know if in the past it got value for money or if there were big savings to be made owing to a lack of clarity on pricing structures with the result that the HSE paid too much for the drugs supplied every day. As the HSE is a huge procurer of drugs in all the hospitals and all the institutions that provide care it is important that the utmost prudence and pricing management is strictly adhered to. As there is an onus of responsibility on those who purchase drugs for the HSE, the legislation will be of major assistance in enabling them get a better deal for the Government and the taxpayer, which is very important. I hope those people who work for the HSE in the buying departments and who deal with large sums of money every day will see the legislation as enabling them to be tougher and stricter about the amounts they pay for certain products.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> I wish the Minister well in the future. While people may have different issues with certain parts of the legislation before us, overall it is prudent and timely for us to review the pricing and supply of medical goods. If it results in solid savings for the State, that is to be welcomed.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012. There was a time when senior company executives travelled exclusively in first class, but no longer. Shareholders are seeking better use of their company funds. Airlines are reducing the space allocated to the first-class brigade, as these sections of the aeroplane are not filling as they once did. These airlines are responding to the market conditions to reduce the space allocated to a product that has low demand and occupancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> What is notable is that the airline customers are not choosing to avoid travelling, but rather the way they travel in choosing economy class rather than first or business class. The result for customers is still the same - they still arrive at their destination. There was also a time when executives of public service companies used to travel by business class. Thanks to this Government, these are now a thing of the past. Indeed there was a time when Government officials used to also avail of excessive travel perks, both by air and by land. The stakeholders of this country, the people, deserve and demand better. We are all aware of the dubious and excessive use the Government jet was subjected to. Again, and fortunately thanks to this Government, this is now a thing of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> I think it is clear that there has been a seismic shift in attitudes and actions since this Government's inception. This shift is based on two simple principles. The first is that we could not condone and continue the outrageous excess of the previous Administration, which was unethical and simply unsustainable. The second point is that the Government has inherited an economic and spending mess. This needs to be addressed and that is why we were elected. This Bill is a part of that process because it addresses overspending in the health sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> The Bill proposes to allow pharmacists to substitute cheaper medicines for the ones prescribed, if patients agree. It also sets out statutory procedures for HSE supply and reimbursement of medicines and other goods. The overall aim of the Bill is to reduce the cost of pharmaceuticals to the State by promoting competition and achieving greater value for money. No patient will suffer or receive inferior medication. However, using cheaper medication will produce savings for the Government at a time when they are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> The Bill aims to increase the use of generic medicines, which are generally cheaper alternatives to brand name or originator medicines. There is broad agreement that generic substitution and reference pricing have the potential to reduce the State's pharmaceutical bill through encouraging greater use of cheaper generic drugs and price competition among manufacturers.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> Further savings were achieved this week when the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, announced that intensive negotiations involving the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, the HSE and the Department of Health had reached a successful conclusion with a major new deal on the cost of drugs in the State. The deal is an important step in reducing the cost base of the health system and is further evidence that the Government is firmly committed to addressing State overruns. The new deal, with a value in excess of €400 million over the next three years, will mean significant reductions for patients in the cost of drugs, a lowering of the drugs bill to the State, greater access to new cutting-edge drugs for certain conditions and an easing of financial pressure on the health services into the future. These results represent a win-win for the State and the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> The deal is beneficial in two broad ways. Approximately half the financial value is related to reductions in the cost of patent and off-patent drugs, and the other half is related to the State securing the provision of new and innovative drugs for the duration of the agreement in an exceptionally difficult economic climate. The new deal, combined with the IPHA agreement reached earlier this year, means that €16 million in drug savings will be made this year with much greater savings to be achieved in the following three years. It is estimated the deal will generate gross savings of up to €116 million in 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> This is the type of forward thinking and decisive action that is needed to haul the State out of its budgetary mess. I applaud the Minister for these enormous savings and in conjunction with the Bill being presented to the House it is a clear sign of the determination of the Government to redress the State's finances. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation. It could hardly be more crucial and discussion on it could not be more timely as we approach a budget with a health bill that takes up 27% of all Government expenditure, costing a massive €13 billion, with medicines now comprising almost €2 billion. It must be a major element of any cost-containment exercise. It is vital that we contain costs because we need to maintain access to vital medicines.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> I very much welcome the conclusion this week of an agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association. While it took considerable effort the savings for next year are projected to be €116 million. I seek more information on the deal. Is it a once-off three-year arrangement? Will our medicines continue to be priced by reference to a basket of European medicines as we did in the past or is a new formula being found? I take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State and wish him well in his difficult job.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">I am sure he is already finding out how arcane the system and procedure for setting the prices of medicines is, given that it is influenced by so many factors and interests. These include factors as diverse as wholesaler stocks at any time of the year and significantly - something mentioned by others - the presence in Ireland of so many drug manufacturers' research and development, and manufacturing facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> There has been a perception that there is a tension between the State's role in incentivising inward investment and high-end employment in pharmaceuticals, and the State's role as a purchaser of medicines from those companies. However, given the proportion of the market that Ireland represents, I believe that is a bit of a red herring. I cannot see how the price we pay would influence their decision to invest in Ireland. They invest in Ireland for a variety of reasons but I do not believe any of them relate to the size of the market here.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> Whatever the reason, the general perception of the international price-referencing system is that we seem to do very badly out of it. There is anecdotal evidence and I listened to a report on the radio yesterday. Regardless of where one goes in Europe, it always seems we are charged more than those abroad. We need considerably more transparency in how prices are decided. I heard the spokesperson for the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association state that some are dearer and some are cheaper, but that does not reflect our experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> In the past ten years the drugs bill has quadrupled from €570 million to €2 billion now and average prices have doubled. The most interesting and inexplicable figure is the growth in the volume of prescriptions which seems to have more than doubled in the past ten years from 20 million items per annum to 44 million items per annum. Some of it relates to population, which increased but it did not double. While the population is getting older, it is not that much older and we have a relatively young population. I would like to see some analysis of this apparently inexorable trend. It cannot be that we are sicker than we used to be. It is possible that we think we are sicker or that we think there is a pill for everything. Coming from either patients or the drug companies' sales representatives there seems to be pressure on doctors to prescribe. Whatever the reason is, we need to identify the underlying factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">Last year, the Government introduced a 50 cent charge on each GMS prescription item dispensed, up to a maximum of €10 in any one year. What has been the impact of that charge? Has it resulted in a reduction in the number of medicines dispensed? Is there a need to look at this again? People who obtain medicine free will not be conscious of cost containment whereas people who are paying for medicine will not buy anything that is not essential. I do not believe the €10 maximum in any one year will be a constraint. Perhaps we need to look at how this charge is applied. One could buy 20 medicines over a year for €10, which is not that much. People with minor illnesses would buy at least 20 medicinal items a year. Perhaps we should provide that the charge comes into play after the first 20 items purchased. Issues such as what is motivating the increase in prescriptions need to be examined and could be addressed by the task force which is being established under this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> I read in a newspaper during the week that the Medical Council has clarified the ethics code for doctors' interaction with drug companies around the acceptance of trips abroad to medical conferences and so on. One of the issues on which clarification was provided was the acceptability of doctors charging a fee to drug sales representatives for a visit to their surgery, which knocked me back a little. I mention this only because it highlights the complexity of the relationships and the potential for undue influence that exists between all of the players, be it drug manufacturers, distributors, doctors, wholesalers, hospitals, the Irish Medicines Board and the pharmacists. I include the Irish Medicines Board because it is the gate keeper for medicines. It is the body which decides what is made available to us and how we get it.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> A point often heard anecdotally is that one has to visit one's doctor here in order to get a prescription for many of the medicines available over the counter in other countries, although in pharmacies rather than supermarkets. This turns the doctor into the gate keeper, which must push up the cost of medicines in Ireland relative to other countries. While obviously people who have medical cards do not have to pay the doctor, this costs the State more. I understand that the main task of the Irish Medicines Board is to ensure safety of medicines. However, some type of balance must be struck. In this regard, there must be reference to what is happening in other countries. Also, pharmacists attend school and college for as long as doctors. We must have more faith in our pharmacists and give them the same responsibilities as given to pharmacists in other countries. If pharmacists do not know as much about medicine as doctors, what do they know? This issue also needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> The complex supply chain relationship needs to be analysed in terms of negotiation, monitoring and determination of the cost of medicines. It is a total minefield, one which is constantly changing. It is a little like politics in that one never knows where the mines will be. The Minister of the day will need to be ever vigilant of the factors influencing prices, practices and procedures. We have in recent times seen many changes in the mark-ups available to wholesalers and retailer-pharmacists, which are to be welcomed. Last week, agreement was reached with the Irish Pharmaceutical Health Care Association on new on-patent drugs. Today, we are debating the introduction of generic substitution and reference pricing. This step is a major departure in this country, which I welcome. One or other, or both, are in use in other developed countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> Provided we put in safeguards this new arrangement has enormous potential to save the consumer and the State a lot of money. This arrangement will, however, need to be carefully monitored. My concern around price referencing is that a floor price will be introduced. One needs to be careful when attempting to control prices. Every manufacturer will want to be producing the drug of choice. While manufacturers should be competing, they will only compete to the floor price. As such, the Minister of the day will have to be vigilant to ensure that floor does not act as a barrier to prices falling. The danger of this happening will be there at all times. </p>
          <p eId="para_236"> Putting the reimbursement list on a statutory basis is new. I want to comment specifically on new medicines getting on the list, which is a major challenge. While we all want access to the latest medicine a balance must be struck, by reference to clear criteria, between efficiency and cost. Choices have to be made in any country, in good and in bad times. This is what must happen all the time as new medicines become available. The decision in terms of medicines is a life and death one, one which I would not like to have to make. It is an important decision which must be made by the Irish Medicines Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> While there is in place a mechanism of appeal by the professionals, from the manufacturer to the dispenser, in respect of all decisions made by the Irish Medicines Board or Health Service Executive, there is no mechanism in place for the patient. I do not believe that access to medicines should be decided by virtue of access to the media. There is a need to put in place a system that works quickly for patients. Patients who, in terms of their condition, believe a particular medicine is for them at least deserve to have their concerns dealt with in a prompt manner and through an established mechanism rather than the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> Also on the reimbursement price list, currently a price is put on every product on the list that will be reimbursed by the HSE. This could also be a minefield. There is nothing in the legislation to suggest that the reimbursement must or will be the same as that charged by the pharmacist. As such, it could be the case that this legislation will not only permit but facilitate an entirely new system whereby patients could end up paying the difference between the real price and the reimbursement price. This is inherent in the new reference price system for interchangeable medicines, in respect of which the patient at least has a choice in terms of use. I am flagging that this legislation could be used - I am not suggesting it will be used now - in the future to usher in a regime whereby only partial payment is made by the State for medicines. It may be that that is what will have to be done. However, I would like to think this will not happen by stealth and that it is something that would be openly flagged. Everybody, be it a medical card patient or a person dependant on the drug refund scheme, needs some element of certainty around the cost of medicines and health generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> I would welcome if the Minister of State, Deputy White, could respond to some of my questions and concerns. I welcome this legislation, which has huge potential to save money for all of us and to ensure that people continue to have access to vital medicines.</p>

          <p eId="para_240">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, although I understand the Second Stage debate will be adjourned at 12.30 p.m. and will be resumed in a couple of weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> Before I get into the details of the Bill, I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, on his appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">I look forward to seeing him in the Chamber on numerous occasions when I speak about health issues. Fianna Fáil welcomes the Bill, which has been a long time in gestation. The main purpose of the Bill is to promote competition between suppliers of interchangeable medicines to ensure value for money in the supply of medicines and other prescribed health items. We spend almost €2 billion in this area each year, which is a phenomenal amount. Savings can and must be made and it is very important that this is done.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> The Bill will enable patients to opt for lower cost generic medicines on a list prescribed by the Irish Medicines Board. This sounds as though an onus will be placed on the individual but it will not work this way. The Bill provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. This is a new concept and is an important part of controlling the overall medicines bill. Reference pricing involves setting a common amount for selected groups of medicines on a list approved by the Irish Medicines Board and operated by the HSE. The Irish taxpayer will only pay the reference price for a particular medicine. This is the only amount that will be reimbursed by the State to the pharmacist and the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> If eligible patients want a branded product they are entitled to it, but they will pay over and above the reference price. In the legislation the Government is stating it will pay a certain amount for equivalent medicines but if the patient wishes to choose a branded product which costs more he or she is free to do so but must pay the excess. It is a matter of consumer choice. Some people will always be happier to pay for a brand. I do not want to trivialise it by comparing it to the fashion industry, but some people like to have a particular brand when they pay for a product. Other people are happy to know the substance of the product is the same and they are unconcerned about the brand name. It is important we get away from this because it has cost the Irish taxpayer a great deal of money. People are free to choose the branded medicine if they choose to do so. I would be happy to take the product provided for by the Irish Medicines Board and the HSE. If other people wish to pay extra that is their affair and more power to them if they want to do so. If they want to add to the profits of the pharmaceutical industry they are welcome to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> Unfortunately the Bill is overdue. We should have had it a long time ago. We welcome that it will make savings, but the Minister's failure to introduce it earlier this year has cost the taxpayer more than €100 million in savings which should have been achieved from 1 January this year rather than having this legislation at the tail end of the year. The spending of this €120 million will result in the HSE having to make major cuts to bring it closer to its budget because it has not achieved savings in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> The Bill has already gone through the Seanad. I understand this Second Stage debate will be adjourned and will not resume next week. The Dáil will not set the following week so we will not resume Second Stage until well into November. I hope the legislation will be enacted before the Christmas recess but this will be 11 months too late and will have cost an extra €120 million in profits the taxpayer has had paid to somebody in the industry. This at a cost of cutting home help and front line services.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> It would be remiss of me if I did not mention some of the possible front line cuts proposed in my area. In Abbeyleix a proposal to close a hospital is still awaiting decision by the Minister. A decision is also awaited with regard to St. Brigid's hospital in Shane. These issues are up for consideration to ensure the HSE lives within its budget. The financial assumptions underlying the potential decision to close these units are fundamentally flawed. They are being considered because the Minister did not bring forward this legislation to save this money. Had he saved €120 million on this over the full calendar year we would not have to consider downgrading the respite services available in Mountrath or the adult service available in Abbeyleix. In particular I make a plea on behalf of those with disabilities and special needs that the funding of the HSE, and those contracted to do its work such as the Muiriosa foundation in my area, is maintained in the Estimates for the coming years so some of these proposed cuts will not have to be made. The way to do this is by reducing the medicines bill. Had this been done sooner I would not have to raise these topics on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> I will recount an anecdote to demonstrate what I consider to be the outrageous prices charged by the pharmaceutical and health care association. Approximately 30 years ago I wore contact lenses for a year or two. It was okay but something happened and it did not work out in the long term. I remember I had to buy solution to clean the lenses. The solution was made by Allergan, which is based in Westport, County Mayo. It used to cost £14 for a bottle which lasted approximately a month. During that time I went on holiday to Rio de Janeiro in Brazil where I saw in a pharmacy the exact same bottle, made by Allergan in Westport, being sold for the equivalent of £7, which was half the price. The Irish taxpayer was being ripped off no matter how one looks at it. The product was made in Mayo and sold in Castlebar for £14 while the same bottle made in the same factory was on sale in Brazil on the same day for £7. This shows the rip-off with regard to pharmaceutical and health care products being sold in Ireland. I do not know how they got it to Brazil and could sell it at a profit at half the price it was being sold in the pharmacy next door to the factory where it was made. It defies all logic and is one of the reasons we are having this debate. Perhaps this legislation should have been introduced 30 years ago. It is long overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> Perhaps over-prescribing takes place. We all know that in most houses in Ireland one will open a cabinet full of medicine. Every doctor, nurse or home care worker will tell one they have gone into many houses where a person has died and the first thing they had to do was fill up a few black bags with all of the unused medicines. This is a huge waste of taxpayer's money. These products have been paid for but not consumed. A pharmacist is not allowed re-use them because it cannot be guaranteed that they have not been interfered with and on health and safety grounds they must all be incinerated. This is too convenient, simple and lazy an approach for the HSE to take and I ask it to reconsider. The same used to be true about appliances. There was a time when hospitals did not take back crutches because they could not guarantee they were not damaged. Now a facility is available to examine crutches and if they are in good condition they can be reused. The HSE changed its position on some small appliances when it was forced to do so on economic grounds. While health and safety is the overriding feature it should be able to do the same with regard to medicines. The HSE needs to examine this important factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> It would be strange if we did not refer to the new deal with the pharmaceutical industry which the Minister announced during the week. This is also an effort to reduce some costs. The Minister will have to explain how reference pricing will integrate with the pricing agreements in the deal announced this week. The announcement did not include details and I am sure we will hear them in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> The Bill is necessary. We will propose amendments on Committee Stage as we did in the Seanad. We will need to see a definition of reference pricing of drugs because if it is set too high at the outset it will be an excessive cost to the Irish taxpayer. We must look at the situation in other European countries and countries outside Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">Europe is one of the highest cost centres in the world. Going back to my example where the health care and pharmaceutical industry can make products in the EU and sell them cheaply in South America, maybe we should be looking at the world prices at which these products are being sold.</p>

        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_156">
          <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_255">Before getting into the detail of this discussion, I want to acknowledge the difficult and distressing situations faced by people throughout the country who, through no fault of their own, are living with the legacy of building failures, including dwellings affected by pyrite. In the case of pyrite, many home owners have been disowned by all of the main stakeholders, including materials suppliers, builders, developers, banks and insurance companies. I have seen at first hand homes affected by pyrite and the anguish and upset it has caused people. Indeed, in that instance, such was the stigma attaching to the issue that owners did not wish it to be known that their home was affected by pyrite. I am sure all of us here empathise with those home owners, but empathy and sympathy are not sufficient as a policy response. Action is required and it was against this background that I set up the independent pyrite panel in September 2011 to assist in finding a resolution to the pyrite problem for home owners. It may be convenient for some people to try to shift the blame for all the failures, including pyrite, onto the State and on a supposedly light touch regulatory system, but that would totally ignore the role and responsibilities of the main stakeholders involved in the delivery of so-called fit for purpose building projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> A strong statutory framework for the regulation of construction activity exists under the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007. The building regulations set out the legal requirements for the design and construction of buildings, including houses and extensions. Detailed technical guidance documents outline how these standards can be achieved in practice, and the responsibility for compliance rests primarily with developers and builders who engage professionals as required to ensure statutory requirements are met. From a regulatory perspective, there is much that can be done to improve compliance with, and oversight of, building regulations, and in July 2011, I announced a number of measures to enhance the building control system. Following a recent public consultation process, I am currently finalising the new building control regulations, which will be signed into law. These new regulations will provide for the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the building regulations have been met in respect of the building concerned. In addition, registered professionals will be required to inspect works during construction and also to certify that completed buildings are in compliance with the requirements of the building regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> Some people have made the point that while the regulations may have been comparable with the other jurisdictions, the lack of enforcement by building control authorities was a major contributory factor to the pyrite problem. However, the panel concluded that, on balance, it would not have been reasonable to expect that the unprecedented issue of pyrite in hardcore could have been identified by building control officers during normal inspections. Another issue which has given rise to some debate is the level of knowledge of pyrite in Ireland prior to 2007, and this is dealt with in the report. Having considered this issue, the panel concluded that there was limited knowledge of pyrite prior to 2007 and, in fact, cracking resulting from pyritic heave was initially misdiagnosed. The general view among engineering professionals is that there was very little knowledge of pyrite prior to 2007 and there was only passing reference to it in third level engineering courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> A pyrite problem occurred in Canada in the late 1990s and is often quoted as being a reason there should have been an awareness of the pyrite problem in Ireland. However, the Canadian problem only came to light consequent to the manifestation of pyrite problems here. I have stated on many occasions in the past that I did not believe the State was responsible for the pyrite problem, and this position has been vindicated in the pyrite report where those stakeholders identified as having responsibility include quarries, material suppliers, builders, developers, vendors and relevant insurance companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> However, while the State is not responsible for the pyrite problem or liable for the costs of remediating pyrite affected dwellings, I believe it has a role and a duty to assist home owners find a solution to the pyrite problem, and this was one of the key objectives in setting up the independent pyrite panel. Indeed, the pyrite report points to the important role for the State in ensuring that responsible parties engage constructively in processes to deliver solutions for affected home owners. I am conscious of the considerable period of time that many home owners have spent trying to get a resolution to pyrite problems without success. It is now imperative that this waiting is brought to an end and that a move is made quickly to provide solutions for home owners. This is my focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> A sizeable number of dwellings have been and continue to be remediated under various processes, including by some responsible builders who are undertaking remediation works themselves under structural defects insurance and other types of insurance. I welcome this progress and believe it is the route that should be embraced by many other responsible stakeholders. However, it is not a sustainable viewpoint that the taxpayer should be made liable for the costs associated with the remediation of pyrite-damaged dwellings. The costs should fall to those responsible and I welcome the panel's clear view on this matter. The panel was unambiguous in its view that the parties with direct or indirect responsibility for the pyrite problem should face up to those responsibilities and provide solutions for home owners, and that the State is not responsible for the pyrite problem or liable for remediation costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">I would now like to address a number of issues in the pyrite report which have generated some debate. The first is the number of suspected developments and dwellings and another is the categorisation of dwellings to prioritise remediation works. The pyrite panel undertook a desktop study, in conjunction with stakeholder consultation, to establish facts in respect of the potential exposure to pyrite problems. The information was gathered from a number of sources, including local authorities, structural guarantee providers, representatives of home owners, private builders, construction professionals and public representatives, and was cross-referenced to verify, as far as practicable, its validity.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> Estimates of dwellings that may be affected by pyrite are significantly less than the figures which have been speculated about in the public domain. No substantive basis of which I am aware has been put forward for the figures quoted by various sources of 60,000 or 70,000 dwellings, whereas the estimate arrived at by the pyrite panel of 74 estates with 12,250 ground floor dwellings is supported by a robust methodology which is set out clearly in the report. Those figures represent the position as of March 2012 and, based on the methodology used by the panel to arrive at the figures and taking account of the rate of presentation to date in Ireland, I would have confidence that these figures represent a reasonably accurate picture of potential future exposure.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> In 23 of the estates included in the above figures, there are no claims with guarantee companies nor is there any evidence that any dwellings in those estates have been remediated, so there may be some overestimation in the figures. The panel suggested that, based on the number of claims with guarantee providers, approximately 850 dwellings as of March 2012 were in need of immediate remediation. The use of this figure has given rise to some concern among people whose homes are affected by pyrite. People are concerned that if they are not included in the figure, they may not be included in whatever remediation processes are finally agreed. I want to make it clear that the figure of 850 dwellings categorised as "red" is an indicative figure and will not be used to determine admissibility to a remediation process. The panel used the information it had collected to give an estimate of the possible distribution of ground floor dwellings across the three classifications of red, amber and green. However, it should be noted that the inclusion of a dwelling in the figure of 850 does not necessarily mean that the dwelling has been confirmed as having reactive pyrite in the hardcore and-or has pyritic heave.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> In the preparation of its report, the panel consulted widely, meeting in excess of 40 groups from a broad range of backgrounds: home owners, industry, academia, professional bodies, banks, insurance providers, local authorities and other individuals and public representatives who had a particular interest in and expertise in dealing with pyrite. It also received a number of submissions from various groups and I understand it has considered these. While not everyone may agree with all of the recommendations in the report, it is well researched and the recommendations are supported by a broadly based consultation process. I thank the members of the pyrite panel for providing me with a thorough and comprehensive analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> Not all dwellings in estates where pyrite has been identified will manifest pyritic heave and significant damage and the reasons for this are outlined in the report. Recognising this position, the panel recommends a categorisation of dwellings to determine appropriate remediation approaches and these are detailed in the report. I agree with the recommendation that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting damage to be remediated simply because there is pyrite in the hardcore, and this position is supported in the High Court judgment of Mr. Justice Charleton in the case of James Elliot Construction <i>v.</i> Irish Asphalt. In the judgment, Mr. Justice Charleton stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_268">It is not yet reasonable to remove the infill ... solely because of the high sulfur content of the infill. That only established a possible danger into the future. Removing the infill because of actual heave is on the other hand entirely reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The pyrite report details the basis for arriving at the decision. The approach suggested by the panel to classify the dwellings into red, amber and green is a practical and sensible one to prioritise the remediation of affected dwellings.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> The remediation of dwellings is an expensive and disruptive process. I agree with the view expressed by the panel that it would be unreasonable to remediate dwellings if they do not exhibit pyrite-related damage. However, the recommendation is made on the basis of a system being in place to repair such dwellings if and when they exhibit damage in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> A number of recommendations in the pyrite report point to the need for constructive engagement by stakeholders in providing solutions for home owners. Following receipt of the pyrite report in late June, I met representatives of the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation, HomeBond, the Irish Banking Federation and the Irish Insurance Federation. I outlined to them the key role I believe they can and should play in providing a solution to the pyrite problem. The panel expressed its disappointment at the lack of engagement by stakeholders with home owners in trying to resolve the problem, and I concur with that view. I set a deadline of the end of September for the stakeholders to return to me with credible proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> All the stakeholders came back to me by the deadline with their individual responses. While they have outlined in varying levels of detail how they see the pyrite problem being resolved, and in some cases how they might participate in a resolution process, they have not come back with definitive proposals that individually or collectively would see stakeholders provide a voluntary solution for home owners. My initial response is one of disappointment that the stakeholders have not responded more positively in this regard. However, they have provided detailed responses and some have offered to participate actively and engage in any structure that might now be established to make progress. There have been further communications in recent days from some of the stakeholders and I am evaluating these to see if they can provide a basis to make progress more quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> In addition to recommending engagement by various stakeholders, the pyrite report also recommended the establishment of a resolution board which could be funded by a levy on the construction and quarrying sectors and the related insurance sector. As I have previously stated, my preferred approach to deal with the pyrite problem was for the stakeholders to work with me in finding solutions for affected home owners. This included sourcing the necessary funding to meet the costs of remediation works. In the absence of credible proposals from the stakeholders, I have made it abundantly clear that I would impose a solution along the lines recommended in the pyrite report in regard to the establishment of a resolution board funded by a mandatory levy on industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> I want to be absolutely clear on this. I have asked my Department to finalise arrangements and terms of reference quickly to permit the establishment of the proposed resolution board next week and to provide the relevant stakeholders with these details. My preference is that all of the main stakeholders would engage with the proposed board. This will give a final opportunity for all those directly or indirectly accountable for what has happened to respond, play a lead role in the remediation programme and contribute to the cost of resolution. I am hopeful that all of the stakeholders will respond positively within ten days. However, if this is not the case, I will have no option but to ask the Government to sanction the necessary steps to impose the type of levy envisaged by the panel in its report and, in that way, to provide finance for the resolution of the problem on behalf of home owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> The cost of remediating pyrite-damaged dwellings must fall to those stakeholders who are deemed to be responsible for the pyrite problem and who are so identified in the pyrite report. I will do what is necessary to ensure that effective solutions are provided for affected home owners. </p>
          <p eId="para_276"> I am conscious of the long period for which many affected home owners have been waiting to secure a resolution to this problem and I will not delay in finalising robust proposals to bring this phase of the process to a speedy conclusion. Nobody should be in any doubt about the side of this debate I am supporting. It is the home owners who have suffered for far too long because of this problem.</p>

          <from>Deputy Barry Cowen<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T12:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_279">I welcome all home owners affected by the presence of pyrite in their homes. They have taken time off work to be here in Leinster House alongside their families to listen to these statements, including those of the Minister. The statements allow Members an opportunity to further question the Minister on his most recent announcement and to seek to clarify issues for those affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> Buying a home is the largest and most important investment people make in their lives. The families and home owners of Priory Hall have seen that dream cruelly shattered and now live in a limbo between a rogue developer and an unhelpful Government. Thousands of other home owners, ordinary families and young people starting out have seen their ideal homes splinter and crack as they are slowly ruined by pyrite. Some of these individuals are in the Gallery today. The damage, disappointment and financial pressure suffered by innocent home owners who purchased their homes in good faith, only to see them gradually diminish in front of their eyes, must be confronted by the Government. As we aim to deal with the pyrite problem and offer a long-term solution by way of creating effective, fully enforced building regulations, it is incumbent upon us in this Chamber to keep home owners at the heart of any solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> The long-awaited release of the pyrite panel report in July, six months after it was originally due to be released, has yet to provoke real decisive action by the Minister on the issue, apart from that mentioned in his most recent comments, which I will address later. The report set out 24 recommendations to form the basis of a new approach to dealing with the pyrite problem. Stakeholders, including the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Association and the insurer HomeBond, among others, have failed to agree a plan to address jointly the issue of pyrite-affected homes by the end of the September deadline.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> The president of the Construction Industry Federation, Mr. Tom Parlon, has indicated that no resolution was found between the stakeholders. I am aware that serious concerns exist over how committed the stakeholders were to reaching a workable solution. I note the Minister met the representatives individually and that at no time were all of them brought together at the one forum. It appears that more foot dragging on the issue is all some of the stakeholders want. However, it is imperative that the Minister drive towards a meaningful resolution and does not let it linger for months or years. We will hold the Minister to account in that regard. We welcome some of his statements on bringing the stakeholders together within the coming ten days. In light of the report by the panel of experts not having resulted in the desired resolution, the Minister needs to highlight a timeframe for his bringing forward a clear, meaningful resolution, imposed or negotiated.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> The delay in publishing the report in the first instance does not bode well for dealing with the issue swiftly. Home owners have spent long enough waiting for the stakeholders to take action and should not bear the burden of further prevarication by these groups. The Minister must now adhere to his statement and take strong, decisive action to aid the beleaguered owners of pyrite houses. Ordinary home owners must not be left to foot the bill for the failure of developers to adhere to building standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> The report sets out the creation of a levy on the industries involved to fund the required remedial work on homes across the country. This includes such bodies as the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Concrete Federation, HomeBond, the Irish Insurance Federation and the Irish Banking Federation. The Minister stated today and previously that he will be forced to impose a levy on the industry to finance remedial work. Will he stand by his words in the absence of a viable solution put forward by the stakeholders? If so, what will the timeframe be?</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> As I stated previously on the issue, those responsible for the supply and use of damaging pyrite across the country, and their insurers, should be culpable for the costs of rectifying the problem. To ensure progress is made on the issue, the submissions of the stakeholders to the expert panel should be made publically available to place pressure on them to reach an agreement. It may be that the onus will be on the Minister to negotiate a settlement in this regard. The approach of imposing a settlement may be fraught with danger and a gamble that would force the matter into the courts, thereby prolonging the problem indefinitely such that there would be no resolution forthcoming for those affected by the Governments not putting a fund in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> Many of the home owners affected by pyrite are deeply concerned by the prospect of a property tax being placed on their already burdened wallets in the coming months. The Government's botched implementation of the household charge does not inspire confidence in the Cabinet devising a fair and equitable tax. Instead, it appears that a hefty fee will be placed on homes across the country. For example, under the ideas touted by the Government so far, a 0.25% market value tax would be inflicted on home owners. A standard three-bedroom house costs €176,000. At 0.25%, the annual property tax charge would be €440. However, the average cost of a standard three-bedroom house in Dublin is €208,000, meaning the annual charge would be €519, some €79 per annum more expensive than the national average.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> These figures do not take into consideration the extra levy that local authorities may be allowed or required to implement, as per the Minister's announcement this week on local government reform. For the owners of homes affected by pyrite, this would be nothing short of a slap in the face. I agree with the report's proposals on exempting them from such onerous charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> It is fitting that, on the first anniversary of continued Government failure in respect of the residents of Priory Hall, we have the opportunity to discuss progress in resolving pyrite problems and building regulations as a whole. Priory Hall, a 187-unit residential complex in Donaghmede, was evacuated when Dublin City Council was granted a High Court order in October 2011 for the evacuation of the development on the basis that it was unsafe due to fire hazard concerns. The various problems with the site ranged from pyrite to defective sections of the roof. Some 256 residents - families cast out from their homes - are affected by the failure of regulation at Priory Hall and by the Minister, who has consistently passed the buck on the issue and has yet to even meet them. I ask him to do so within the next ten days in the same manner that he asserts he will meet the stakeholders in the pyrite situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> In the context of this week's announcement on better local government and putting people first, as the Minister termed it, he has missed an opportunity to appoint a planning regulator as the Mahon tribunal recommended. When does the Minister intend to implement the recommendation, given his party leader's statement in this Chamber that he would have no problem in that regard? The Minister was afforded the opportunity, but he failed initially. It may be that he possesses the means to do it at a later time and that he can explain why he has not done it to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> Before considering the specifics of the pyrite report, I will again suggest a practical proposal that the Oireachtas can quickly act upon to help beleaguered home owners. It is important that we act quickly to ensure that the affected households are given every support necessary to secure their homes. During the summer, my colleague in the Seanad, Senator Darragh O'Brien, introduced a Bill to ensure that they would still have access to the courts. The home remediation pyrite Bill could ensure that home owners would have significantly more time to address the issue due to the Statute of Limitations coming into effect after pyrite had been independently identified by an approved pyrite test. This would be a real action to help home owners, many of whom are struggling with mortgages and negative equity, to address the problems facing their homes and to ensure that liabilities from building guarantee companies are fully met. I am informed that Fingal County Council has confirmed that, due to a gap in legislation in this regard, it will not proceed with 31 actions against builders, quarry owners and suppliers as intended. The Government and all parties in the House should support Senator Darragh O'Brien's Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> The Minister referred to the report's methodology. I will reiterate some my concerns about the report published last July. I am deeply concerned about the methodology used to quantify the number of houses affected by pyrite difficulties. According to the report, more than 12,000 homes in 74 unnamed estates may be contaminated with the material from five quarries. This stands in contrast to the 72,500 houses estimated to be affected previously. The estimated number of quarries was also higher. Why is there such a dramatic gap between the original estimates and the number found by the panel? What methodology was used to identify and quantify the houses affected? It is important that the roadmap for dealing with the problem accommodates the possibility of a problem on a far larger scale than the official report indicates.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> The panel found that the affected homes stretch from Fingal into my constituency in County Offaly, with estates in Edenderry badly affected by pyrite problems. Of these dwellings, only 850 have submitted claims to guarantee providers. A further 1,100 dwellings have already been remediated or are undergoing work. The majority of these works were primarily due to a court case undertaken by a builder against the quarries involved, as the Minister mentioned. The report concluded that the remaining 10,300 ground floor dwellings represent the maximum estimated future potential exposure to pyrite problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> Tackling the pyrite problems by the laborious method of removing it requires major intervention and the typical cost for an average house is estimated at €45,000. This represents a significant cost to struggling home owners. Given the scale of problem, we need to provide them with strong legal support. This underlines the need to support the legislation to which I referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> The Minister alluded to another matter. Many of the affected homes have not been formally identified. In some cases, this is because of the attached stigma as well as fears of worsening levels of negative equity. This is particularly true, given the fact that the location of the seven quarries that provided the houses' building materials is widely known. These factors increase the figures indicated by the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> Putting in place effective standards is a critical part of tackling the pyrite problem in the long run. The panel considered that timely and appropriate action was taken and the problem was successfully contained after it came to light in 2007. The panel was not informed of dwellings commenced after 2007 that were the subject of pyrite-related claims to guarantee providers. This would increase the report's indicated figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> The panel has found that, prior to the identification of the pyritic heave problems, the regulatory framework for hardcore could have compared favourably with that in the UK and other jurisdictions where guidance evolved in response to specific problems. While a number of measures were taken subsequent to the discovery of problems, we must ensure that our regulatory regime remains as strong as other jurisdictions that are dealing with the problem. We must ensure a regulatory regime similar to UK standards is in place and, more importantly, adequately enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> It would be remiss to examine this issue and fail to address the broader issue of building regulations that the Minister is dealing with under the 2012 building regulations. A national building inspectorate should examine at least 40% of the buildings under construction. A system of licensing or registering builders should be put in place. Designers or contractors who are negligent in their duties should be fully prosecuted. An open register of inspections and prosecutions and reports of inspections should be made public. A private inspection regime should be implemented to ensure that another Priory Hall can never be built. The decision to carry out an inspection should take into account the past history of the builder and any other available information that may indicate potential problems with the development. Information on builders should be shared among the relevant authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> The proposed regulations make no mention of a local authority being required to carry out due diligence in respect of certificates. At a minimum, it should verify that the person carrying out the inspections is suitably qualified and properly indemnified. It should be mandatory rather than discretionary for a developer to lodge a bond with the local authority. That bond should not be returned until such time as the council is satisfied that the development is complete and meets the required standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> In the absence of a stakeholder solution, it is time for the Minister to introduce a levy, publish the contributions of the stakeholders, reform the building regulations, provide exemptions to home owners affected by pyrite and bring this drawn out process to an end.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> The Minister stated that it is his intention, having consulted with the stakeholders and the expert panel, to meet the stakeholders within the next ten days.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">That would be around next Tuesday week. Does the Minister, as is his responsibility, wish to preside over a negotiated settlement? Is it his intention to impose a levy in the absence of a negotiated settlement? Is it his intention to have legal advice available setting out a potential train of action in the absence of an imposition of a levy? Ultimately it is the Minister's qualified responsibility, on the part of the Government and the people we represent, to preside over a process by certain means. He has gone to enough lengths to engage with the stakeholders, apart from what is planned for the next week. Despite our misgivings about what is within the expert panel, it has had enough time to act.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> It is ultimately incumbent on the Minister to act and we will hold him to account. We want him to come back within the next two weeks with the result of the agreed settlement with the stakeholders. In the absence of that, he should put to this House a train of action to bring about the desired result, even if it is by imposition and with legal expertise attached. I assume the Minister will respond to today's discussion.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">I am very pleased this issue is finally being discussed formally in the Dáil and I welcome the report and the Minister's response. I take this opportunity to give credit to the families affected by pyrite contamination and the Pyrite Action Group, many of whom have taken the time to come here today. These people spearheaded this campaign and have fought their corner with dignity and unswerving dedication. All they seek is a home they can feel secure in, a very small thing to ask for but which is, unfortunately, for many a tall order in this State. A home is an essential part of living in dignity. It is not simply a roof over one's head but a place where we can feel secure, safe and comfortable.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> It should be a very basic right which the State provides for, although for many decades it was the concerted aim of the State to maximise home ownership regardless of the suitability to the populace. It was made desirable to own a home, even if a person could not afford it. It seems people were fools if they did not want to buy their own homes, and mortgages were handed out with little care for details. People were told credit was and would stay cheap, and if a person did not have money now, he or she could pay back the money later.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> In the past decade, due to the massive availability of credit for everyone who wanted it, builders and developers were never out of work. Houses, apartment blocks and other commercial and civil buildings were often just thrown up. This was done in a system of few checks and balances, and legislation and resourcing for inspection of these works was wholly inadequate. Self-regulation was expected by the same Fianna Fáil Government that brought us the Anglo Irish Bank debacle.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> When competition is high and the jobs are backing up, self-regulation becomes a byword for no regulation. Opportunistic developers, builders, quarry owners and concrete wholesalers wondered why they should regulate themselves at their own expense. Why go by the standards of other more respectable people in the market when they could undercut them or simply raise the profit margin with no consequences? In all cases where under-regulation met greed, there were very real consequences, but the people who faced them were those who in utmost good faith bought their homes on these estates, thrown up by people who did not give the slightest damn about the quality of the work. They paid no mind to the fact they were building family homes which people paid for with hard-earned savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> The bottom line was everything to those businesses, and so it was for the Government of the day. According to Fianna Fáil, regulation is just another word for lost profits. There remains no mandatory testing of quarries for heave potential. This has been a long drawn-out process, with much investigation having been done. The report produced is of a high quality but we needed no report to tell us that quarries should be tested for a substance which could cause a house foundation to expand and the damage that would to do to the entire structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> There are houses around north Dublin and Meath being torn apart from the inside because of these very simple but unforgivable failures to regulate. At no point on the chain of supply were sufficient checks made to see if the material being used for the foundations of these houses was suitable. At no point did any regulation require those in the quarry, the concrete suppliers or the construction company doing the work to ascertain the quality of their materials and that substances like pyrite were not present. Self-regulation failed as it always will in most cases, and government regulation was not even in place. This was the case not just for pyrite contamination but fire safety and other standards. We have been lucky not to have had more pyrite-contaminated houses and cases such as those in Priory Hall, Gleann Riada, Balgaddy or The Laurels.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> In my own area we have local authority housing such as Avila Park, which is also contaminated. There are five families which have been living in caravans for over two years, waiting for their homes to be repaired or rebuilt. Is the fact these are Traveller families related to their being left in appalling conditions? More than 10,000 homes were identified in the report but there are many more, including local authority housing like in the case of Avila Park. It cannot be stated any more clearly that the State failed these families utterly and so far it has continued to fail them.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> We need legislative reform of inspections and building standards which will make these kind of scandals much more rare and easily resolved. In the North of Ireland inspection rates are 100% and they are the same in places like the USA and Britain. We settled for inspection rates of approximately 10% because the economic activity of construction was more important than the housing produced and the people who would have to live in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> The report found correctly that builders, subcontractors, vendors, material suppliers and insurers were to blame for the failure to carry out sufficient checks and balances to ensure their build quality was up to standard and safe. The report does not, however, state what is obvious in that the State and its laws were completely deficient. It must bear a responsibility and a duty of care to the people affected by pyrite, and it must step up to the plate not just in facilitating a result but in making a meaningful effort to help the families affected at present and in the future while ensuring building practices like those which caused the pyrite problem will never be allowed again.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> Part of this process could be a commitment by the State to pay now for the repairs identified as of immediate need in the panel's report. Some 850 homes were identified as requiring immediate repairs due to serious structural damage caused by pyrite contamination. This money could be recouped over time by whatever mechanism is put in place to levy the other responsible parties. A special mention must be given to HomeBond, which denied its duty to customers and gave two fingers to the Oireachtas on a number of occasions over the past year and a half. How it can be let continue to trade after its behaviour is beyond me, but what is most shocking is the appointment of HomeBond's customer service manager to the Building Regulations Advisory Board by this Government. HomeBond could learn a lot about customer service and share some of the profits it recently announced.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> It is also essential that part of the State's commitment to resolution of this issue is to see that a fund is put in place to deal with any future repairs which become unavoidable. Some of the homes which are not identified as needing immediate attention are at risk of developing problems into the future and the people affected cannot be allowed to lie in a limbo of having a pyrite problem develop too late for the support we demand for those who need it right now. A comprehensive and systematic notification, testing and remediation scheme should be put in place at no cost to those who require it.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> It must be mentioned that thousands of people still work in these industries and in companies which operate on a sufficient level of self-regulation, with no part in the supply chain or construction which led to the pyrite scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">We must act in a way which does not put these businesses, which did not act negligently, out of operation due to the acts of others who, in some cases, maybe undercut them by using substandard practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> The pyrite action group has circulated a number of actions it believes are needed to get the resolution process right and I would be inclined to agree with it. These include the immediate removal of defective infill from all homes found to be at risk of pyritic heave and sulfate attack; remedial works to be carried out systematically in blocks; the independent and professional co-ordination of remedial works; independent structural re-certification, full compliance with the building regulations and a new credible structural warranty; provision of upfront funding in order that remedial works can be undertaken quickly while the State recoups costs from other responsible stakeholders through the proposed levy, voluntary contributions and other appropriate mechanisms over the longer term; and a retrospective waiver of the household charge and forthcoming property taxes for home owners living in affected developments until the entire development has been brought up to standard and can be successfully reintegrated back into the property market. All the Deputies have seen these requests and all the Ministers have received them, including the Minister, Deputy Hogan. We would be hard-pressed to disagree with them and the onus is on us to hold the resolution process to account and strive to have these requests honoured. The State, at the very least, owes these people that.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> I would like to go back to the issue of those living in local authority housing affected by pyrite, which is not mentioned in this report. We still have no idea how many there are but there are at least 300 in my constituency. Due to the shortage of local authority housing, these people are also in limbo and are forced to seek temporary accommodation or to live in homes which are unsuitable and possibly dangerous. Local government funding is needed to address this not only in homes, but in community centres, schools and other facilities, which we have all seen.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> The Minister promised at the end of September that if he did not get replies from the industries concerned, he would impose a solution. He got replies but they seem very inadequate. This issue is so serious that we demand a better response. The Minister mentioned that he would give it in ten days. I had hoped we would have a definitive answer today on what actions he would take - not a holding position but a clear and unambiguous solution which will cover all those affected now and into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> Tens of thousands of people are affected - men, women and children. We are not just talking about 10,000 homes but about tens of thousands of people who live in these homes. They face constant worry about their future and their children's future.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> The pyrite report was a good piece of work and I welcome it. In the Elliot case, which the Minister mentioned, work is being done and all the floors and the paths are being taken out. It was not selective. I hope we will not delay by putting in place a resolution board. We will have to go through the whole process of assessing people and their houses. It is very important we get this right.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> I welcome the fact we will debate this issue again soon. This issue will not go away and it needs resolution. Without an upfront levy and without the Government putting its name on the chequebook, we will have big problems. It will take time to build up a levy, if that is the route we take. I said that legislation may be needed and we need to assess that as quickly as possible.</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_165">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_324">I was going to start by welcoming the report which is a substantial body of work and which pinpoints the difficulties and identifies important measures for the future, but having listened to the interpretation put on it by the Minister, I can come to no other conclusion but to say that the panel was established to minimise the State's responsibility in this regard. The Minister's comments were an insult to the people in the Visitors Gallery who took time off work.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> I do not make these points lightly but I make them on the basis that Brendan Tuohy, the chair of the panel, attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht and said that no one mentioned the State's role in this. That is absolutely not true. I mentioned it, as did many other people. Two of the people on that panel were former members of the Building Regulation Advisory Board and the National Standards Authority of Ireland and they attended all of the meetings. Arthur Cox, the Government's legal advisers, legally advised the panel in drafting and crafting this report.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> No one is saying, as the Minister did in his speech, that we want all of the blame for all of the failures to rest with the State. Everyone accepts that the main stakeholders have a role in this, including the quarry owners, the insurance companies, the banks and so on. The idea that the Minister has consistently tried to put forward that the State is not responsible is factually incorrect and will not be tolerated by citizens in this country. We have used similar scenarios to explain it. It is like flood victims and victims of clerical abuse. The State did not carry out the actions which gave rise to them but it has a central role in producing a remedy to sort it out. Unless the State provides the money upfront and then chases the stakeholders, those people will be left in limbo.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> It is not good enough to say, as the Minister did, that the State could not have known. I am aware the panel said that as well, but it is wrong. Bodies were employed by this State which were charged with regulating standards. The Building Regulation Advisory Board and the National Standards Authority of Ireland brag in their literature that they are responsible for a continuous honing of technical expertise to ensure we are abreast of all international developments. They did not keep abreast of developments in the area of technical expertise even though the expertise existed.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> For 50 years, there was knowledge in existence. Not every engineer had it but it was quite widely known that elevated levels of sulphur in sedimentary rocks containing pyrite increased the chance of a sulphate attack on concrete and steel and swelling-causing gypsum and causing heave. The first published article on this was in Britain in the late 1970s, some 35 years ago. There were other reports in the 1980s and 1990s. There was the Canadian experience, to which the Minister referred, and there was geological knowledge of the rock formation around the Tobercolleen formation in which many of the quarries are located. They should have known.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> When they went looking in 2005, despite that knowledge being there, it took them two years to get an explanation for the cracking. It has been suggested by someone that if they had Googled it, they would have got it in a half an hour but to be honest, there was no explanation as to why it took two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> The panel compliments Fingal County Council. Let us be clear, Fingal is the area where most of the victims live with the consequences and that is why it is particularly important in this context. When the first case was confirmed in June 2007 to Fingal County Council by HomeBond, it correctly notified Bay Lane quarry where the infill came from and it wrote to all of the developers who had given commencement notices that they were starting development in Fingal alerting them to the possible danger of pyrite in the materials. That was good, but it was not good enough. Why did it not write to the other three quarries in Fingal, which also have pyrite in them, including Roadstone in Huntstown and Murphy's quarry - coincidentally the same Seamus Murphy who is the friend of primary care centres - and so on? Why were those quarries not put on alert? Why did Fingal County Council not contact the developers and the builders of the projects under way? Many of them are probably owned by the people in the Visitors Gallery.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> In buildings where the slab floor was laid but where there was no other construction, it would have cost approximately €5,000 to remove the infill at that stage and rebuild the property. Instead, these people have been left with a bill of approximately €50,000 and a house they cannot use. It is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> It went to the aggregates panel which devised a new standard. That is good but what does it tell one? It tells one that the existing standard was not adequate, so it changed the standard in 2007 but took it six months to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">Many thousands more dwellings came on the scene within the six months and one could not come to any conclusion other than that the inadequate standard emerged in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> It is inadequate because Premier Insurance, the second largest insurer in the State, will not insure properties that meet the Irish standard because it is not good enough. Why when most of our standards are similar to Britain's is the standard not similar in this regard? It is because five of the seven members of the aggregates panel are from the industry representing Kilsaran, Roadstone, Irish Cement and the Irish Concrete Federation. They have a vested interest in ensuring standards are kept low and there is no testing because that would be more onerous on them. The panel is incorrect in its repeated statement that five quarries had pyrite. The members were given the names of six quarries with pyrite and I am reliably informed there are seven.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> The State is responsible for this lack of standard and oversight but, crucially, it is also responsible for allowing the fraud perpetrated by HomeBond. This company was allowed to pose as the provider of a structural guarantee when everybody knew it was not worth the paper it was written on. This society knew in 2000 when the Law Society issued a warning about that. HomeBond has totally and utterly failed people and both the residents and I reject the notion of the company playing a leading role in the resolution of this process. We know the company has the lists. They should be taken from it and used. HomeBond has €25 million in the bank, little of which will be drawn down for cases other than those relating to pyrite. The money should be taken from the company and used to set up the fund to begin remedial works. Its staff do not have expertise in this area and there should be no question of them having oversight of the remedial works. That has to be done on an independent basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> The key issue, which has been touched on by previous speakers, is that it is inadequate to address this issue on an individual, case-by-case basis as the panel suggests. There must be a systematic, State-led approach to renovation. There is no other way that this will happen. The residents refute the figures regarding the number of houses affected and the traffic light system. It is not the case that only 850 houses are critically damaged by pyrite. In one case in my area, residents were told 15 houses had been notified to HomeBond - I cannot get verification of that - when they knew of 50 in a development of more than 600 houses. If one's house is in the amber category, which means it has pyrite but is not displaying signs of distress, it will not disappear. It can only go in one direction and get worse. These home owners have a valueless, unfit for purpose noose around their necks about which they can do nothing. There can be no phasing. The only way to deal with this is by a State-led systematic approach on an estate by estate basis and that can only happen if the Minister takes the lead and sets up a fund. It has to start with comprehensive testing and not by people being forced to extend their mortgages to get a loan from the bank to pay for the work. The banks should cough up and fund the entire remediation and testing process. No costs should be borne by the residents and there should be systematic testing and renovation.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> This is our responsibility. The Minister made a number of references to the poor residents, the heartache and so on but they will ring hollow unless something is delivered on this issue quickly. He said during the summer when he launched the panel that the members had three months to come up with a solution or he would impose one. That was four months ago and now he says we have to wait another ten days. These people cannot afford to have the can kicked down the road. We have been told €2 billion from NAMA will be spent on capital projects. Up to €1 billion in unspent development levies is held by local authorities. The Minister has been able to transfer the bad debts of councils to the Exchequer. He can, therefore, come up with the money to start this fund. These people cannot be left waiting and they will not go away. This issue is too serious and the State is ultimately responsible and will be judged accordingly whether it comes with the solution or not.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_338">If I was a home owner in the Visitors Gallery listening to the Minister's contribution, Pontius Pilate is the first image that would have to come to mind. I realise that the Government parties are aware of many of the problems now but it is not good enough that the State is saying that it has to go after different guys. It should go after them in due course but the problem the people affected face needs to be dealt with now. The Government must be upfront, fix the problem and then it can chase the people responsible. The Minister cannot just ignore this. The private sector works under the watch of the State and the Minister cannot walk away from responsibility. As Deputy Daly pointed out, the Government did not cause the abuse in religious institutions but it took responsibility for it. The Government might not necessarily have caused the behaviour of the banks but, because the Financial Regulator was not doing his job, it took responsibility for the banks and bailed them out. How in God's name can the Minister not see that the State has a responsibility to deal with this matter upfront?</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> The affected home owners cannot be expected to chase the quarries. They cannot even deal with the likes of HomeBond, which has reneged on its responsibilities. They certainly cannot deal with the CIF and God knows they cannot deal with the financial institutions. The blame lies everywhere. We can start with the quarries. The stone was not fit for purpose. If I bought loads of stone and it was delivered to the site, I would not have been in a position to test it when it arrived. I could be forgiven for thinking that it was fit for purpose when I bought it. Getting the quarries to take responsibility will be a major problem because some will say they have X amount of responsibility and others are more to blame because the quality of stone varies. Some quarries have a higher content of limestone while others have a higher shale content, which is more liable to result in to pyrite problems. There will be huge division between the quarries as to who will take responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> I reiterate the comment of the previous speaker about the regulation which permits 0.6% sulphur content in Irish stone whereas it is 1% in Britain. How in God's name can we stand over that? That is outrageous. This facilitates the serious players because they think they can get away with a little sulphur in their stone and they will get away with less than they would in Britain and that is not good enough. It is a minimum requirement that we follow the British regulation if for no other reason than to be on the safe side. The fact that the aggregates panel is dominated by people with a vested interest means it would have been difficult to expect them to come to a different conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> The notion that HomeBond is responsible for structural defects is a myth. HomeBond has been a disgrace and a disaster. The company was not even good to work with in the industry because the amount of checking its staff did was minimal. It was a poor organisation which was geared more towards making money than acting as a regulator.</p>

          <p eId="para_345">It is outrageous to suggest that the financial institutions do not bear responsibility. If they gave the people affected by pyrite mortgages for their homes, then they sent someone out in advance of drawdown to see if it was safe to part with their money. The agreement was signed off with the banks deeming the homes to be worth the money before granting the mortgages. Now they will walk away from home owners, which is outrageous. The Government must hold them to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> If ten houses in an estate of 100 houses are found to have pyrite, it is outrageous that the other 90 are not tested because they are no good to the people residing in them. The owners can never sell them because the houses are under suspicion of having pyrite unless it is proven that they do not. If I had the job of testing 100 homes together, I could do it at a fraction of the cost of doing them individually. Any estates with pyrite should be tested so that each house can be certified as clean. Otherwise, it is a stone around the neck of the owners.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Shane McEntee)<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_347">I welcome this day and all the speakers. Regardless of politics, everyone has the opportunity to speak. As a rule, I do not prepare a speech and read it out but I do not want to make a mess of what I want to say. This issue has been ongoing for four or five years. I take on board what has been said across the Chamber. Three years ago, I got involved in helping out two families in County Meath to get their houses fixed. Two and half years ago, people tried to shut me up when I was in opposition and I tried to raise the issue of millions of euro being spent on court cases. I got involved with two companies and, instead of fighting it out in court, I got the companies together and the 700 houses are fixed and will be finished in October. I worked on that basis to get where we are today and I am glad the Minister said it will be resolved in ten days. In some ways, that is ten days too long but I guarantee it will be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> I welcome the statement made by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, at the beginning of this debate. I acknowledge the active commitment of the Minister and the Government in charting a way forward to a solution to this problem, which has brought misery to the lives of so many decent people who are citizens of our Republic. The pyrite problem happened on the previous Government's watch and it did nothing about it, even though the problems were staring it in the face. This Government took it on. The Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, set up the pyrite review panel under an independent chairman and with a clear mandate and resources. I commend the work done by the panel, under its excellent chairman, Mr. Brendan Tuohy. The report set out a roadmap for the remediation of the issue of pyrite in private dwellings. The panel made it clear those with direct or indirect responsibility for the pyrite problem should bear the cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> I welcome the Minister's commitment to getting Cabinet approval for setting up a pyrite resolution board and, if necessary, a compulsory levy. I call on the stakeholders - quarries, builders, insurance companies, lending institutions and HomeBond - to make a voluntary contribution to the creation and operation of a remediation fund. Having had extensive contacts with HomeBond in recent weeks, I am satisfied it is committed to making its extensive expertise in the area available to the remediation process. In the case of the other stakeholders, their contribution must be, and will be, financial.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> The pyrite resolution board needs a strong independent chairperson with deep knowledge and experience of the issue and credibility with the stakeholders. The resolution board should include fully mandated representatives of the various stakeholders - builders, developers, subcontractors, quarries, insurance companies, financial institutions, HomeBond and the citizens affected. From my contacts with them, I am sure the stakeholders will participate fully. The remediation board will differ from the earlier pyrite review panel in that its mandate will be to actively progress a programme of remediation based on, but beyond, the scoping work and analysis of the issue done by the review panel. A new pyrite czar, chairing the pyrite resolution board, must have the total support of the Minister and Government to provide leadership and focus to the remediation programme and, if necessary, to knock heads together to break any logjam and push on to a resolution for everyone affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> With a fund established and cash flow over the next three or four years, which should be started immediately, we can deliver on remediation for the three categories of dwellings identified by Mr. Brendan Tuohy and his team on the pyrite review panel - immediate priority, intermediate and latter stages. No one group or industry is capable of resolving this issue on its own. It is a major undertaking and no one should be in any doubt about it. My involvement and experience with this issue in my county, Meath, over the past four or five years in helping to get estates fixed and helping to resolve the major Menolly Homes and Lagan case has led me to believe that a voluntary approach, within a defined framework, will achieve the outcome we want. It is ridiculous to burn millions of euro, as was the case, in legal fees and costs in court cases that drag on for years while the problem in people's homes gets worse. I could not believe the final figure in one of the cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> Having spent the period since the publication of the pyrite review panel meeting with stakeholders, with the knowledge of the Minister, together with my involvement with this problem over the past five years, I am confident the various stakeholders are prepared to work together to put a workable remediation programme into action, provided they are clear that no sector will carry an undue or unfair burden under the programme. However, if certain people or institutions continue to ignore the legitimate aspiration to a safe, secure home of people paying their mortgages, the choice left to the citizens will be stark. The people of Ireland, at enormous personal cost, have been supporting the financial institutions. Now is the time for the institutions, in return, to take part and contribute to a resolution of the pyrite issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> The panel did not consider that the State was responsible for causing the pyrite problem and therefore should not be liable for the costs associated with remediation. The report clearly stated that those parties with direct or indirect responsibility for the pyrite problem should bear the cost of remediation. Among the groups identified were builders, subcontractors, developers, material suppliers and insurers. I want to acknowledge everybody in the Visitors Gallery today for their commitment and determination to get this problem fixed. I acknowledge the support from party colleagues and, in particular, Deputies Catherine Murphy, Clare Daly and Dessie Ellis for working with me in a positive and constructive way. The pyrite review panel has done the State some service by giving us an excellent report pointing the road to a solution. Today, we take our first big steps along that road. We owe it to them, and to the thousands of families whose lives have been devastated by pyrite, to turn the report into action.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanOFearghaillFF" eId="spk_172">
          <from>Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_354">I am pleased to have the opportunity to take part, albeit briefly, in this debate. From time to time, debates in this House lead nowhere and generate no action but we can acknowledge the announcement of the Minister of the establishment of a resolution board as an outcome to this debate. I welcome that and thank the Minister for taking the first small step along the road to a solution. The issue has been consistently raised at meetings of the Whips and Deputy Catherine Murphy has continually pushed for the debate to take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> I am fortunate that we are not affected by this problem in south Kildare but I am conscious of the extent of the problem in north Kildare and the greater Dublin area. I have direct experience of people coming to my constituency clinics when they are in negative equity. They struggle to cope with mortgages if they are unemployed or have seen the value of their incomes decrease dramatically. I can only imagine the horror and stress that must exist for families trying to pay mortgages, living with negative equity and facing the fact that the home they love and bought as a life investment and a place to raise a family is crumbling around them. We accept the point that the State did not cause the problem, as pointed out by the Minister, but the State must provide leadership towards finding a resolution to the problem. If the stakeholders continue to be derelict in their responsibilities, as they appear to have been to date, it behoves the State to take a strong leadership position and to engage, as the Minister suggests, through the resolution board and to take more resolute action if the engagement does not lead to concrete action.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> Identifying the scale of the problem must be the first task. The cost to the interested parties, and ultimately to the State if the State is to pick up responsibility, depends on the number of properties affected. I am not unduly convinced by the report's certainty about the figure of 12,500.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">The report says the panel endeavoured to establish the scale of the problem by estimating the number of ground floor dwellings that may have pyritic hard core. It goes on to state: "Therefore, in considering the extent of possible future exposure to pyritic heave, the panel is of the view that, taking the most pessimistic view, there may be approximately 10,300 units." The report goes on to say that three schools have been identified by the Department of Education and that approximately 850 social and affordable housing units have been identified in a number of local authority areas. </p>
          <p eId="para_358"> The media is full of reports that between 60,000 and 72,000 units are affected. Surely we need a definitive analysis of that figure before we can move towards a solution or get the parties to commit to participation. If we do not know the cost we cannot know the capacity of those responsible to bear the cost or what cost will fall to central Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_359"> The report of the expert committee seems to indicate that inadequate analysis has been done or, at least, there is not enough certainty about the problem. The Government needs to consider an additional public awareness campaign. Deputy Wallace made a valid point. If ten houses in an estate have a problem, the other 90 householders deserve, at least, to have their houses analysed. It is highly improbable that the material for ten houses would be brought from one quarry and the material for the others from elsewhere. </p>
          <p eId="para_360"> The executive summary of the report seems to suggest that not all the quarries identified have ceased to operate. We need an assurance from the Minister that action will be taken by his Department or by the relevant local authority to ensure that any quarry that is still operational is closed forthwith, so that there is no possibility of inappropriate material being removed from those sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> We need to go back to the public and highlight the possibility that other properties may be affected, so that we can properly quantify the scale of the problem. That task will be complicated by the fact that it can take between two and nine years for pyritic heaves to commence. People who are sitting in properties today may discover tomorrow that their sitting room floor is beginning to bubble up in front of them or the walls of their living room are beginning to crack. We must confirm these matters as soon as possible. </p>
          <p eId="para_362"> I was also struck by the fact that we knew nothing of pyrite in Ireland until 2007, although it had been a problem in other jurisdictions, particularly in Canada. It is not surprising that we knew nothing about it because our schools of architecture and colleges of engineering did not include pyrite in any of their training courses. If the experts in the field were not being educated in this area, it is small wonder that the problem manifested itself unknown to anyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> Are other problematic materials being used in construction of domestic residences or in the public infrastructure programme? Problems may arise from inadequate testing or monitoring and give rise to difficulties in the future. As I go around the country and my own county, I sometimes notice that while one road has been constructed and lasts for years, another with the same volume of traffic but constructed by another team or contractor in another part of the county disintegrates within two or three years. One suspects this is because materials of different qualities have been used. If we are to learn anything from this, it must be that we insist on proper testing and monitoring of construction materials.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> We should see today's debate as one small step forward. The Minister must honour the clear commitment he gave to the House to have engagement over the next ten days. He must come back to the House after that engagement and confirm whether progress has been made. If progress is not made, the Minister will have the unanimous agreement of all Deputies to bring forward urgent legislation to force the parties to this process to make a contribution, by levy or some other method, so that the matter can be brought to a conclusion. </p>
          <p eId="para_365"> The people who are affected by this problem need to be able to rest easy in their beds and to know the Government will address the matter and insist on bringing about a resolution that involves the restoration of the houses to the standard they have a right to expect.</p>

          <from>Deputy Alan Farrell<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_366">I thank the Minister for the opportunity to contribute to the statement on the report of the pyrite panel. The report is a significant step in addressing a serious issue for tens of thousands of individuals across north Leinster.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> Five years and three months ago the<i> Evening Herald</i> led with a headline about my own estate and published a photograph of a house two doors from my own which was affected by pyrite. The following day, the TV cameras were in the estate and since then the pyrite problem has been simmering in the background. </p>
          <p eId="para_368"> Nothing was done to tackle the issue by the previous Administration. I pay tribute to a number of Deputies, particularly the Minister of State, Deputy Shane McEntee, and a number of Opposition Deputies, for the work they did in the previous Dáil and in the last months to ensure that this matter was brought to a head with the publication of this report and with the commitments given in the House by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, today and previously. </p>
          <p eId="para_369"> As someone who has gone through the process myself, having discovered pyrite in July 2007 and having had it remediated last year as a result of a settlement agreement that was much publicised, I know the hurt, anguish and pain other home owners are going through. On top of the pressures of mortgage payments taken out during the boom, cost of living changes, salary worries, job losses and all sorts of impositions placed on individuals in the past years, the knowledge that it would be almost impossible to borrow the €50,000 needed to fix one's home if it has pyrite - never mind if one can afford to get it tested to prove it has pyrite - is a significant worry.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> The figure of 74 estates and 12,250 properties identified is probably accurate. I hope it is. It would be entirely unsatisfactory to come back to this issue a number of years from now, having found another pocket of dwellings constructed before or after 2007. </p>
          <p eId="para_371"> Will the industry and all the stakeholders take responsibility? This is the issue the Government must face. I am heartened by the comments of the Minister when he said the State had a role and a duty to assist home owners in finding a resolution to the pyrite problem. That is a clear and unambiguous commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">If the industry does not make a meaningful contribution in the next number of days, a legislative stick will be used to impose a levy to ensure that the home owners in the red category will at least have their properties fixed in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> Anybody who finds themselves in the amber category where there are signs of pyritic heave will have their properties remediated. My personal opinion is that what is proposed for the amber category is not sufficient. If there is pyrite in the floor slab, one cannot sell one's house. If one cannot sell one's house, one cannot move on with one's life. There is a variety of reasons that a person would need to sell their home. They might have bought a two bedroom property and now have two or three children, so they need to move on. I am aware of families with two children living in one bedroom apartments on the first floor of apartment buildings. They cannot move on with their lives because they cannot sell their property due to it being in an apartment building with pyritic infection in the ground floor dwellings. That is a very distressing position for families.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> In the 18 months since I was elected to the Dáil dozens, if not hundreds, of individuals have contacted my office, clinics and constituency office about this issue. As my constituency colleague mentioned earlier, Fingal and north Dublin is the hotbed of the pyrite problem and it spread outward from there. I noted Deputy Ó Fearghaíl's comments about the significant contribution we will all make in fast-tracking legislation, if required, if the industry does not step up to the mark in the next number of weeks. I compliment Fingal County Council on the work it did in 2007. The building control unit produced a comprehensive document which was sent to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and which, unfortunately, did very little with it thereafter. However, the report has been used since then and it is mentioned in the pyrite panel's report. I am certain the work undertaken at that time means less work is required now to move this issue towards a conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> The pyrite panel report is a stepping stone in the right direction to getting the problem resolved. We must now ensure that a standardised testing regime is introduced so if a home owner believes he or she has pyrite but has been unable to afford to get a test carried out, he or she can avail of this low cost option as soon as possible. What I found most frustrating was the requirement to get a test carried out that would stand up to the evidentiary rules of our courts, which costs thousands of euro. I know some individuals, Deputies and other public representatives who have had to do that. The cost can range from a few hundred euro to a few thousand. We need a standardised system to ensure residents are aware whether they have the problem. At least they could then move on and provide the test result to prospective purchasers, perhaps, or to the pyrite resolution panel for the purpose of getting an all-clear certificate, or whatever is arranged in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> The Minister used the word "responsibility" in respect of ensuring that we do what we can to ensure the industry steps forward. That is welcome and is probably the most positive thing that was said in the House this afternoon. As well as the standardised testing regime, I wish to refer briefly to Deputy Wallace's comment regarding the suspicion of pyrite. I will not name estates as I do not wish to cause any further distress to families whose homes are in those estates. However, it should be known that there are houses in my estate and others in north Dublin that are pyrite free, while houses a couple of doors down have significant pyrite damage. The first experience I had with pyrite was in July 2007. It was in my neighbour's house and I was able to put my fingers, up to the knuckles, into a crack in a supporting wall in their hallway. That is a significant crack. Thankfully, it has been repaired. It is one of the 700 properties the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, mentioned earlier that are being repaired. However, there are hundreds of other instances where individuals are not in pyrite affected homes but who have the constant worry of the association with pyrite. That is the reason these pyrite free certificates must be rolled out as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> In conclusion, I wish to be as constructive as possible about this process. It is easy to point the finger of blame and say the Government did not do this, the Department did not do that and the local authorities did not do the other. What we must do now is stamp out the problem and ensure the building regulations and technical guidance documents are sufficiently robust to ensure this does not happen in the future. The Government will use the threat of the legislative option to impose a levy on the industry to ensure that affected home owners get a resolution as quickly as possible so they can move on with their lives.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">Cuirim fáilte roimh an deis labhairt ar an ábhar uafásach tábhachtach seo. Many families in this State are locked in pyrite homes that are a living hell for them. Each day they watch their most important investment and possession, their home, disintegrate around them. In other cases, families have been forced to leave their houses because of kitchen units falling out of the walls and parts of the house falling down. In many cases, these people blame the inaction of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> Up to 20,000 houses in the State could be affected. Many of them are in north Dublin but many are also in my home county, Meath, in towns such as Navan, Enfield, Dunboyne, Kentstown and Ashbourne.</p>

          <p eId="para_381">Like other Deputies, I have seen the damage that has been done. Cracks are appearing across supporting walls and door frames are starting to disintegrate. It is a heartbreaking experience for anybody. It is mainly affecting my generation. These are the people who were told to get on the property ladder a few years ago because, if they did not, it would cost too much for them ever to own a house. These people scraped and struggled in every way they could to get mortgages to buy houses that are now worth only a fraction of what they paid for them. These people are our friends, neighbours and, in some cases, our families who bought their dream house. These citizens believed they were protected by the regulations of the State, insurance and the surveys that were carried out. Ultimately, the innocent victim of this entire process is the only one who has, so far, been made to carry the can. They bought in good faith, but have been dealt with in an appalling fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> The repair bill for these houses runs to tens of thousands of euro. At a time when the Irish League of Credit Unions has reported that most of this generation is struggling to find disposable income at the end of the month, it is clear it will not be possible for them to pay such amounts. It is money they should not have to pay. It is not just the private housing stock that is suffering in this regard. Many local authority houses, schools, public buildings and roads have been affected by this.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> The blame clearly lies with sectors of the construction industry - the quarry owners who sold contaminated construction materials, the builders who failed to test the quality of those building materials and the developers who were more interested in a quick buck than ensuring the quality of their product. However, the buck does not stop there. The State had a system of regulation that failed to detect the major problem of pyrite contaminated materials.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> The previous regime had a system where surveys were carried out to pass houses as fit but those houses were not fit for habitation. Under the previous regime, the HomeBond scheme was in place but that has failed owners as well. All of this points to an abdication of responsibility, which is simply not acceptable. It is well beyond time these citizens got what they paid for.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> It is equally clear the construction industry has abdicated responsibility with regard to this mess. It is unrealistic to expect a voluntary system will resolve this situation. It needs the direct intervention of Government, which must hold these sectors to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, also a Deputy from County Meath, brought the Taoiseach, then the leader of the Opposition, to a number of houses in Dunboyne, Kentstown, Ashbourne and Dunshaughlin before the general election. The Minister of State said then that he was shocked at the level of destruction he had seen, that these were people's homes and it was an outrage that the then Government was washing its hands of the issue. He said those people were in an impossible situation. Eighteen months later, those people live in exactly the same impossible situation as they did when the Minister of State lambasted the previous Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_388">Many of these families are still in exactly the same situation. It is unfortunate a solution has not yet been found. I implore the Government that this living hell should not be allowed to continue for these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> What must be done? The construction industry must be made responsible for this mess. The Government must step in to stabilise and repair the worst of this damage. It must impose a levy on the industry to make good the full cost of the repairs. While that levy is building, the Government must put the money upfront to resolve the situation. If this Government does not act, it will only compound the despair of the home owners while further damaging the credibility of the political system, which ignores the innocent and fails to hold those responsible to account. We may have our political differences on many issues but we are all on the same page when it comes to recognising the importance of this problem. I understand the wheels of Government turn slowly by their very nature, so I implore the Minister to put as much effort as possible into ensuring no time is wasted and that we do not wait for a levy, but that we make an investment in the houses that need it. I look forward to welcoming the Taoiseach back to Meath in order that he can visit the same houses after they have been repaired.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> If that does not happen, however, I challenge the Minister of State and the Taoiseach to go back to the same houses in a year's time and explain why this has not happened. Legislation will be necessary to resolve this problem and I ask the Minister of State to ensure any legislation is retrospective and does not leave a single householder behind.</p>

          <p eId="para_391">The Government and Minister of State are seeking to provide a framework within which we can move forward and do all we can to deal with individual cases while putting in place an overall plan to allow us to deal with this issue in its totality. I have visited houses that have been affected by this, both in and near my constituency. I have been in local authority public housing that was built to provide people with good housing in their own communities but there are now cracks in the brickwork and the frames are coming under pressure and cracking. I have been in private housing where, as Deputy Farrell said, a few houses will be unaffected while the other houses will have cracks that a person could put a fist into. There is nothing like seeing this problem and the awful effect it has on people who bear absolutely no blame for the situation. There is clearly a need for the Government to act but it is also clear that the report offers two ways to approach the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> The report makes clear that the Government is dissatisfied with the engagement to date by many of those who have been involved and more must be done. It lays out what needs to be done to address the problem. We all have a strong interest in ensuring the fifth, sixth and seventh recommendations from this report are promptly implemented. The fifth recommendation outlines the desired response of the insurance industry for those who have been affected. The sixth and seventh recommendations, however, are the most important recommendations we need to see delivered: how people should engage immediately to ensure these houses are fixed and what can be done to ensure costs are apportioned fairly to those responsible for them in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> I am aware that in some cases, some of the companies responsible for this no longer exist. That will make it more difficult to apportion costs fairly but that should not stop us from doing what needs to be done initially. The implementation of the levy, or the credible possibility of it being implemented, is crucial to getting everyone involved with this to the table. I ask the Department and the Minister not to spare any effort in ensuring this is quickly done. We have a clear responsibility to the people who live in these apartments to ensure those responsible for this happening through the provision of material that did not meet the required standards are compelled to fix the issue quickly. I hope the report being presented to the House will provide a framework for doing that. I am sure the Government will do all possible to have it implemented.</p>

          <p eId="para_394">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this report and welcome its publication. It is the result of the independent panel established by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government last year. Our home is the biggest investment we will ever make in our lives, financially and emotionally. I can only imagine how I would feel if I had to go through what some of these people who have been affected by this awful occurrence have been through. I think of the people in Edenderry in Offaly who have been in contact with me, and it is appalling to see what they have been going through.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> I welcome the findings of the independent review, however, that the figures are lower than estimated for the number of homes affected. I realise that is no consolation to those who were affected but it means the scale of the problem is not as large as we thought. Reflecting on this, a number of issues contributed to it, not least the information deficit in the construction industry. It is difficult to believe that in construction and engineering courses, there was no specific information on pyritic heave. It is extraordinary that people were not even aware this could occur and were not in a position to ensure the chemical testing that should have been done on this hard core was done. From the very beginning, I have seen this as a consumer rights issue and consumers did not get what they paid for. It is still such an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> The response of the construction and insurance industries has not been very good, to say the least. It has been appalling. They have a moral responsibility to come with a solution. The hands-off attitude we have seen to date is unacceptable. I am particularly disgusted at the attitude of HomeBond which supplied the structural deficit warranty and withdrew the cover for the pyritic damage. Neither it nor Premier Guarantee will cover testing, which is expensive. Whatever about redoing work that has shown signs of pyritic heave, not to produce the money, which is substantial, for testing in areas of potential damage is disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> What bugs me is that, since last year, HomeBond would not appear before the joint committee to give an account of itself. It has been invited on numerous occasions and to date it has not appeared. We have discovered it has a representative on the Buildings Regulations Advisory Board. We urge that it not be allowed remain on that board, given the disdain in which it held the joint committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> To achieve swift movement on the issue, I urge that the pyrite resolution board be set up immediately. The construction industry has had time to figure this out. The board must be put in place and the levies imposed on the industry in order that people can return to their homes and enjoy them, which is what we all want in our place of safety and security. That is what they deserve and what they paid for in the first place. I would like to see them as consumers getting an opportunity to take a class action on this issue to the Competition Authority. I referred to this matter in a contribution in the House earlier in the year and it is something I would like to see them being in a position to do.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_399">I welcome the debate but I wish it was not necessary. However, it is necessary because essentially the industry was given until 30 September to respond, which was a significant amount of leeway, but it gave the Minister the two fingers. In recent weeks it has been dragged back into the system. I acknowledge it is back in the system because the Minister of State, Deputy Shane McEntee, has played an essential role between it and the Government. I noted the difference in the language used by the Minister of State and the Minister in respect of the next ten days. The Minister said he was hopeful that all stakeholders will respond positively within ten days, whereas the Minister of State went a step further and used the word "guarantee". If it is up to the Minister of State it will be a guarantee and I acknowledge that, for a long time, he was a lone voice, particularly in opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> I take issue with a statement made by the Minister that a strong statutory framework for regulation of construction activities exists under the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007. If that was the case, we would not have some of the problems being experienced. The reason the mandatory compliance certificate is being introduced is that previously there was a lower standard, an opinion certificate issued by various sectors. The mandatory compliance certificate was provided for in legislation but it was not signed into law, as we discovered at the joint committee meeting last week. I challenge the Minister on the issue of a strong framework. For some time I have expressed the need to license builders in order that we have a sector from which people are confident to purchase their homes. We must learn from the experience. </p>
          <p eId="para_401"> I hope the debate will move the issue to the point where we see the A to Z and the timeline on how to resolve the problem. As it is a structural failure, it needs a structural response. It is not about a piecemeal response. It has to deal with issues such as testing, how the testing will be conducted and who will pay for it. Will it be done in a systematic way? We have to deal with the issue of certification in order that when houses are found to be pyrite free or remediated, there is no blight that continues on if the house runs into difficulty in regard to insurance issues and needs to be resold. Those are practical issues that need to be dealt with as well as the most urgent issue of remediating the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> The pyrite action group, which has co-ordinated some of the people affected, compiled many documents. It has indicated what it sees as the effects of pyrite: heaving, the lifting of ground-bearing concrete slabs, bulging and cracking of internal partition walls supported by floor slabs, cracking above doors and windows, even on the outside, internal doors jamming to the point where people have been locked into rooms, and bulging and cracking of floors and walls. I have seen structural cracking of outer walls which interferes with damp courses, cracking shower trays and fireplaces, staircases, fitted wardrobes, kitchen tops and other units separating from the walls, and causing damage to underground piping, such as sewerage, gas and water pipes. Then we find the HomeBond structural guarantee is not really a structural guarantee. The Minister referred to its expertise. The expertise I see from HomeBond is that of avoiding the problem. It is an absolute disgrace. I have no confidence in its expertise because of the way it has handled the issue, which is nothing short of a disgrace. </p>
          <p eId="para_403"> HomeBond was established by the Construction Industry Federation and the Irish Homebuilders Association in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. The Department is not a disinterested party in respect of this organisation and the problem as a consequence. There must be consequences for HomeBond rather than allowing it to participate in the solution when there is a doubt about its credibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> I have been in an estate where apartments have been affected and often it is the people on the upper floors who are most affected. There are practical issues in the upper floors that do not control what happens on the ground floors. In some case, some of those apartments have not been sold. Where the downstairs area is affected by pyrite, the upper floors suffer the consequences. Many other issues need to be dealt with. People talk about stakeholders getting involved. We need to know from a practical point of view what will happen where the builder is in receivership or ceases to exist or if the developer is in NAMA. That is the information we had hoped to get from the report. Much of what was done in the report was necessary but what is missing is the A to Z on when and how the problem can be remediated. We need to know what will be the role of the banks and the lending institutions. They should not be let off the hook as they are central to the problem. They required a certificate from an organisation such as HomeBond or people would not have got a mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">How can they dissociate themselves? It is unfortunate we are at this point. In addition to the threat of the levy, organisations such as the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Insurance Federation and the lending institutions have had an open door to Government. There should be a consequence for these organisations and should they have less access on the issues they want to discuss with Government unless they deal with the issues Government wants them to address. They should face Government sanctions.</p>

          <p eId="para_407">It would be of enormous importance if the Government could show it could take an issue such as this and resolve it to the satisfaction of the people who are affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> The pyrite action group has sought the following: the immediate establishment of a comprehensive and systematic notification, testing and remediation scheme not at their expense; the immediate removal of defective infill from all homes, including the ones in the orange category which are of no value in terms of reselling unless the pyrite, if identified in those homes, is removed; that it be done systematically in blocks rather than in a piecemeal approach; independent and professional co-ordination of the remedial works; independent structural recertification; and a ten or 15 year guarantee once the work is done so that there is not an issue when people subsequently sell their homes or have to insure them. Disgracefully, the insurance industry and mortgage lenders are causing serious problems from that point of view.</p>

          <p eId="para_410">The group also seeks provision of upfront funding. Attention has already been drawn to the €1 billion in the development levy fund and the levy on quarries. However, there needs to be an upfront fund if this is to be dealt with. How can a property tax be applied on something that is falling down around the owners and causing nothing but grief? It is valid to expect a waiver from any household charge or forthcoming property tax. We need to take strong action against those identified as the cause of the problem. We need to close the door on them unless they open the door to those who have been subjected to this horrific problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important issue, which has caused enormous distress to many people. I very much welcome the substance of what the Minister told the House earlier. As someone who was a member of a local authority for 12 years, I share many of the thoughts expressed here today. On countless occasions families have moved into what they regarded as their home - perhaps for life - and experienced some of the difficulties outlined today of cracked doors, dampness, warped floorboards, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> A number of years ago I received a letter from a resident advising me that on the day she got a letter from the housing authority indicating that she was being provided with a home, she thought all her dreams had come true. However, a few years later she was in a nightmare situation with little or no recourse.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> I am mindful of the insurance issues and the role of the insurance industry in such major problems. I welcome the Minister's approach to ensuring that the issue is addressed. It is estimated that between 10,000 and 14,000 houses have been affected. We must remember that those houses are family homes. I can only imagine the frightening experiences many people have in that situation, particularly following such a massive downturn in the economy following the so-called Celtic tiger years when many people bought homes. However, I agree with the Minister that the State should not be liable in such cases. Notwithstanding that, the issue must be addressed and those responsible must be held accountable. I am satisfied that the Minister is trying to do that, particularly in the case of those in such a situation today and also in the event of future occurrences.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> The Minister has said that not only is he considering ways in which the State can enhance and help those 10,000 families affected by this problem, but equally importantly he has made a commitment to ensure regulations are put in place. If such instances arise in future, legislation will be introduced to ensure the industry makes available a fund to carry out such repairs and ease the problems of the families affected. I very much support the sentiments expressed in the House today. It is very important to debate the issue for the sake of those families who in many cases have had the quality of their lives destroyed because of this problem.</p>

        <speech by="#ReginaDoherty" eId="spk_188">
          <from>Deputy Regina Doherty<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_416">I have spoken to people in my constituency who been unfortunate to have come across pyrite in their homes. We are all aware that it is not just about devastation to buildings, but also about devastation to people's lives. Tens of thousands of home owners are suffering the agony of having their homes either disintegrate around them from pyrite-induced heave or because they have become serious fire hazards in consequence. In my part of the constituency, three estates are seriously affected - two in Ashbourne and one in Dunshaughlin. The people living in such houses are innocent victims who bought what they believed were beautiful homes. During the property bubble they found themselves paying exorbitant prices for them. They must now cope with the stress of trying to meet those often unsustainable mortgage payments while their crumbling homes are either in serious negative equity or in most cases worthless.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> Most people now know that pyrite affects a house by cracking walls, rising floors and doors jamming. However, there are also unseen effects, such as the effects on water, gas and sewerage. Some people in my constituency are living in fear of the possibility of gas leaking or exploding in their houses as they go to bed at night. These are not things people should have to worry about in houses that are only seven or eight years old.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> I do not want to mince my words. The complete inaction by those responsible to resolve this situation in recent years has been nothing short of a disgrace. The builders, the quarries, the insurance companies concerned and the vast majority of stakeholders involved have walked away from the issue, disowning the householders and leaving them to face this disastrous legacy completely on their own. The Minister, Deputy Hogan, said today that empathy and sympathy are not sufficient and that what is required is action. We would all agree that emergency intervention is now needed. These people need the necessary work done to rectify their homes. These are not investment houses for most people but homes where families are rearing their children. We need a mandatory levy on the construction and quarry industries to pay for the damage done.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> There is a small upside to this proposal as it would create an estimated €1 billion worth of work for the depressed construction industry and could create 10,000 to 14,000 badly needed construction jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">It is time the funding to commence the remediation works was provided. Following this, a levy should be placed on the construction industry, which would be a fair apportioning of the blame and responsibility for this issue. Obviously, such a levy would have to be long term and mandatory so that it does not crucify the industry in the short term. Financing of the remedial works in this manner is the only way of fixing this problem given our current economic situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> The recent pyrite report was critical of the stakeholders, including the construction, insurance and banking sectors, for their complete reluctance to engage with home owners. The report contains approximately 24 recommendations, including that stakeholders should fund the cost of the repairs, that a resolution board be established, that certification be developed for homes affected by pyrite and that the insurance industry should not penalise home owners in estates where pyrite is identified. Nothing much has been done to date in terms of implementation of those recommendations. The time has come for all involved to step up to the plate. This is crunch time. Those involved need to come together and provide the reparation services or, as stated earlier by the Minister, Deputy Hogan, the Government will be forced to make them do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> Given the building control fiascos that continue to unfold, I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Hogan, on his announcement today that current building regulations, which have allowed dodgy developers to flourish, are to be replaced with a new tough policing regime. This Government is finalising the new building control legislation which will ensure standard regulations are met. The industry has relied on self-certification in terms of architects, engineers, surveyors and builders certifying that new buildings comply with statutory regulatory requirements. That light touch regulatory regime introduced in 1990 by the then Minister, Pádraig Flynn, is outdated and needs to be changed. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Hogan, on doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> There are moral and legal responsibilities involved. It is well past time the issues of responsibility and low standards were tackled so as to prevent this type of fiasco occurring again. We cannot change the past but can help the people involved to move on to a safer future, which is the very least they deserve.</p>

          <p eId="para_424">I pay tribute to the home owners enduring the nightmare of pyrite affected homes and all the suffering that entails, some of whom have come together as Pyrite Action to campaign for justice for themselves and all others experiencing this problem. The local authorities and successive Governments have been slow to respond and keen to wash their hands of any responsibility for the remediation of those homes affected. Fingal County Council was commended in this House for a report in 2007. However, that council has failed to enforce regulation on builders who constructed local authority pyrite affected housing estates in its area, including Mulhuddart. My colleague, Ruth Coppinger, was criticised by council officials and councillors in 2010 for raising this issue on the basis that it was not helpful and would devalue homes. There has been a washing of hands on this issue and a desire to cover up the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> In May 2011, I raised the issue of pyrite with the Taoiseach during Leaders' Questions and pressed for a task force to be established as a matter of urgency. Even then, the Government was not prepared to give a clear answer. A pyrite panel was subsequently established but it took a year to report, which is too long in the circumstances. However, I welcome that the issues laid out in that report are before the Dáil for discussion today. The issues involved are not complex. I reject the pyrite panel's conclusion that this situation could not have been avoided and, as stated by the panel in a letter, that pyrite was a perfect storm, as if it were due to mysterious forces coming from some strange outside source that could not be controlled. It is true that the chemical reaction of pyrite and iron sulphate with moisture and oxygen to create the expansion of the affected rock with incredible force, which causes devastating structural damage to homes, could not be controlled. However, what could and should have been controlled was the arrival of that pyrite infill at a building site, let alone into the homes now affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> It is manifestly not the case that there was no knowledge of pyrite heave prior to 2007, which this report attempts to imply.</p>

          <p eId="para_438">There were warnings in civil engineering literature in Britain 30 years ago with regard to pyrite. Some 25 years ago, there was also a detailed paper entitled "Cause and Significance of Heave at Llandough Hospital, Cardiff - A Case History of Ground Floor Heave due to Gypsum Growth". In 1992, there was an international conference of the construction industry and civil engineers in Bristol at which the implications of ground chemistry for construction were outlined in detailed submissions. Are we expected to believe that major Irish construction companies and suppliers of infill, including Irish Asphalt Limited, Roadstone Limited and Kilsaran Concrete, some of which are billionaire enterprises, had no knowledge of this situation? That does not stand up. Detailed testing should have been carried out, thus avoiding this problem. The reality is that the Building Regulation Advisory Board and the National Standards Authority of Ireland did not apprise themselves of the situation and insist on proper standards and testing.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> What needs to be done is not complex. This is laid out clearly and succinctly in the letter sent by Pyrite Action to Members, including the immediate establishment of a comprehensive and systematic notification, testing and remediation scheme at no expense to home owners. There must be no tip tapping around individual homes as problems come to notice. There must be a comprehensive examination of all homes followed by the immediate removal of defective infill from all homes. The Minister's statement today that he agrees with the panel that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting damage to be remediated simply because there is pyrite in the hardcore is incredible. The Minister also said this has been agreed by the High Court. I do not care what the High Court says. Where there is a risk of pyrite going into expansion mode, that pyrite must be removed. It is crazy to suggest one should wait until the house starts falling apart. If a bomb is found under one's home, should one leave it there hoping it will not explode and take care of the consequences later if it does? This suggestion should be rejected out of hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> It is also recommended that independent and professional co-ordination of remedial works should be carried out, that there should be independent structural recertification and full compliance with building regulations, which is crucial. I will deal with the issue of funding later. The reality is that pyrite is only one awful symptom of the greed that drove the home construction industry in the ten years of the property bubble. The profiteering of that industry led to an entire generation of young working people being shackled with 40 year mortgages at unsustainable rates and afflicted with these problems. The reality is that building regulations were not written by the State or local authorities but by the profiteering construction bosses when they gathered to shower Fianna Fáil with funds at the infamous tent in Galway and subsequently the regulations were simply not implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">In the Dáil in the days of the bubble the parties then in opposition, such as the Fine Gael Party, were silent on what was going on in the construction industry. Look at the fire hazards in which thousands of people live. Priory Hall is only one horrendous example.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> I urge all Members to read the letter sent yesterday by a Priory Hall resident to every Deputy and Minister on the heartbreak these people face. Stephanie Meehan writes that little did they know a year later they would still be asking questions and wondering when, if ever, they will get to go home and where their homes will be. This is the reality. They are the victims of this greed, just like those suffering because of pyrite.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> I am appalled at the reliance of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on the corporate entities responsible for this scandal to put it back together. I will give a simple example.</p>

It is quite ludicrous. The question is who will pay for the pyrite scandal and the remediation of the homes affected. I say all those who had their snouts in the property bubble trough must pay. These are the big builders, the big bankers, the insurance companies and the quarry owners. However, they will now start a process which could go on for years of trying to evade responsibility and paying up. Home owners cannot wait and put their lives on hold while these corporate entities slug it out. We need a public fund immediately. We can put this public fund in place and take civil engineers and construction workers off the dole and put them on a publicly funded scheme to remediate all the homes, and in the meantime begin to take massive levies from these people. We cannot leave home owners waiting for these issues to be decided by these entities. Those leaving the House today must have certainty, a time limit and a schedule of when the work will be carried out. Nothing less is agreeable to us.</p>

          <from>Deputy Patrick Nulty<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_450">I commend the people who have suffered because of the pyrite scandal in my constituency and other areas, particularly in north Dublin, Kildare, Meath and surrounding areas. It is something that can happen to any family and home. Those responsible for this disastrous crisis are the unscrupulous and cowardly people who sold quarry material which was defective and completely inappropriate for family homes. I am very concerned that according to the report only 850 homes require immediate remediation. It is required by far more homes than this. To resolve the pyrite crisis we need the immediate establishment by the Government of an independent and expertly co-ordinated testing and remediation scheme to identify the full extent of the problem and to resolve it.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> It is right and proper that the construction industry pays for the crisis, but families should not have to wait any longer. The Government should fix the problem now and claw back the resources from the construction industry. The Minister stated he would give the construction industry until September to resolve this. It is now mid-October and he is sitting on his hands as usual, doing nothing. Where is he today? Why is he not doing anything about this? The people who have suffered for years because of this demand action today and I commend and salute them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Ryan<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_452">We need action by the Government to tackle the pyrite crisis and we need it urgently. The pyrite panel report can lay the foundations for a path out of the pyrite crisis. It is nowhere near perfect but it is a basis from which to begin to resolve the crisis and this process must begin now. In July, when the much delayed report was finally released, I stated I saw no reason to delay the establishment of a functioning pyrite resolution board.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> The Minister gave stakeholders three months to come up with voluntary proposals to resolve the structural problems in pyrite damaged homes. The past three months have come and gone and to no one's surprise, no voluntary resolution measures are on the table. It is now down to the Minister and it is time to act. It should be funded by a levy on the construction and quarrying industries, which was recommended in the pyrite panel report. This would be a progressive and continual funding source for the resolution board. I note the Minister's intent to take steps after a further ten days to progress this, but it is essential this is not a rolling ten days used by some stakeholders to stall the process. The fund should not be solely based on an industry levy. It needs to be front loaded and based on future funds flow from the levy to resolve this national crisis, and this needs to be done as soon as possible. The State can then recoup these costs in the years and decades ahead from the growing levy fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> There are also the developers, some of whom built the homes of people sitting in the Gallery today, who are still solvent and trading and presumably still earning revenue. There is a well-founded belief that these developers have hunkered down over the past 18 months waiting for the results of the pyrite panel report and have refused to engage actively with affected residents during this period. I know because I have met some of them. These developers need to be forced to cough up. The pyrite panel report states that stakeholders were far too slow in addressing the legitimate concerns of the home owners, often appearing more concerned about defending possible claims against them rather than in remediating the affected dwellings. I acknowledge the reputable developers who are taking their responsibility seriously and are remediating homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> Recommendation 22 of the pyrite panel report deals with home insurance issues and recommendation 22(e) states that "the insurance industry should not withhold standard household insurance cover to dwellings specifically affected by pyrite". Recently I have received a number of representations from constituents refused basic building and contents insurance from reputable blue chip insurance companies for pyrite-related reasons. An e-mail I received this morning states a big insurance company refused building and contents insurance as it was not aware of the knock-on effects of pyrite. Just when people afflicted by issues with pyrite felt they could not be hit any further, they were faced with the refusal of even the most basic form of home insurance. This is a disgrace. Insurance is a basic requirement for selling a home and without it a house can be deemed worthless. These homes were bought in good faith and although the natural order has seen house prices decrease in recent years, pyrite affected homes are at a very real risk of being deemed worthless. We need to act now.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> I wish to refer to suggestions that HomeBond might be involved in some aspect of the resolution process. HomeBond has lost all credibility to deal adequately with this issue, based on the relationship between its members, developers and builders. HomeBond should only re-engage to meet its financial obligations to home owners. It has lost all credibility to actually resolve the structural damage to the homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> The pyrite panel report states that successful implementation of the recommendations will require one body, possibly the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or a body in its aegis, to have responsibility for monitoring, co-ordinating and managing the report's implementation. The report also states that wider Government support and engagement is absolutely critical to the successful implementation of the recommendations. I fully agree with this. I am ready and willing to support practical and visible steps forward as I am sure is every Deputy. However, all of us, in the Government and Opposition alike, request urgency from here on.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> I welcome the comments made by the Minister at the conclusion of his contribution that people should be in no doubt he supports the homeowners in this debate. It is now time to end the debate and proceed with haste to a resolution. People and families throughout the country and in the Gallery today deserve nothing less.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> I wish to read from a note I received today.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">It states :</p>

          <p eId="para_463">This debate has been a long time coming. I was glad to hear the firmness in the Minister's statement today and I will go into the details of that later on in my speech. The families who are sitting in the Visitors Gallery watching this today have all been waiting a long time for some resolution. They want answers. They do not want to just sit here and listen to a debate today. They came here to get a resolution. They are the ones who are living with the pyrite problem day in and day out. They have been tirelessly campaigning for a resolution of this issue. I know from meeting with the pyrite action group the amount of selfless, hard work many people involved in the group carry out to make sure this campaign keeps going.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> The Minister of State and I are very aware of this problem. Unfortunately, it affects many of our constituents in Meath. We both know that estates in places like Ashbourne, Dunshaughlin and other towns are suffering from the pyrite issue. It must be noted that the Minister of State has done a lot of work on this issue but we are not there yet, although we are near a resolution. I find it very difficult to see a family's home being ripped apart by pyrite. I know how important a house is to a family and the pride that families take in their homes. I understand how difficult it is to have a house where windows do not sit in their frames, doors are leaning forward, gaps are appearing all the time and cracks in the walls are so big that one could fit one's hand into them. When one sees these problems in people's houses, one understands the constant fear the families are living in. One understands that when they go to bed or go to work, they worry that there might be another extension of the cracks. It they have children, they might worry about the impact of this on them. We all want to feel safe in our homes, especially families with children, but it must be very difficult when one goes to bed not trusting the very foundations of the house one is living in. This is the harsh reality for people not just in County Meath, but in other counties around Dublin as well. The Minister knows that these people bought their homes in good faith and were unlucky but it is time that this good faith was rewarded.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> Since this problem began, I have been working with the Minister and have submitted a number of parliamentary questions to try to find a resolution. He will know from receiving many questions from me on this issue that nobody will be satisfied by a quick-fix solution. We all agree that when the pyrite panel was announced, a roadmap would provide us with the way forward and a way out of this nightmare for people suffering from this problem. I remember meeting with the pyrite panel in the Custom House on a number of occasions over the past few months, listening to what it was planning to do and giving feedback. Three months after the recommendations of the report and three weeks after the end of consultation with the relevant stakeholders, it is time we gave the people some answers and the Minister gave some of these this afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> I am happy that the terms of reference for the resolution board are currently being drawn up and will be ready next week. I am also happy that a levy is going to be imposed on those who should bear the brunt for the mistakes they have made and not the home owners. It is not fair to expect home owners to pay for this. However, like previous speakers, I am concerned that the levy will not start to bring in money for some time. The worry is that we might not see people getting the resolution they need for many years. Can we look at sourcing other forms of finance for this? We could then use the levy as a way of paying the money back. There are options that the Minister might like to consider, such as looking at the National Pensions Reserve Fund and seeing whether there might be money available from that source. Alternatively, we could go to the European Investment Bank or other sources of finance and ask for a short-term loan which could then be paid off when the levy starts to bring in money.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> There is the opportunity here to create jobs in the construction sector. People will need skilled construction workers to carry out the repair work so we can get some of them off the dole and back into employment. It would also give them a chance to gain new employment afterwards with their renewed skills so there are a number of benefits here. We could help reduce the number of people who are unemployed while at the same time giving resolution to the families in the Gallery who have been waiting a long time for this. I urge the Minister to look at ways of funding this in the short term through a loan so that people can rest assured that we are going to bring about a solution to this nightmare they are living through. </p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_468">We must move quickly. Thankfully, this is not an issue that affects my constituency of Dún Laoghaire. However, I want to show my full solidarity with and extend my support for the thousands of families and householders who are affected by this pyrite disaster and tell them that if there is anything I can do, I will be very happy to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> It is a double whammy for the families and households affected by pyrite. Like the rest of us, they are no doubt the victims in all sorts of ways of an economic crisis and recession caused by the activities of bankers and developers and politicians who failed to regulate those people in respect of activities which pumped a construction bubble and led to this crash. They are affected by all of the things everybody else has been affected by. Many of them are no doubt in negative equity and are struggling to pay their mortgages or are victims of the economic crisis in terms of job and income losses. As if all this were not bad enough, they must also deal with this intolerable situation. As with almost every issue we face, the powers that be - corporate interests, such as the construction industry in this case and insurance companies, and governments - pass the buck between one another, blame everybody but themselves and seek at every turn to avoid taking responsibility. One group of people who are not in any way responsible and are the innocent victims of this situation are the home owners themselves. Yet they are the ones who must deal with the consequences and suffer as a result of the inaction of those who are responsible, whoever they are. It seems to me that the political authorities, those who failed to regulate, HomeBond, the insurance and construction industries and the quarries are all responsible. They did not put in place proper regulation and safeguards and a proper insurance regime so that ordinary people who sought to do nothing more than put a roof over their heads did not find themselves in this intolerable situation. </p>
          <p eId="para_470"> Given the clear unwillingness of those in the construction and insurance industries to assume their responsibility, it is the duty of those elected by the public and whose job is to be the guardians of the public interest to act in this interest and worry about how we pay for it or apportion responsibility afterwards. The victims should not have to wait any longer. They need certainty and safety. I am not an expert on this but what will happen if sulphuric acid is released as a result of pyrite in the foundations or structural damage becomes so serious that serious accidents might happen?</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Must we wait for that before somebody acts? If it happens, will we still have buck-passing, with everybody pointing the finger at one another without action being taken? I hope the Government will not let it come to that pass.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> It should do what the families are asking for, namely, make available upfront a remediation fund to ensure the homes of everybody affected will be subject to remediation immediately. Others who suspect their homes may be affected should have the resources necessary to test for and remove pyrite so the danger of further structural or other damage will be averted immediately. We can worry further down the line about how we make those responsible pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> Although I have not followed the discussion in as detailed a manner as some of the Members from Dublin West, Dublin North and other affected areas, I believe the banks should be brought into play. Almost all of the homes affected were bought for extortionate prices during the economic bubble. The owners are paying extortionate mortgages and many have difficulty paying these. It is even more appalling that people are paying off mortgages if there is pyrite damage. The banks that we own and recapitalised could be directed to offer a write-down or some relief on mortgages of those people affected. In addition, a fund should be put in place. The affected families should receive an immediate, unconditional waiver on all property charges. That they would have to pay these charges is utterly unacceptable given the circumstances in which they find themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> The problem requires a serious regime of regulation, inspection and management of the construction industry to prevent cowboy builders and cowboy insurance companies - such as HomeBond, it seems - so the problem will not recur. A man to whom I spoke at the protest outside was absolutely disgusted that the builder who built his home, which is literally falling apart, is back in business. I cannot mention the builder as the company is subject to legal action. The builder is walking around building sites with a hard hat and building again under a new company name. His family members are on the board of directors and the victim to whom I spoke and many others are left to carry the can for what was done to them. Those who carry on building are not held to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> I commend the pyrite action group and all those in the intolerable, unacceptable circumstances I have described. I appeal to the Government not to delay action on this matter any further. Whatever can be done, however complex or difficult, to force the stakeholders or those responsible to pay for remediation over the longer term should be done but householders should not have to wait over the longer or medium term to have remediation. They have waited long enough and their circumstances are intolerable enough already. Therefore, the Government should put in place the necessary resources to allow the affected householders leave Leinster House today saying the Government did something for the people who elected them.</p>

          <p eId="para_476">I am sharing my time with Deputy Broughan.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> I welcome the report. It is easy for us, as legislators, to do so but the experience has been more painful for those who live in houses affected by pyrite. I hope progress has been made, although it has taken some time. I listened carefully to the Minister's contribution this morning on the publication of the report. I have listened to most of the contributions by the other Members who have spoken and noted that we are at one in agreeing that this matter must be resolved as quickly as possible. As other Members stated, what occurred has been distressing for the affected families. It is not just a Dublin problem as some Members have received mail from other counties about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> I am encouraged by the recommendations in the report. The Minister outlined his frustration with the stakeholders and their lack of co-operation. I was encouraged to hear his views. He has probably had enough and wants to put an end to the problem. That is good and it is what people like myself want. We want progress made fairly and to give due recognition to those who are living with the pyrite problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> I welcome the establishment of the resolution board and the timeframe for it. I hope we may not have to return to this House on very many occasions to discuss this topic. All of us want the problem resolved in the interest of those who have suffered. They did not cause the problem. We all know who created the problem, and this is recognised in the report and the Minister's contribution. I stand with the Minister in dealing with those who created the problem, irrespective of whether the relevant period is ten days or 12 days. Let us solve the problem in the interest of those who have had to live with it.</p>

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_213">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_480">I thank the Technical Group and Deputy Catherine Murphy for allowing me and my Labour Party colleagues to say a few words. I welcomed the publication of the report of the pyrite panel last June. Astonishingly, this report was the first comprehensive response to the worst construction disaster to occur since the foundation of the State and which may have affected tens of thousands of home owners in north and west Dublin and across the mid-Leinster region. I have raised this appalling issue countless times in this Chamber, particularly with former taoisigh Mr. Bertie Ahern and Mr. Brian Cowen and the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. John Gormley. I was almost blue in the face asking Mr. Gormley to take responsibility for this appalling crisis. I first learned of the problem in July 2007 when Drynam Hall, Clongriffin and The Coast estates in my constituency reported appalling damage to homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> In my initial analysis of the pyrite report, I concluded it provided a useful technical analysis of the pyrite disaster as it unfolded since 2007. In the report, it was estimated that more than 12,250 ground floor dwellings in 74 estates across the country could be contaminated by pyrite. Of these, approximately 850 have made a claim with a guarantee provider, and approximately 1,100 have been remediated or are in the process of being remediated, on 12 estates. I remain convinced and have told the Minister, Deputy Hogan, several times in the Dáil that these estimates may be too conservative given the estimates that I received from industry sources in 2007 and 2008. Disastrously, up to 60,000 housing units may be affected. One of the most striking points in the report is that abnormal cracking in dwellings was being investigated as early as 2005, yet, seven years later, many residents are still left suffering and in limbo.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">For example, I heard a few days ago that houses in another large estate in my constituency, Belmayne, might be contaminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> The panel's report contains 24 key recommendations. However, as the Pyrite Action Group has stated, the report is only a "partial solution to the pyrite crisis". A large stumbling block in achieving a resolution has been the appalling lack of engagement by many stakeholders, particularly the construction, quarrying and insurance industries and the banking sector, as noted in the report. I was attending a meeting and did not have a chance to listen to the start of the debate, but I understand the Minister stated he was moving towards what he would consider to be a full and satisfactory engagement with these stakeholders in a resolution process. I learned from my colleague, Deputy Hannigan, that the Minister is proceeding with recommendation No. 14 on the establishment of a resolution board, which would be welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> The Minister promised repeatedly earlier this year that, if there was no action from the stakeholders by 30 September, he would make them take action, force a resolution, levy them or do whatever else was necessary. Must he introduce further legislation or statutory instruments to ensure that this occurs? Will the Government provide upfront funding for a proposed remediation scheme to reflect the State's failings in the matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> When this horrible situation developed in summer 2007, I was directed to consider the province of Quebec in Canada, which had faced this disaster in the late 1990s and early part of this century. I noted that, after two or two and a half years, its Government had spent €70 million Canadian dollars and the federal Government in Ottawa had put up additional funding to resolve the situation. Many new estates along the Montreal shoreline had been affected by disastrously high levels of pyrite in their infill. This approach should be examined and I commend my Labour colleagues on asking that similar action be taken in Ireland. The Minister, Deputy Hogan, might bring it to the attention of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> This situation reflects the lack of regulation of quarries and the abject failure of local authorities to enforce building regulations. We are well past the Minister's 30 September deadline.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> Recommendation No. 2 in section 8.4 of the report proposes a system for clarifying affected housing of red, amber and green, wherein red is a house that requires immediate remediation, amber denotes a house that requires ongoing monitoring and green denotes a house that requires no further action. Some 850 pyrite-affected homes have been designated red and in need of urgent remediation, but the owners of pyrite-affected homes, including the outstanding Pyrite Action Group and Lusk village action group, which regularly brief me, other Deputies and householders in my constituency, strongly believe that all homes with reactive pyrite must be remediated.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> People bought their homes in good faith. They believed they were buying decent products in which they could live. A house is the largest purchase anyone can make. Those people were sold grossly defective products. It is the Minister's job to ensure they will have the same quality housing as those of us who have not needed to deal with this plague. As Deputy Boyd Barrett stated, they should not be expected to live in crumbling and potentially dangerous homes with only an expectation of remediation works if they have been designated in the red category. How will the definition of "significant damage" referred to in the red and amber designations be estimated? Will a system be put in place in the proposed amber category, for example, to conduct the monitoring on an ongoing basis and how will this be paid for?</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> Previously, I asked the Minister to implement recommendation No. 13, which would exempt pyrite-affected homes from any proposed property tax until such time as they were remediated and fully certified. Will the Minister confirm whether he intends to make this case to the Minister for Finance and his Government colleagues? I ask my Labour colleagues to make the case strongly. We are discussing unfinished houses on unfinished estates. In fact, they have not even been started. The idea of imposing a property tax on them is outrageous.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> A key concern of home owners affected by pyrite is the review of structural guarantee policies, as laid out in recommendation No. 22. Home owners believe the structural warranty provider must be independent of developers or any person or company involved in the construction of the homes. The Lusk village working group has rightly described the HomeBond model as "fundamentally flawed", as its core relationship is between HomeBond, its members and the developers. Residents believe that HomeBond is basing applications for pyrite damage on the basis of the assessment of the developers-builders who built the homes in the first place and used the disgraceful infill, and not on an independent and transparent invigilation of the house in question. I am sure the Minister will agree that the role of HomeBond in the pyrite catastrophe has been deplorable. Residents rightly have little or no faith in the competency of that organisation to manage the remediation or any other part of the resolution process.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> I have also raised the disgraceful failure of HomeBond to appear before the Oireachtas environment committee. The Minister responded to my parliamentary question on this matter last week. My colleague, Deputy McCarthy, is the committee's chairman. He should call HomeBond to attend and ensure that it does.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> In a reply to me in a previous debate, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, mentioned the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI's examination of pyrite testing standards and the development of a remediation method statement for the certification of pyrite-affected homes. The establishment of both standards is key to enabling householders to sell their houses if, as any of us might do, they wish to move and give a good product to the householder who moves in after them.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> I hope the Minister will report to the Dáil on the recent Fingal consultation on quarries, a matter I raised with him in a previous debate. Specifically, will he report on notice 216A relating to the quarry at Bay Lane, Kilshane, Dublin 11? Having read the report, the council's planners gave the quarry planning approval, but did not indicate that additional work needed to be done. What about the product it was producing? It is allegedly the source of much of the problem under discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> Recommendation No. 14 on a resolution process is in train, but the owners of pyrite-affected homes have set out a clear and reasonable series of measures that they believe must be adopted to resolve the crisis. The north fringe of Dublin city should be an area of the highest quality housing and commercial development, an asset to our city and a place where people will visit. It is close to the coast and a beautiful area with a high value and many amenities. We want to finish the north fringe to the highest standards. The Minister can help us in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> The home owners' demands include the immediate establishment of a comprehensive notification, testing and remediation scheme to identify and invigilate the full extent of the pyrite problem, the immediate remediation of all pyrite-affected homes, the undertaking of remedial works in co-ordinated blocks of work programmes rather than in a piecemeal <i>ad hoc</i> fashion, the independent and professional co-ordination of remedial works, an independent structural recertification process, the provision of upfront funding and a retrospective waiver of the household charge and forthcoming property taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> Will the Minister address the position of pyrite-affected householders who are buying their homes through an affordable housing scheme, but who are being treated in the same way as fully private home buyers, given the fact the local authority is the vendor? It is astonishing that a number of local authorities bought houses suffering pyrite problems without having carried out basic certification works on quarries or the inspection of homes. The Minister's building regulations should go much further.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> Aside from the banking disaster consequent on the blanket bank guarantee of September 2008, which I am delighted the Labour Party voted against, the pyrite contamination of a large proportion of the yearly housing bubble output from approximately 2002 to 2008 is perhaps the greatest economic disaster in the history of Ireland since Independence. In my constituency, quarry owners, developers and builders bear the primary responsibility, but a grave responsibility also attaches to Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and the State. Unlike the governments of Quebec and Canada, this Government, like the former Minister, Mr. John Gormley, and the Fianna Fáil-Green Government, has failed to discharge its responsibility to our constituents, who have suffered so disgracefully. I hope today will be the starting point of a different course of action that will resolve the crisis.</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_498">I thank all Deputies who contributed to what has mostly been a constructive debate on these issues. I also thank them for the honest way in which they brought to the attention of the House their experiences on behalf of the home owners who we are all trying to help.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> Legitimate questions have been asked about how the problem arose and the length of time that people whose homes have been affected by pyrite have been left without solutions. Mindful of the distressing and challenging situation with which those home owners have been coping, I set up the independent pyrite panel last year to table proposals to assist in providing them with solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">It was a legacy issue that I found in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and although I did not want to meet it I had to take it head on. I am the only Minister to have done something about this by setting up an independent panel to establish once and for all the extent of the problem rather than having figures bandied around like snuff at a wake. We now have a comprehensive report with recommendations I intend to implement.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> The conclusions and recommendations that Mr. Tuohy and his team formulated are very carefully considered, with much consultation having taken place with groups and individuals, including people in the building and construction sector, banks and insurance companies. Everybody was consulted in comprehensive fashion. I thank the public representatives, particularly those in the affected constituencies, for their engagement with the panel and for helping to bring information to its attention before it formulated conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> I agree with the view of the pyrite panel that it would not be reasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting pyrite damage to be remediated simply because there is pyrite in the hard-core filling. Currently, the only recognised remediation method for pyrite-damaged dwellings involves the full removal and replacement of the infill. It is a disruptive and expensive process, although some research is being undertaken into a number of alternative preventative methods that could provide solutions in future. That will not in any way deal with immediate concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> The number of affected dwellings has given rise to some speculation and debate but the methodology used by the panel in arriving at its figures is robust. We could argue all day about the extent of the problem but we are not here to argue about figures rather to discuss helping people with the problem now or those who may have it in the near future. The panel was very clear about where responsibility lies, and I have already dealt with that issue. I want to ensure that in dealing with those who are responsible for the problem, there will be a speedy resolution to the matter in the form of financial contribution to a fund to help homeowners. I have asked Department officials to finalise arrangements for the establishment of this proposed resolution board and to give the terms of reference to stakeholders. They can be examined over the next ten days and if some parties wish to make voluntary contributions, as has been indicated, I would encourage such an act over the next ten days. There is a narrow window of opportunity in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> I assure the House and the people affected by pyrite that I will implement the recommendations as quickly as possible and seek Government sanction to impose a mandatory level to fund the remediation process if stakeholders do not come to the table with the necessary responsibility and proposals to rehabilitate the reputation of the industry which caused these problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> If people want to play politics with the issue, either in the professional or political sphere, that is fine, but I am only interested in finding solutions for homeowners and ensuring that the people who caused this problem will pay for the resolution. I commend the constructive approach of the Pyrite Action Group in helping me to help its members. I will report progress to the House in due course and subsequent to the Government decisions that I will ask to be made with regard to the recommendations of the pyrite panel. I will also bring forward new proposals for building regulations to make up for the problems of the past and to ensure homeowners of the future will not have to suffer in the same way as the people who are affected now, either by pyrite problems or building deficiencies such as those evident in Priory Hall or other areas. I am very much on the side of the consumer and homeowner in this regard and I am determined to ensure the recommendations will be implemented in full.</p>

            <from>Deputy Derek Keating<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_506">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on what is an important issue for this House and the people. The Minister will agree that there is a subculture of activity which is being protected by certain drug lords who are importing massive amounts of drugs from Europe and other continents for what is commonly known as the Irish market.</p>
            <p eId="para_507"> We see from recent information from An Garda Síochána that former members of the IRA, and who is to say but perhaps even current members, are involved in the importation, distribution and selling of drugs and in criminality. The Minister and most Members of this House know the damage these drugs do to our society. The one area for which Members of this House have responsibility is giving good example. I am somewhat concerned about the messages sent occasionally by Members of this House and I refer specifically to Deputy Luke "Ming" Flanagan.</p>
            <p eId="para_508"> I add to illegal drugs and so-called "prescription drugs" the importation of illegal tobacco products which are mixed with toxic and damaging substances. It is often the stepping stone to cannabis use which, in turn, is the stepping stone to illicit drugs such as heroin, amphetamines and other such dangerous and toxic substances.</p>
            <p eId="para_509"> I refer to the purchase of drugs on the Internet, which are often purported to be cheaper, but they do not meet prescription standards. This is a major and growing problem, of which I know the Minister is aware. We do not know much about these drugs. How do we know what they contain? Two professional people in Cork died recently from so-called "bad batches" of drugs. When I was thinking about this last night, I wondered what Deputy Luke "Ming" Flanagan would have to say about such bad batches.</p>
            <p eId="para_510"> I would like to send a message from the House to every youth leader, community leader, parent, young person and citizen who is concerned about this issue that we should co-operate fully with the Garda and the authorities to stamp out this dreadful and heinous crime which is wrecking the lives of many people in every parish, village, town and city in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_511"> I have seen in my constituency and from my experience as a community worker for many years how people are targeted in different ways, in particular through social media, social gatherings, in public houses and even on our streets. Last week I went into Dublin city for the first time in a long time and it was a frightening experience. My wife, who had recently been to New York, was with me and she said that in her experiences over the past couple of weeks, the one occasion in which she was most fearful was in Dublin city last weekend. I say that with great regret.</p>
            <p eId="para_512"> There is so much more I would like to discuss but I fully accept there is a time constraint and I am grateful to the Minister for coming to the House to respond to this topical issue.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_216">
            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_513">I am very grateful to the Deputy for raising these very important matters. It is very important we discuss them and the difficulties in this area in this House. The problem of drug misuse remains one of the most challenging and complex issues faced by modern society. The Government's overall approach to tackling the problem of drug misuse is being pursued in a co-ordinated and integrated way through the national drugs strategy 2009-16.</p>
            <p eId="para_514"> Drugs law enforcement is one element of this response and is a key feature of our overall integrated approach. I can inform the House that An Garda Síochána continues to prioritise organised crime and the sale and supply of drugs as a core focus for 2012 through the Garda Síochána policing plan. Work in this area is led by the Garda national drugs unit which works closely with dedicated divisional and district drugs units on a nationwide basis, together with other national Garda units, including the organised crime unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_515"> Of course, An Garda Síochána also works in close co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners - customs service - and with other drug law enforcement agencies, such as the Irish Medicines Board. Furthermore, An Garda Síochána has developed strong and strategic partnerships at international level which is absolutely crucial because the drugs trade is international and some of the drugs gangs with which we are confronted operate internationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_516"> This approach continues to yield significant results, which I would like to acknowledge. For example, from January to August 2012, Garda figures indicate that a total of 11,263 drug offences were detected, with 9,743 related arrests made. Furthermore, with regard to drug seizures, drugs with an estimated value of €59.3 million were recorded during the first six months of the year. They were very substantial drugs seizures. This seizure data do not include a number of significant seizures made at the end of that six month period, which remain the subject of further analysis, nor do they include some very recent large seizures which will appear in the next official statistics when they become available.</p>
            <p eId="para_517">For example, the figures do not include the largest ever inland seizure of cocaine in the jurisdiction, which was made in the west Dublin and Kildare areas last June as part of a joint operation involving both the Garda and the customs authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_518"> As the Deputy has highlighted the drugs market and the consumption of drugs is a dynamic phenomenon and trends emerge from time to time with users often trying different combinations of drugs, which sometimes involves the mixing of legal and illegal drugs, as well as various modes of consumption. I agree with him that all Members should be categorical in their condemnation of drug use and of drug trading and should not seek in any way to suggest this is a healthy option for any individual in this State nor should they seek to diminish the criminality involved in the supply and sale of drugs. The emergence in recent times of large scale cannabis cultivation sites, the increase in the consumption of new psychoactive substances and the increasing illicit trade in medicines are particular features of the current drugs landscape we are facing.</p>
            <p eId="para_519"> Our drugs law enforcement authorities remain cognisant of this and proactively tackle new features of the drugs trade as they emerge. Operation Nitrogen is a Garda operation which continues to be successful in identifying and dismantling cannabis cultivation sites throughout the country. For example, during 2011, more than 500 so-called grow houses were located during intelligence led operations resulting in more than 26,000 cannabis plants with an estimated value of €10.5 million being seized. I expect those actions of the Garda would be welcomed by every Member, including Deputy Luke "Ming" Flanagan, who was referred to by the Deputy. This remains a key focus of the Garda's drug enforcement efforts and recent successes in this respect include the detection of major cannabis production sites in Navan, County Meath and in Malin, County Donegal with related arrests.</p>
            <p eId="para_520"> I refer to an issue of enormous importance, which is a great danger to people. The Deputy drew particular attention to the emerging problems we are seeing with the illegal trade in prescription drugs which has been acknowledged as an increasing problem being experienced across the country. Our law enforcement agencies are also vigorously responding to this problem as demonstrated by the recent successes achieved by the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, Revenue's customs service and An Garda Síochána through their involvement in Operation Pangea V. This Interpol-led operation, which was conducted between 25 September and 2 October 2012, involved an international week of law enforcement action targeting the online sale of counterfeit and illegal medicines throughout Europe. In Ireland, the joint operation by the IMB, the customs service and Garda led to the detention of more than 120,000 tablets-capsules with an estimated value in excess of €375,000. The number of packages detained during the operation in Ireland by the customs service was 282 while 11 search warrants were executed resulting in four arrests. It is important to note the substances seized included products for weight loss and erectile dysfunction as well as mood stabilisers. People who acquire counterfeit drugs may find themselves with nothing better than a placebo or buying the equivalent of Smarties in their local confectionery shop and they can, in some circumstances, place their lives at serious risk. They should not engage in these purchases from websites or from individuals on street corners.</p>

            <p eId="para_521">I would love to think the Minister's contribution will be well received throughout the country. In this day and age, it is often difficult to sift through media reports to find good news. This is good news because of the co-ordinated response of all those involved, particularly when one considers the successes. I had details of some of these before I came to the House but I was not informed about the full extent of the success. We ware having enormous success dealing with this scourge but we must remain vigilant and reach out to all corners of our society to ensure we are all focused and engaged on this issue and continue to co-operate with the Garda drugs surveillance unit and drugs squad, Interpol and those working in education and so on. If the Minister is saying the resources are in place to yield that success, I am happy to support him in the work he is doing. It is incumbent on all 166 Members to support him and the authorities in this work.</p>

            <p eId="para_522">I appreciate the Deputy raising the issue. I refer back to the issue of counterfeit drugs and medicines. There is not adequate public consciousness yet of the dangers of buying prescription drugs through websites when one does not know what one is being sold and what is its composition. If it is not a placebo, the product could comprise substances other than what one believes it to contain, which places one's health or life at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_523"> This highlights the benefit of being part of the European Union and co-operation in the justice area. Operation Pangea V had extraordinary results. It was a dedicated, focused operation across the EU over a one-week period, which led to the seizure of 120,000 counterfeit tablets and capsules in Ireland that might otherwise have been consumed by people in this State who believed they were required for their health. They related to weight loss, mood and erectile dysfunction issues. People would have taken these drugs without knowing their content or the consequences of taking them or knowing that they were counterfeit.</p>
            <p eId="para_524"> Because it was a European wide focused operation, in that week, 18,000 websites selling these pharmaceutical products were closed.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kevin Humphreys<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_525">I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topical issue. I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State but I am disappointed that the Minister for Health is not present to take this issue. Ten months ago, I tabled a parliamentary question about this issue because it was leading to a revenue loss to the health service. According to the reply I received, the loss was estimated at €76 million. My colleague, Deputy Conway, was informed at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children in September by Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE, that the figure owed then was in the region of €60 million while last week, in reply to Deputy Kieran O'Donnell at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, it was indicated that €74 million was outstanding.</p>
            <p eId="para_526"> I asked the Minister in January, which is ten months ago, what disciplinary action, if any, could be taken and he indicated at the time that he wanted the issue addressed under the Croke Park agreement. The Department indicated there was no contractual requirement that medical consultants should sign off on health insurance claim forms. Is there a contract with bus drivers to make sure bus fares are collected? There seems to be one rule for high paid public sector workers and another for those on more modest incomes. Under the 1999 contract, a consultant must co-operate with his employing authority for the collection and maintenance of fees and, under the 2008 contract, consultants are expected to work within the framework of the hospital, agency and HSE service plan. The delay in claiming the fees due is having a major effect on cash flow in our hospitals. While I acknowledge the Minister managed to secure an agreement recently that will lead to substantial savings in the State's drugs bill and the Bill currently going through the House to deal with generic substitution and reference pricing must be commended, I am disappointed there has been little or no action on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_527">What action has been taken to ensure claims are paid promptly and signed off by highly paid consultants? Was it part of the recent discussions with the IMO and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association? If so, will it be implemented? It is unclear if the deal will come into force. There was media speculation on when exactly the matter will come before the Labour Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_528"> Yesterday evening, we had a debate about home help. Today, we are discussing a topic I raised over ten months ago concerning €74 million. Consultants need to get a grip of themselves and carry out the job they are employed to do. It is part of their responsibility to ensure the hospital service in the HSE is properly funded. For them to shrug their shoulders and say they will not sign means hospital beds lie empty, wards close and people in need do not receive hospital treatment they require and deserve. I hope the Minister of State carries this message loud and clear. It is no longer acceptable in this country for highly paid consultants not to sign off on insurance forms.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_529">I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly. I thank Deputy Humphreys for raising this important issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_530"> The HSE and voluntary hospitals recoup a considerable amount from private health insurance companies in return for private and semi-private treatment services provided to patients with private health insurance cover. However, lengthy delays can often occur between the discharge of patients and the receipt of payment from health insurance companies. This has led to an unacceptably high level of debtor days and months with a significant amount in fees outstanding. As of the end of September 2012, €204 million was due to the HSE from private health insurance companies in respect of treatment provided to private patients. Of the €204 million, €100 million relates to claims under preparation in hospitals, and €104 million relates to claims submitted to insurers which are either being processed or are pending.</p>
            <p eId="para_531"> Delays in consultants signing off on health insurance forms is one of the issues affecting the claims collation process in public hospitals. Of the €100 million under preparation in hospitals, €73 million relates to delays in consultant sign-off. The Minister has instructed the HSE to address the issue as a matter of urgency and the HSE has directed hospitals to bring down the value of claims awaiting consultant action. Hospitals are also targeting the highest value claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_532"> The issue was also addressed by health service employers and the two consultant representative bodies at the Labour Relations Commission. An important feature of the proposals agreed between the parties was a commitment on the part of all consultants to expeditious processing and signing of claims for submission to private health insurers. Consultants will be required to complete and sign private insurance forms within 14 days of receipt of all the relevant documentation and to co-operate with the secondary consultant scheme, whereby a secondary consultant involved in a case can sign the claim form if the primary consultant has not signed it within a reasonable timeframe. They will also be required to support the implementation of electronic claim preparation.</p>
            <p eId="para_533"> Health service management is proceeding with implementation of this and other measures in the coming weeks, having regard to the relevant provisions in the public sector agreement. In addition to addressing delays in consultant sign-off, the HSE has also awarded a contract for the phased roll-out of an electronic claims management system in 11 HSE sites. The system will address the many deficiencies of the current paper-based process, will streamline the claims collection process and will ensure standardised work practices are implemented across hospitals. The system is live in six hospital sites with a further three to come on board by mid-November.</p>
            <p eId="para_534"> It is also worth reflecting on the intensive work that has been ongoing between my Department and the main private health insurers to reach an agreement in principle on an accelerated income collection process, which will generate an additional once-off cashflow benefit in the region of €125 million in 2012. The accelerated payment arrangements are at an advanced stage, with the detail of the legal agreements between the HSE and insurers expected to be finalised very shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_535"> The Minister has emphasised to the HSE the importance of addressing the issue of income collection, in conjunction with the insurers, in order that the maximum resources possible are available to the health system. He believes the range of measures I have outlined will contribute to improving the collection of income outstanding to the public hospital system.</p>

            <p eId="para_536">I thank the Minister of State for his answer and I hope what he has outlined will happen. Some ten months have passed since I raised the issue and it seems that, from the response of the Minister of State, we are getting some action. Is it not a shame it took so long to get consultants to pull into line? More than 2,200 consultants work in public hospitals. They use beds for private patients and draw down enormous salaries from private practice with questionable practices. Are their incomes subject to PRSI? We must examine the practices and methods of consultants in our public hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_537"> I welcome the payment systems outlined and we must wait and see if they are delivered upon. This is very unfortunate. Shame on the consultants that the Government had to go to such lengths to ensure the income stream and cashflow of our hospitals were guaranteed. These men and women walk the corridors of the hospitals and see the shortfall in income yet they delayed on signing off on significant sums that would make a substantial difference to the hospitals of the State. I welcome the response. I will be monitoring the topic closely and I will check whether the target of 14 days is achieved. I will seek further information on the practices of consultants in the public hospitals service. I want to see this saving and cashflow delivered quickly.</p>

            <p eId="para_538">I think Deputy Kevin Humphreys. I agree wholeheartedly that these are significant sums of money that could be expended on front-line services but they are held in abeyance because of a lack of will from certain ranks within the health sector and, perhaps, bureaucratic difficulties associated with the payment process. The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, has prioritised the solution to the problem. I referred to the opportunity for a second consultant to sign off on an insurance claim, the electronic claims management system, which will shortly be in place in 11 sites, and the ongoing work with health insurers to set up an accelerated income collection process. One can only conclude from the response that these measures will be put in place quickly and will serve to address the issue. I have a funny feeling that, this time next year, we will not have such a substantial amount of money outstanding.</p>

            <p eId="para_539">I will not be long-winded or engage in a long rant. The purpose behind the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, and the back to education scheme is to take some of the thousands of people on the dole queue, who are unemployed and have no prospects, and give them an opportunity to re-educate themselves and reskill in an attempt to return to the workforce re-energised and with a new skill set. There must be criteria for every initiative offered by every Department but the strictness with which we adhere to the admissions policies for the VTOS and back to education scheme is counter-productive and goes against the spirit of the schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_540"> I will give two brief examples. One gentleman in my constituency is three days short in terms of the stamps needed for VTOS. He was turned away and told to go home and sit on his bum for another year and return next year. Another man was 12 days short and is in the same position. Apart from being hugely frustrating, it is crazy that an official of any Department, particularly the Department of Social Protection, would instruct people actively pursuing retraining initiatives to go home and sit on their bums for a further 12 months before they would be eligible the following year.</p>
            <p eId="para_541">It is criminal.</p>
            <p eId="para_542"> I ask the Ministers for Education and Skills and Social Protection to come up with some sort of creative mechanism so that people who are far outside the qualifying number of contributions but who are genuinely interested in retraining and reskilling can qualify for schemes, perhaps by buying extra contributions. We need some sort of creative mechanism so that the initiatives the Government has offered can be made available to those who are genuinely enthused by those initiatives and can avail of courses.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ciarán Cannon<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_543">I thank Deputy Doherty for raising this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_544"> My Department funds a range of further and higher education and training courses and programmes which are open to the unemployed. All further education and training courses are delivered free of charge to welfare recipients.</p>
            <p eId="para_545"> The vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, is one of a range of full-time further education and training options available to adults who wish to return to education. VTOS is targeted at unemployed persons over 21 years of age. Its primary target groups are the longer-term unemployed, the low-skilled and the disadvantaged. It aims to give participants education opportunities that will develop and prepare them to progress to employment or on to further education opportunities leading to employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_546"> There are almost 6,000 places available under VTOS, some of which are provided by VECs through the post-leaving certificate, PLC, programme. To be eligible to participate in a course under VTOS, a person must be over 21 years of age and in receipt of a specified social protection payment for at least six months at the start of the course. Those eligibility criteria are specified to ensure that courses delivered under VTOS are targeted at the longer term unemployed. The criteria help ensure that the 6,000 places can be prioritised for people who are longer-term unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_547"> While VTOS is designed to target the longer-term unemployed, I can tell the Deputy that there is a range of other courses and programmes available that are open to all unemployed people. I mentioned PLC courses. Unemployed people who want to do a PLC course may be able to avail of the back to education allowance, BTEA, which is funded by the Department of Social Protection. If a person is more than three months unemployed, they can access the BTEA and in this way continue to receive income support while engaging in full-time further education. Alongside full-time further education, there are full-time training courses provided by FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_548"> In addition to these full-time options, there are a range of part-time further and higher education and training opportunities available. In the further education sector, these opportunities are delivered under the back to education initiative, BTEI. Attendance at BTEI courses generally does not affect a person's social protection entitlement as they are part-time and the person is still available for work.</p>
            <p eId="para_549"> With regard to the Deputy's suggestion, there are no plans to change the qualifying periods for VTOS payments. Buying days would be a matter for the Department of Social Protection and I understand that there are no proposals to allow those who are unemployed buy any days they might be short, in terms of the qualifying criteria for BTEA or any other programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_550"> I would encourage anyone who wishes to return to education or training or is considering their options to contact their local VEC or FÁS office or one of the new Intreo offices that are appearing throughout the country. They might contact their local higher education institution or check with their local welfare office, if they are in receipt of a welfare payment, and they will receive high quality advice and guidance as to the education options available to them and that they might pursue.</p>

            <p eId="para_551">I appreciate the Minister of State taking the time to attend the House to answer my query, somewhat. However, with respect to him, I must inform those who write ministerial responses that I already know what the VTOS scheme is, its purpose, the criteria for taking part in it and how one applies for it. The Minister of State has read a page and a half of information that everyone in the House is well aware of.</p>
            <p eId="para_552"> Some part of the VTOS scheme is not working. People in my constituency have been told they are 12 days or three days short and should go home and sit around for the next 12 months. I asked if some mechanism be found to allow a person to do the VTOS course he wants to do, or some other VTOS or back to education course. The answer in the last two paragraphs of the Minister of State's statement is effectively to say sorry, that is not possible. I get that and I will have to find some other creative way to assist these gentlemen. </p>
            <p eId="para_553"> The Minister of State indicated that other options are available. The reason these people arrived in my office is that they were told to go home and sit around for the next year and wait for the course to be provided again. That is not good enough. </p>

            <p eId="para_555">The Deputy is clearly aware of the conditions and criteria applying to the VTOS scheme. There are almost 450,000 people on the live register. About 100,000 of those are now long-term unemployed. The longer they remain unemployed the more unemployable they become. My Department and the Department of Social Protection has, therefore, focused on that cohort of people who are the most vulnerable and have the longest journey to make back to education and employment. That is why the VTOS provision is targeted at that cohort and we are clear cut and unambiguous as to who we support and the criteria a person must satisfy in order to access that support.</p>
            <p eId="para_556"> If the Deputy e-mails me the details of the two individuals to whom she refers, I will work with her in making them aware of other options. I am confident there are other options they can avail of. They are not required to sit at home twiddling their thumbs for the next 12 months. I will certainly assist the Deputy in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_557"> I am also confident that if they were to visit their local VEC, FÁS or Department of Social Protection office they would receive guidance and counselling as to the direction they should take. There is no requirement on anyone to sit on their hands for a year awaiting the opportunity of training or further education.</p>

            <p eId="para_558">Last Monday, Tourism Ireland announced that it has acquired the <i>Ireland.com</i> domain name from<i> The Irish Times</i>, in a deal worth almost €500,000. In doing so, Tourism Ireland has greatly inconvenienced as many as 15,000 <i>Ireland.com</i> domain users who have been told they are about to lose their e-mail addresses. The Minister may be able to provide us with more information on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_559"> The users who have been in contact with me have indicated that from 7 November people who have had @ireland.com as part of their e-mail address will have to change it. It is imperative that the Minister act to ensure that Tourism Ireland's purchase of the <i>Ireland.com</i> domain address does not deprive these customers of a valuable service. Instead of shutting down the domain address, the service should be enhanced and promoted. People who have been promoting Ireland through this address should not be punished as a result of the purchase by Tourism Ireland, ultimately the State, of the domain address.</p>
            <p eId="para_560"> There are many benefits of the @ireland.com element of an e-mail address. It has been used as a service by many within the Irish diaspora. I know many people who are proud to have the element @ireland.com, and the resource could be expanded and used as a tool to encourage people to come to Ireland as part of The Gathering. Many people use the element in their e-mail address, and more would do so if they were aware of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_561"> I hope Tourism Ireland's purchase will lead to an enhanced service being made available. It has huge advertising potential for Tourism Ireland and I hope we will hear more about that.</p>
            <p eId="para_562"> I have received correspondence from a number of concerned e-mail account holders who have been told their service will be withdrawn before Christmas. It is important that some clarity be brought to the situation at the earliest possible opportunity to allay any fears. There are others who, if the service is not to be continued, will have to change stationery and find another service provider. Finding a new service provider may not be expensive but the ancillary costs of having stationery re-printed would be a nuisance and an annoyance.</p>
            <p eId="para_563">As the Minister knows, these types of operators, some of them with only two or three staff, are the last people we wish to inconvenience at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_564"> Clearly, two groups have the most to lose. One is the diaspora, and the huge opportunity that exists there, and the other is small and medium enterprises, some of them single-owner type operations, which will be put to considerable expense if they cannot retain that e-mail address. I appeal to the Minister to examine the real potential here. I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, is present too. He keeps in regular contact with many in the diaspora, probably by e-mail in some cases, and he will be very aware of the importance of its retention. Hopefully, we can find a solution here. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response. I will try not to be critical until I have at least had an opportunity to hear it.</p>

            <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Leo Varadkar)<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_565">First, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which I am aware has received some media coverage in recent days. However, the decision to purchase the domain name <i>Ireland.com</i> from <i>The Irish Times</i> was an operational decision by Tourism Ireland and its board. Tourism Ireland is a North-South body that is jointly funded by the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive. The issue of accommodating existing @ireland.com e-mail address holders in as helpful and fair a manner as possible is clearly the responsibility of <i>The Irish Times</i> and one over which I have no responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_566"> With regard to the decision to purchase the domain name from <i>The Irish Times</i>, I understand that Tourism Ireland firmly believes that having a simple domain name like <i>Ireland.com</i> will have significant benefits. Primarily it is felt that given the ease of recognition and memorability, the new domain name will deliver greater "stand out" for Ireland around the world. From a tourism perspective, Tourism Ireland believes the move is timely for a number of reasons. First, it is at present redeveloping its suite of websites with the aim of capitalising on the ever increasing importance of the Internet for the planning of holidays by potential tourists worldwide. Second, we are in the advanced stages of preparations for The Gathering Ireland 2013, Ireland's biggest ever tourism initiative. Having a simple domain name like <i>Ireland.com</i> can only help in projecting an even stronger online presence to achieve our ambitious targets for visitor numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_567"> It is also worth putting on the record the business case advanced by Tourism Ireland for purchasing the domain name. I understand that the cost involved was just under €0.5 million. While this is a considerable amount of money in the current economic climate, Tourism Ireland is in no doubt that the cost represents very good value. The rationale for this belief includes the fact that at present <i>Ireland.com</i> is a competitor for search engine traffic. In other words, when people overseas are searching online for information on holidays in Ireland, they may be directed towards this site rather than existing Discover Ireland sites. Accordingly, the acquisition will be beneficial in accessing that traffic.</p>
            <p eId="para_568"> Second, it is believed that the simplicity and directness of <i>lreland.com</i> will facilitate an increase in direct traffic and will also help capture increased organic search engine traffic. Furthermore, Tourism Ireland's business case for the project identified that cost savings will also be achieved through a reduction in its paid search engine optimisation activity. In this regard, a proportion of Tourism Ireland's marketing budget each year is devoted to ensuring that the Tourism Ireland website is advertised on search engine sites such as Google, Bing or Yahoo. In fact, Tourism Ireland's projections show that the costs of the acquisition will be fully recouped in just over three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_569"> Reverting to the issue of the existing e-mail subscribers, I understand that <i>The Irish Times</i> has contacted all @Ireland.com subscribers to advise them that the e-mail service will be discontinued from 7 November 2012 in terms of sending or receiving messages. Users will, however, be able to access their account until 7 December for the purpose of transferring any data currently saved on their account. To help users to move easily to a new provider, I am informed that <i>The Irish Times</i> has a helpline in operation from 8 a.m to 8 p.m. and there is also a step-by-step guide available on the <i>Ireland.com</i> website to assist its customers with the transition.</p>
            <p eId="para_570"> In conclusion, my primary focus in tourism is obviously to ensure that we do everything we can to grow visitor numbers in the years ahead and achieve our ambitious targets in this regard. At the same time, I share the Deputy's desire to ensure that nobody is inconvenienced by the purchase of the domain name as discussed. However, Tourism Ireland only bought the domain name, <i>www.ireland.com</i><u>,</u> and not the customer database of e-mail subscribers. Therefore, any decisions relating to the e-mail service and the matter of accommodating existing users are entirely the responsibility of <i>The Irish Times</i>. I hope the efforts it is making to facilitate a smooth changeover for its clients will continue right up to the transition date.</p>

            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_571">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive outline of the background to what happened. I fully support what Tourism Ireland has done. It was excellent use of public moneys to purchase this domain name. Clearly, it was ludicrous to have <i>Ireland.com</i> in the ownership of an agency that does not have the promotion of Ireland within its remit. We have seen where similar cases occurred with other brands as a result of how domain names were handed out in the early years. The Minister and I are at one on that. I also accept that Tourism Ireland might not be in a position to purchase the database of subscribers. It was probably prudent to opt for just the domain name.</p>
            <p eId="para_572"> However, there is nothing of which I am aware that would prevent Tourism Ireland from establishing as a service provider, providing e-mail accounts and e-mail addresses as an enhanced component of the ownership of that domain name. Without purchasing the subscriber database, it could certainly offer the service, with the <i>Ireland.com</i> address, to those who wish to have it. Migration would take place naturally, with no additional cost to the State. There would be an added ability to promote the domain name if it was also offering it as an e-mail address. Many of the other search engines already do so, such as Google with gmail. It is a cost to them but they see it as an essential component of attracting people into what is their community. They do it quite successfully.</p>
            <p eId="para_573"> There is a very strong argument for Tourism Ireland, which is now offering a new portal or base for the consolidation of its web presence and the capacity to advertise to a broader audience, to add this service provision of e-mail. It is a loss leader for most of the search engines. Yahoo, Google and all the others do it. If Tourism Ireland thinks this through, it will see the benefits. I ask the Minister to raise this issue with the agency. If it would require an additional allocation of resources, I will certainly not criticise the Minister or Tourism Ireland. I would fully support it.</p>

            <p eId="para_574">I appreciate the Deputy's comments and concerns. I agree that <i>Ireland.com</i> is a good purchase for Tourism Ireland. It will be in public ownership, or at least in the ownership of a North-South body. A lady in the United States whom I know quite well and with whom I stayed for some time has an <i>Ireland.com</i> address, and she asked me what .ie meant at the end of all my e-mail addresses. In America all addresses are X, Y or Z.com and having the domain name <i>Ireland.com</i> in the ownership of Tourism Ireland is very valuable. The only concern that might arise is that when <i>Ireland.com</i> becomes a tourism portal and website, allowing anybody to have that address might cause people to believe they are somehow associated with official Ireland, the Government or tourism when they are not. However, perhaps that is not a reasonable concern. Everybody knows that if one's address is gmail, it does not mean one works for Google. I understand what the Deputy means.</p>
            <p eId="para_575"> I do not know what can be done in this space. The duty of care lies with <i>The Irish Times</i> because only the domain name was bought, not the customer database. I will discuss it with the chief executive of Tourism Ireland to see if there is a way to facilitate people retaining those addresses, provided it does not prejudice the purchase of the domain name.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" as="#Minister_for_Transport,_Tourism_and_Sport" eId="spk_232">
            <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_577">The CIE group is struggling with a very difficult financial situation. On 24 July last, the Government decided to provide additional funding of €36 million to CIE to ensure that the companies could continue to operate for the rest of 2012. This would bring the total subvention for this year to €278 million, higher than the subvention level for 2010 and the fifth highest level of subvention ever.  At this very difficult time for the public finances, it was not easy to find a large amount of additional funds. It involved very difficult decisions in terms of having to divert funding from other very worthwhile and important projects and initiatives and imposing sacrifices on others. </p>
            <p eId="para_578"> To date, none of the additional €36 million subvention has been paid over to CIE, but up to €36 million is still available.  I want to see significant progress being made on the development of a realistic, sustainable and robust business plan by CIE to deal with the current economic realities; cost reductions with the CIE group and employee support for same; the sale of non-core assets; and the securing of new credit facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_579"> At the time of the announcement it appeared that these were advanced but unfortunately, despite a lot of hard work and best efforts, insufficient progress has been made to date. The Minister of Sate, Deputy Kelly, and I are meeting regularly with the chairman and senior executives  of the CIE companies and have met with union representatives as well. These various avenues are currently being explored and may reduce the need for the level of funding required.</p>
            <p eId="para_580"> Ultimately, however, it needs to be understood that if required, the additional funding for this year only provides a very short breathing space to CIE. It is essential that the management and staff in the CIE companies use this time productively to discuss and implement proposals to cut costs that can help to address the serious financial position in which the CIE group finds itself. </p>

            <p eId="para_581">Does this mean that, in the event of CIE being unable to make the saving the Minister is seeking, €36 million is still available that has been reassigned from the projects mentioned and not spent on the original plans? I asked the Minister before what projects this money was taken from but I have yet to get an answer.</p>
            <p eId="para_582"> How does the Minister see CIE being able to make the necessary changes within the next two months if it is to come under €36 million? The Minister said he has not cut off the funding but he has put it up to CIE to find the savings in an exceptionally short timeframe. Depending on the strength of the Minister's position, this could spell disaster for public transport. CIE has cut services in rural and urban areas to balance its books and that is impacting on the company's ability to maintain its comprehensive network. Iarnród Éireann and Dublin Bus face a deficit of €40 million this year. While it is always possible to make savings, the scale the Minister is demanding makes it very difficult. It is my view the only way this can be dealt with is to increase fares and reduce services. When the Minister was in opposition, he hit out at fare increases, and he was right to do so, but he seems to have changed his mind.</p>

            <p eId="para_584">The €36 million is still available and to the extent that I can, I will not allow public transport to collapse. The money is available but it will only get the companies to the end of the year. I will not have enough money next year and €36 million will not solve the problems of the company next year. In the past, Governments could come up with more money if it was needed but that is not how the country works anymore. We are part of an IMF-troika programme and there are spending ceilings that cannot be broken. This year, I might be able to take money from one pocket and put it into the other, rob Peter to pay Paul and kick the can down the road, but I am running out of pockets and I am running out of road. If we do not see progress on the four issues I have mentioned, I will not be able to find the money to keep the companies operating by the middle to end of next year. Then, there will be no choice and public transport will fail. I do not expect CIE to find €36 million by 31 December, but it must make progress on those four areas so it does not require an additional subvention next year because I will not have it.</p>

            <p eId="para_586"> My Department and the National Transport Authority are working with public transport operators to increase the efficiency and attractiveness of existing public transport services.  We are not in a financial position to make significant investment in our public transport network but we can get a better return from our existing public transport system, through targeted investment, better use of resources and by using smart technology to make public transport more responsive and user friendly.</p>
            <p eId="para_587"> My Department works with the NTA to improve smarter travel, with the NTA providing funds to local authorities in the greater Dublin area and regional cities, while my Department provides direct funding in the other counties and towns. In addition to NTA funding, we are investing €65 million in sustainable transport over the next five years, the majority of which will be invested in cities and towns around the country under key programmes such as smarter travel areas and active travel towns. </p>
            <p eId="para_588"> Targeted investment is essential in these financially straightened times.  An example is the Luas BXD project to link the LUAS lines. The Government has also continued to invest in the bus companies, including the recent decision to purchase 80 new buses for Dublin Bus at a cost of €25 million and 60 new buses for Bus Éireann in 2011 at a cost to the Exchequer of €18.5 million. Considerable funding has also taken place in recent years on measures to make public transport more attractive such as the leap card, real time passenger information, automatic vehicle location and providing Wi-Fi. Given the pressure on the public finances, there is no possibility of additional funding by the Exchequer and I expect that subvention levels will reduce over the next two years.</p>

            <p eId="para_589">I have said many times that we have one of the lowest subventions for public transport in Europe and the Minister has agreed. Even last year, CIE received €316 million and this year the amount is €242 million. Even with the €36 million, it is still only €278 million. If we continue to cut like this, we will hit vital services even more. We have increased fares and the cost of yearly tickets by 10% in the last month. That will further discourage the use of public transport and it penalises those who continue to use it. It does not make sense.</p>
            <p eId="para_590"> There have been cuts across services in rural and urban areas. The 19 and 19A services in the Glasnevin area were combined into one service. Dublin Bus and CIE are passing the buck on responsibility for these decisions. It is down to the fact that not enough money is being made available. We talk about smarter travel but we must invest in it. I welcome the fund of €65 million that the Minister has made available but what way will that spread out? Will it address the route shortages? Are we going to hit the main lines? The Minister mentioned the Luas and we all know the BXD is being started but we cannot continue to cut.</p>

            <p eId="para_591">If the €36 million is required, the PSO will be €278 million, the fifth highest subsidy ever in the history of the State and we must remember that. The subvention increased rapidly in the boom but the subvention of €278 million will still be the fifth highest subvention in the history of the State. There are many people in many sectors who would like 2012 to be the fifth best year in their history. Many schools, hospitals and so on would happily be in the same position as CIE now.</p>
            <p eId="para_592"> When people say subvention in Ireland is relatively low, they do not take into account that it is not just the PSO subvention. There is also the railway safety programme, which involves over €100 million in grants to Irish Rail, and there are capital grants such as the €30 million spent on new buses.</p>
            <p eId="para_593">In most countries the public transport company gets a single funding line and the comparisons that suggest that subvention in Ireland is low do not tell the full picture. When one takes into account the very substantial capital grants that go to the public transport companies, subvention is still lower than the European average but not lower by as much as people think. Most European countries need higher subvention because they have underground railway lines. They have high speed railways between their cities. As we do not have any of that, naturally we should not need the same level of subvention as those countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_594"> It is important to point out that Luas gets no subvention whatsoever. It is a publicly owned privately operated transport system and the only one in the State that does not require subvention and, perhaps, is a good model in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_595">It is very disappointing, particularly following the launch of the 80 new buses and a further 60 for the industry, that we are going back to CIE and Dublin Bus to say that assets will have to be sold, whether older buses or otherwise, to make up the shortfall in moneys. There is a need to be more imaginative. Is there any way of addressing the fuel issue and looking at where cheaper fuel can be got or other means because there must be savings somewhere?</p>

            <p eId="para_596">There are things that can be done over time. Certainly a move to compress natural gas as a fuel over time would save money. We are in an emergency and whatever is done has to be done quickly. That will involve the sale of assets and other cost savings. Luas is an interesting model. Luas should be expensive to run because it involves electrics, tracks and expensive rolling stock, yet it seems to be able to operate without the need for a State subvention.</p>

            <p eId="para_598">This question relates to the remuneration of the chief executive officer of Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company.

            <p eId="para_602">I thank the Minister for his reply. I welcome the fact the representatives of the harbour company will appear before an Oireachtas committee. The anger felt by the workforce in the harbour company is extreme. Five members of staff were made redundant at the beginning of 2011, the chief executive officer is seeking pay cuts of between 30% and 40% from the workforce and the entire harbour police are subjected to disciplinary proceedings, essentially in disputes which seem to arise from the fact that the management is putting huge pressure on the workforce and appear bent on driving them out. All of this is happening at a time when, as the Minister has acknowledged, the chief executive officer has bumped his salary up to €188,000 per year. He also receives director's fees of €12,000 per year and unspecified payments of €40,000 per year. Last year there were unspecified payments to the chief executive officer of €20,000. </p>
            <p eId="para_603"> This is extraordinary, given a relatively small workforce. Also the harbour company has made significant losses in revenue this year as against last year. It appears that those at the top are creaming it while the workforce is under extreme pressure. Has any justification been given by the management of the harbour company in regard to where the unspecified payments of €40,000 came from, what they are and why they think they are justified on top of already high salaries? Questions remain concerning expenses which were wrongly claimed by a former board director which we were told would be returned and it is still not clear if they have been returned, against a background where the workers are being hammered.</p>

            <p eId="para_604">The salary is very high for a relatively small company. There are many people running much larger enterprises than this who do not get paid a salary of this scale. For the information of the Deputy, the basic salary is €136,000, plus €12,600 in board fees and a car allowance of €20,000, all of which are contracted and, as a consequence, the chief executive officer is legally entitled to them. The additional payment of €19,877 relates to a payment in lieu of untaken holidays or untaken leave. My Department wrote to the chairperson, whose term has ended, stating that we did not accept this payment of €19,877 and that it should not have been made. When a new chairman is appointed the matter will be taken up and resolved. The chairman designate will appear before the joint committee to discuss these matters. Unfortunately, these matters are a distraction from a much more important issue which is the future of the harbour company. I would like to see the new chairman and board deal with these issues quickly in order that we can concentrate on the much more important matter of the future direction and future success of the harbour company.</p>

            <p eId="para_605">I agree that the future of the harbour company is the major concern for the people of Dún Laoghaire and certainly for the workforce. I accept this is a legacy issue which the Minister has inherited. Any reasonable person would say this is an unacceptably high level of remuneration for top executives who appear to give themselves unspecified payments of very large amounts and increase their salaries when revenues are falling and workers are under the hammer. We need to protect the front-line workers, the harbour police and maintenance workers who make the harbour function and get rid of these obscene salaries and expenses and waste of money at the top, which seems to serve no particular function and cannot be justified. Is that the general direction in which the Minister is heading?</p>

            <p eId="para_608">I have an open mind on the future place of the harbour company, whether it should remain as a company under my Department, a company under the local authority or be transferred to Dublin Port. I would be interested to hear the views of all the Deputies from Dún Laoghaire on that matter. I accept the rate of remuneration is high. It is not far off the rate of remuneration of the chief executive officer of Dublin Port which is a much larger enterprise. That is an issue that will have to be addressed by the new board. On the issue of the workforce, the key issue is whether it is the right size in terms of costs and the level of business of the company.</p>

            <p eId="para_610">I am pleased to report continued good progress in the preparations for The Gathering Ireland 2013 which will be Ireland's biggest ever tourism initiative. Fáilte Ireland is the lead agency for the implementation of the initiative and has put in place a project executive team to implement it. Tourism Ireland has specific responsibility for promoting The Gathering Ireland 2013 in overseas markets and has also provided staff for the project team.</p>
            <p eId="para_611"> The St. Patrick's Day festivities were used for the overseas launch while a major domestic launch took place on Friday, 11 May 2012 in Dublin Castle. Since then the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, and I have attended a number of events overseas to mobilise support for the initiative. The Gathering Ireland 2013 was the title sponsor of the Notre Dame versus Navy American football game in September which received widespread coverage in the United States. President Higgins also promoted The Gathering Ireland 2013 during his recent visit to South America and further publicity events in our main overseas tourism markets are planned for the remainder of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_612"> In terms of domestic activity, local Gathering co-ordinators have been appointed in each county and steering committees have been formed. Over 7,000 people have attended 52 community meetings throughout Ireland since June. Individuals and community groups can see what is already planned in their area by logging on to The Gathering Ireland 2013 website where planned events are shown by county. The website also provides online supports and ideas for those interested in setting up their own event. I am informed that there are now more than 600 individual events pledged on The Gathering Ireland 2013 website and this is increasing daily. Among the most common are clan gatherings, twin-town trips, school and work reunions, genealogical projects and family reunions.</p>

            <p eId="para_613">I thank the Minister for his reply. I have had the opportunity to meet Mr. Miley, who has responsibility for running the event and he is very clear in what he wants to do. I am concerned that it does not appear to have a comprehensive budget. I have spoken to representatives of a number of community groups in my area who are anxious to be part of The Gathering Ireland 2013 and see it as their civic duty. However, it is not clear what kind of funding will be available to these groups in the organising and promotion of such events. I accept, as the Minister said, that there is a level of activity among small communities involving things like family gatherings. I believe there should be some assistance with the cost of the communications that need to be put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_614"> Other groups are seeking to organise larger events and it is unclear whether the State will be in a position to provide the necessary funding. That matter needs to be clarified relatively quickly because as the Minister and the Minister of State both know, people who are coming from our important tourism markets cannot decide to do so at the last minute. While it may apply to those coming from our nearest neighbour, which is a very important tourism market for us, people coming from the United States would make those decisions now if they are planning on coming here next summer or autumn. I ask the Minister to provide information on the overall budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_615">Some funding is available through Fáilte Ireland's festival and events programme. The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, made some announcements on that matter recently. There is a top-up fund for festivals with a Gathering dimension. I believe we need to examine the smaller projects at county level to which the Deputy referred. Obviously, the Department is a bit short of cash at the moment, but that is something we need to examine. If we were able to find a private or corporate sponsor, that would be very helpful. It is something we are trying to work on, but I cannot make any commitments at this stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_616">As the Minister is aware, a number of the smaller existing festivals receive funding either from the Arts Council or the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. We should utilise to the greatest extent possible funding that already exists. For this particular year there should be a requirement for Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht funding to have a Gathering dimension. In Counties Mayo and Clare there are many arts festivals, which receive support from the State through the Arts Council and have significant tourism potential. They have the capacity to act as a catalyst to attract tourism as part of the overall Gathering project.</p>

            <p eId="para_617">I recently met representatives of the Arts Council, who when deciding on their funding programmes are taking into account how the arts and arts centres can contribute to The Gathering Ireland 2013. However, they do not envisage being in a position to allocate their funding until the new year. Obviously we would prefer to see that happening before the new year, but that is their call and not mine. The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, has been in contact with the county managers and mayors of the local authorities to ask them to set aside even a small amount of money from their budgets next year to support events such as this.</p>

            <p eId="para_619">This question relates to funding for homeless soccer street leagues.</p>
            <p eId="para_620"> I take this opportunity to congratulate the Irish team on their performance in the Homeless World Cup in Mexico. I also applaud the work that is being done through the homeless street leagues. Programmes such as these can have a very positive impact for those involved and present a wonderful opportunity for participants to represent their country at a large sporting event.

            <p eId="para_622"> The Irish Sports Council, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the allocation of current expenditure funding for sports organisations. The council channels funding through the national governing bodies of sport. In the case of soccer, funding is provided to the FAI. I understand that the homeless street leagues are affiliated to the FAI and that the FAI provides financial and other support for the leagues through its Football for All programme.

            <p eId="para_623">I also congratulate the Irish Homeless World Cup team, which finished eighth - a very creditable performance. There are a number of homeless street leagues in Cork, Galway, Waterford, Portlaoise, Longford, Wexford and Dublin. There is also one in Wheatfield Prison. Approximately 500 people participated in the street leagues and the primary target groups are the homeless, those dependent on drugs and alcohol, former offenders, refugees and asylum seekers, people resident in hostels, the long-term unemployed with learning disabilities, and increasingly those who have lost their jobs and homes and have found themselves homeless.</p>
            <p eId="para_624"> According to Focus Ireland, approximately 5,000 people are in some form of homeless situation. I know the figure the Minister of State quoted was less, but this is what Focus Ireland has advised us. It costs €80,000 to keep a person in prison for a year. This year the Irish team only received €9,000 from the FAI towards its participation in the Homeless World Cup. I do not believe it received any other money. When the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is handing money over to the FAI, it should point out that the FAI is allocating a paltry sum to the Homeless World Cup team, which is unacceptable. They have been involved in these sorts of tournaments since 2003 and this is just not good enough.</p>

            <p eId="para_625">It is great that 500 people are involved. It has given these people a new lease of life. A recent impact study report indicates that 92% of players have a new motivation for life, 73% have changed their life for the better and 93 players successfully addressed drug or alcohol dependency. My Department gives the funding to the Irish Sports Council and last year it received approximately €46.5 million. It is a matter for the Irish Sports Council to deal with the national governing bodies. I will contact the Irish Sports Council and ask the question. However, to be fair to the FAI, it is the only sporting organisation running any such leagues, on which I compliment it. These street leagues have worked very well, particularly in disadvantaged areas. I compliment everybody involved including the organisers of the event, the FAI and others working with homeless people. These people deserve the same recognition and support as everybody else. I am glad that the FAI is playing its part.</p>

I would welcome if representatives of the street leagues could be invited to Leinster House by the Minister of State or other Deputies. It would be a great boost to their morale.

            <p eId="para_634"> The payment of directors' fees is a matter for Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company in accordance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies. While the code requires companies to provide details of attendance in their annual accounts and outlines a number of other requirements in regard to the payment of fees, it does not link the payment of fees to attendance at a particular number of board meetings in any given period.</p>
            <p eId="para_635"> The company's annual accounts and chairman's report for 2011 confirm that all fees were paid in accordance with Government guidelines. Furthermore, the company’s accounts also detail individual directors’ attendance at board meetings for the period covered by the accounts.  The person referred to attended six out of a possible nine meetings in 2011. This information is publically available. I am not yet in receipt of the company's annual accounts for 2012 nor was I aware of the reports to which the Deputies refer.</p>

            <p eId="para_637">I thank the Minister for his reply. These concerns arise as a result of the extreme pressure on harbour workers, a couple of whom are in the Visitors Gallery today. For example, four of the nine harbour policemen have been put on one week a month temporary lay-off for an indefinite period because the company says it does not have the money to pay them, which is a major hit for those concerned and for the amenity in terms of safety. It is incredible that the company does not have the money to pay the workers who protect the harbour and users of it while a director who is known to have been overpaid expenses, which were supposed to have been returned - I am not sure if they have been repaid - and does not attend meetings continues to receive directors' fees, expenses and so on. Earlier we discussed the payment of obscenely high and unjustifiable salaries to people at the top. It appears as though there is one law for directors and executives and another for low to middle paid workers who are being hit severely by way of temporary lay-off. Also, the superintendent of the harbour has been suspended in what appears to be a deepening rift between management and the workforce in the harbour.</p>
            <p eId="para_638"> I ask that the Minister investigate these matters and try to bring fairness to bear, thus ending the situation whereby people at the top are paid large amounts of money for doing very little while front line workers, who ensure the harbour functions in the interests of the public, are hammered in an unacceptable manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_639">This issue relates to a person who is not here to defend himself and is no longer a member of the board of the harbour company. I do not believe people who do not turn up for board meetings should be paid directors' fees. That situation must change.</p>

            <p eId="para_640">I welcome the Minister's response, with which I agree wholeheartedly. Given that the Minister is reviewing this situation - I can tell from the tone of his responses that he takes these issues seriously - how can we, as public representatives, best put forward our suggestions to him in regard to how this regime could be changed? I put it to the Minister that given the threat to the amenity and the workforce the best solution would be to abolish the board and executive. He could probably get representatives of the workforce or community to do the job on a voluntary basis, with direct control for operation of the harbour resting with the Minister, thus protecting front line workers. I would welcome the Minister's response in regard to the proposal to defend the jobs of front line workers and abolish the board, which appears to serve no function.</p>

However, whatever the final structure, it will need to operate on a commercial basis. Government subvention and taxpayers money is for schools, hospitals, pensions and support for the disabled, carers and the unemployed. We do not intend getting into the business of subventing harbours or port companies or any semi-State organisation, other than CIE.</p>
            <p eId="para_642"> I am interested in hearing any suggestions in regard to how the company can be put on a sound commercial footing, under any structure.

            <p eId="para_645">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 77 together. </p>
            <p eId="para_646"> These questions relate to the situation at the Pilot Training College, PTC. This issue arose from the failure of PTC, a privately-owned and operated flight training school, to meet its contractual obligations to its students for the completion of their training.  </p>
            <p eId="para_647"> The Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, has responsibility for approving and overseeing flight training organisations.  Its primary functions in this regard are oversight of the safety, quality and standard of the training being delivered and the conduct of examinations and flight tests.  It considers issues such as whether the company has sufficient resources to safely provide the training required to the internationally determined standards.  It had no involvement in, or responsibility for, the contractual arrangements between PTC and its students.  The IAA's role is based on European rules. PTC is not, unfortunately, an isolated example. There have been similar failures in other countries in the recent past in respect of which the students involved also suffered losses.  Unfortunately, many businesses have, in the current economic climate, failed, leaving their suppliers and customers out of pocket, including businesses in respect of which a State body has a regulatory role.</p>
            <p eId="para_648"> In July, the High Court appointed an examiner to PTC Ireland.  The IAA worked with the examiner to assess the options available but unfortunately on 28 September the court ordered the company's liquidation after a final potential investor withdrew.  While I sympathise with the students and their families, many of whom have suffered considerable financial losses through this company's collapse, neither the Government nor the IAA, has any liability in this regard.  The Irish taxpayer cannot be liable for a company’s debts simply because it had approval of some form from a State agency.</p>

            <p eId="para_649">I thank the Minister for his reply, although the information provided does not give any comfort to the parents and students who find themselves with an enormous financial burden.</p>
            <p eId="para_650">I refer to young people who accepted a place with the PTC in the belief that it had the backing of the State, not just in terms of the regulatory role of the Irish Aviation Authority. The Minister said that, as part of the authority's remit, it would have to determine whether the PTC had sufficient resources to provide training. One wonders whether it was possible at the outset to establish whether there were sufficient resources to ensure the training of potential pilots. </p>
            <p eId="para_651"> In recent weeks, it has been reported in public that another training company has been established in Waterford. It has a very similar name, Clearsky Pilot Training College Limited. From company records, it appears to have a set of directors similar to that of its predecessor. This is of particular concern to the parents. Will the company seek to be recognised by the Irish Aviation Authority? If so, will the authority be compelled to provide it with the necessary credentials provided that it is technically able to provide training to prospective pilots? Will there be capacity in this instance to deal with the issue of providing sufficient resources?</p>
            <p eId="para_652"> From a couple of perspectives, we need more clarity. We need to know whether the law is strong enough to protect against the phoenix-like emergence of a new company. Without more evidence, I do not want to repeat some of the allegations that have been made about the stripping of assets and resources of one company in order to provide for the establishment of another. This would be very serious if it were true. Does the Irish Aviation Authority have appropriate investigative powers and other appropriate powers to prevent what I described from happening?</p>

            <p eId="para_653">There are a few relevant points. PTC's accounts were signed off, without qualification, on 29 August 2011 by professional auditors. The accountants were satisfied that "the group, including PTC, will continue as a going concern" and they stated the directors are satisfied that sufficient financial resources are available to the group from its budgeted profits, banks and shareholders. The Irish Aviation Authority reviewed the company's financial projections for 2011-13 and its projected profits for each year to the end of 2013. As recently as early June 2012, the authority met PTC's CEO, who assured it that the company had sufficient funding in place until at least the end of 2012. It is worth pointing out in this regard that, had the authority come to a decision that the college did not have sufficient resources – there is no evidence to suggest it – the only action open to it would have been to de-recognise the college and require it to cease trading. Therefore, those affected would be in exactly the same position as they are now. The problem would simply have arisen a few weeks earlier.</p>
            <p eId="para_654"> A Government regulation is not the same as a bond or guarantee. If an airline or travel agent fails, customers are protected because of the bond. There is no bonding system in these circumstances. Perhaps we need to consider this but we cannot make provision retrospectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_655"> As with me, I am sure the Deputy has constituents who have been burned by this problem. We all have considerable sympathy for those affected. In some cases, they are losing a lot of money because of what has happened. One should bear in mind that they are not the only creditors. If the Government were to decide suddenly to compensate the creditors, including the very large number of foreign students, airlines and the business in Florida, it would have to compensate them all on the same basis. This would cost the taxpayer millions of euro in this case alone and set a very significant precedent for future cases. Ultimately, I have no money. The only money I have is money that belongs to the taxpayer. It would be irresponsible of me to offer compensation in this case or any similar case.</p>
            <p eId="para_656"> Clearsky Pilot Training College Limited has been established and registered at the same address as PTC. Following the reports, the Irish Aviation Authority inspected the premises of the company on 4 October last. The new company was providing refresher training for an international non-EU client. The training does not meet the standard required for an Irish or EU pilot licence. Should the new entity wish to provide training meeting EU standards, it, like any other company, will have to apply to the Irish Aviation Authority for approval. To date, the authority has not received any such application.</p>

            <p eId="para_657">The Irish Aviation Authority, a State organisation, granted the college a licence to operate. The authority was charged with ensuring the company had sufficient resources to provide training safely. The college never had the resources required for students to complete their courses. We now face a debacle in that a large number of people are left stranded abroad with huge debts. They are unable to complete their training and education. This is a serious issue for them. We met many of them outside Leinster House and they told us stories about borrowing money and of their being up to their eyes in hock. It is just unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_658"> To what extent did the Irish Aviation Authority scrutinise PTC when it decided to grant it a licence? There is an onus on the State to address this because the authority is a State institution that needs to be made accountable for what happened.</p>

            <p eId="para_661">They were but they subsequently came home themselves or were repatriated at the expense of the Irish Aviation Authority on a no-prejudice basis, or on humanitarian grounds. I do not have the exact figures in front of me but I am informed that most of the trainees have resumed their training. Arrangements have been put in place in other colleges to allow the trainees to pay in instalments so they will not have to borrow large sums of money upfront. In addition, the Irish Aviation Authority made sure it got its hands on the trainees' records so training done to date will be recognised. There was a case previously in which this did not happen. Assistance was provided in so far as this was possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_662"> The PTC was audited by independent accountants and no issue arose in respect of the audit. Any inspections or reviews of the financial protections carried out by the Irish Aviation Authority showed the college had sufficient resources. Even if the authority had determined that the college did not have sufficient resources, all it could have done would have been to remove its licence. With the exception of a small number of people who paid fees in the weeks just before the college closed, everyone is in the exact same position. This would have been the case even if the Irish Aviation Authority had determined that there were insufficient resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_663"> As I stated, a licence is not a bond or guarantee. Perhaps there should be a bond, and we will examine this. A bond will come at a cost, and that cost will have to fall on the trainees.</p>

            <p eId="para_664">The Ceann Comhairle was kind enough to allow me to raise a Topical Issue on this subject but, thanks to a mess-up in my office, I missed the debate. I apologise and appreciate the opportunity to raise the matter again.</p>
            <p eId="para_665"> The Minister referred to professional audits and qualified accountants. However, if he reads excerpts from the report, he will note it states the negative capital and reserves of the company were almost €2.2 million underwater as of 31 December 2010. It also states: "These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern." Furthermore, it states: "The financial statements do not include any adjustments that would result if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern." The latter is repeated twice. These three statements raise serious concerns that should have stood out significantly.</p>
            <p eId="para_666"> The Irish Aviation Authority, a State agency with regulatory responsibility, gave the college a clean bill of health. Enterprise Ireland, a semi-State body, granted €400,000 to the college on top of an earlier grant of €8,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">It could be any Irish family but we are focused here on our constituents who spent their life savings so their children could fulfil their ambitions.</p>
            <p eId="para_668"> The full imprimatur of both the Irish Aviation Authority and Enterprise Ireland had been given to this company even though it is clear from its accounts that it was in serious difficulty. Families now hear about companies like Clearsky Pilot Training College Limited and the Shemburn Group, which allow the same directors to start again and possibly get a licence. Where is the justice in this? I know the Minister has met the families and knows the issue very well but I appeal to him to reconsider. The Irish Aviation Authority will be appearing before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications next Wednesday morning. I ask the Minister to look at the transcript of that meeting afterwards. I appeal to him to reconsider because this is very unfair to dozens of Irish families who face serious hardship. I admire the Minister's approach to many of these matters so I ask him to reconsider the issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_671">It is possible to read sections of accounts but, ultimately, the finding of the auditors was that it was a going concern and would continue as such. If it is the view that the Irish Aviation Authority somehow failed in its duties, it is open to the people concerned to take legal action against the authority. It is then, ultimately, for the courts to decide if that is the case. Based on its own advice, the Irish Aviation Authority, which is the statutory body responsible for this matter and not my Department, is confident that it was not negligent in any way.</p>
            <p eId="para_672"> The issue of phoenix companies causes huge anger and frustration but there is a reason why we have limited companies. If an honest businessperson has two businesses and one of them fails, it would not be right to allow the business that failed to bring down the good business. This is why we have limited liability - so that the failure of one business does not bring down other businesses. </p>

            <p eId="para_688">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 31, 41 and 58 together. </p>
            <p eId="para_689"> These questions relate to the separation of Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority. As the Deputies will recall, following the Government decision in principle in May to separate Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority and merge it in a new entity with a restructured Shannon Development, a steering group of senior officials from five key Departments was established to bring forward proposals for the implementation of that decision. </p>
            <p eId="para_690"> As part of the restructuring of Shannon Development, the latter's functions in respect of enterprise supports, both for domestic companies and inward investment, will transfer to Enterprise Ireland and the IDA respectively while the agency's tourism functions, including the regional tourism offices, will transfer to Fáilte Ireland. In this regard, last month the Government approved proposals from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to amend the IDA Act 1986 to enable Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to carry out enterprise development functions in the Shannon Free Zone. These changes will bring a more integrated, streamlined and focused discipline to the delivery of both enterprise support and tourism services in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_691"> The steering group is being assisted by two task forces which were established in June. The aviation business development task force is seeking out and evaluating aviation-linked business opportunities that could be associated with the new Shannon entity while the change management task force is developing proposals for transitional arrangements and for the appropriate corporate, managerial and operational structures of the new entity, including matters related to IT, HR, finance and property.  This latter task force is also drawing up proposals for the transfer of Shannon Development functions to the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Fáilte Ireland. </p>
            <p eId="para_692"> I understand that these groups are well advanced in their examination of the range of issues that must be assessed in some detail in order to arrive at the best way forward for the new entity at Shannon. I also understand that the timescale for the task forces to submit their proposals remains mid November. When those proposals have been evaluated by the steering group, both myself and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, will revert to Government before the end of the year with detailed proposals, including an implementation strategy for the establishment of the new entity.</p>
            <p eId="para_693"> In the meantime, Shannon Airport is continuing its business operations including maintaining its existing airline customers and attracting new business where possible. This includes a range of schemes on offer to incentivise airlines to increase services and passenger numbers at the airport.  In addition to the usual schemes, a new growth incentive scheme was introduced last year by the DAA at the three State airports which is due to run until 2014.  This scheme is one element of the three pronged strategy announced last year by Government as part of the jobs initiative to encourage inbound tourism.  In this regard, the recent decision by United Airlines to operate a new Chicago-Shannon service five times a week next summer is very welcome.</p>

            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_694">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. He has indicated that the steering groups are on schedule to bring forward a business plan, which was probably part of the original legislation. The Minister spoke about the breaking up of Shannon Development. This very important agency has been of strategic importance to the mid west region and I am very disappointed that this Government has decided to dismember it. The Minister has not spoken about Shannon Heritage, which is really the pool of assets owned and controlled by Shannon Development and consists of the tourism attractors. Examples would be Bunratty Castle and Folk Park and a number of other castles and tourism attractions in the region. Could he identify where he expects those assets to ultimately reside?</p>
            <p eId="para_695"> Aer Rianta International is a very significant asset. It was created in Shannon and has provided huge revenue to Shannon Airport initially and latterly to the Dublin Airport Authority through the way the three airports were pulled together. What does the Minister intend to do with Aer Rianta International? It is hoped and expected that he will ultimately decide to assign Aer Rianta International to the new independent State airport at Shannon. It would act as a very significant contributor to meeting the bottom line cost to ensure the airport will be able to get through the transition period involved in moving from the protection of the group of airports to going it alone. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify that matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar<recordedTime time="2012-10-18T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_696">I do not know what the final proposal of the steering group will be with regard to Shannon Heritage. There are three options. It can either become a company in its own right that is totally separate from everything else, a subsidiary of the new Shannon entity or a subsidiary of Fáilte Ireland. Shannon Heritage Limited does a very good job and runs the sites very well so wherever it ends up, it will do a good job.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">The general consensus emerging from people I speak to about this is that it would not be appropriate for it to be a subsidiary of Fáilte Ireland because Fáilte Ireland is moving out of tourist attractions. It will either be separate in its own right or, more likely, a subsidiary of the new Shannon entity where it probably belongs. In practical terms for the people working there it will not make a huge difference.</p>
            <p eId="para_698"> It is the case that Aer Rianta International started in Shannon but it is now almost entirely an international business and much of its investments are linked to the group rather than to one airport in the group. It is intended that Aer Rianta International will remain part of the Dublin Airport Authority which will be renamed. It is also intended, if possible, to allow the new Shannon body to be debt free. Shannon Airport's debts are entirely its debts and they would be much higher were it not for Government measures in the past. If Shannon Airport's debts were to stay with the DAA, they would probably be similar to if not greater than the value of Aer Rianta International if it were sold. One must bear in mind Aer Rianta International has very few assets. It operates concessions but does not own very much.</p>

            <p eId="para_701">I agree with Deputy Carey. I am very keen to bring this project to a conclusion. Like most things I have started in this job, it has taken longer than I thought for various reasons, and there are always complications, but we are on target for mid-November. If all goes to plan, it would make sense to appoint a board and begin the search for a chief executive officer sooner rather than later.</p>
            <p eId="para_702"> Given the work done by the aviation development task force, I am increasingly confident that separation will work. There is genuine and real interest from industry in investing in Shannon. The infrastructure is in place and it does not involve building runways or hangers or involve support from Government. All it requires is the right business deals. The reports I have received on the work of the task force are very encouraging.</p>

            <p eId="para_706">Many Limerick people have worked in the airport over many years. It has been a very positive reciprocal arrangement.</p>
            <p eId="para_707"> I welcome the comments made by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar. I compliment the work of the aviation business development task force led by Rose Hynes and the change management task force led by John Fitzgerald. With regard to separation, from a regional perspective it is very important Shannon Airport is put on a sustainable financial footing by being debt free and being able to promote the airport as a destination. The ancillary activities are crucial and we must never lose sight of the fact it is an airport. I ask the Minister to be conscious of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_708"> I welcome the fact the Minister expects to receive reports from the two task forces in mid-November. When does he expect that he and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, will bring the reports to Cabinet for approval to progress with separation? When does he expect a formal announcement to be made on appointing a board and chief executive officer? When does he expect to make an announcement on corporate governance and the financial structure?</p>
            <p eId="para_709"> I represent the constituency of Limerick city, which includes a portion of County Clare, and I am very glad to represent it. The people of the mid-west are looking forward to having an airport for the region. We want a good take-off and the two elements required for this are corporate governance and a proper financial structure.</p>

            <p eId="para_710">The Deputy has made a very valid point. The new Shannon company needs to be on a sustainable financial footing. Quite evidently there is no point in doing it otherwise. However, it also needs to be commercial. Quangos and State agencies are on a sustainable financial footing because they receive money from the Government. I do not want this to be a quango or a State agency. I want it to be a successful company which is on a sustainable financial footing from day one and which, from then on, will have to make a go of it. If it is successful, it will succeed, grow and improve each year. If it is not it will not, and this is the risk that arises with any commercial venture.</p>
            <p eId="para_711"> The Minister, Deputy Bruton, and I expect to bring the conclusions of the working groups to Cabinet in November and all things going to plan, assuming we will have Cabinet support, I expect to proceed with appointing a board by the end of the year, which will then recruit a chief executive officer. Asking me how long it will take to recruit a chief executive officer is a different question and I cannot answer it. Something else I have learned is that it can take a bit of time to do this.</p>

            <p eId="para_713">The intention is to publish the plan for all to see and begin implementation in November, and if not in November by the end of the year. We are in limbo and huge patience has been shown in the region on this point. I do not want us to be in limbo for much longer. The plan is to have everything done and dusted and agreed by Cabinet by mid-November, or at the end of the year by the latest, and then to begin implementation immediately. The legal work on separation and the business plans could take time, but for all intents and purposes the company could be established with its own board and be running itself in the new year.</p>

            <p eId="para_714">I thank the Minister for his response. The steering group is very important, as are the growth incentives and the recent announcement made by the Minister on the five flights between Shannon and Chicago. It shows we can look for new routes and find them. A debt exists and I am not clear on how appointing a new chief executive officer or directorship will deal with it. Will the State take some responsibility for the debt? Are we still considering selling off State assets? I am concerned that Shannon Airport would be one such asset. It has given phenomenal service to the mid-west and the country over the years.</p>

            <p eId="para_715">There is no question of the State taking on the debts of any airport. There is potential to work out the debt whereby the debt would stay with the DAA which would continue to pay interest on it but it would no longer have to cover the operating losses which exist at Shannon Airport. It could be done in such a way that it would not seriously impact on the balance sheet of the DAA, or what will be the new DAA which will have a new name, taking into account that it will not just be a Dublin body. This must be worked out, but there is certainly no question of the Exchequer taking on the debts of any airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_716"> There are no plans for the sale of Shannon Airport to a private buyer, nor has there been any expression of interest. If someone was willing to invest in the airport, one could not turn a blind eye, but it has not arisen and there are no plans in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_717">I thank the Minister for his frankness, but he and I differ significantly as regards airports. He believes that they should be commercial ventures. While I accept his point about putting them on a secure financial footing, he has also stated previously that, after being given the best chance, they either take off or crash land. If we are serious about balanced regional development, which has been a hallmark of successive Governments, one cannot view an airport, which is critical infrastructure, as a commercial venture no more than one can view the tunnel connecting counties Clare and Limerick under the River Shannon in the same way. My colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, will appreciate that. While the airport is such a venture to some extent, the State underpins it and underwrites the losses.</p>

            <p eId="para_721">To advise Deputy Dooley, it would be a major mistake to start a new company by telling it that it would be underwritten and that it would have a pile of money as a safety net if something went wrong. One way to ensure that a commercial venture fails is to tell it that it does not need to succeed. We must put it up to Shannon Airport to succeed on a commercial basis. It can do it.</p>
            <p eId="para_722"> The Deputy mentioned balanced regional development. The Shannon Foynes Port works on a commercial basis in the region, as does Galway Port. The west is not such a basket case that it cannot be a commercial success. We should aim for commercial success as a starting point. There is a risk in even suggesting otherwise or in giving people licence not to succeed by putting in place safety nets, subventions, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_723"> I compliment the task force on its work. I appreciate the phenomenal <i>pro bono</i> work of Ms Hynes and Mr. John Fitzgerald, the chairpersons.</p>
            <p eId="para_724"> Shannon Airport is predominantly a passenger airport and will continue to be so. We hope to regain some lost business in terms of passengers and aviation firms, but the discussions with the businesses in question are commercially sensitive and I cannot go into them in detail.</p>

            <p eId="para_725">I have come to this debate late, but could Shannon Airport be a location for the Air Corps? It could be a base to help in the policing of fishing fleets and so on off the west coast. We could think laterally.</p>

            <p eId="para_729">That is a question for the Minister for Defence. Deputy Mathews can ask him about the matter. As we have a small airforce, moving to Shannon Airport would mean closing Baldonnel. The Coast Guard is doing well operating out of Shannon Airport. I would need to pass the Deputy's suggestion on to the Minister for Defence.</p>
