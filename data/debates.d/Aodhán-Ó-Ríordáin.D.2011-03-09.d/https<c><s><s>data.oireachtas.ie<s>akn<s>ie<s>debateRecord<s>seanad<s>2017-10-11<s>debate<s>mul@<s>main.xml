            <p eId="para_20">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, for facilitating this debate, which is very important in the context of Limerick. I refer to the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, study which, in layman's terms, produces flood risk management plans for specific areas in Ireland. In 2009, and more recently, there was severe flooding in the same locations. I refer to St. Mary's Park and Corbally in the city, Westbury and Castleconnell, Montpellier and Annacotty in the suburbs of Limerick and the Mountshannon Road between Annacotty and Castleconnell village.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> The same individual homes and areas flooded. The Corbally Road flooded down to the back of Westbury. The mall in the village of Castleconnell flooded. Mulcair Drive in Annacotty flooded. The Minister of State knows from his experience in Athlone that people's homes have been flooded on two occasions, which was traumatic. Smaller estates flooded in Montpellier, a small village on the border between Tipperary and Clare outside Castleconnell. </p>
            <p eId="para_22"> The CFRAM study is being prepared. Having spoken to Limerick City and County Council, I note it wishes to proceed with the design of flood defences to be built in the locations to which I referred. It has been advised by the Office of Public Works, OPW, that it has to wait for the CFRAM study to be published. When will it be published? If there is a delay in publication, is there a method by which Limerick City and County Council could apply to the OPW for funding to allow the design work to get underway?</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> The Minister of State knows that in respect of special areas of conservation the process is very slow. It takes a number of years to get to the stage where building can commence. Some work has been on Verdant Crescent in St. Mary's Park in the city. The main works are about to go to planning and the process has taken some time. It has been traumatic for those living in St. Mary's Park who experienced flooding. </p>
            <p eId="para_24"> When will the CFRAM study be finalised and published? When can Limerick City and County Council apply for funding in order to submit properly designed flood defences for Corbally, Castleconnell, Montpellier, Annacotty and Mountshannon Road? I greatly admired the Minister of State's work in Athlone. I extend an invitation for him to come to Limerick and visit the locations to which I have referred to see at first hand how important it is to get flood defences in place. </p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran)<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_25">I wish to thank the Senator for raising this matter today and I am pleased to provide an update on the status of the preparation of the CFRAM programme and when it is expected to be published. The CFRAM programme is the largest flood risk management programme ever undertaken by the State. The programme is focusing on 300 areas for further assessment, AFAs, including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> This programme has identified feasible flood relief measures to provide protection to 95% of properties at risk in the 300 areas. The details will be set out in the flood risk management plan. Nearly 500 public consultation days have been held on the CFRAM programme, where the CFRAM teams met the communities involved to discuss the process face-to-face. Draft plans were published last year for public consultation.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">There was an extensive response to the public consultation on the draft plans and constructive and wide-ranging observations were provided. The review and assessment of these observations took longer than expected but reflects the nature of the value of the comments received. People’s views have helped form what is now proposed in the final plans. These are currently undergoing an independent review in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Once this independent review of all plans is completed and observations are addressed, the final plans will be formally submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for approval, in accordance with the statutory requirements. I hope by the end of this year to publish the final plans developed under the CFRAM process and to announce the proposed structural measures contained within those plans that will protect communities and properties at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> The CFRAM programme addresses the requirements of the EU floods directive as well as national flood policy. The OPW has been in regular contact with the European Commission advising it of the progress with the finalisation of the plans. I assure the Seanad again that the Government will continue to ensure that measures to deal effectively with flooding through the development of the CFRAM programme and plans, and the continued investment in flood defence capital schemes, will receive the highest priority. I assure the Senator that in my role as Minister of State, I will give this a high priority. I sympathise with anyone affected by flooding, whether they are in Limerick, Cork, Clare or Athlone. Everything that can be done will be done. We hope that by the end of the year we will roll out the CFRAM provisions. It has taken longer than envisaged but I am pleased to say we are now coming to a finality. At the Senator's request, I will visit Limerick in the near future if he so wishes.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">I thank the Minister of State and look forward to him coming to visit Limerick. He is more than welcome. This is very important to us. There has been an extensive consultation process and in one location, Castleconnell village, there was a need for a second consultation because of risk of flooding. The OPW did the further consultation and I expect it will be rectified. People are worried about another severe rainfall as they know the areas of Corbally, Castleconnell, Montpelier, Annacotty, Mountshannon Road, as well as further into Clare with the likes of Clonard, will be flooded. The only way this can be arrested is if we get flood defences in place. I very much welcome that. I expect that any submissions from Limerick city and council to go with the design projects would give priority to the areas I spoke about for flood defences. I hope that will happen under the CFRAM study.</p>

            <from>Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_31">I thank the Minister of State for attending, although I am very disappointed the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, or the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, did not attend this morning. On 15 August they attended a meeting with officials at Carlow County Council where there was a proposal from the council on a draft budget going to 2018. I am very disappointed they did not attend today.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> Carlow has been hit harder than most towns in the recession and Government funding is more important now than ever. Carlow needs the Government to address these matters immediately. Our workforce must leave town daily, as our young left our shores during the recession. Hundreds of our workers park their cars on our motorway access point or share cars to Dublin, Cork, Louth, Limerick and further afield. They put in at least 14 to 15 hours daily and they have no other choice. We lost our manufacturing industries and we saw the heartbreaking sight of long-established businesses closed, with the county's disposable income all but dried up. These people must leave their families behind to find work as they have bills to pay. Carlow was once one of the most prosperous counties in this country and Carlow town was one of Ireland's most progressive and successful locations. Carlow County Council played a major role in this prosperity and, unfortunately, the equalisation fund was set in these years of prosperity.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> The reality today is so different. We can consider the loss of the Irish Sugar Company, Erin Foods, Lapple, Cold Rolling Mills and numerous engineering companies and building contractors that have gone. Numerous small and medium enterprises have also gone. Braun was a major player that left the area devastated when it closed. This company employed more than 1,200 women and many men. The women brought valued second wages into the family home, thus providing disposable income. This income and the value of these jobs were especially helpful to Carlow's economic success and the thriving business community in Carlow.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> Carlow must look to the future, and securing our fair share of Government funding is the first step in the process of restoring Carlow to a prosperous and thriving town and county. We cannot be left behind under the cloak of rural Ireland and tourism campaigns. We must work together to boost our county. Housing is vital to our county, but if we build houses, we must consider planning for jobs to bring income to those houses. Local government must be aided in creating prosperity to enrich these homes. Carlow is not shouting for extra funding or asking to be bailed out like banks. It is just asking for its fair share of Government funding. The Government can start this with the local property equalisation fund, just one item that can start to help the recovery both of Carlow town and every other part of our county.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> In just over a year in this House I have seen the country's financial position improve. I look at Dublin and see a city that is thriving. Other cities and towns in counties are benefiting from recovery, but many other parts of our country are not feeling these benefits. They are not feeling hope. If our future is to be bright, we must provide that hope. Unfortunately, Carlow is one of the areas that has not felt much recovery and it has lost hope. If the Government gives Carlow its fair share of funding, it will help the county develop, improve services and make it a more attractive location in which to live, work, invest, create and build. We work hard in Carlow with Government agencies that work to attract large industries. We cannot choose their location for them. We can, however, shine our shoes, put on our best suit, light our lanterns and demonstrate that Carlow is open for business, growth and profit.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> We need the help of the Minister of State. Carlow County Council refused to raise the local property tax last week because my county is not getting its fair share of funding from central government. These councillors have seen all other counties receive extra funding that we are not getting. I ask the Minister of State to say if they were wrong to highlight this injustice. Would he honestly say he would not do the very same for his constituents, fighting for their fair share and being the brave public representative they elected him to be? To recover fully from the recession, the Government must ensure every county is included. We cannot have an island within an island, with a thriving business industry dynamo blocked by the M50. I am sure other counties will fight for their fair share of Government funding and they should do so. Today, however, I am highlighting the case of Carlow and speaking for my home county and its concerns. The Government has failed to accept there is a matter that must be addressed immediately with Government funding for Carlow. It is really urgent as we are getting some of the lowest levels of funding.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Pat Breen)<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_37">I thank Senator Murnane O'Connor for her comments and am delighted to see her fighting for her area. As Minister of State with responsibility for business and trade, I am always concerned about balanced regional development. I was in Carlow earlier this year and was very impressed with Carlow Institute of Technology and the innovation centre. The county is lucky to have a third level institution and its innovation, as it attracts entrepreneurs. I have no doubt that Carlow has a bright future, given its location. I would talk up Carlow rather than talk it down as it has much to offer and is a very nice town.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> I apologise for the absence of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, as both are tied up with budget issues. They asked me to take this matter this morning. I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> I welcome this opportunity, on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, to outline the importance of equalisation funding to local authorities such as Carlow County Council in the context of local property tax, LPT, allocations. It is important to recall that the LPT was introduced to provide a stable and sustainable funding base for the local government sector, providing a greater level of connection between local revenue-raising and local expenditure decisions, while simultaneously reducing the local government sector's reliance on other taxes. Local retention of the LPT started in 2015 and since then the overall principles and allocation mechanisms have broadly remained the same. A total of 80% of the LPT is retained in the area in which it is collected, notwithstanding any local variation decisions. The other 20% goes to support equalisation funding for local authorities with lower LPT bases, just like the Senator's county council in Carlow.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> As we all know, local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure etc. In the past, general purpose grant funding and other income reflected this variety. It is not possible, therefore, to compare absolute levels of funding received across local authority areas, as to do so would not reflect the differences between them.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> With regard to the LPT, in accordance with decisions taken by Government regarding the distribution of funding, every local authority has a minimum level of funding available to it known as its baseline. Equalisation is the process that ensures that every local authority’s LPT allocation is brought up to this baseline. As well as the 20% contribution from each local authority, the Exchequer also contributes to equalisation support, with €43 million allocated in 2018 and to be distributed in 2018 in accordance with the LPT allocation mechanism. The current baseline is linked to previous general purpose grants and was increased in 2016 to take account of pension-related deductions previously retained as an income stream by local authorities. For both 2017 and 2018, the Government decided that no local authority should receive less income from the LPT than it received in the form of general purpose grants in 2014 as well as the amount of pension-related deductions that was integrated into the baseline in 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> Accordingly, Carlow’s LPT allocation is in line with its previous funding level, as is the case for all local authorities. In fact, Carlow County Council is a net beneficiary of equalisation. For 2018, the estimated LPT yield in Carlow, based on data from the Revenue Commissioners, is €3.9 million, of which €794,000, 20%, goes towards equalisation. This contrasts with a baseline figure of €6.1 million, meaning in 2018, Carlow will benefit by €2.9 million from equalisation support. If this is the figure to which the Senator is referring, it is important to remember that the same mechanism has been applied consistently across the local government sector, that LPT allocations for 2018 have been finalised and notified to authorities and that it is not possible to reopen this decision or to supplement the allocation of any individual authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> The current approach to LPT distribution and equalisation is fair, consistent and ensures resources are used to support those authorities that need them most. It is important that local authorities are treated in a consistent manner. Any variation from that approach for one individual local authority would introduce inequity and, it is presumed, lead to similar demands from other local authorities. All such issues have to be considered within the parameters of the national and fiscal budgetary situation and the competing priorities presenting themselves at the wider governmental level.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> In this context, it should be noted that the Government has allocated significant resources to tackling the housing shortage as part of the budgetary process. The Senator will be aware of the €1.83 billion allocated for that in the budget. The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will continue to work with local authorities to deal with this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> It is a matter for each local authority to consider how it can maximise local income sources and manage its own spending in the context of the annual budgetary process. As the process of formulating local authority budgets ramps up in the aftermath of the national budget, local authorities must consider how to balance income with service delivery. The current local government funding model supports local authorities of all types to support an appropriate level of service provision. Every local authority has the opportunity to decide whether to increase or decrease LPT rates by up to 15% each year. Carlow County Council did not use its power to vary LPT rates for 2018, nor did it use those powers in the past. If the authority had decided to increase LPT rates, it would have retained 100% of the additional LPT collected and would, therefore, have had additional funding available for the county. It is important to note in this context that budgetary decisions, a reserved function, are a key responsibility of the elected members of local authorities. As well as LPT and grants from Government, local authorities also derive income from local sources, including commercial rates, and goods and services. These two sources account for almost 65% of Carlow’s budgeted income for 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> The Department keeps the LPT allocation mechanism under review to ensure equitable treatment of all local authorities. However, while acknowledging that local authorities may face challenging decisions in the coming weeks in the context of their annual budgets, no additional LPT funding can be made available to any authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> I thank the Senator for raising this issue. I know she has grave concerns about it. There is very little we can do about the allocation for this year and it may be something that could be considered for next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">I am disappointed with the Minister of State's response given that many other local authorities have been given much more funding than our authority has been given. There is not a fair system in place. Yesterday's budget was supposed to be fair but it is not a fair budget. If the Government does not look after the local authorities that are telling those in government that they cannot come up with the funding they require, then we are in trouble. I am very disappointed. I am proud to be from Carlow and proud of what Carlow has achieved, but we were hit by the recession. Our county needs to be addressed like other rural counties, but the Government is not addressing our needs.</p>

          <speech by="#TimLombard" eId="spk_14">
            <from>Senator Tim Lombard<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_54">I want to raise an issue I raised previously regarding the need for the Minister with responsibility for local government to outline his proposals to review the local government boundaries in light of the upcoming local elections in 2019. The review of local government boundaries is an issue we have discussed and it has been on the agenda since the previous report in 2013. That report unfortunately initiated a change in boundaries resulting in some constituencies increasing to ten seats, which has had a major knock-on effect on local government. None of us in this Chamber or in public life realistically sees the advantage in constituencies increasing to ten seats, given what that can mean in geographical terms with local electoral constituencies in, for example, south Kerry or west Cork stretching to 110 to 120 miles. It does not make sense. A review of the criteria in terms of the geographical nature of these constituencies is important.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> We have seen that local government is the heart of Ireland and local government is about knowing one's local representatives. If a person lives in a constituency that stretches to 100 miles, the chances of him or her knowing the local representatives or the representatives knowing that person are very limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> That criteria used for local government reviews need to be examined. Traditionally, we have used a system of district electoral divisions, DEDs. It does not make sense to use criteria that are more than 100 years old and up to 120 years old. These mapping districts need to be reviewed. Ireland has moved on. It does not make sense that we as a progressive State would return to boundaries that were set more than 100 years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> I will give an example of the unbelievable way in which constituencies have been divided. The town of Carrigaline in Cork, with a population of more than 15,000 people and a river flowing through the centre of it, was divided between two electoral districts. One half of the town became part of the Ballincollig-Carrigaline area, which became a ten-seat constituency, and the other half became part of the Kinsale-Bandon area, which became a five-seat constituency. It does not make sense to divide towns on the basis of those electoral districts. Electoral districts need to be inclusive in nature and an electoral area needs to include both halves of a town such as Carrigaline and its hinterland to promote better local government. Unfortunately, if we fall back to using these old maps and do not move on from maps that are more than 100 years old, we will not move on when it comes to representation of local government.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> The report relating to current boundaries was published on 30 May 2013. This did not give public representatives, the public and executives in local authorities enough time to prepare for a local election that was held 12 months later. There is an anomaly in the system. The European election boundaries have already been set for 2019. The MEPs know their constituencies. They know exactly where they are running and the public knows the constituencies as they are laid out in law. They were laid out on 27 June 2017 but the process of laying out new local election boundaries has not even commenced. This is a major problem for the executives, the public and the councillors who want to serve these people. There are 918 councillors who are waiting for a local government review of the boundaries and for the Minister to press the button and set the criteria. There are many things at stake. Criteria are very important. We have seen how bad criteria have led to bad decisions. We need appropriate criteria and an appropriate timescale. I look forward to the Minister of State's response because we need to address this issue. The public needs local government and at the moment, the word "local" is missing in these very large constituencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_59">I thank the Senator for raising this matter. As someone who was once a councillor, looking at the previous divisions, I echo the Senator's concerns. I keep in touch with councillors of all colours to hear their concerns. It would be hoped that all their concerns would be reflected in any review. I apologise for the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, who has budgetary matters to attend to this morning and who asked me to come in his place.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> A Programme for a Partnership Government sets out a number of commitments relating to local government reform to ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy into the future. In particular, the programme includes a commitment to consider reducing the size of local electoral areas. In this context, the preparatory work in support of a review of local electoral areas is being advanced in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. It is intended that the review will be initiated shortly and will be completed in good time before the 2019 local elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> In contrast to the position for Dáil constituencies, there are no constitutional or statutory requirements relating to the frequency of local electoral area reviews. Nevertheless, provision is made in section 23 of the Local Government Act 2001 for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to divide each county, city or city and county into local electoral areas and to amend those areas as may be considered necessary. However, changes to local electoral areas may only be carried out following the completion of a review by an independent boundary committee established under section 28 of the Local Government Act 1991. The Minister must have regard to the report of a boundary committee before deciding on whether to make an order amending local electoral areas. The terms of reference for a boundary committee are set by the Minister of the day. The most recent review of local electoral areas was carried out from November 2012 to May 2013 by a boundary committee in advance of the 2014 local elections. Local electoral area reviews were also carried out by boundary committees in 2008, 1998 and 1985. In broad terms, previous reviews of local electoral areas had regard to a wide range of factors, including the emerging needs of society, population change and demographics as well as the policy considerations of the day.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> In accordance with the programme for a partnership Government, the Department is currently preparing a comprehensive report for Government and the Oireachtas on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability, which is important for any politician. This report will comprise a number of papers which will cover a broad range of issues on the local government reform agenda. The Minister is aware that concerns have been raised by a number of local authority members across different local authorities and by the Association of Irish Local Government relating to the territorial size and configuration of some of the local electoral areas specified following the last boundary review. The demands on councillors in territorially large local electoral areas are greater than those in more compact areas even when member-to-population ratios are broadly similar. This can arise due to distance, travel time and the difficulty in keeping abreast of local issues. A further concern which has been raised is that there has been a loss of focus on some large urban centres by virtue of their inclusion in territorially large local electoral areas. To address these concerns, it is proposed that the review of local electoral areas will be given priority ahead of the broader report to Government and the Oireachtas on local government reform. In this regard, it is anticipated that the review of local electoral areas will be initiated shortly and will be completed well in advance of the 2019 local elections, so the Senator and other Senators can carry that message back to county councillors in Cork and elsewhere. This will be done and councillors and local authorities will have plenty of advance notice.</p>

            <p eId="para_66">Perhaps a bit of common sense will apply. An example of the point Senator Lombard is making is the Beara Peninsula, which was represented by two councillors in my time and one Deputy, Deputy Noel Harrington, up until recently. A person living in Bere Island now has to get a boat to shore and then travel 35 miles to meet his or her first public representative. There is no logic in that. I am out of that scene but I just mentioned it to make a comment, which I rarely do, in support of Senator Lombard.</p>

            <p eId="para_67">I thank the Minister for Education and Skills for taking the time to be here in person. In another circumstance, I would picture the many crushing disappointments of yesterday's budget announcement but I will save that for another time and just speak about one issue involving Gaeltacht courses that primary teachers in training are expected to attend. I raise the issue because of a letter Deputy Jan O'Sullivan received from a constituent and passed on to me. I will give the Minister a flavour of what the student, whom I will not name, was saying.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> The student mentioned the cost of mandatory Gaeltacht courses incurred by primary school teachers and said that they sought Deputy O'Sullivan's support for a reinstatement of Government support for these courses in budget 2018. The student wrote that since 2012, due to cutbacks, students have had to pay for attending two courses in the Gaeltacht, each of two weeks' duration. The student wrote that although she believed it was necessary for students to attend these courses, the cost is around €1,400 per student, which she believed was too much for students to bear. She wrote that this does not include transport costs and living expenses. The student also makes the case that while they are two weeks away from home, teachers are missing out on the part-time job income they get during that time. She wrote that up until 2012, the cost of these courses was subsidised by the Government and that for an average student to save for one Gaeltacht placement now, they must work two eight-hour shifts every weekend for ten weeks and save all earnings.</p>
            <p eId="para_69">As a result they have no money left to pay for living expenses each week. The student asked that the matter be brought to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, and requested that in budget 2018 he reinstate the subsidies for these courses, which would help to alleviate the burden of these expenses on students. </p>
            <p eId="para_70"> The Minister will probably elaborate on what has been done in budget 2018 to deal with this issue; however, I wish to make a further point. I think the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, also called in its pre-budget submission for a restoration of the grants for student teachers attending mandatory Gaeltacht courses. Nobody is suggesting the courses should be stopped in any way as they are very important for student teachers in brushing up on their Irish language competence. I was involved with the Marino Institute of Education in setting up a local initiative where students attending second level DEIS schools with an interest in becoming primary schoolteachers did grinds and received tuition after school in order to attain the standard required. I would be worried if disadvantaged students involved in teacher training had to fork out a significant amount of money at their own expense to go to the Gaeltacht. Now that we are in a better position in terms of the economic projections and that we have more money at our disposal, what the individual student and the USI are calling for is an opportunity to go back to where we were in 2012 for students attending Gaeltacht courses which I attended as a trainee primary schoolteacher and for the courses to be subsidised. If that has not happened in the budget, rather than turning it into a party-political point-scoring exercise, will the Minister examine the issue and restore the support in the coming year?</p>

            <p eId="para_71">I thank the Senator for raising this issue. I have received similar correspondence to that which he has raised with me. I think he knows the backdrop to this issue better than I do in that there is a compulsory Gaeltacht placement element of the course and that it arose when teacher education courses were reconfigured in line with the recommendations of my Department's literacy and numeracy strategy and the Teaching Council's policy on teacher education. There is a need to ensure all primary teachers are competent and confident in their use of the Irish language, especially given its importance in the primary school curriculum. Changes to the structure and content of the Gaeltacht placement arose from the Teaching Council's new accreditation criteria, published in June 2011, which provide for "an extended and reconceptualised Gaeltacht residency which will now form part of the overall programme and be under the direct jurisdiction of the teacher education providers". The report of the Teaching Council’s Gaeltacht placement working group provides for the operation of the revised placement and that initial teacher education providers have responsibility for quality-assuring the content, teaching and assessment of the Gaeltacht element of initial teacher education programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> My Department supports the changes which contribute to overall quality improvement in initial teacher education. As the Senator indicated, the revised Gaeltacht placement now consists of two two-week blocks which take place in separate academic years. Prior to 2012, student primary teachers spent three weeks on Gaeltacht placement, usually during the summer months following the first year of their course. My Department paid a grant of €637 per student per three-week placement directly to the Gaeltacht summer colleges. The average annual cost was €850,000. The decision to stop the payments by my Department was made with effect from September 2012. In the context of budget 2012, difficult choices had to be made to achieve savings. To that end, in 2011 all Departments carried out a comprehensive review of expenditure on all budgets and programmes and proposals to achieve savings were put to the Government. It was in this context that the decision was taken to stop the payment of grants towards the cost of student teachers' attendance at Gaeltacht courses from September 2012. The removal of the grant means that students are liable for this cost which I understand is in the region of €1,500 for the four weeks spent on placement. This cost is split over two years in accordance with the Teaching Council's requirements. The Senator will understand, therefore, that the decision to stop the Gaeltacht placement grants was taken during the economic crisis when, unfortunately, very difficult decisions had to be made to stabilise the nation's finances. Priority was given to protecting resources for front-line education services as far as possible, which remains particularly challenging with rising numbers of schoolgoing children. The changes to the Gaeltacht placement grant were publicised in advance of implementation in order that students would be aware of the new arrangements before embarking on initial teacher education programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> The Senator may wish to note that, to assist with the cost of the Gaeltacht placement, students qualifying for a 100% fee grant or who would have qualified for a full fee grant but for the free fees scheme can apply for a field trip grant towards travel and accommodation costs, subject to the normal terms and conditions of the student grants scheme. Apart from the student grants system, in circumstances of particular need students may apply for support under the student assistance fund. In view of other pressing demands on the education budget it has not been possible to consider reinstating this subvention to date. The Senator will be aware that a major report on the funding of third level education, chaired by Mr. Peter Cassells, has been published and is being examined by the Oireachtas committee. The report outlines a number of options for future funding. The committee is assessing the appropriateness of the different options.</p>

            <p eId="para_74">I find the Minister's reply disappointing. The announcement made by him yesterday was that the overall budget for the Department of Education and Skills was in the region of €9 billion. It would cost €1 million to resolve the issue I have outlined. We all know the background to it and I fully accept that we were in an economic crisis. We have all heard that 1,000 times, but we have also heard that the recovery is happening, that things are better now, that we have more money and that there are chances to repair the cutbacks and reductions that took place in recent years. That would be a reasonable expectation on the part of those in society who have endured huge pain. It appears that yesterday's budgetary announcement did not really do a huge amount for those studying at third level or training in various colleges. This is one such measure which would cost €1 million out of the €9 billion at the Minister's disposal. While I appreciate that he is not in a position to change the decisions made yesterday, I urge him to give some indication that he has a vision for the future - to paraphrase him - in rowing back on the difficult decisions made and that we can look forward to this type of measure being somewhere near the top of his priority list when trying to reverse the cutbacks introduced in the past.</p>

            <p eId="para_75">The position is that one has to set priorities. I have clearly set priorities to get teachers back into the classroom. In September 2016 and 2017 I provided 5,000 extra teachers, plus 2,000 special needs assistants, SNAs. For the coming September I have added another 1,280 teachers and a further 1,000 SNAs. We are providing for 1,400 extra apprenticeships, 1,400 extra traineeships, 1,000 extra places on the Springboard programme and a demographic expansion of 2,000 higher education places. We are expanding substantially in all areas of priority, but, unfortunately, we have not been able to provide additional support for student grants, other than for postgraduate students, including those taking the masters of education programme, where those on low incomes receive additional support. It is an arena in which even the Senator would probably criticise the budget for not doing enough. We have a budget this year of €10 billion. It is the first time we have reached that amount, but even then, it is stretched to meet what are a lot of justifiable calls made on it. That is the difficulty. Each year I will review all of the calls made and look to see which ones can be funded from year to year. Unfortunately, I was not able to meet what I was asked to do within the resources outlined yesterday.</p>

          <p eId="para_77">John Bradley of Queen's University Belfast once said that policy neglect seldom goes unpunished. The Revenue Commissioners have produced a comprehensive report on Brexit that the Government has not released. It outlines the fact that the 91,000 Irish companies that trade with the United Kingdom will be subject to massive regulations and customs declarations in the event of a hard Brexit and the UK leaving the customs union and the Single Market. The report says that an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic will be impossible from a customs perspective and it would be naive to believe a unique arrangement can be found.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> This House needs to debate that report. It should be made available to the public. It is not our job to design the Border for the UK or to predetermine the outcome it wants, although it does not seem to know what it wants. Its policy is it wants to have its cake and eat it. That is not, as John Bradley would point out, a policy at all. The Revenue Commissioners' report needs to be debated by this House because in the event of a hard border with a hard Brexit we will, under our obligations as a member of the European Union, have to put in customs posts along our border with the UK. There are over 345 crossings between the North and the South. During the Troubles only 20 of those were open. We need to plan and prepare for what Britain may or may not do. We must be prepared for all eventualities. I know the Leader would agree that, given that the report was leaked and is in the public domain, it is important that we debate the Revenue Commissioners' analysis. It is an independent analysis which Government asked it to carry out. We need to see what the cost will be, not only for the State to put these customs posts in place but also for the 91,000 companies that trade with the UK. What will happen at our ports in Rosslare, Dublin and Cork as a result of this? What kind of delays will there be? What will be the practical implications of the extra space required, buildings that need to be built, storage units to be put in place now, not with six months to go, and Britain crashing out of the European Union as seems to be its destiny, which is within its own hands? We cannot assume that it will have its cake and eat it because the European Union is certainly not going to bake it and neither will we.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> We have to prepare and help companies that will face these extra tariffs and customs arrangements, financially, as announced in the budget. It is not nearly enough but it is a step in the right direction. We must help them. That independent report needs to be debated by this House, the other House and all the committees, which have produced reports on Brexit, including the Seanad special committee, chaired by Senator Richmond. I hope the Leader will facilitate that debate. </p>

          <p eId="para_83">Last week the Rohingya community fleeing Myanmar was described to me as the worst man-made humanitarian crisis in decades. They have been called the world's most persecuted minority, an ethnic group, the majority of whom are Muslim and who have lived for centuries in the majority-Buddhist Myanmar. An estimated 1.1. million Rohingya live in the south-east Asian country. Today the United Nations said that Myanmar's systematic crackdown on the Rohingya is aimed at permanently expelling the minority Muslim community from its home in Rakhine State. It is estimated that over half a million Rohingya have fled Myanmar since the commencement of this strife. The World Health Organization has warned of a cholera epidemic in refugee camps and settlements close to the Bangladeshi border with Myanmar. It was reported earlier this week that a boat carrying 100 people sank near Galachar, a coastal village in Bangladesh.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">Nearly 100 people were on board of which 40 were adults and the rest were children. Only two people were rescued alive and the others are missing. I fear these instances will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> We need to call this crisis what it is - ethnic cleansing. It is taking place in front of our eyes. This country has a moral obligation, along with the rest of the global community, to do more to put a halt to what is taking place. We also need to do more to provide urgent aid to those refugees. I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come to the Seanad to outline how Ireland's voice will be heard and what more we can do.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">This morning I expected to be debating and opposing yesterday's budget but I am not going to say anything about the budget or Brexit because yesterday afternoon the sad news came through about the passing of Neill O'Neill. Instead this morning I wish to express my sympathy to the family and friends of Neill O'Neill, the managing editor of <i>The Mayo News</i>, who died very suddenly yesterday at the age of 36. I extend my condolences to his partner, Emma Joyce, his parents Colam and Mary, his brothers Conor and Finbarr, his sisters Aoife and Orla and, indeed, all the family that makes up <i>The Mayo News. </i> Senators may remember Neill from the RTE documentary on regional newspapers. Local newspapers, like <i>The Mayo News</i>, provide an invaluable source to communities and report the issues that are central to them in a very honest and transparent way. If one wants to know which issues really exercise people one only needs to peruse one's local paper or listen to the local radio station.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> When dealing with the many problems facing rural Ireland, it is refreshing to look through the local and regional newspapers and to listen to local radio to see and hear about all the wonderful volunteers and the sporting and cultural activities that go on away from national headlines and hold communities together. Neill O'Neill epitomised all that is good about regional and local newspapers, community and community activism. He showed that through all the different groups that he was involved in, whether it was the GAA, the chamber of commerce or the many groups that serve to support rural Ireland. He understood his readers and contributors. He treated them all with respect and fairness across the board. He and his team on <i>The Mayo News</i> epitomised the kindness, understanding and sincerity required when reporting sensitive issues that affect people at the most vulnerable times in their lives. For that, I thank him and the team of <i>The Mayo News</i> and, indeed, many of the regional newspapers for such work. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dilis.</p>

          <p eId="para_88">I wish to express my concern to the Government about the continuing detention of the Irish citizen, Ibrahim Halawa, in a Cairo prison. Despite his acquittal in an Egyptian court over three weeks ago, news reports yesterday indicated that the paperwork to secure his release had not even been begun by the legal authorities. I am concerned about the effects that continued detention of an individual who has been declared innocent of any crime is having on him and his family. Other acquitted prisoners have been released in a matter of days. I seek an assurance from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade that the Irish diplomatic presence in Cairo is extending all its influence on behalf of Ibrahim and his family.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> Brad Youngblood from the Tahrir Institute of Middle East Policy, a Washington-based think tank, was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> this week as saying: "The odds that the delayed release is due to the paperwork and bureaucracy surrounding the implementation of court orders in Egypt are very low." He also said that it is very likely that elements of the Egyptian judiciary or security services are acting to slow or prevent Ibrahim's release. If this is true, can I be assured that the Government will increase the level of pressure to ensure the rapid return home of Ibrahim Halawa?</p>

          <p eId="para_90">I wish to raise two issues. First, I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to discuss education. I am a little perturbed by yesterday's budget in terms of what it does for education. It is quite clear that many of the opportunities that were open to the Government were not taken. Clearly, the Minister has shown in the recent past that he has no interest in equality when it comes to teachers' pay. He also has no interest in free education, which is quite clear from the budget announcements that were made yesterday. There has been no effort to reduce the cost of going to school, no interest in raising the capitation that schools receive and no interest in alleviating the cost of going to college for students. I would appreciate an opportunity to have a conversation with the Minister on these matters. It is quite depressing that the new communications unit will receive €5 million. That amount of money would have done a huge amount to pay for schoolbook rental schemes in primary schools in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> Second, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to debate the status of a Government document launched four years ago, entitled the Right to Read campaign. The campaign focuses on literacy and achieving literacy excellence in every local authority in the State. The document acknowledges the fact the library system, the housing stock and the environment in which children are raised have a huge influence over educational attainment. The document is called the Right to Read campaign because the State has acknowledged that every child has a right to read.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> I raise this matter because there is the possibility that a library in Donaghmede in my constituency will close in June 2019. I understand that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government pays for half of the rental cost for the library currently and that when the lease ends such funding will no longer be available. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to come to the House to discuss the status of this Government document that was launched in 2014. I want to know whether he still believes in the Right to Read campaign, if the State is still willing to fund local libraries and if he will ensure that the library in Donaghmede will not close due to a lack of funding from central government.</p>

Shannon Airport is one of three airports in the final. The other airports are in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Italy. I encourage everyone to go online and vote for Shannon Airport to win the route because we want to encourage as many tourists as possible to come to Ireland. Shannon Airport is part of the gateway to the Wild Atlantic Way. Whichever airport receives the most votes, and it is an unusual way to select the route, will be the airport that will be selected for the new route from Cologne.

          <p eId="para_95">I wish to express my concern about the change in the stamp duty legislation. Agricultural land has been bundled with commercial rates for the past number of years. Yesterday, an increase from 2% to 6% was announced as a means to take money from those with development lands and commercial properties. Unfortunately, the initiative will also catch agricultural landholders. With Brexit on our doorstep, farmers are again facing an uphill battle in terms of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> In terms of the Finance Bill, I am curious to know whether agricultural lands could be exempt from the 6% charge. The initiative is very unfair and will not help the agriculture industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">The Leader might be able to provide clarification. Where development lands are being "hoarded", the term they are using at present, there will be a stamp duty of 3% in the first year, 7% the following year and 7% the year after on lands that are not brought into use. Does that apply to zoned lands or lands with full planning permission? I am curious to know.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">I rise today on the important issue of the recent changes to the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme., GLAS Many Senators will be familiar with the GLAS scheme. Last week the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> carried a major story on an immediate change in the GLAS scheme. It is coming into effect immediately. It affects farmers who will no longer be permitted to graze cattle - those who want to have out-wintering stock - in designated areas. They will not be able to feed forage, hay or silage on parcels of land that have been assigned under the low-input permanent pasture scheme under GLAS. I have received representations from local representatives in the following areas: Galway, Roscommon, Mayo, Clare, Offaly, Wicklow and Kerry. They are now seriously concerned. We are in the second week in October. These are farmers who bought into the GLAS 1 and GLAS 2 schemes. They were given grants. They made preparations about out-feeding. They have had no time to put slatted houses or structures in place. There are penalties being introduced with immediate effect. If one has five hectares in the scheme, the penalty will be €1,500. The Teagasc inspectors whom these farmers and communities contacted had no idea of it. They, in turn, had to refer to the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> to find out. Clearly, this is an enormous scheme, particularly for farmers in these regional and low-lying areas who are out-feeding their cattle.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> There should have been at least a lead-in scheme. What are these farmers saying? I understand some of the reasons it is happening, about compression and about the impact on the land. It is particularly low-lying land in these designated areas. There was agreement entered into under GLAS 1 and 2 for these payments and they should be at least given a lead-in time for change so that structures would be put in place. There was an understanding that the places of fodder would be removed on-site and that is not now addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> It is a clear issue. It is the lead in the editorial in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> again this week. It is an issue of concern, particularly to small farmers. I ask the Leader if we could have the Minister come and explain the background to it and whether there is any leeway for this year so that there could be a greater lead-in. If one is going to bring in change, particularly to a scheme that farmers have already bought into, they should have some advance notice. From talking to a number of Teagasc officials yesterday, I am aware that they themselves were unaware of a scheme. They are, effectively, meant to be monitoring this scheme in rural areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_102"> I ask that the Leader would make an intervention with the Minister for Health on a serious issue concerning the urology department in University Hospital Galway. Last week, I tabled a Commencement matter which stemmed from an issue brought to my attention by the family of an elderly man who was in Mayo General Hospital since 19 September waiting to get into urology. This man is seriously ill with cancer. The hospital in Castlebar, by its own admission, could do nothing further for him and he needed to get to University Hospital Galway, which is a centre of excellence, to be seen by the urology department. He was being advised to go to the emergency department and he is so sick he is not fit to go there. He was discharged home on the day of my Commencement matter, which was Wednesday. Yesterday, his family got confirmation from Galway that he would get an outpatient appointment for January 2018. Now this man, as I said, is seriously ill. He was discharged after being told by the doctors in Castlebar that he needed to get into urology as soon as possible, and them directing him to go to the emergency department.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> I received a letter from the Saolta Group, which is responsible for Galway, Castlebar and the other hospitals in that region, telling me there are a number of patients in Saolta hospitals waiting to get into the urology specialty in Galway. Something is seriously wrong in the urology department in Galway when a man so ill is given an outpatient appointment for January 2018, notwithstanding the fact that I raised it. I should not have to raise this here but I have, and I raised it last week. I am asking the Leader to address it as a priority. This is a seriously ill man. His family are gutted about this and I do not blame them. I am asking that the Leader, when he leaves here today, pick up the phone and talk to the Minister for Health about what is going on. Let us get some accountability from the HSE and from the Saolta Group in respect of what is going on in Galway. Let the truth be known and let the issues be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">I want to raise the funding of the Sláintecare programme. It was raised briefly by some Senators in the statements on the budget yesterday. I would like the Leader to give clarification on the health measures announced in the budget. I saw this morning that the Minister, Deputy Harris, tweeted about the Sláintecare report in reference to the budget. This is disingenuous as the budget simply does not allow for the implementation of the report. It seems as though the hours and hours of hard work and dedication given to the report were just to keep the public representatives happy and distracted, when key recommendations were ignored. From my party's analysis, when the funding required to cover pay restoration of the Lansdowne Road agreement and the increase in demographics is taken into account, the Government is actually underspending and not making any real investment at all in tackling the crisis in health care. It would be funny if it was not so serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> This morning some Government Deputies are saying that, in comparison to my party's alternative budget, the Government outspent Sinn Féin on health. This is false and delusional. It is incredibly worrying that Government Deputies cannot read a budget expenditure sheet and have confused my party's additional increases, suggesting they are as poor as their total increase. Sinn Féin's alternative budget allocated an additional €403.5 million to health over and above demographics and the pay restoration of the Lansdowne Road agreement, which was costed at €1.2 billion. All of this was to be fully costed within the context of my party's wider alternative budget, inclusive of tax measures to fund these increases. We have outspent the Government on this because we know that health is in an emergency situation and it is a priority. There are severe pressures arising year after year, from the young and the old, on the demands on the crumbling services. I ask the Leader to clarify why the Sláintecare report was largely ignored in the budget. If he is unable to do so, I ask him to ask the Minister to come in and provide this House with an explanation.</p>

          <p eId="para_106">I raise this morning the need for the Leader, with his colleagues in Government, to take immediate action on the entire banking system of the country. I welcome a number of initiatives in yesterday's budget, including the housing strategic investment fund towards which the Government is putting €750 million and the announcement of the new Brexit loan scheme on the back of last year's budget's affordable loan scheme. We are like the mother trying to cajole her young child into eating his dinner with the spoon being an aeroplane. We are having to put funding into the banks to compensate them to reduce their interest rate to make these loans available for the people. We bailed out the banks. We will still be paying for that exercise for many years to come. We were told at the time that an effective functioning economy would not work without a banking system and yet we are, like the mother trying to cajole or cod the child into eating his vegetables, trying to persuade the banks to act. We are having to put incentives before them. We are having to put in funding to compensate them to reduce their interest rate. All the while, they are avoiding taxes - it was well documented recently - and hammering those who were on tracker mortgages. As my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, stated, they are now saying it was a mistake they made but, coincidentally, all the pillar banks happened to make the same mistake involving the same vulnerable sector at the same time.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">It is about time the Government introduced the necessary legislation. The banks need to be hauled in. They need to be doing the banking, not the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> The measures in the budget are very welcome. They are needed to stimulate areas that need stimulus, but we should not be putting money into loan schemes. Last year, the affordable loan scheme for the agriculture sector in particular was introduced. The pillar banks were signed up and I know for a fact that while a number of them just ticked the boxes to keep the Minister happy for the affordable loan process, they then gave short-term stocking loans as opposed to what the scheme was intended for and got their money back within a year. They had ticked the box for the Minister and moved on. If a proper banking system is working in any economy, they should be providing the stimulus.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> We talk about health services. I am aware of a primary care unit, which is badly needed, that is ready to commence. Everything is in order in terms of all the parties involved and planning permission, but the bank is not playing ball. It is time that we hauled them over the coals and whatever legislation is needed is introduced to ensure we have a proper functioning banking system, not fancy buildings with counters people are not allowed walk up to.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">In yesterday's budget, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal O'Donohoe, made reference to the new accident and emergency department at University Hospital Limerick, which is an outstanding facility but is only one part of the equation. The second part of the equation is the building of a 96-acute-bed unit alongside the new accident and emergency department. I hope that when the new capital plan is published, the 96-acute-bed unit on the University Hospital Limerick site will be included. A number of months ago, the HSE agreed to my request to provide more than €100,000 to allow the design phase of this 96-bed unit to get under way. That is now in place so no further time is being lost. I would like to see the funding provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"><b>
						</b> I will make a brief comment on the budget. First, the biggest issue with housing, apart from other issues, is supply. The measures introduced in the budget will bring about further supply. It is a three-pronged approach. The vacant site levy will ensure that people do not sit on sites and that they are either built on or sold for development. Second, there is a €750 million strategic investment fund available to couples and young people who are looking to purchase houses at a reasonable value. Third, the stamp duty now comes in line with that in the United Kingdom but if someone purchases a site and develops houses on the site, they can apply for a refund of the increased stamp duty paid. That has been lost in the debate. The measures that are being brought in will bring about additional housing, and supply is the key issue in housing.</p>

          <p eId="para_120"> I call for the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to come into the House because after the bluff and bluster from the Government and Fianna Fáil yesterday, I want to talk about the reality in Limerick. I cite a real life example of a 19 year old lady who is eight months pregnant and earns €100 a week, which was halved by the Leader's Government. She has to give €30 of that in housing assistance payment. She lives in a flea-infested hovel. She has to give another €45 each week to her landlord to make up the difference in terms of the HAP. When she went to the community welfare officer on two occasions she was told, six weeks before she is due to give birth, that she should declare herself homeless and move into a shelter. That is the reality of the Government's response on the ground. That lady has no support from family or anybody, and that is not her fault. It is what the community welfare officer said to her. She has no money each week to eat. Thankfully, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul intervened to ensure she has some food as of Monday. That is the reality on the ground for people in Limerick today, and it is nothing less than an absolute disgrace. I ask the Leader to bring the Minister into the House with the utmost urgency because our people are being let down daily by his Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">I, too, want to speak about the budget. I was very disappointed that post offices were not mentioned. We have 1,100 post offices in Ireland but there is fear of 400 being closed. A programme should have been put in place to keep extra services, whether through motor tax or tourism. We are promoting hubs through housing. Why not promote our rural post offices as tourist information centres where tourists can go to get information? That issue was neglected in the budget yesterday and that needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> There were great announcements in the budget about Leader. We are all involved in Leader. The Leader programme plays a major part in my local area but that programme started in 2014. It is now 2017 and not a penny for Leader has come from Government. Applications have been submitted for about 20 projects. Ten have been approved and not a penny has come into our local authority. I know for a fact that other local authorities have not seen a penny either.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> I say "Well done" to the Taoiseach on the new Department of Rural and Community Development. That is a good initiative but the Minister must do the job he is supposed to do and put the funding into local authorities. In my local authority, we were told that €624,830 was approved and would be given, with the possibility of approximately €1 million by the end of the year, but this has been going on for three years and we will be lucky to see the funding in 2018. It is important that in terms of new announcements in budgets, what has been already announced needs to be delivered to local authorities such as mine.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> The Leader might ask the Department that some sort of programme be put in place to save rural post offices thereby ensuring that the 400 post offices under threat will not close.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">Tá mé ag ardú ceiste anseo atá tromchúiseach go leor agus atá ardaithe agam roinnt uaireanta cheana. Some time ago we had a statement in the local media in Galway that the Sisters of Mercy are to transfer the ownership of the building at Lenaboy Castle, which was acquired by the order in 1925, to Galway City Council, along with a payment by the nuns of €750,000 for renovation and development. This was a protected structure on Taylor's Hill and it was run by the religious order as an orphanage, a children's home and an industrial school. Latterly, it was a HSE West social care centre for children and adolescents known as St. Anne's.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> I have raised previously my concerns about this venue. It is to be used by Galway City Council as a creative hub for arts groups and young people's groups. I have been approached by people who would have had connections to the home and I have also spoken to Catherine Corless, who brought to light the issues around the Tuam mother and baby home. We have concerns that there may well be a burial site at this place as well. I believe that before any development is allowed to go ahead, a fundamental archaeological survey must be done of this site. It is my understanding that Galway City Council may well have done that previously through its heritage officer and, if so, it should make the findings of that survey available. We should not have any development of a children's creative hub at that site until we are absolutely sure of what is on it. A more forensic archaeological investigation may be needed if anything is unearthed but from contacts Catherine Corless and I have had, we have serious concerns that there may well be another children's burial site at St. Anne's or at Lenaboy Castle. It is something that needs to be investigated. I call on the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, to examine this issue and when she is free to come into the House and update us on the work of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission, the supports that are being given to survivors, etc.</p>

What we must do is wear the green jersey, which Senator Daly does, in fairness, in the context of Brexit. The Taoiseach has made it quite clear that we do not want any return to a border on our island and there is unanimity on that issue in this House. Our aim is to ensure that the UK remains within the customs union or that a new customs union is developed.

          <p eId="para_142">Senator Lawless raised the very important issue of the human rights of the Rohingya people. The refugee crisis is a damning indictment of the Burmese authorities and a solution must be found immediately. Aung San Suu Kyi has to do more than condemn what is happening because it is within her gift to bring about change. I hope that our Government, through the United Nations, can play a role in providing support to the people to whom the Senator referred. A huge and appalling tragedy is unfolding before our eyes and collective action must be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> Senator Grace O'Sullivan raised the issue of Ibrahim Halawa. The delay in his release is unacceptable. I have spoken to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade about the matter. The Minister was also on "The Pat Kenny Show" on Newstalk this morning speaking about the issue. The delay is purely bureaucratic. The Egyptian authorities have taken the view that all of the detainees must be taken together and that they cannot deal with Ibrahim Halawa separately. The Minister and the Government have asked the Egyptian authorities to fast-track his release. There is daily communication between the Irish Government and the Egyptian authorities.

          <p eId="para_146">Senator Devine will be interested to know that the education budget will see a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio, more special needs assistants, more teachers, a return to the provision of career guidance as well as the building of new schools under the capital development plan. The Government of which Senator Ó Ríordáin was a member built more schools than any Government in modern times. I am a bit surprised that he did not see that in the Budget Statement. Notwithstanding that, his comments around the Right to Read campaign will be supported by all Members. Literacy is important and the library in Donaghmede to which the Senator referred is important in this context. I know that the Senator is leading a campaign focusing on that library. Libraries have always been at the heart of communities. They are an important and valuable asset and I certainly hope that the library in Donaghmede will be retained.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> Senator Byrne spoke about the Eurowings vote today involving Shannon Airport in Limerick, and I wish Shannon Airport well in that. I also join Senator Byrne in congratulating the communities in Limerick on the huge voluntary efforts they have made to keep the city and the towns in the county clean and vibrant. The Limerick Going for Gold campaign is wonderful and is strengthening those communities further. It is important to pay tribute to the volunteers who go out, as Senator Byrne has said, so early in the morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> Senator Davitt made reference to the stamp duty changes and the issue of land. The Finance Bill will be coming before the House for debate and it is important that the Senator would suggest any changes he considers necessary in the areas to which he referred during the debate on that legislation. I am happy to speak to the Senator following the Order of Business to arrange that a note be sent to him on the matter from the Department. In some cases, it is very much a matter for local authorities in terms of how land is zoned, but having said that, the Senator raises an important issue. While agricultural land is a vital and valuable part of our infrastructure, equally important is the need to develop land for housing. We must get that balance right but I would be happy to discuss this further with the Senator later.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> Senator Boyhan raised the issue of the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has announced the reopening of that scheme. In terms of the payments, it is disappointing that delays have occurred. Approximately 2.5% of GLAS I and GLAS II applicants have yet to receive payments. Only 0.5% of 2015 applicants are still awaiting payment, while 98% of payments for 2016 have been made. The issue causing the delays, as I understand it, is the lack of a farm nutrient management plan. I am happy to pursue the matter further with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on behalf of Senator Boyhan. I am also happy to arrange a debate on GLAS with the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> Senator Mulherin raised the issue of urology in University Hospital Galway. The facts of the case she outlined were disappointing to hear. I am happy to raise the matter with the Minister of Health. Senator Devine and I are going to lock horns yet again on the issue of health. I am disappointed that the Senator, who is a health professional herself, did not read the Budget Statement on health. I will repeat some points for her, in the hope that they will sink in. I welcome Senator Devine's new-found interest in the Sláintecare report, but as Senator Colm Burke rightly said here yesterday, Sinn Féin did not support Members of this Chamber being part of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare that produced the Sláintecare report. It is a case of crocodile tears for the Senator to come in here today and criticise-----</p>

It is a matter predominantly for the local authority, but the Minister, Deputy Zappone, will be in the House next week and we can have that discussion. The Senator can raise it with her as part of his contribution. It is an important and a sensitive issue which needs to be examined but I am not familiar with the case.</p>

        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" eId="spk_101">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Simon Coveney)<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T12:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_192">I am very pleased to participate, on behalf of the Government, in the making of statements in the Seanad on Northern Ireland. The discussion is timely, as this is perhaps the most critical phase for the devolved institutions under the Good Friday Agreement since their restoration just over ten years ago. Ten months have passed since they were last fully operational. That is a source of deep concern for the Government as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, as I believe it is for Members of this House. That is why we are having this debate. Most directly, it means that the people of Northern Ireland who provided a fresh mandate for a new Assembly and power-sharing Executive in elections in March are not being served by an elected and accountable devolved government, to which they are entitled under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> The Executive is responsible for taking what are very pressing budgetary and other decisions on public services and investments. A host of other important devolved matters and issues which impact on people's daily lives in Northern Ireland await attention, debate and decisions through the devolved institutions under the Good Friday Agreement. In the absence of an Executive, the North-South Ministerial Council is also unable to progress its essential work, as an integral part of the Good Friday Agreement, to deliver all-island co-operation across the sectors to the practical benefit of people living on the island, North and South. In addition, as we all know, the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union presents unprecedented challenges for Northern Ireland and the island as a whole. Phase one of the Article 50 negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom is well under way, dealing with the separation issues, including the Irish-specific concerns. There was further discussion of that issue as recently as yesterday. The Government is playing its role in the Article 50 negotiating process as a committed EU member state, working with all of our continuing EU partners and the EU institutions and with intensive and positive engagement with Mr. Michel Barnier and the Article 50 commission task force. However, absent this year has been a formal Executive voice to represent Northern Ireland's interests in the UK-EU exit process, as necessary, in Belfast, London, Brussels and elsewhere. That is also a cause of deep concern for the Government, given the breadth of shared interests on the island that need to be defended.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> The Government is keen and ready to continue the very valuable work that was commenced last year on a partnership basis with the Northern Ireland Executive through the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, to identify shared interests and a shared approach to seeking solutions to the challenges raised by the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union. At the highest level, our shared interest, North and South, is to protect the gains of the peace process founded on the Good Friday Agreement, including the open border. The Government is continuing to pursue that issue with the support and solidarity of our EU partners. It believes both Administrations on the island should work in a co-ordinated way, whenever possible, to address the generational challenge of Brexit for the island and for the peace process founded on the Good Friday Agreement. The fact is that without the Executive and the Assembly which are at the institutional heart of the Agreement the process will not be able to move forward as it should and must in order to deepen reconciliation, as the Agreement commits all parties to doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> It is in pursuit of a deeper peace and full reconciliation that successive Governments have worked for full implementation of all provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and the later agreements. This goal and duty is reflected in A Programme for a Partnership Government. It is something that I as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to pursue as a matter of the highest political priority, as did my predecessor. However, an Executive and an Assembly are necessary if critical outstanding issues from the agreements, including the Irish language, rights and legacy, are to be fully realised on an agreed basis. These are the major difficulties we face with the continuing absence of the Executive, the Assembly and the North-South Ministerial Council. Devolved government in Northern Ireland cannot move forward, nor can all-island co-operation take place through the NSMC. Northern Ireland's interests in dealing with Brexit cannot be fully represented and the peace process cannot move fully forward as it should. That position is not sustainable for much longer. As I have said, this is a most critical point for the devolved institutions under the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process as a whole. As co-guarantor of the Agreement, the Government has a responsibility to give every support and encouragement it can for the effective operation of all institutions, including the Assembly, the Executive and, of course, the North-South Ministerial Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> We have worked to this end throughout this year, with the British Government and the political parties, including in the discussions that took place between March and June at Stormont Castle, on outstanding commitments arising from previous agreements. As the Government has reported to the Houses of the Oireachtas over the course of the year, encouraging progress has been made on a number of the key issues. For instance, in dealing with the difficult legacy of the Troubles, something envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement and provided for within the framework of the Stormont House Agreement, there were intensive further discussions at Stormont Castle. Progress was made in dealing with a number of key difficulties with the legacy framework, from the time of the 2014 and 2015 discussions in Stormont House. The Government believes it is critical that we build on the momentum and we will continue to do so in the weeks and months ahead in order that the agreed legacy bodies can finally be fully established. That, alongside other essential legacy services such as inquests, will allow work to start to meet the legitimate needs and expectations of victims and survivors who have been left waiting for far too long.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> The political parties in Northern Ireland have been taking forward the discussions on forming a new Executive. Discussions on Executive formation took place between all parties at Stormont Castle between March and June. Following some further consultations between the parties over the summer, there has been intensified and sustained engagement in recent weeks between the DUP and Sinn Féin in order to resolve key differences which have proved to be an obstacle to the formation of an Executive. That is to be strongly welcomed. As the two parties mandated to lead the next Executive, they will need to establish a basis on which a new Administration can work, consistent with their mandates but also in accordance with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement of mutual respect, parity of esteem and genuine partnership. In my ongoing contacts with the parties I have underlined the risks that attach to a prolonged absence of the devolved institutions in the context of Brexit and the peace process overall. I have urged them to continue their engagement and seek routes to achieve the bigger goal of getting all institutions of the Good Friday Agreement operating fully again. I continue to work closely with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire, in this engagement with the parties. On 25 September the Taoiseach discussed in London with the Prime Minister, Mrs. May, the imperative of ensuring a way forward for the devolved institutions. The two Governments are at one in the view that all possible efforts must be made to support and encourage the parties to achieve the essential objective and form a new Executive, making good on the mandate given by the public in the Assembly elections in March. I welcome the statement made in this regard by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the House of Commons on Monday and his continued readiness to bring forward legislation to enable an Executive to be formed once an agreement has been reached. That needs to be supported. </p>
          <p eId="para_198"> The parties in Northern Ireland are continuing their discussions this week. I suspect they are meeting as we speak. I do not underestimate the real differences that still remain to be bridged if a new Executive is to be agreed. However, I believe they can be resolved if both parties are willing to work with one another. Time is now a very real factor with budgetary and other necessary decisions on public services building up, creating genuine pressures in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">These need to be addressed by elected and effective devolved government in Northern Ireland, as provided for in the agreement. The time to deliver that for the public in Northern Ireland and for the wider peace process is now.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> At this point, I believe that with a further step forward by the two main political parties there can be a basis for the necessary resetting of political relationships, including by addressing outstanding issues from previous agreements, which would get the devolved institutions of the Good Friday Agreement operating fully again on a sustainable basis, which is important for both parties. I am hopeful that the political parties will urgently and successfully conclude their discussions to open the way for a new Executive within the mandate of the current Assembly. That needs to happen sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> I would like to see a fully inclusive Executive, with all parties involved, including the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the UUP. That would be a much more balanced Executive than the previous one. The larger parties would accept that.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> I want to affirm to the House that I and the Government will continue to do everything possible to support that outcome. It should, in turn, open the way for the important next steps in the peace process which I am anxious to pursue on behalf of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> It is unusual for me to come to the House and read a speech as I have today. I am normally somewhat more engaging, but sensitive discussions are happening today. I urge people to be somewhat cautious in terms of how they approach this debate. We need to recognise that we are at a sensitive point.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> The DUP and Sinn Féin want to make the current negotiations work, but they face real challenges which are very political and difficult. We spent a long time facilitating bilateral discussions between the two parties over the summer. We want to see those conclude successfully sooner rather than later. That is why I am somewhat cautious in terms of what I am saying about the detail of what is being discussed because I do not think it would be helpful for me to be offering a running commentary today when we are trying to make progress with the two parties in Belfast.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> With that in mind, I will try to respond to any statements and suggestions for constructive questions from Senators. I look forward to hearing what they have to say.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarkDaly" eId="spk_102">
          <from>Senator Mark Daly<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T13:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_206">I thank the Minister for the update on his work and that of his Department regarding getting the Northern Executive up and running. I have some questions. If the Minister does not have the answers today, I ask him to send them to Senators at a later date.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> How many officials in the Department are dealing directly with officials in Brussels regarding the impact of Brexit on the joint bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement? How many meetings have they held? What will happen to the secretariat in Armagh if there is a hard Brexit and a hard border? What will happen to the 104 organisations which rely on the Good Friday Agreement?</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> When I joined the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, I suggested it carry out a detailed analysis on what is yet to be implemented in the Good Friday Agreement. One would think that would be common sense. Instead, we received a press release from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We sought a line-by-line and issue-by-issue analysis, equivalent to the Fresh Start Stormont House agreement. I ask that, as a courtesy to the joint committee, the Minister ask the Department to provide the committee with an actual line-by-line analysis of what needs to be done. We do not wish to force that request to a motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> The two recent elections in Northern Ireland have had a radical effect on the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process. The DUP vote was only 1,000 ahead of Sinn Féin, which had a dramatic effect on unionism. </p>
          <p eId="para_210"> I have a letter to the Attorney General from the solicitors for Raymond McCord, inviting the Government to be a party to a case in the High Court in Belfast in November. He is a unionist whose son was murdered by the UVF. The member of the UVF who ordered his murder was a paid informant of the RUC.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> Mr. McCord is taking this case not because he wants to see a united Ireland - he does not - but because he wants to stop both sides using the issue for their own electoral gain. The case is seeking clarity from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland as to how the Secretary of State would determine whether a referendum on unity would be called under Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> The Government is invited to participate in the case, thereby fulfilling the constitutional obligations outlined by a former Attorney General, the late Rory Brady. Is the Government going to be a party to the case? The Office of the Chief State Solicitor has responded acknowledging the letter and initiative, but has not given a determination.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> The UK elections, which were disastrously called by Theresa May, resulted in Northern Ireland being further polarised and the Tory Government relying on the DUP to stay in power and to survive. As a result, the Good Friday Agreement has been held hostage and direct rule cannot, unfortunately, be far away. If this continues, and given that Brexit is around the corner, the future for Northern Ireland is neither clear nor bright.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> If the UK does not sign up to a single market or customs union, the only way Northern Ireland and the Border can remain open to people and goods is following a referendum, as allowed for under the Good Friday Agreement, which will allow the people of Northern Ireland to remain in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> I happened to be in the Horse and Jockey in Tipperary during the Minister's election campaign when Fine Gael voters voted. I was glad to hear that the Minister won the majority of their support. I saw his poster which stated "Simon Coveney: Uniting Ireland". I heard him speak about the issue on the radio. I have not heard him speak about it since. I know it is not a slogan.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> The Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement appointed me to compile a report on what needs to be done by the State in order to secure what was voted on by the people of Ireland, namely, the amendment to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and how to achieve that aim. The report was unanimously adopted by all members of the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> Other than the New Ireland Forum 33 years ago, I could not find any other report or analysis from any Department or the Oireachtas on achieving the main aim of the State. In the report I quoted Mr. Justice Richard Humphreys and his book, <i>Countdown to Unity: Debating Irish Reunification</i>, in which he discussed the political establishment not wanting to touch the issue of a united Ireland. He outlined the logic to this quite clearly. He said the reason they want a perpetual state of the <i>status quo </i>is because of the fear of a return to violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> That is a legitimate concern. It is why I asked President Obama's senior policy adviser on the National Security Council, Michael Ortiz, who is an expert on countering violent extremism, to write a report for our committee on what needs to be done in order to ensure that there is no outbreak of violence in the run-up to a referendum. He said it is quite simple. We have to provide jobs and educational opportunities to the most disadvantaged areas in Northern Ireland. That is why the committee recommended the establishment of a task force in respect of that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> Of the ten poorest regions in Northern Europe, nine are in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland is one of them. The United Nations human development index ranks the Republic sixth in the world in terms of health, education and income. The Oireachtas Library and Research Service ranked Northern Ireland 44th on the same scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> Dr. Kurt Hubner, of British Columbia University, in an analysis for the report I compiled said there would be a benefit to the whole island economy of €35.6 billion in the first eight years after reunification. Since the report was published and launched by the committee, I have met unionist politicians, religious leaders and senior paramilitaries members in the loyalist community. Many believe that there will be a referendum within the next ten years. They have concerns about that, as one can imagine.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> As a result of the draft report, I was contacted by a senior member of the Ulster Defence Regiment, UDR. Once upon a time it was the largest regiment in the British Army. I asked him to make a submission to the report, which he did.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">It has concerns about land ownership and whether people would be asked to return the land given during the Plantations in retribution for former members of the security forces who had been involved in collusion, about which the Minister spoke. It is also concerned about how the British identity would be protected and respected after reunification. These are legitimate and heartfelt concerns held by those communities and there is an obligation on the State to address them with generosity and a realistic solution. That is why one of the key recommendations made in the report I compiled is the establishment of a new Ireland forum 2 to address all of these concerns and set out a vision for Ireland for the next 100 years to accommodate all people on the island. If the Minister truly believes in reunifying Ireland, as the slogan on his poster states, I hope he will establish new Ireland forum 2. I hope he will put in place the policies needed to reunify the people of Ireland in peace and prosperity. He will be told by many in his party and the Government to keep the <i>status quo</i> and not to go near the main aim of achieving the State's objective as outlined in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. I hope he will ignore those who do not want to see change and wish the <i>status quo</i> to continue. I hope he will listen instead to the advice of the person voted by the people as Irishman of the 20th century, T. K. Whitaker, who in November 1968, on the eve of the Troubles, gave advice to another Cork man, Mr. Jack Lynch, in a note: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_223">We were, therefore, left with only one choice, a policy of seeking unity in Ireland between Irishmen. Of its nature this is a long-term policy, requiring patience, understanding and forbearance, and resolute resistance to emotionalism and opportunism. It is not the less patriotic for that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_103">
          <from>Senator Michael McDowell<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_224">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this subject, I also welcome the Minister. I accept fully what he says about the requirement in current circumstances to remain at the level of generality for fear of compromising delicate negotiations which are in train.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> Arising from the remarks of Senator Mark Daly, it seems that there are several issues of which we should be conscious. First, it is all very well to talk about a referendum and making preparations for one, but the precondition for holding a referendum under the Good Friday Agreement is that it appears to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that there is a majority who wish to see a change in the status of Northern Ireland. It is not that people would like to have a referendum. In that respect, we can learn a little from what is happening in Catalonia. It is one thing for people to say they favour the holding of a referendum, it is another matter completely to say they want a change in the status of Northern Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_226"> I do not believe talk of a referendum at this point is justified or justifiable. In that respect, I differ from Senator Mark Daly because I believe that, although Northern Ireland is coming into balance demographically - the Catholic community is at somewhere between 43% and 47% or 48%, while the so-called Protestant community, if one can use that label, is of the same dimension; therefore, a balance between the two traditional major groups in Northern Ireland is coming into view - it does not follow that the majority would favour a united Ireland or that public opinion in Northern Ireland is at tipping point. All of the public opinion surveys that have been conducted indicate that, notwithstanding the huge demographic change that has taken place in Northern Ireland and that the old 2:1 hegemony of unionism, Protestantism and ascendancy versus Catholic nationalism and republicanism in Northern Ireland has disappeared, that does not mean that there is a will in Northern Ireland for either a referendum or a united Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_227"> I agree fully with Senator Mark Daly that we should consider the words of the late T. K. Whitaker, a former Member of this House, who counselled against opportunistic emotional approaches to Northern Ireland and that the policy of the State should and must be towards unity but that it should be persistent, patient and measured. That is not because I fear the reunification of the country. I earnestly hope and aspire for it. However, at the moment the major task confronting nationalists and republicans on the island is fostering the reconciliation process in Northern Ireland. I fully accept what Senator Mark Daly said about the calamitous effects on the North of Brexit and the pessimistic view one would have to have of the prospects for Northern Ireland if a hard Brexit takes place. I am very hopeful, however, that there will be a solution to the Brexit matter - a soft Brexit in which there will be an analogue to a customs union partnership between the European Union and the United Kingdom and that, therefore, it will not be necessary to have tariffs on the Border. That is something for which I earnestly hope. I believe it can be achieved and the Government should be working towards that end. There are people in the European Union who are not as keen on or as bothered about it. A small minority still have a tone of punishing the United Kingdom for leaving the European Union and making it difficult for it to do a sensible deal with it. Guy Verhofstadt, who has a role in the European Parliament, and Jean-Claude Juncker gravitated towards the proposition that even if the United Kingdom changed its mind, it could not come back on current terms into the European Union but would have to become an integrationist state in order to remain part of it. That is part of the same psychology that they really want to see the back of the United Kingdom in the European Union. That is a dangerous sentiment in some circles in Brussels.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> Ireland must take a line in the European Union which is directed towards having the softest possible Brexit. We must be courageous in doing so and not be afraid of being seen to be under the influence of some people in the United Kingdom in seeking that way out. It is in our interests that there be a soft Brexit and a partnership between the United Kingdom and the European Union. We must very patiently but with determination seek that way out as our preferred option and make it clear that is where we are going because the damage caused by a hard Brexit on both parts of the island would be almost incalculable and its capacity to drive the island further and further apart, especially if the United Kingdom were, for instance, to engage in the provision of state aids to attract industry and commerce from this state into the North, would be very significant. The tragedy of the Brexit referendum is that it puts pressure on the political faultlines between the two parts of the island. </p>
          <p eId="para_229"> If we are in the business of reconciliation which I believe is the ultimate republican virtue, we should take a long hard look - I say this particularly to members of Sinn Féin - at how reconciliation would, in fact, be brought about.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">We had a civil war in this country. Something I discovered in Cathal Brugha Barracks one day was a piece of paper written by Garret FitzGerald's father directing the destruction of all files relating to military tribunals and such by fire on the day that it was anticipated that power would be handed over to Fianna Fáil in 1932. Some people might ask if it is not scandalous that our history was going into a bonfire but the symbolism was that he did not wish for this bitterness to continue. The generations on both sides which followed the Civil War, perhaps by their silence, effected reconciliation.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> The constant drumbeat about commemorating people who lost their lives on one side in the Troubles is not designed to bring about reconciliation on the other side. One does not see all these parades or roadside monuments to remember Ulster Defence Regiment, UDR, men or women who lost their lives and there is a divisive effect on the minds of people who see one commemoration taking place in one county or district of a county and who know that there were other people who are being forgotten. I do not mind people showing solidarity with the political movement from which they come but every action has some kind of political reaction. I want to emphasise that if we are to reconcile the two communities in Northern Ireland, it is not going to be a see-saw 51% to 49% vote in some referendum held in the next ten to 15 years. That is not how a united Ireland is going to come about. It will come about with a confluence of economic interests, a history of working together on joint projects of joint concern, and a genuine defusing of those aspects of the political culture of Northern Ireland that divide people.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> I want to address what Senator Mark Daly said. There has been an abstinence of political activity here relating to the nuts and bolts of Irish unity but part of that is explained by the need to put mutual collaboration between the two communities in Northern Ireland and the establishment of mutual trust and conciliation ahead of the relentless ambition towards the earliest possible establishment of Irish unity. There is nothing dishonourable in it. It is perfectly reasonable in the circumstances. It is a matter of what one's priorities are. My priority as an Irish republican is to see reconciliation in Northern Ireland. It is not to start planning or speaking constantly about the earliest opportunity to have a referendum because, at the moment, I am conscious of the fact that if a referendum were held in Northern Ireland in the next five years, the proposal for Irish unity would be beaten two to one. People here who forget that fact endanger the other, much more important point, which is to conciliate the two communities in Northern Ireland.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NealeRichmond" eId="spk_104">
          <from>Senator Neale Richmond<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_233">I am deputising on behalf of my colleague, Senator Joe O'Reilly, our regular spokesman on foreign affairs, who cannot be here since he is representing Ireland at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. I sincerely welcome the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, to the House and thank him for his remarks. As this is the first time I have had the opportunity to engage with him in his new portfolio, I wish him all the best in his vitally important role.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> The current impasse in Northern Ireland is understandably of major concern to all in this House as well as to many people across this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland itself. I welcome that, as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is determined to do everything in its power to ensure that all of its institutions operate effectively, including the devolved assembly and power-sharing Executive in Northern Ireland and, vitally, the North-South Ministerial Council. I am reassured by the Minister in his comments that some progress is being made in the current discussions between parties and I join him in welcoming the sustained engagement between the DUP and Sinn Féin, particularly over the last number of weeks. I join with many others in hoping for a speedy resolution at this sensitive time, although I also add my support for the idea of including political parties beyond the two main parties in Northern Ireland, such as the Alliance Party, the Ulster Unionist Party, UUP, the SDLP and other members of the Assembly. I was also heartened to hear in recent days from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, that he is confident that a deal can be reached in the near future. I fear, in the context of Brexit, that this deal would perhaps be too late to ensure that Northern Ireland's voice is heard properly, particularly at Westminster and in Whitehall.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> Brexit will be a monumental challenge for this island in particular as our Border, post-Brexit, will become the only land frontier between the European Union and United Kingdom. The relatively normal and harmonious situation that we are now used to can and will change utterly in the case of either a hard Brexit or, even worse, a no deal scenario. The Border region, both North and South, would be devastated economically and socially if this was to occur. I and other Senators who sat on our Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union heard at length from scores of organisations about the difficulties that it would present for every facet of life. Everything must be done to prepare for, but hopefully avoid, the worst-case scenario. It is in that regard that a rapid restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive is now more important than possibly ever before. With the looming European Council meeting to decide if enough progress has been made between European and British negotiators on key issues such as the Irish question, I implore all those in this House and beyond to use every tool at their disposal to encourage compromise and make sure that Northern Ireland's voice is heard strongly. Let us give the 1.8 million people of Northern Ireland the opportunity to have their voice heard fully in the Brexit negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> In my recent work on a European level, I have been confronted by many European colleagues and indeed domestic stakeholders who have queried if this Government has focused too much on Northern Ireland so far in the Brexit process when wider issues such as trade are also vitally important. While I agree, of course, on the importance of agreeing a good, open free trade agreement between the EU and UK post-Brexit, I am sure this is a priority for all EU member states that enjoy, to varying degrees, a good trading relationship with the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> However, Northern Ireland presents a unique problem for the post-Brexit process which Ireland is most exposed to. Ireland is duty-bound to push to ensure there is a positive resolution to it or, in reality, that the amount of damage caused by Brexit is simply limited. A key stumbling block to any future relationship is customs, and the Government is wholly correct to continue to push for the UK to either remain in the existing customs union or for a new EU-UK customs union to be agreed upon. There are no technological solutions to the Border issue. The return of any border, soft, hard, movable or electronic would be a massive negative backward step.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> I thank the Minister for his frank and clear engagement here this afternoon. I wish him and all interested parties the best of luck in the coming weeks. I repeat my call for every effort to be made to restore the institutions in the North. On behalf of my colleague, Senator O'Reilly, I echo his many concerns about the particular Border region in the post-Brexit era as it relates to his home area of Cavan-Monaghan.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancesBlack" eId="spk_105">
          <from>Senator Frances Black<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_239">I welcome the Minister. I have always had a great interest in the situation in the North. I previously mentioned my strong family links to the North, so it is a very personal issue for me and is very close to my heart. My work with the RISE Foundation has often brought me to the North, where I have worked with cross-community organisations. That was of great interest to me and the cross-community project was fascinating. It was very powerful from a therapeutic point of view. I know it is very difficult for any work to be done at the moment because we have devolved institutions. I believe that they can only function if there is equality. We have to look at issues relating to same-sex marriage and the Irish language Act. I am happy to hear today that progress is being made in this area and I am delighted that there will be and have been talks.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> I will talk about Brexit and its implications for the North and the Border region, in particular, which are very serious and I believe it poses a great challenge to the island of Ireland, both economically and politically. A large majority of the population on the island are in favour of remaining in the EU and are against any imposition of a border. If the UK leaves the customs union, it is very likely that there will be a border and this will be incredibly harmful to the agricultural sector and other industries in the North. It could also pose a real danger to the peace process. It is essential that we work hard to avoid a hard border. I know that the Minister knows all of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">It is absolutely vital. CSO data show that approximately 15,000 people cross the Border every single day, and we have to ensure that this is not disrupted. We are talking about people’s lives - relationships, businesses, and everything else that demands their going from North to South easily, or <i>vice versa</i>. </p>
          <p eId="para_242"> It goes without saying that, in all of this, we have to make sure that the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are always respected. It is a fantastic agreement. The Good Friday Agreement has been the bedrock of peace, stability and reconciliation in the North of Ireland and any final Brexit deal needs to be mindful of this. We must ensure that the status of the North is not changed without the consent of a majority of the people as this change of status would be in contravention of the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> There is a case for a unique solution or special deal for the North. We really need to focus on building a cross-community approach to this, which the Minister mentioned in his speech, and ensuring that everyone has an opportunity to input. Much of the public debate has been around avoiding a hard Border, either across the island of Ireland or down the Irish Sea. The only sure way to avoid either of these outcomes is for the UK as a whole to remain in the customs union with the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> We should also be clear that EU funding has been vital for many community services and initiatives in the North of Ireland, and we cannot let those projects just fall away once the UK leaves the EU. Despite the formal end of the conflict, a substantial proportion of the adult population continues to suffer the adverse mental health effects of chronic trauma exposure. This is where I did the work with the The Rise Foundation. It is likely that the legacy of ill mental health associated with the conflict, if not adequately addressed, will endure for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> As a member of the cross-party Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, I recently organised a trip to meet cross-community groups in north Antrim and Belfast. All of the groups expressed concern about the impact of Brexit on their communities. One of the groups with which I have worked, called Bridge of Hope, is a community health and well-being service based in north Belfast that supports individuals affected by the conflict and poor physical and emotional health. It expressed concern that it may not get similar funding from the UK Government when its European funding stops in 2020 and that this could lead to the cancellation of services in one of the most deprived areas of Belfast. We cannot let these people down.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> The EU-funded PEACE programme has provided over €2.2 billion for cross-Border projects on education, young people, shared spaces and relationship building. This has played a hugely important role in addressing the trauma and legacy mental health issues that have remained as a result of the conflict. Unless properly addressed, these issues can be longstanding and do untold damage to families and communities. We cannot allow this to happen. This funding must be maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> The reality is that there are still many legacy issues that need to be addressed before society can move on. The legacy issue has to be properly funded and brought to a conclusion. The onus is on the Irish Government to ensure that the British Government plays its part and accepts its role and responsibility in dealing with legacy issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_248"> It is also vital that we maintain common standards and approaches across the entire island in key areas such as environmental protection, which is an area that I am particularly interested in, healthcare, education and human rights. This is particularly clear when it comes to the environment. It seems very possible that the UK may no longer be bound by key EU environmental directives post-Brexit and this has caused a great degree of uncertainty.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> Environmental issues by their nature transcend borders and there is a big overlap on issues such as biodiversity, waterways and air quality. We need a co-ordinated, consistent approach across the whole island, treating it as a single bio-geographic unit and realising that our rivers run across borders. British Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK will remain a leading actor on climate change. We have to ensure that this means no slipping in standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> Similarly, this all-island approach must be taken for human rights protection too. If the UK withdraws from the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights or the European Convention on Human Rights, we must ensure that they are not replaced with a bill of rights which is watered down and less far-reaching. We simply cannot row back on people’s rights. Human rights protections must be equivalent on both sides of the Border. This is outlined in the Good Friday Agreement and we need to maintain it. It was great to see the dismantling of a peace wall in Belfast in recent weeks. It is to be hoped that this was the first of many. These barriers must be abolished and communities have to learn to live together. </p>
          <p eId="para_251"> In the past number of years some people have been marginalised and imprisoned without charge for years. The case of Tony Taylor comes to mind. He is incarcerated in Maghaberry Prison. His wife outlined his awful living conditions when she presented to the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. The mistreatment of prisoners has long been a cause of unrest and must not become a threat to the peace process. All politicians should make their voices heard in calling for his release as no evidence has been produced to justify his detention.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> The abandonment of the Six Counties in 1922 has left a deep scar in the Irish psyche. I believe that it has a parallel with the guilt felt by parents who abandon a child. The Minister may not like me saying it but that is how I feel. I also believe that the main southern parties have an obligation to organise throughout the Thirty-two Counties and advance their stated objective of the reunification of Ireland. The onus is on all people on this island to establish a nation that respects the traditions of all communities and creates a country of equals.</p>

          <from>Senator Frank Feighan<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_253">I commend the work of our Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, for his ongoing work with all the parties in trying to restore the political institutions in the North. I know this Government is determined, as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, to ensure that all the institutions are working effectively, including a devolved assembly and power-sharing Executive in Northern Ireland along with the North-South Ministerial Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> There has been much talk of a united Ireland and we must ask ourselves what it is we want. Nearly 100 years ago my grandfather, James Feely, was a Sinn Féin councillor and a member of the IRA. He was arrested for a raid on Rockingham House for arms and guns. He went to Dublin on the train and 2,000 people saw those men off to be tried and sent to Mountjoy Prison. He joined the hunger strike with Austin Stack and they were granted their political demands. He was then sent to Belfast to be tried, where he was imprisoned. I, therefore, wonder what is a united Ireland. Is a united Ireland a single sovereign state? I have noticed how Sinn Féin does not talk about a united Ireland but about unity. We must look at it from a different point of view. We need to unite the minds of the people. We have one Ireland, but perhaps it is not the united Ireland that people have been talking about for the past 100 years. </p>
          <p eId="para_255"> At the same time that my grandfather was carried shoulder-high, 126 young men from my town in Boyle went to fight for Home Rule or whatever and never returned home. We forgot about these young men. Was that the united Ireland that we wanted? We have airbrushed them out of our history. The past 15 or 20 years, we have come to remember and commemorate the sacrifice and the lives of men who were Irish and of my DNA but who, because of some event in history in 1916, of which we are very proud and which we have commemorated, we have simply airbrushed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> It is not a one-way street. A united Ireland has to be a two-way street, which is why I believe we need to do a lot more to reach out to unionism. We need to do an awful lot more to reach out and work on the relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom from a political perspective and in terms of a friendship.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> I have chaired the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and am still a member of the committee. Senator Black's trip to Rathlin island and Northern Ireland was positive and beneficial and we learned a lot. We need to do an awful lot more of that. We will be in Liverpool this weekend at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly. It is a forum for good. It brings politicians from all sides together. I have noticed in Westminster, where there are 800 or so in the House of Lords and 600 or 700 in the other House, that there is huge goodwill towards the island of Ireland. That goodwill was not there when bombs were going off in London, Birmingham and Northern Ireland. We have come to a stage now where there is a huge amount of goodwill.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> We speak of the Irish caucus in Washington. There is an Irish caucus on the next island which is made up of men and women who come from Roscommon, Northern Ireland and elsewhere. We need to work with them. That is why I am bringing perhaps 20 or 30 Oireachtas Members to Westminster on 6 November. It is because that is where those relationships are built up.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The best day was the day of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which was signed 33 years ago. When one looks at 100 years and 33 years, one can see it is a third of 100 years. That agreement gave us a say in the affairs of Northern Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_260"> We are moving in the right direction and all the parties are working together. When we talk about a united Ireland, we need to unite the people of Ireland. We need one Ireland. There are people who automatically look away when we talk about it so we must choose our language correctly. I wish the Minister every success. I was in Manchester last week at that famous breakfast with Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill. It was frosty to a certain extent but one could see that the two leaders were trying to work together. We need to give them as much space as possible and we need to get the institutions up and running. Again, we have a role. Not all of us think the same way but the role is to have peace on the island of Ireland and peace for our neighbours. We have come a long way in the past 32 years since the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</p>

I share the sentiments expressed by the Minister regarding tempering and considering our remarks and contributions today given the live talks and negotiations. I am sure it was a sincere and genuine mistake on the part of Senator Richmond but these statements are not statements on foreign affairs; they are statements on Northern Ireland and that is how we should approach it when we come into this Chamber.

          <p eId="para_263">I appreciate that fully but I thought it was important to say it.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> Reconciliation was referred to by Senators McDowell and Feighan in terms of what needs to happen. I agree with Senator McDowell, which does not happen very often, that it is a core tenet of Irish republicanism and a core tenet of my Irish republicanism and the republicanism of my party. If Senator Feighan wants to know what kind of united Ireland we aspire to, he should take the proclamation down off the wall and read it because it is all there, including the issue of reconciliation. If we are talking about Sinn Féin's record and the record of republicans relating to reconciliation, I do not think anyone has set a better example or a better trajectory on that path than the late Martin McGuinness who on several occasions famously met with Queen Elizabeth II, the commander in chief of the British armed forces. He led a Sinn Féin delegation to Messines and the Somme where he laid a wreath at the Ulster Memorial Tower. In my capacity as Lord Mayor of Belfast, I laid a wreath at the Cenotaph in memory of all the people mentioned by Senator Feighan and indeed those from my city who lost their lives in the First World War.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> All of this feeds into the broader political issues we have faced in recent months. It has all been done with zero reciprocation. We stretch ourselves to attend civic events at Belfast City Hall for the signing of the Ulster Covenant or the Battle of the Somme but when there is an historic event, the first of its kind, at Belfast City Hall to mark the centenary of the Easter Rising, unionist politicians refuse to attend, therefore, leading to our President not attending that event, which was a slap in the face to nationalists and those nationally minded people in the city of Belfast and across Northern Ireland. If we are going to lecture people on reconciliation, we must see that reconciliation is a multi-way process that involves more than just republicans, who I believe have not just led on the issue of reconciliation but have lived and are living that reconciliation, difficult as it is at times. </p>
          <p eId="para_266"> Regarding Senator McDowell's remarks on the Border poll, it is fair to say that Brexit has changed everything. Demography is changing. The Unionist political majority in Northern Ireland has ended and I do not foresee it coming back. He references a series of polls. The only poll I know of involves that very well-known and balanced publication <i>The Belfast Telegraph</i>, which surveyed a couple of thousand people so I do not know where the evidence that there would be no desire for either a poll or a discussion on unity comes from. We should be preparing for that. As Senator Mark Daly rightly says, we are constitutionally obliged to prepare for that. The Good Friday Agreement allows for that so why would we not at least begin a national dialogue? We have facilitated it around Brexit, which has changed the political paradigm on the island so why would these Houses not consider the formation of a joint Oireachtas committee to look at the reunification of the country, be it a new Ireland forum or a civic dialogue? </p>
          <p eId="para_267"> I do not expect the Minister to comment on the specifics of the Irish Language Act and the ongoing discussions but it is a very important issue and worthy of comment and contribution in this House. I welcome the Minister's very clear public contribution on his behalf and on behalf of the Government that lends support to the majority of MLAs and political parties in Northern Ireland for a stand-alone rights-based Irish Language Act. It is supported by 50 out of 90 MLAs in Northern Ireland and the majority of the parties there and was agreed at St Andrews ten years ago. An Dream Dearg, Conradh na Gaeilge, schools, sporting clubs, community groups, families and many more from all over Ireland have come together and taken to the streets to show the vibrancy, dynamism, youthfulness, inclusivity and diversity of the Irish-speaking community. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, has refused thus far to meet with representatives of the Irish language sector. I do not think that is helpful or conducive to the kind of negotiation we want to see concluded. Even Arlene Foster and the DUP have met those representatives so I think the Minister would agree with me that it is an unacceptable and untenable position and one that causes deep offence to the broader public when the Secretary of State does not extend that basic civility to those representative bodies. Perhaps the Minister will consider raising this privately with Secretary of State Brokenshire. </p>
          <p eId="para_268"> In 2006 and 2007, there were 3,660 children at Irish medium schools. This increased to 5,873 last year, up 60.46%. Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta predicts that by 2021, there will be 7,220 children receiving education through the medium of Irish, a rise of 97.23% from 2006. As the Minister knows, it is these children that the implementation of an Irish Language Act is for. The symbolic and practical nature and outworking of an Acht na Gaeilge will have a positive and affirming impact on the lives of these children, their families and their neighbourhoods as well as the broader society in Northern Ireland. The clear support of the Minister and Government for that demand is very welcome among Irish speakers and those who cherish and respect the Irish national identity and I commend the Minister for that. </p>
          <p eId="para_269"> On the issue of citizenship, the Minister has perhaps seen me tagging him on Twitter over the past couple of nights. I welcome his letter, which I received the other day, directing officials to assist in the case of Emma and Jake DeSouza. Their plight involves an application for a residency visa for Jake, who is a US citizen. Emma is an Irish citizen resident in Northern Ireland who is currently refusing the obligation being placed on her by the British Home Office to renounce British citizenship, a citizenship with which she has never identified or held as under the rights afforded to her under the Good Friday Agreement, she is solely an Irish citizen. We have seen another highly publicised case over the past few days that saw another Belfast couple face similar difficulties and anxieties while applying for a visa from the British Home Office simply for asserting a right to be an Irish citizen. Yesterday, I wrote to the British Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, encouraging her to ensure that when dealing with visa applications from Northern Ireland, Home Office officials are fully briefed and trained up on the rights of people in Northern Ireland to be Irish citizens and so that, hopefully, they can prevent any further undue anxiety or stress as a result of this ignorance of the Good Friday Agreement. Perhaps the Minister and his officials might raise this with the British Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_270"> Partitionism is not just mechanical. It does not just intrude in the mechanics and logistics of our lives. A psychology of partitionism prevails. When the Good Friday Agreement gave us citizenship and afforded us the right to participate in the life of the Irish nation, it never said that Northern Ireland was perpetually settled and done. Conan Doherty, an author writing for, of all publications, <i>SportsJOE.ie</i>, wrote regarding James McClean and the Ireland match that "[I]t wasn't a tactical decision by players to join Ireland because they couldn't get onto the north's side". </p>
          <p eId="para_271">It is not a bloody decision; one is either Irish or one is not. A person does not have to think about it. Whether it was for a cheap laugh, these great servants of Ireland should not have swipes taken at them after doing what they did for their country in such an important battle. James McClean grew up with just as much love and fire and just as many dreams to play for Ireland as David Meyler. Derry is as Irish as Cork. That is the reality for many of us; it is cultural, psychological, social and political. If we are to ask the British Government and unionism to respect our place as Irish citizens, people and figures, we need to have a serious conversation about how we reconcile people in the South with those of us in the North who are Irish and how our citizenship is treated with equal status.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianODomhnaill" eId="spk_110">
          <from>Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_272">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire fá choinne an díospóireacht seo ar chúrsaí Tuaisceart na hÉireann agus an dóigh ina bhfuil idirdhealú á dhéanamh ar na deacrachtaí polaitiúla atá ann faoi láthair. Tá lúcháir orm go bhfuil an deis seo againn a leithéid de dhíospóireacht a bheith againn.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> I welcome the Minister and want to add my tuppence worth to the debate. I listened in the office to the Minister's contribution in which he outlined that sensitive discussions were taking place. He said we should be aware of this and temper our remarks with that in mind. That is what I intend to do. However, there are matters that must be aired. I know that, depending on one's political persuasion, this may be seen as an opportunity to look at the issue of a united Ireland. However, that is a much more complex issue. Before we go to the end of that road or bóithrín, there are many issues to be addressed in the North. I say this as somebody who lived there for four years while attending university. I have strong links with the North of Ireland, through relatives, political links and sporting connections.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> To say the position in Northern Ireland is dysfunctional would be an understatement. I know a number of school principals to whom I spoke over the summer. They do not even know what their budgets are from week to week. As a consequence, they cannot hire staff. Such a position is detrimental to people with special needs and so on and that is only in the education sphere. It goes right across the board into the health service and so on. We are looking at legacy matters that have been discussed, apart from the Irish language issue. It was my understanding that was agreed to at St. Andrew's, but now it is being left to the grown-ups at Stormont to try to deal with the baton they have been passed. Unfortunately, however, they are unable to do so. Has there been direct dialogue between the Minister or his officials and the Democratic Unionist Party on the Irish language issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> There are other legacy matters to be dealt with, including the need to establish a truth commission to try to provide some solace for the families that lost loved ones during the Troubles, during which over 3,600 people were murdered, not to mention those who were maimed. One individual living in my constituency in County Donegal lost his wife during the Troubles because of collusion by the police force in Belfast which provided information for one of the Ulster Volunteer Force, UVF, brigades. It tried to shoot him at point blank range and shot his wife dead in August 1988. I raised the matter with the previous Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, who was more than helpful in the matter. Such issues must be addressed and the electorate in the North is seeking answers to such questions. Not having an effective and working Executive at Stormont is disrespectful to the electorate in the North which is in a state of flux. If an agreement is not reached forthwith, there will be social and economic consequences for every community across the North. The Irish language is an important matter, so too are the people who are trying to get hospital appointments and whose kids are seeking approval to receive the help of special needs assistants. There are school principals waiting to have their budgets approved. There are, therefore, key issues that need to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> I appeal to both parties to get on with it and get the institutions up and running. We know that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Brokenshire, has indicated that we are heading towards direct rule in the coming weeks if Sinn Féin and the DUP cannot come to an agreement. A serious coming together must happen. If there is not an opportunity for the two Governments to impose pressure on the DUP and Sinn Féin to agree to provide latitude to enable the institutions to come together, there will be an urgent need to have an independent broker, whether it be a special envoy from the United States or somebody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> The deprivation indexes in the North are shocking. There are more multi-millionaires in Belfast than in many cities across England, Wales and Scotland - it is third on the list - and most of them are not Catholic. When one digs into the figures, in Belfast alone, 80% of the deprived population in Belfast alone, in economic terms, are Catholic. There is a serious need for the divvying up of the available resources for those who need them in the North. It is time those in Stormont got on with dealing with the real matters that affect people week in and week out. The posturing that has been ongoing since the election is not helping anyone. Sinn Féin is doing its utmost in that regard. The DUP must engage. Whatever needs to happen must happen. Direct rule would be an absolute disaster at a time when Brexit has been thrown into the equation as another factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> There are many concerns and the Minister has a major task ahead of him. I wish him well in the discussions that will take place in the coming weeks.</p>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Simon Coveney)<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_279">I thank Members for being reasonable in their comments and not raising matters unnecessarily that might cause difficulties in the context of other discussions that are ongoing. This is Parliament and we must be able to speak openly, but at the same time people must be conscious of other discussions that have been ongoing for quite some time. They have been ongoing for months at this stage and although progress is being made, difficulties are being posed for both parties and their leaderships.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> I will start with Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill's comments. Most Members of this House do not need to be reminded of the consequences of direct rule for Northern Ireland. It would be devastating if it were to happen, not just in the context of Brexit but also in the context of community relations and the need to find pragmatic and practical ways of reconciling. Political leaders must show the many who follow them how to behave, interact and build trust and faith between two communities that come from very different places on many issues. Since becoming Minister, I have tried to spend as much time as I can north of the Border, speaking to people on the streets of Derry, Belfast and elsewhere. I took up the invitation from Ms Arlene Foster to bring my family to the North to spend a weekend there. If I might be forgiven for a moment for indulging in a personal experience, I had a powerful moment with my children. I was trying to find a way to introduce them to the story and legacy of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I found a way of doing this on the Peace Bridge in Derry, where we literally sat down and spoke about why the bridge needed to be built and who paid for it, ironically in the context of Brexit. I tried to simplify for an eight year old and a six year old the complexity of the history, pain and tragedy, and progress of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> I want to be a proactive Minister on these issues, assisting parties and communities to start talking to each other and, in time, trusting each other, so we can find real ways of bringing about reconciliation that matters. I recognise that even though all of the speakers have a slightly different emphasis on what they are saying, reconciliation is a common theme among everybody, particularly those who have lived, for some or a lot of their lives, in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> In terms of the direct dialogue with the DUP on the Irish language, I have spoken to the DUP on all of the issues, just like I have spoken to the other parties, and there is a responsibility on political leaders in a Government in Dublin to get to know and try to build some trust with all community leaders and all political parties in Northern Ireland, the DUP included. I hope I have been pretty forthcoming in recognising the role Arlene Foster is trying to play at the moment, in particular her comments on the Irish language. She is the first DUP leader ever to speak to her own community and say it should not fear the Irish language. She is the first DUP leader to say the party should be legislating, but there are limits to what she can achieve and those limits, obviously, are being explored, just like there are limits to what Sinn Féin can live with on the same issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> If there is to be a way forward on a difficult issue like this, and there are other issues as it is not just the Irish language, then both leaders and their negotiating teams need to find a way to accommodate each other, and this is not easy politically. Some people find it frustrating when they hear me commenting or speaking about it, and perhaps the less I say in that type of commentary the better, because it is up to the two parties on a bilateral basis to find a way of accommodating each other, recognising the complexity and politics of these issues within their own communities and support bases, and being able to take brave decisions to move the issue forward, because there is a bigger context here, which is that Northern Ireland needs a government.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> Decisions on many of the issues to which some of the Senators have referred, practical matters in Northern Ireland such as how schools are run and how the health service is run and the response to flooding and other issues, cannot be made without political input. I hear it every now and again, when people say to me they do not have much faith in the political institutions of Northern Ireland, that maybe the <i>status quo</i> is not so bad. The <i>status quo</i> is not sustainable. Civil servants cannot continue to make decisions. There are many areas where they simply do not have a political mandate to make decisions, so politicians outside of Northern Ireland will have to start making decisions at some point in the not too distant future if it is not possible for directly-elected politicians in Northern Ireland to find a way of putting an executive and a functioning assembly in place that allow them to solve the problems of the people they represent. This is why this is so important, and why the British and Irish Governments have a responsibility to try to facilitate the structured dialogue that is continuing. These negotiations, I am glad to say, are in private for the most part now. They were very much in public at the start of the summer, and that structure proved difficult, particularly after two very divisive elections, and let us be honest about this. The Assembly election and the Westminster election in Northern Ireland were very divisive elections. There is new leadership in both Sinn Féin and the DUP and, for that matter, in the SDLP and the UUP. With new leadership comes new pressures, and we have seen communities in many ways being more divided on key political issues than we have seen for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> Yes, a breakthrough is needed, and I want to recognise the efforts the negotiating teams in Sinn Féin and the DUP are embarked upon at present. I also want to thank the other political parties for their patience. The SDLP, the UUP and the Alliance Party have largely been observers over the summer. While, of course, there is engagement, they recognise an assembly is not possible without the two largest parties finding some accommodation of each other. In my view, they have shown remarkable generosity and maturity in the context of how they have responded to date. They need to be involved in the negotiations in the context of forming an executive, but they know there is a barrier to overcome first between Sinn Féin and the DUP, which is what all of us are trying to assist with right now.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> I do not think I need to talk about the consequences of direct rule. Most people realise where that takes us. It is not a good place, and it is something the Government would be very concerned about if it looked like we were moving in that direction. There is also a timing issue. Northern Ireland needs a budget. What we are coming down to now is practical realities. If there is not an assembly and an executive to pass the budget there are responsibilities on others to pass a budget and bring financial clarity to a whole series of sectors that need state support and funding. As I said, we all want the directly-elected representatives in Northern Ireland to be the people making decisions on these matters in terms of prioritising how money is spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> With regard to Senator Ó Donnghaile's comments on the DeSouza case, I have written to him on this and we will continue to follow up with him on it. In the Good Friday Agreement there is very strong reference to the right of citizens in Northern Ireland to be able to choose Irish citizenship if they want to, British citizenship if they want to or dual citizenship if they want to. Of course, this has consequences in the context of Brexit because with Irish citizenship comes EU citizenship and the rights that flow from this, which is an added complication but an important one.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> In terms of reconciliation and the need for reciprocation in both communities, that is true but, depending on where one comes from and how one has been affected by the tragedies and violence of Northern Ireland, it is very difficult for some people to find a way of doing this. Real leadership, in my view, comes from people who are willing to continue to try to promote and act in a way that promotes reconciliation, even if there is nothing coming the other way. We need to continue to do this rather than in any way making it contingent on getting something back. I accept the Senator was not saying this.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">Over time, and this is where the Whitaker comments come in, patience and perseverance are what are required. Anybody who looks to be opportunistic in terms of trying to achieve his or her, albeit legitimate, political ends in Northern Ireland and is trying to rush agendas and using other political crises to do so is, in my view, undermining the overall project here, which has to be about uniting Irish people and Irish communities, North and South. When I was involved in the leadership contest in my party I had the slogan "Uniting Ireland", and I was very clear about what that meant, which, by the way, applied to communities outside of Northern Ireland also. We have seen a divided society develop in Ireland, given what we have been through in the past ten years. Big political parties like mine have an obligation to try to bring people together.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">We have been trying to do that in some of the decisions we have made in the budget announced yesterday, but in the context of Northern Ireland, it is about bringing communities together in a way that can allow them to trust each other, talk to each other and put the past in a context that allows communities to move on. That is what I mean by trying to unite people. If we can do that, then other exciting things are possible, but if we try to do it in reverse, to force a political agenda in a way that is threatening, then we will continue to divide communities. A majority community today could potentially become a threatened minority community tomorrow. That is not what the uniting Ireland agenda should be about. It should be about generosity, recognising the diversity and difference on this island, and recognising who people are, where they come from and what they hold as important in the context of their own identities. The genius of the Good Friday Agreement is that it caters for all that in terms of east-west relations, North-South relations, and a way of changing the constitutional structures on the island of Ireland should a majority of people want to do that. Personally, I think that is some time off. We have a responsibility to prioritise reconciliation and understanding. We have a lot of work to do in that area before other questions under the Good Friday Agreement's conditions are followed.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> I take Senator Feighan's point. This is an evolution of relationships between Ireland and Britain. We have come a long way and we are now being tested in quite a fundamental way by something that has come out of left field, in some ways, in the context of Brexit. I would caution against using the difficulties and complexities around the Brexit debate as a way of trying to pursue another end of a united Ireland agenda. We need to work with unionism and nationalism in Northern Ireland to find practical solutions that protect the interests of this island as a whole and protect the interests of the Irish-British relationship, which, regardless of what happens in Brexit, has got to remain a close interwoven relationship because we cannot undo it even if we want to, and I do not believe we want to. Unfortunately, Britain has chosen to leave the European Union but there is a negotiation ongoing now which Ireland is in the centre of, as we should be, and we have worked hard to ensure that we have placed Irish issues at the centre of those negotiations. We continue to do that to try to address some of the issues that many of the Senators have raised. However, there is a danger sometimes that positioning on Brexit questions provokes and encourages a divisive response in Northern Ireland that forces people back into the unionism versus nationalism debate. Brexit should not be a green versus orange issue. I certainly will work to try to ensure that it is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> My view is pretty well known on the issue of the customs union. I find it very difficult to see how we can solve the Border challenges on the island of Ireland in the context of Brexit unless Britain and Ireland and the rest of European Union are part of a shared customs union. We can call it whatever we want, Britain staying in the customs union or Britain negotiating with the EU task force a customs union partnership, but the net result has to be same. When one drives from Dublin to Derry or Dublin to Belfast, if one is moving from one customs union to another, there is no way of avoiding some Border infrastructure, whether it is at the Border or in people's businesses or farmyards, if one is having to manage the movement of goods from one customs union to another. That is why there are no easy answers to this in the context of the current approach by the British Government, and we need to continue to explore solutions here. The language has improved in this context. There is now talk of transition periods and maintaining the <i>status quo</i> during that. There is talk of a customs union partnership as opposed to simply just leaving a customs union. There is talk of a trade partnership as opposed to demanding a free trade agreement. I think the British Government is exploring ways in which we can try to discuss these matters when we get to phrase two of the negotiations. However, let us not forget the job we need to do in phase one first, particularly in the context of Northern Ireland, the Border, protecting the Good Friday Agreement and its full implementation, protecting a common travel area, on which I think we are making good progress, and the need for us to work with all parties in Northern Ireland in an effort to find a practical way forward on that. Our efforts to do that would certainly be a lot easier to do if we had a First and deputy First Minister and an Executive that was all inclusive.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> I thank colleagues for their contributions. If they have suggestions or queries, they can contact me at any point on these issues. Once again, I remind people that we are at a very important point. This week is an important one in the context of Northern Ireland and the job that we need to do together. I hope it will have a successful outcome by the end of the week.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (Deputy Damien English)<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_299">I will speak to the motion on the Eighth Report of the Convention on the Constitution, and I thank Members of Seanad Éireann for this opportunity to discuss the very important rights issues raised in the eighth report. As they will all be aware, the eighth report of the Convention on the Constitution considers a range of issues. It recommends specifically that the Constitution be amended to strengthen the protection of economic, social and cultural rights. Some 56% of the members of the convention wished to make recommendations for reform immediately, while 43% wished to refer it elsewhere for further consideration of the implications of possible reforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> The most popular option for reform was the insertion of a provision into the Constitution that "the State shall progressively realise economic, social and cultural rights, subject to maximum available resources and that this duty is cognisable by the Courts". In relation to which specific rights should be enumerated in the Constitution, 84% considered the right to housing should be included, 78% considered the right to social security should be included, and 87% considered the right to essential health care should be included. The percentage in favour of the inclusion of rights of people with disabilities was 90% and the percentage in favour of the inclusion of linguistic and cultural rights was 75%, and 80% considered that the rights covered in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights should be also included.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> Obviously, the range of issues and the implications arising from inserting these in the Constitution raise questions, which need further exploration and discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The issues arising include the suitability or otherwise of the Constitution as a vehicle for providing for detailed rights in these areas, the possible costs arising, and the fact that there is already power under legislation to confer rights and determine expenditure via primary and secondary legislation, that there is an elected and accountable Government and Oireachtas and that, unlike the Constitution, such legislation can be varied as needed and as availability of resources allows.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> Other Issues include the absence of provisions for Revenue to provide for any ensuing expenditure, concerns about transferring the power to the Judiciary, which is unelected, to make decisions affecting the allocation of resources which are more appropriate for an elected Parliament and Government and the current position of the State as regards debt levels and the need to meet stringent EU rules into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> On the question of inserting the right to housing into the Constitution, the announcement yesterday that there will be close to €2 billion available for housing in 2018, a sum that would have been unthinkable a few short years ago, is further evidence of the priority placed by this Government on securing homes for people and, in particular, addressing the challenge of homelessness. The package of measures announced yesterday will mean that the housing needs of more than 25,000 households will be met next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> In addition to the significant increase in funding for 2018, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, also announced yesterday that he has secured a further €500 million for investment in social housing for 2019 to 2021. This is in addition to the previously committed sum of €5.35 billion for housing projects. This will allow the overall Rebuilding Ireland social housing target to be increased from 47,000 to 50,000 units, with a total funding envelope for Rebuilding Ireland of more than €6 billion. The All-Party Committee on Housing and Homelessness in the term of the previous Government recommended that we would reach a level of 10,000 social housing units per year, giving a total of 50,000. We are on track with its recommendation. We have always said we believed in doing that when the resources would become available. The overarching aim of Rebuilding Ireland is to ramp up delivery of housing from its current undersupply across all tenures to help individuals and families meet their housing needs. Members can be assured that this is the number one priority of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> On inserting the right to housing in the Constitution, a range of matters need to be considered. There are already specific, substantive and procedural rights for housing in place arising from existing legislation and case law. For instance, a person has the right to apply for and be assessed for social housing assistance, and if deemed qualified for social housing, that is, having met the income and need criteria, a person will normally qualify immediately for housing assistance payment, HAP, subject to fulfilling the conditions of the scheme, such as the suitability of the accommodation selected etc. If a person does not opt for housing assistance payment, HAP, he or she is placed on a list for allocation of a social housing home in accordance with the local authority’s allocations scheme. Where a person avails of housing assistance payment, he or she may on request to be placed on a transfer list to be allocated a social housing unit by the local authority, again in accordance with the local authority's allocations scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> There are also many legal protections for the family home and numerous new or recent protections for tenants renting in the private sector. These are very important issues that need further consideration. We will discuss the mortgage-to-rent scheme and it is important that we have a discussion on people's rights and so on as we relaunch that scheme. I look forward to questions on the right to housing together with the other rights referred to in the eighth report being fully considered by the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> We had this discussion in the Dáil recently on a motion. It is believed that the committee is the best place in which to discuss and tease out all the possible scenarios that will arise if we enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution, along with other rights as well. I think most people, even those who tabled the motion, agree that it is not just a simple decision but one that needs to be teased out. It is welcome that the Bill was not opposed and that it was referred to the Select Committee on Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> I thank Members for their time and I look forward to responding at the end of the debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">I thank the Minister for addressing the House today. Fianna Fáil voted to delay this Bill to allow the housing committee to consider the report of the Constitutional Convention on this matter and other economic, cultural and social rights. Broadening the Constitution, the fundamental legal basis of the State, should be done carefully and should take into consideration the wide range of consequences. The committee is best placed to undertake that work. The most important task in addressing the housing crisis is not holding a referendum that will cost €15 million but ensuring that the housing supply is increased. The budget and capital plan are key and should be our immediate priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> The Constitutional Convention voted to enhance the level of protection for the economic, social and cultural rights, making them ready for supervision by the courts in certain circumstances. They also voted to highlight certain rights which should be stated in the Constitution, namely, housing, social security, essential health care, rights of people with disabilities and cultural rights, which are covered in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> The programme for Government contains a commitment to send this recommendation to the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government. We believe this is the appropriate forum to thrash out the issues involved. It is important not to give people false hope or fall into political gestures rather than real action. To add the right to housing to the Constitution will not solve the housing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> It is important to recognise that holding a referendum to insert a right to housing in the Constitution should only be undertaken with full consideration of all the issues. Most important, it cannot be allowed to divert attention from the steps to increase supply and tackle escalating rents. We need to increase capital expenditure on social housing. The social housing capital budget was €300,000 below the 2008 budget. I have significant concerns about that. This should be increased up to €400 million to ensure that extra units will be built.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> A new regulatory regime should be established to allow vacant units and units above shops to be converted into residential units. This could open up thousands of units in established areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> We need to re-establish an affordable housing scheme. Workers on ordinary salaries should be able to buy their own homes. Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 should be amended to ensure that units are earmarked for affordable housing. This is crucial. We do not have an affordable housing system. In addition, local authorities should relaunch their own building programmes with an affordable housing element.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> Practical steps can be taken in the coming months that will address the 130,000 people on the social housing waiting lists. The homeless crisis and the rental market are the major problems. The directive principles of social policy enshrined in Article 45 set out the rules and general guidance for the Oireachtas in setting out laws. However, the rights included in Article 45 are non-cognisable by the courts. A citizen cannot take the Government to court for breaches as they are for guidance only. This article would be subject to judicial review. This may transfer too much power into the hands of the courts rather than the democratically elected representatives. We all want to ensure that people have homes, but we need to ensure we have it properly thought out before we enact legislation. The proposed amendment refers to residents rather than citizens, which is the term used in other articles of the Constitution. It should be clarified as to whether this broadens out the right to housing above the other rights in the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> The Constitution Review Group report in 1996 advocated amending Article 40.3.1° to restrict wide-ranging judicial interpretation and to list out explicitly the fundamental rights contained in the Constitution. Enshrining housing rights without amending Article 40.3.1° may lead to a further extension of judicial power as the creative approach to the Constitution enables the Judiciary to widen its influence over areas currently considered the remit of day-to-day political life.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> We all know people need a home, not a house. We are here to represent the people. People need a home to ensure that they and their family have stability. We need, however, to ensure we do the right thing. Fianna Fáil wants the committee to examine the proposals. I am a member of that committee and I can guarantee that I will give this a high priority.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_119">
          <from>Senator Michael McDowell<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_320">I was one of the people who participated as a guest speaker at the Constitutional Convention in Malahide when all of this started. When I got there, all of the dice were already heavily loaded in favour of this being the outcome of the convention. Papers had been put before the delegates by people who were interested in social and economic rights being put into the Constitution. Even though I did my best to point out some of the difficulties, it was a one-way street as far as the so-called debate was concerned. It was not a considered debate. It was an emotional one-way street.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">The point is that to include in the Constitution, "that the State shall progressively realise [economic, social and cultural] rights, subject to maximum available resources and that this duty is cognisable by the Courts" presupposes a lot of things. What are the maximum available resources at any given stage? Who decides that the Abbey Theatre should get €2 million to provide an extension and that such money should not be spent on a particular service in a hospital in Waterford? Who makes such decisions? What possible function could the Judiciary have in becoming involved in such matters? These are matters of judgment, but not of judgment by the courts or the judges in the courts. As Members of the Oireachtas, we are elected by the people of our democracy to make judgments on such matters. It is a difficult for anyone to choose whether to spend €2 million on the Abbey Theatre or on the provision of a service in a hospital in Waterford. Politicians have to make such choices around the Cabinet table, in the lobbies of Dáil Éireann and - to some extent - in this House. If we decide to extend statutory rights to welfare and housing, etc., in a particular way, a cost will be attached to that policy and resources will have to be marshalled to finance it.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> The inclusion in the Constitution of vague-minded and, in my view, dishonest language of this nature would achieve absolutely nothing other than the politicisation of the Judiciary. I have spent most of my life practising before Irish judges. Our Constitution gives them massive power to look at and reverse any act of the Executive under the rubric of judicial review. They even have the power to annul Acts of the Oireachtas by reference to the Constitution. These immensely strong powers are given to Irish High Court judges sitting alone, subject to the right of appeal. The British judiciary does not have these powers. The American judiciary has them to some extent. We have accorded our Judiciary immense powers under our Constitution. When Éamon de Valera was drafting the Constitution in 1937, he distinguished between the areas of public life and vindication of rights which should be justiciable on the one hand, and those which should be matters for judgment by the Oireachtas, on the other hand. He and the draftsmen of the 1937 Constitution saw a need to draw a particular line between those two areas. That is why Article 45 of the Constitution sets out directive principles of social policy for the guidance of the Oireachtas and states that those principles "shall not be cognisable by any Court". Éamon de Valera understood the separation of powers issue that lies at the bottom of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> Having appeared before judges in every type of court, including the Special Criminal Court, the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, I know that the courts are not suitable for deciding on the allocation of resources. They can decide that a particular pensioner is entitled to have a Social Welfare Act operated in a particular way because the Oireachtas has set up the Act and has provided the resources to do it. In certain circumstances, the courts can inform the State that an Act says that some particular pension must be provided to an individual, and instruct the State to get the resources to facilitate this, on the basis of the law of the land that has been put in place. It has never been the case that the Judiciary has been accorded the right to say to the State, "You may not do X or Y and you may not diminish the budget here or there because we believe resources are available to enable you to carry out this function".</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> I agree entirely with what has been said to date. While I have no objection to this proposal being considered by a committee, I believe it is half-thought-out and ill-thought-out. It strikes at the heart of the constitutional order. The political class in this country has one vice. It is a virus which I have had myself. I refer to its capacity to play down the role of democratic politicians and to play up the role of Joe Duffy, the media, the courts and everybody else for the purposes of diminishing its own function in our democracy. That is the beginning of the end of the set of values that underlie our Constitution. Politicians should not see themselves as anything other than the judges of the issues to which this proposed amendment relates. Politicians should insist on taking responsibility for solving the housing crisis, for example, because such issues are matters for resolution in this House and not under any circumstances down in the Four Courts.</p>

          <from>Senator Paudie Coffey<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_325">I welcome the Minister of State. I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the eighth report of the Constitutional Convention. I note and acknowledge the contributions of colleagues in this House. I look forward to listening to more contributions. I also acknowledge the contributions of citizens and colleagues who participated in the convention under the chairmanship of Mr. Tom Arnold. As we all know, the convention operated on the basis of openness, fairness, equality, efficiency and collegiality. However, I was interested to hear Senator McDowell say in his contribution that he feels the convention was an emotional one-way street. It is important for us to challenge different views, perspectives and recommendations, regardless of whether they are emotional or are coming from the perspective of social responsibility. I share many of the concerns outlined by Senator McDowell and I will elaborate on them later in this speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> It was important that the Constitutional Convention deliberated on, debated and discussed the topics before it, following public consultation and with the support of various professionals and experts in the relevant fields. The convention identified the topic of economic, social and cultural rights. All politicians agree that we need to work in the best interests of citizens to deliver services that are as equal as possible in areas like health, education and housing. I note that the convention has made various recommendations in that respect. Having been a Member of the Oireachtas for over ten years, I would argue that the Executive - the democratically-elected Government of the day - is responsible for introducing Estimates that make provision for the services of the State to be made available in as coherent and sustainable a way as possible. It is eminently appropriate for the convention's recommendations to be referred to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform so they can be considered and debated properly by our Oireachtas colleagues, who are mandated by the State and under the Constitution to analyse, scrutinise and make recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> It is appropriate at this time for the House to acknowledge the substantial State investments in areas like housing, health and education that were announced in yesterday's budget. The total commitment in housing alone is over €6 billion. This will facilitate the delivery of over 99,000 housing solutions under various programmes, including the direct build and housing assistance payment schemes, between now and 2021. Other new programmes have been introduced to deliver housing solutions, including the provision of social and affordable housing. Regardless of the emotions that exist - it is right that we have emotion in public debate - it is important that we do not prioritise any one cohort of citizens over another. Housing is needed across the board by all citizens. A homeless person has a legitimate right to a house, but so does a family that is working hard to keep a roof over its head while struggling to pay the mortgage. Our priority must be all citizens. We should not prioritise one group over another.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> I welcome yesterday's announcement of increased expenditure on education. An additional €554 million is being allocated, bringing the total spend on education to over €10 billion. For the first time, we will have the lowest class size ratio of one teacher to 26 pupils. I think that is a welcome development.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">I welcome the fact that over 1,300 more teachers will be employed for various schools. These are the real equality and delivery decisions that the Government and Oireachtas must make. </p>
          <p eId="para_330"> It is important to recognise and acknowledge the constitutional role of the Executive or the Government of the day to present the Estimates for each individual Department. I was a member of the recent Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services and during that time I felt that we bordered on setting a dangerous precedent. I am referring to the fact that an Oireachtas joint committee tried to set the Estimates for the Government of the day. Such a development is dangerous as it undermines the democratic authority of the Government of the day. It is important that Oireachtas joint committees scrutinise, make recommendations, deliberate and debate but it is not their job, or that of constitutional conventions however they are compiled, to set Estimates and approve budgets. It is important that we acknowledge that as politicians in the national Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> One could apply the same principle from the bottom up, and even as far as local authorities, where it is the job of local elected representatives or local councillors to pass local authority budgets. Such work is not and should not be the job of agencies, NGOs or other groups. Yes, they play an important role in the public debate and advocacy and they inform and educate policymakers. Ultimately, at the end of the day, it is the job of an elected member, whether it is a councillor, Deputy or Minister, and the latter has a responsibility to pass national budgets. It is their democratic function. We need to be careful not to undermine such a democratic function. </p>
          <p eId="para_332"> I welcome the fact that we will recommend the referral of the recommendations for further scrutiny to an Oireachtas joint committee. There will be a further opportunity for colleagues to scrutinise the recommendations made by the Oireachtas joint committee and we will then allow Ministers to consider the recommendations.</p>

Taispeánann sé go bhfuil an pobal féin i bhfad chun tosaigh ar an Rialtas agus ar na húdaráis sa gcaoi is go ndíríonn siad ar na cearta daonna a bhaineann le tithíocht, teanga, cultúir agus go leor eile nach iad. I dtuairim Shinn Féin, ní chóir go mbeadh an coiste airgeadais á bhreithniú. Is cúis leis an gcoiste seo féachaint ar chúrsaí airgeadais le súil ar chiste an Stáit. Tá muid ag plé anseo, áfach, le ceart bunúsacha an duine, nach féidir luach a chur orthu. Mar sin, ba chóir coiste speisialta ar leith a bhunú a bheadh in ann na finnéithe agus na saineolaithe cuí a ghairm chuige chomh maith le foireann taighde agus riarachán feiliúnach don ábhar a phléifear ann.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> We welcome the fact this report is finally being discussed. We want to see social, economic and cultural rights enshrined in the Constitution. We note that there has been a particular emphasis placed on the right to the housing recommendation made by the convention. However, Sinn Féin feels it is inappropriate for the report to be discussed solely by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach. We believe such a move would bring a disproportionate focus on resource allocation, rather than a wider debate on people's rights. </p>
          <p eId="para_346"> The finance committee naturally has an eye on balancing the books for the State. We have no problem with the finance committee being among a number of committees considering the matter. However, that is not the approach the Government and Fianna Fáil have proposed. Sinn Féin calls for a special committee to consider the report as the measure will allow a better balance of skills and perspectives to consider the eighth report in an appropriately wide context. This committee could call upon staff, witnesses and experts suited to the myriad of areas covered by the report. </p>
          <p eId="para_347"> The finance committee has already considered housing at the level of institutions, lending institutions and housing co-operatives. All of this has been done in the overall budgetary context. We need a rights-based context as we trawl through the report. </p>
          <p eId="para_348"> The finance committee is also one of the busiest committees in these Houses. It already has quarterly engagements with the pillar banks and it has a programme of work set out for the months ahead. There is no way the committee can dedicate the time needed to consider the many recommendations contained in the report. Too much work has been put into the Constitutional Convention to see it wasted by hasty consideration by an unsuitable committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> I agree with many of the points that have been raised. The fundamental issue that we are discussing here is where is the best place in these Houses to make sure that we have the debate that Senator McDowell has called for so that he would get an opportunity to raise his issues. We must also ensure that we get a balance of witnesses in these Houses to discuss his issues. We believe that the finance committee is already overburdened. We have seen great examples in this House where Senators have had an option to debate issues such as mental health and bring in witnesses to discuss the different ramifications. Today's report is very broad and covers all of the different rights. The convention was heavily in favour of rights related to housing, social security, essential health care, the rights of people with disabilities, linguistic and cultural rights and rights covered in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. My party and I believe that it would be a fundamental mistake to consider the report merely from economic or financial perspectives. Even though we respect the will and right of the convention to come forward with proposals, the role of this Parliament should not be diluted when it comes to discussing these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> Members of these Houses have been elected by the people to discuss issues of extreme importance. A sub-committee is considering how the eighth amendment to the Constitution can be dealt with. These changes are equally important and equally as fundamental and that is why we need to consider the report. </p>
          <p eId="para_351"> The report states that to some degree in Ireland: "ESC rights are protected generally by means of legislation, including employment law, housing law, social security and social assistance (social welfare) law." It continued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_352">Legislation can be easily amended, or administrative practices changed, to reduce or remove particular ESC rights. With legislative protection of ESC rights, in times of perceived crisis, the ESC rights of particularly vulnerable people, the elderly, disabled people, single parents and children growing up in poverty, can be subject to reduction or withdrawal.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">That is why I would like to hear from witnesses acting on behalf of groups such as the disabled, single parents and children growing up in poverty. Some of the biggest critics of the budgetary decisions that were made yesterday were people who represent people with a disability, and dealt with issues around housing and lone and single parents, etc. </p>
          <p eId="para_354"> Let us consider economic rights. People in direct provision have made a case for the right to work. The economic rights in the Constitution show that individuals have a right, for example, to join and participate in a trade union but there is no obligation on the State or employers to recognise trade unions. </p>
          <p eId="para_355"> As I have stated here on many occasions, people who work in the hospitality sector are discouraged from joining unions. There are major issues and abuses of rights of people who work in the hospitality sector. That is one of the reasons Sinn Féin has called for the 9% VAT rate not to be left as it is because many hotels and businesses are making a handsome profit that is not being passed on to workers. This is not just a purely economic area. </p>
          <p eId="para_356"> In terms of social rights, there are issues with social security and social assistance payments. The report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_357">Certain social assistance payments exist that could be viewed as protecting the family, including one parent family payment, family income supplement and child benefit. Irish housing law provides a system for determining who is entitled to social housing, although there is not enough social housing to meet overall need. Irish law provides for tenant and landlord protections in terms of their mutual rights and obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> The report is far broader than just financial issues that would arise at a finance committee. We need a joint committee that will go into detail about these issues, invite witnesses to attend and allow Members from both Houses of the Oireachtas to tease out the issues. I call on all Senators who favour democracy and debate to support the amendment that we have brought forward. </p>

          <p eId="para_365">The conclusion of the report is very welcome. The directive principles of the social policy in the Irish Constitution are some of the most positive and engaging elements of the document.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">It is my belief that their better realisation by Irish Governments would go far in creating a fairer and more equal Republic that the founders of the State envisaged in the Proclamation of 1916.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> I hope, should the recommendations be sent to either committee, that the discussion might be expanded to include another aspect that I believe has a place in the Constitution, the protection of the right to a healthy environment. According to a paper released this week by Dr. Roderic O'Gorman of DCU, 148 of the 196 national constitutions now in place contain some form of environmentalism. Ireland is one of only 48 countries with no such provisions. This is in part likely due to the age of the Constitution, written as it was at a time before environmentalism and ecology were part of the political and economic vocabulary. The only time the natural environment gets mentioned is with regard to natural resources and even then the approach is an entirely extractive one that emphasises only the natural environment as something to be exploited. Dr. O'Gorman's paper outlines the emergence of the international trend towards constitutional guarantees and the different ways it can be expressed, from the right to a healthy environment to rights for the environment itself as an inherent good. If we are to consider changes to the Constitution to expand and solidify the economic, social and cultural rights of citizens, environmental rights are a core part of all three areas and must be included in the discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> I also concur with the Sinn Féin counter motion. I believe that this report would be better served by consideration by a committee which would consider it in a wider context than merely fiscal. Either way, I look forward to engaging with the discussion as it proceeds through the Oireachtas.</p>

          <p eId="para_369">The report is being referred to the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.

          <p eId="para_372">There is no reason the committee cannot do that but the Government has to make a formal decision that the report goes for formal consideration. The discussion can happen at any stage. Today's is only a short debate on a short motion. There is nothing preventing the House having a debate on this and having a greater say on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> I would disagree with Senator Ó Clochartaigh. The Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach is not a narrow committee. It has a wide-ranging reach and covers all issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_375">It is an important part. I agree with Senator McDowell that a lot of our work as politicians is about the prioritisation of funding and budgetary decisions. That is key. It is not always about law. A lot of our work is around how we spend taxpayers' money and how we collect it. I agree that that is an important decision and that it should be kept with politicians. That is a personal view. The committee can thrash this out but I have to agree that it is our job and it is what we are elected to do. We represent people to do that. The committee can decide that. A report will come back to both Houses and we will tease that out as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> It is the right committee because the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not only about budgets. It is also about reforming the provision of services through all the Departments and it has a role in that. Now that we are entering into better economic times, it should have a greater role in the reform of services and deliverability across the various Departments. This is where it belongs.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> I compliment Senator Coffey. I agree with the Senator that the budget yesterday rightly reflects increased resources in key areas of health, education and housing, as well as other areas. Those are the three important basics. When one is down to basic rights, those are key - education, health and housing. We are responding to that with increased resources. For the first time, the education budget has exceeded €10 billion, which is an important milestone in this country. We need to keep adding to that in the years ahead as well. I am glad the Senator mentioned it today as well rather than focus only on housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> I have dealt with that. As the House will be aware, the Government will not agree with the amendment but I will let the House itself vote on that.</p>

          <from>Senator Catherine Ardagh<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_441">It is my pleasure to speak on the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2017, brought forward by Fianna Fáil before Seanad Éireann. A significant contribution to the formulation of the Bill came from Mental Health Reform, representatives of which are in the Gallery today. I thank them for the support they have given to Fianna Fáil and particularly Deputy James Browne in spearheading the Bill and bringing it to this Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> In agreeing to facilitate a minority Government, Fianna Fáil inserted in the confidence and supply agreement a condition that A Vision for Change would be fully implemented within the lifetime of the Government. A Vision for Change was developed under the then Fianna Fáil Government as a strategy document that sets out the direction for mental health services in Ireland. Since 2001, our understanding of mental illness and the rights of people suffering mental illness have advanced. In particular, we have had the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to which Ireland is a signatory. We need to change how we look at Acts of the Oireachtas that affect peoples' rights. They should be viewed as living Acts that can be readily amended and updated to reflect how we live our lives physically and emotionally. I echo my disappointment about yesterday's budget and measures targeted to mental health funding. I am disappointed the full amount of €35 million was not secured and funding was hidden in other measures. I understand the total comes to less than €15 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> This Bill seeks to implement some of the recommendations contained in the report of the expert group on the review of the Mental Health Act 2001. The Bill was passed by the Dáil in July this year and it would deliver immediate improvements and legislative protection for adults and children accessing acute mental health services. It would also contribute in some part to the Government's fulfilment of international human rights law, including the European Convention on Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Mental Health (Amendment) Bill contains certain significant changes that strengthen the rights of people in hospital for mental health care. The Bill also supports the rights of inpatients to make decisions about their own treatment by linking the 2001 Act with recent law that affirms that everybody should be presumed to have capacity to make decisions. This includes providing people with the supports they need to make these decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> In total, the expert group made 165 recommendations relating to the updating of the Mental Health Act. This Bill does not address all 165 recommendations but it goes some way to addressing some of them. It is a first stepping stone to ensuring those with mental health difficulties have more autonomy to make decisions on their care when they are getting treatment. To date, only one of the 165 recommendations has been implemented by the Government and the pace of reforming our mental health legislation and services is far too slow. The Bill we have put forth seeks to address some of these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> The Bill will deliver immediate improvements in legislative protection for adults and children accessing acute mental health services. It will also contribute in some part to the Government's fulfilment of international human rights law, including the European Convention on Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. One of the key changes put forward in the Bill is to introduce a definition of "voluntary patient", including only individuals with decision making capacity and who have consented to admission. The Bill also seeks to ensure that people are given the right to the highest attainable standard of mental health and the right to receive the least restrictive care possible. It seeks to enhance awareness of the special needs of children when interacting with the mental health services, proposing that each child has the right to be heard in decisions made regarding their care in the mental health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">It also affirms that involuntary patients could not be given treatment without their consent, except in certain circumstances. The detailed proposals we have made would help in the process of reforming mental health legislation and, in effect, mental health services. It is important that we move quickly to implement the recommendations made by the expert group. I will not go through all of the recommendations made. I will focus on some of them and my colleague, Senator Paul Daly, might reflect on others when he is seconding the proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> Section 2(1) of the Bill introduces a definition of "voluntary patient" to include only those who have the capacity to make their own decisions, with support if required, and who give their consent to be admitted to hospital. People who do not have the capacity to consent to admission and who do not object to it are considered to be voluntary patients under the law, even though they are not able to consent to admission. This means that they do not have an external review of their status or receive the oversight protection provided for involuntary patients. Under the Mental Health Act 2001, a person is considered to be a voluntary patient only if he or she is not the subject of an admission or renewal order that would make him or her an involuntary patient. In other words, a person is a voluntary patient only by virtue of the fact that he or she is not an involuntary patient. The 2001 Act does not refer to capacity or consent on the admission of an individual as a voluntary patient. Critically, it does not distinguish between individuals who have the capacity to consent to their admission and those who do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> The Bill also addresses the question of putting the person first. Section 3(2) would eliminate the principle of "best interests" for adults. It would keep the principle of "best interests" for children under the 2001 Act. The Bill would replace the "best interests" principle with the guidance principles under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 which relate, for example, to respecting the will and preferences of a person. The Bill also introduces other human rights principles such as the right to the highest attainable standard of mental health and the right to the least restrictive care. The Government has already signed up to these human rights standards. The Bill would confer a right to "the highest attainable standard of mental health consistent with least restrictive care". The expert group has identified that this should be in the context of giving due respect to "the person's own understanding of his or her mental health". The existing principle of "best interests" under the 2001 Act has been interpreted very paternalistically in the courts and sustained a culture where, at all times, the views of doctors have been given priority over those of patients who are the service users.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> This section of the Bill also retains some of the principles already set out in the 2001 Act, including the right of a person to autonomy, privacy and bodily integrity. The shift from the term "best interests" would empower people to be decision-makers over their own mental health, which is the core value of the Bill. Its ultimate aim is to give people more autonomy when they receive treatment for their mental health issues. This change in perspective values the expertise and knowledge of the individuals in understanding their own mental health difficulties and recognising what is best for them in their own care and recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> I would like to address other aspects of the Bill such as the provisions relating to children and young people under the age of 18 years. While the Bill would eliminate the "best interests" principle for adults, as I have explained, it would retain it for children and young people under the age of 18 years. Section 4 is in line with the expert group's recommendation which recognises that where there is an intervention on behalf of a child, his or her best interests must be the primary consideration. It is imperative that the term "best interests" be defined in a way that is informed by the views of the child, bearing in mind that these views should be given weight in accordance with his or her age, evolving capacity and maturity, with due regard to his or her will and preferences. This is important because it is still appropriate for decisions on the mental health care of children and adolescents to be made with their best interests in mind. In keeping with international human rights law, the "best interests" principle should take account of the views of the child or adolescent, as well as his or her will and preferences. The "best interests" principle is in keeping with international human rights standards. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that "in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration".</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> One of the biggest issues covered in the Bill is consent to treatment. Section 5(1) would amend the 2001 Act to include both voluntary and involuntary patients in the existing provisions relating to the definition of "consent to treatment". The consent to treatment provisions set out in the 2001 Act do not specify that they apply equally to voluntary and involuntary patients. This section of the Bill would expand the definition of "consent to treatment" and explicitly provide that all voluntary and involuntary patients would have to consent to treatment delivered in acute mental health services. Section 5(1)(a) would amend the 2001 Act to include the definition of "decision-making capacity" set out in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, thereby bringing the 2001 Act into line with the 2015 Act in this respect. Section 5(1)(b) would amend the 2001 Act to ensure both voluntary and involuntary patients would be given adequate information in a form of language that he or she could understand on the nature, purpose and likely effect of the proposed treatment. This provision currently applies to involuntary patients only.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> This section of the Bill also affirms that voluntary patients could not ultimately be given treatment without their consent. It also affirms that involuntary patients could not be given treatment without their consent in certain circumstances. More specifically, it would amend the 2001 Act by narrowing the circumstances in which treatment could be administered without the consent of the involuntary patient. It provides that treatment could only be given without consent as a very last resort. in keeping with international human rights law. At a minimum, human rights norms require that the law must specify that compulsory treatment can only be administered as a very last resort and, ultimately, where necessary. </p>
          <p eId="para_453"> As I said, the Bill does not address all of the recommendations made in the expert group's report. There are certain limitations on the Bill which addresses some of the issues only. As I said, it would be a stepping stone and I hope the Government side of the House will support it. I look forward to hearing what other Members have to add to the debate.</p>

          <from>Senator Paul Daly<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_454">It is a great pleasure for me to second motion on Second Stage of the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2017. I join Senator Catherine Ardagh in complimenting Deputy James Browne on the Trojan work he has done to date to get the Bill to this point. While it gives me great pleasure to support the proposal, it aggrieves me that many of the contents of the Bill are only being introduced in 2017. One would have thought that these basic human rights would already be <i>in situ</i> in our society and that legislation of this nature would not be need to be introduced in 2017. The Bill would make certain significant changes to strengthen the rights of people when in hospital to receive mental health care. It would support the right of inpatients to make decisions on their treatment by linking the Mental Health Act 2001 with recent law which affirms that everyone should be presumed to have the capacity to make decisions and should be given the support they need to make such decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> In addition to making some valuable improvements, the Bill is important because it highlights the need to amend the Mental Health Act 2011 in full and the seriousness of the continued violations of the human rights of people who are being treated in hospital for mental health difficulties. To date, just one of the 165 recommendations made in the report of the expert group that reviewed the 2001 Act has been implemented. The Government has failed repeatedly to meet its own timetable for updating the Act in question. The enactment of this legislation would be a positive step towards achieving the full amendment of the 2001 Act in line with the recommendations made by the expert group on mental health reform. It could contribute in some part to the Government's fulfilment of international human rights law, including the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It is clear that the 2001 Act is not compliant with either convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> I would have liked to have seen much greater emphasis on mental health services in the Budget Statement yesterday. The enactment of many of the items included in this legislation would not be severe from a monetary point of view. It would have been nice if a greater contribution to the mental health service had been made. We all know of horrific stories within our own families or circles of friends. If we do not know those affected personally, we read and hear about cases that depict how people suffering from mental health problems are treated in the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">I know of cases where people who suffer from mental health issues have been in the care of the health service, not for the treatment of their specific diagnosis but for other health issues, and the treatment they received has often been impaired due to the fact that they suffer from a mental health disorder.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> It gives me great pleasure to second the Bill but it is unfortunate in this era that we are only reaching the stage of its introduction in 2017. It should have happened a long time ago.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_138">
          <from>Senator Frank Feighan<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_459">I am delighted to speak on this important matter. I welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad again. He has been in this Chamber five or six times in the past two weeks. It is always nice to see him coming in here.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> I take this opportunity to thank all the stakeholders, including Deputy James Browne, on his work in progressing mental health reform. Progress, while slower than originally anticipated, primarily due to the recent recession, continues to be made in implementing the recommendations in A Vision for Change. I was in this House in 2006 when A Vision for Change was published. It set out a ten-year policy framework for Ireland’s mental health services. We had a long, frank and detailed debate on it and there were many calls for ring-fencing funding for it. It recommended that interventions should be aimed at maximising recovery from mental illness, building on service user and social network resources to achieve meaningful integration and participation in community life.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> Preparations for a review and updating of A Vision for Change policy have been under way since early last year. This review was completed in February 2017, and provides evidence to determine the policy direction for a revision of A Vision for Change, both in terms of international best practice and the experience of implementing A Vision for Change.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> Turning to this Bill before us, I understand Deputy Browne is seeking a number of key changes to the Mental Health Act 2001, which will give more to patients in their treatment. One of the changes concerns a proposal to amend the definition of a voluntary patient to explicitly include the need to consent to such admission. That is very welcome. It is essential that we do all we can to protect vulnerable people, including those who need psychiatric inpatient care. Currently, the definition of voluntary patient in the Mental Health Act 2001 states that a voluntary patient is not subject to an admission order - in other words, a person is a voluntary patient if he or she is not an involuntary patient subject to detention. This definition makes no reference to consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> In order to be compliant with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and in line with the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, it is necessary to include a specific reference to the need for a person to consent to admission. However, I understand that this change cannot proceed on its own without any associated changes being introduced. The suggested definition of voluntary patient would immediately result in some people being denied inpatient treatment. Such persons would be those who lack capacity and, therefore, cannot provide consent. While they would need inpatient treatment, they would not be sufficiently mentally ill as to warrant admission as an involuntary patient. As they lack capacity and cannot consent to treatment, they could not be voluntary patients but, equally, as they do not suffer from a mental disorder within the meaning of section 3 of the 2001 Act, they also could not be detained. Before we have any new definition of voluntary patient which explicitly refers to capacity, I agree with the Minister of State that we also need to include lawful measures which ensure that at no stage would the compliant incapacitated be denied treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> As the Minister of State has said previously, it is essential that the change to the definition of voluntary patient occurs simultaneously with the commencement of provisions relating to deprivation of liberty. He also proposes to prioritise a change regarding the definition of voluntary patient, including the associated deprivation of liberty changes, to continue work on the general scheme of a Bill to amend the 2001 Act, the text which, it appears, will be progressed by the end of 2017, and to look at Deputy Browne’s other changes in light of progress on the general scheme of a Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> I am encouraged by all this good work in the area of mental health reform. The Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, which has been established, has met on two or three occasions. We have set out a programme of work. We have been asked to propose child and adolescent mental health services in our areas that we would like to visit. That is very important. As politicians, we come in here and talk about issues, but it is important to get access to these facilities and services and see them first hand. It helps us to understand the complexities, issues and challenges we face. I look forward to visiting such facilities, along with my colleagues on the joint committee. I also look forward to working with my colleagues in that group. We have been tasked with the responsibility for progressing the development of a new policy for mental health. The policy review process will involve consultation with the key stakeholders, which is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> We can come in here and debate Bills and sometimes they are drafted by people who have accessed a service, but politicians should be seen to identify the problems and come up with solutions to them. There has been much talk of this minority Government but it has been quite successful. Many Bills are coming to this House. When I was a Member of this House from 2002 to 2007, Fianna Fáil, which was then in government, would bring in a Bill and that would be it. In 2011 when my party was in government with the Labour Party we would bring in a Bill and that would be it. There was limited debate and the Government used its majority to push Bills through. Most of the time the measure was probably right but sometimes we did not tease out the recommendations or the amendments. This new way of Government, for which the people voted, is quite interesting and successful. This is the way to do business.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> I look forward to listening to the views of all my colleagues on this very important Bill. I thank Deputy Browne for his work in progressing this mental health reform.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanFreeman" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Senator Joan Freeman<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_468">I would like to speak briefly in support of Deputy Browne's Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2017. It is a very worthwhile item of legislative change and I fully support that it seeks to address shortcomings.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> The legislation proposes five key amendments to the Mental Health Act 2001, which serve to strengthen and protect the rights of people embarking on mental health care. I would like to speak briefly on each amendment. First, the legislation proposes to amend section 2 of the 2001 Act and will provide a definition of voluntary patient as a person who has a capacity to be admitted. The existing structure is where people with no capacity and who do not object to being admitted are considered to consent to admission. The existing framework whereby a person who has no capacity is nonetheless deemed to consent to treatment is quite wrong, both in law but also logically wrong. This is an important amendment that respects the capacity of persons to have a proper say in their own treatment. I note that mental health reform representatives are in the Gallery today. They also, as a group, recommended this amendment in the past and are fully supportive of this change.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> The second amendment is to section 4 of 2001 Act where Deputy Browne proposes to insert four guiding best interest principles in regard to the treatment administered to people treated under the Act. I would like to speak about each amendment in turn. The second paragraph in section 4 proposes that the existing standards of autonomy, privacy and bodily integrity in treatment should be beyond dispute.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">The second best interest principle is that capacity is presumed until proven otherwise, in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> The third amendment provides that a person shall not be considered to be unable to make a decision until all practical steps have been taken to help him or her to do so. Section 4 (5) requires that unwise decisions should not be evidence of the absence of capacity. Let us just think about that. Many of us make unwise decisions but we are not deemed to have the absence of capacity. Overall, the inclusion of these principles represents a movement away from the outdated and somewhat paternalistic approach to treatment in the 2001 Act. Section 25 of the principal Act, which relates to the involuntary admission of children by the District Court, is also amended and supplemented to contain stand-alone best interest provisions in respect of children who are subject to these kinds of unique orders. I fully support this section, in particular as it serves to put into primary legislation best interest principles on assessments, admissions and care of children where these orders are often made. These orders are often made in particularly stressful and tense situations where very basic considerations such as bodily integrity and autonomy can get lost. </p>
          <p eId="para_473"> It is important that section 25 spells out the rights of the child that need to be considered by the courts when this kind of order is made. I also note that the retention of the best interest provisions proposed here by Deputy Browne would reflect and protect international human rights law and the necessity for children to have a say in their own treatment. The next amendment proposed by Deputy Browne is to section 56 of the Act. I will give the Deputy a heads-up here regarding where the proposed legislation states he is substituting the following for subsection (1). Section 56 appears to be made up of two subsections. This is a small technicality and not significant but I thought it worth mentioning. The overall intention of section 56 is to update the meaning of consent by reference to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and specifically to section 3 of that Act. This is an excellent amendment in that it proposes to update the interpretation of a patient's consent in the 2001 Act in line with the 2015 Act. This is far more descriptive and widens the understanding of consent by highlighting a holistic approach to capacity, including a person's ability to understand. Section 57 also affirms that involuntary patients cannot be given treatment without their consent except in certain circumstances. It is not currently clear under the Act that consent to treatment is required from both voluntary and involuntary patients. </p>
          <p eId="para_474"> I again congratulate Deputy Browne on this excellent legislation. I despair, however, as to how these modern treatment principles can be appropriately implemented in an inadequately staffed health service. We also have to swallow the fact made public today that only €15 million of funding has been applied to the mental health budget for 2018. I will not allow this depressing thought to take away from the excellent and comprehensive legislation that Deputy Browne has put before the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">I support the Bill. Medical staff, in my experience, know that a hazy area exists and I hope that this Bill will clear that haze. There are many good points in the Bill. I will not go into the amendments in detail but I welcome a Bill that will replace the existing principle of best interest under the Mental Health Act 2001 with the guiding principles of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which respects the will and preferences of the individual. I am also happy to see the retention of the principle of best interest in decisions made under the Act about the admission and treatment of children and young people under the age of 18. This principle should take account of the views of the child or adolescent as well as their will and preference. I welcome too the fact that the Bill will introduce the other human rights principles of the right to the highest attainable standard of mental health and the right to the least restrictive care. The Irish Government has already signed up to these human rights standards. I wish the Bill a speedy passage through these Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> I do, however, have a sharp word of warning. In light of the budget announced yesterday, propped up and supported by Fianna Fáil, none of this will happen. There is a severe lack of vision, courage and political will in Government - and I include Fianna Fáil in that term - for the much-needed revolutionising of mental health. A Fianna Fáil representative on RTÉ yesterday asked us to look at the confidence and supply agreement so as to see if it had delivered on this budget. This agreement states that the Vision for Change strategy must be fully implemented. Sadly, the term "aversion to change" would be more apt.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">This legislation, though good, is minuscule when compared with what is needed to change mental health on this island. We need to enact the A Vision for Change strategy, as 73% of the recommendations made in that document remain unenacted. We cannot allow it to languish and gather dust for another decade. As others have mentioned, it has been clarified that the supposed €35 million increase in the mental health budget actually includes €20 million carried forward from last year. This means a measly €15 million of new moneys, amounting to a percentage of 1.7%. The HSE service level report estimated that an increase of €65 million is needed just to accommodate demographic shifts and pay deals. There is a huge risk that this new money, tiny as it is, will be swallowed up just to keep existing services on life support.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> We know what the Government did last year and yet instead of asking questions, like we did yesterday, we are now plámásing around and letting spin go unchecked. I welcome the warriors in the Gallery from Mental Health Reform and I commend them on their Trojan work for mental health in this country. Mental Health Reform has stated that it is deeply concerned that essential services may not be in place to help distressed people when they need them. We call on the Government to fulfil the commitment in the confidence and supply agreement that A Vision for Change be implemented. The Psychiatric Nurses Association of Ireland, PNA, has also expressed disappointment. We all know of the deficits in the services, which include closed beds, long waiting lists, zero 24-7 crisis intervention, zero out-of-hours services and leaving nothing but hours of waiting at the very inappropriate location of the accident and emergency departments. Many in severe distress eventually just leave these departments, often with tragic results.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> The litany of problems goes on. The Government and Fianna Fáil chose in this budget not to act in the health area but instead chose to offer tax cuts which will provide, at best, a cup of tea and a few biscuits. They will not provide hospital beds or community mental health services. We could wait and see what the communications unit, also known as the Government spin machine, will conjure up here. Its annual funding of €5 million amounts to a third of the €15 million mental health budget. Public opinion, sentiment and rage will see through this manipulative deception. I commend the Bill but the most important matter for us to discuss here is the paltry €15 million given to our mental health services when our people are calling out for 24-7 services and for meaningful engagement in their own mental well-being.</p>

          <p eId="para_481">I will endeavour to speak to the Bill rather than score political points. It is a basic human desire to have one's voice heard. Whatever the context, each of us likes to know that our opinions will be listened to and, more importantly, taken seriously. This is particularly true when it comes to decisions made on our health and on treatments for ill health, and this should be as true of mental ill health as of any other illness. The fact that someone's capacity may be impaired by mental health difficulties does not and should not mean that they are not entitled to have their views heard and their values respected.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">That is why I am supporting the passage of the Bill today. </p>
          <p eId="para_483"> Many people, in their more nostalgic moments, yearn for a time when people had more respect for doctors, teachers, the clergy and other authority figures, but that time was also characterised by a society with very unequal power relations, where the ordinary folk were spoken down to by authority figures. The experts told us what to do and we did not question it. They did the talking and we did the listening. The attitude that the doctor or the teacher knows best and the unquestioning acceptance of anything said by the clergy are now, thankfully, gone. Nowadays most doctors, teachers and others who interact with the public have a more enlightened approach and have come to understand that allowing people's voices to be heard and treating them with dignity is important as it demonstrates that the service user is valued. In the field of health care, patient-centred communication and shared decision making are even more important. People may feel vulnerable when they experience ill health of some sort and treating them respectfully is a matter of common courtesy. More important, scientific evidence demonstrates that a patient-centred care model contributes to improved outcomes for patients, better use of resources, decreased costs and increased satisfaction with care.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> This Bill supports the right of inpatients to make decisions about their own treatment and starts from the basis that people should be presumed to have capacity to make decisions about their own welfare rather than the clinician deciding what is in the best interests of the client. The Bill focuses on the will, preferences, beliefs and values of a person. I am not for one moment suggesting that all doctors involved in the provision of mental health services are currently approaching their patients in a paternalistic manner. I am saying, however, that by putting this legislation in place we are making an important statement about those who suffer from mental ill health. As a society we are saying that their voice matters and will be listened to. This is important because such an approach fulfils the basic human desire to be heard, which I would characterise as a human right. We need to move towards a more human rights-based mental health system. </p>
          <p eId="para_485"> The Bill is only one step in reforming our mental health system but an important one. By passing it and working towards implementation of some of the other recommendations to come from the expert group on mental health reform, we will begin to move towards the fulfilment of international human rights law, including our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> I support the Bill because the approach outlined in it promotes positive interaction with the patient. It promotes better treatment and better outcomes. Most important, it promotes well-being because it clearly states that the person's voice matters.</p>

          <from>Senator Colette Kelleher<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_487">That the Minister of State has been here so often shows the depth of our interest and concern in matters that fall within his portfolio. This issue - mental health - is close to our hearts and comes up time and again. The Bill is a key example of the concrete action we can take to address this pressing issue. It is important that we hold onto that because there really is hope. We can do well by people who have mental ill health. There is hope, and it is important that we communicate that message. I congratulate, in particular, Deputy James Browne and the other members of Fianna Fáil for bringing the Bill forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> The Bill updates the Mental Health Act 2001 in key ways. The Bill contains significant changes to the 2001 Act that strengthen the rights of people when in hospital for mental health care. We would hope that this is the minority of people and that those with mental health issues would not need to get as far as the hospital, that is, that we could act, intervene and support them at an earlier stage. When we met in the summer, the Minister of State told us of a psychiatrist in Cork who is working hard to ensure that children never darken the doors of a hospital. We hope that we can support people at home. There are clear, progressive, people-focused and patient-focused changes contained in the Bill. It is a clear step in the right direction. </p>
          <p eId="para_489"> The Bill supports the right of an inpatient to make decisions about his or her own treatment by linking the Mental Health Act 2001 with recent laws which affirm that everyone should be presumed to have capacity to make decisions. If it was a physical issue, we would not think twice about asking the person if he or she wanted particular treatment. Those with mental health issues are, in fact, their own experts. They know better than anyone what is going on in their head and the supports that they need. It is, therefore, great to see this affirmed in law. </p>
          <p eId="para_490"> The Bill introduces a definition of a voluntary patient, which has been ambiguous. The definition will include only those who have capacity to make their own decisions, with support if they require it, and to give consent to admission to hospital. As the House will be aware, at the moment those who do not have the capacity to consent to admission but do not object are considered by default to be voluntary patients. This is even though they were not able to actually consent to the admission. They do not receive external review of their detention, which can go on for a long time, nor the oversight protections provided to involuntary patients. We need this additional clarity on who is a voluntary patient and who is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> The Bill replaces the existing best interests principle for adults and inserts the guiding principle of will and preference. Again, the most important thing is to be cognisant of the person, to spend time with him or her and to find out what is going on and what might help. There was an interesting presentation on adult safeguarding yesterday. It was about hoarding and what it might mean to a person. Often hoarding can go right back to a person's childhood. Understanding that rather than incarcerating or drugging a person can be the key to unlocking that person's recovery. </p>
          <p eId="para_492"> On NGOs working in the area, Dr. Shari McDaid and her team from Mental Health Reform noted that what we had was a very paternalistic approach that sustained a culture where at times the views of the doctor, as Senator McFadden said, were more important than those of the person. The Bill would also introduce other human rights principles to the highest attainable standards of mental health as well as the right to the least restrictive care. This is a welcome shift from a time when the best we could offer those with mental ill health was to lock them up in places like Our Lady's Hospital, shock them or medicate them with what is known as "liquid cosh". I shed no tears when I saw vandals setting fire to some of the buildings on Lee Road. These are places of sorrow and tears that contain the spirits of people who were deprived of their liberty, segregated, silenced, sequestered and forgotten about. We can do better and this Bill is part of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> The Bill also rightly affirms that voluntary patients cannot be given treatment without their consent. It affirms that involuntary patients cannot be given treatment except in clear and transparent circumstances. When it has to happen, as it unfortunately sometimes does, we are clear about the circumstances that must exist. Currently it is not clear under the Act that consent to treatment is required from both voluntary and involuntary patients. Obtaining consent is key. In addition to making these valuable improvements, the Bill is also important because it provides us with the opportunity to highlight the need to amend the Mental Health Act 2001 in full and the seriousness of continued human rights violations of people who are being treated in hospital for a mental health difficulty. People of my age will remember the film "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", with the unforgettable Nurse Ratched who had so much power over those in her care. We need to continue to shift the power back to the people themselves and to support and understand them rather than control them. This Bill is an important part of that shift.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> Mental Health Reform highlights that to date only one of the 165 recommendations of the expert group on the review of the Mental Health Act 2001 has been implemented. The timetable for updating the Act has not been met time and time again. What is going on with our inability to face up to mental health issues? There is a long story there in terms of our history. We fail to act so often.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">We adopt fantastic policies and carry out fantastic reviews but fail to translate them into action. Passing the Bill will also contribute in some part to the Government's fulfilment of international human rights law, including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which is being championed by my colleague, Senator John Dolan. As constituted, the Mental Health Act is not compliant with either convention. Beyond the changes to legislation, we must also increase the resources available. Again, I note with disappointment the failure to provide adequately for mental health services. It is disappointing that we are underspending in this important area. That is part of the lack of imagination shown in providing for mental health service interventions. I am sure the Minister will say doctors and nurses could not be recruited. These are very important professions, but the mental health service goes way beyond this to what happens in the community. It is extraordinary that the first port of call for a child with a diagnosis of mental ill health is not the family therapy service. Very often the child who is ill is a conductor for what is going wrong in the family, yet he or she is often neglected and does not gain access to the intervention needed. We should be willing to look anew at the issue and I hope with the new committee we will look at how we can spend the moneys allocated and move beyond the nurse and doctor model. These are important professionals, but they are not the be-all and end-all. When I was involved with Cork Simon, one of the measures we introduced was a walk-in counselling service for people with addictions because they were not getting support they needed as they were mentally ill. They were not being treated for their illness because they had addictions. People were disclosing the most shocking histories and there was no place for them to go. We provided the service which we also funded. With imagination, there is no reason we cannot do better.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> I am delighted to support the Bill. I commend the Fianna Fail group, Deputy James Browne and the Minister, and I look forward to more work being done in progressing mental health service reforms in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_497">As Senator Colette Kelleher said, I am in this Chamber very often dealing with this issue. I find it engaging, always learn something new and leave more informed than when I entered. It is a pleasure to be back again.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> I again thank Deputy James Browne for introducing the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2017 which has progressed through all Stages in the Dail. I recognise the importance that he and others in both Houses attach to the need to introduce these changes to mental health legislation. It is timely that we have the opportunity during World Mental Health Week to continue our national conversation about mental health, with a particular focus on this occasion on improving the standards set out in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> From a personal point of view and the point of view of the Government, I again stress the significance we place on providing and improving services for all those in society who suffer from a mental illness. Thankfully, the majority of people who live with a mental illness will never come within the provisions of mental health legislation, with such individuals recovering on their own terms with the support of family, friends, the community and mental health services, where required. That is the point Senator Colette Kelleher was making. For those who require involuntary inpatient care and treatment, there is an onus on the Government, the Oireachtas and society to put in place appropriate legislation which will provide the safeguards necessary to ensure involuntary admission and treatment will take place in a structured manner with the individual's needs at their core.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> In speaking about the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2017 I should also say legislative change is only one part of the important reform process that is ongoing in the mental health sector. Regarding the national policy A Vision for Change - Ireland's Health Service Senators will be aware that a newly established oversight group is in place to oversee the next stages of the review of this seminal document. It will also be something at which the newly established Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care will be looking in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> Senators will be aware of the announcement made yesterday in the Budget Statement that an additional €35 million in development funding for mental health services is to be provided in 2018. Let me clarify and make it absolutely clear to everybody that my door is open to any Senator who wishes to have the conversation with me. An additional €35 million in new development funding is being given to me as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services to initiate new developments in the sector. It is not funding to maintain existing services or to be used towards pay costs. I look forward to debating in this House how the money will be spent. I will take personal responsibility to ensure every cent of the allocation will be spent on mental health services and not returned to the Department of Health or rolled over to any other health sector. If Senators can assist me or offer any guidance in that direction, I would welcome it. Also announced in the budget was an additional allocation of €40 million to be spent next year. I can clarify 100%, despite some of the commentary, that I have been given responsibility to oversee the spending of the additional €35 million in new development funding for the mental health sector. I look forward to doing so. As I said, my door is open to any Member who has concerns or doubts the veracity of what I am saying. It will help us to build on the work commenced in 2017, particularly in the enhancement of community teams for children and adults, as well as later life and mental health intellectual disability services. It will also help us to continue to move towards a fully 24-7 service. It is planned to further improve services for those with eating disorders and a dual diagnosis. I have asked the HSE to use the extra funding to ensure that not only are services of a high quality but also that we are providing as seamless a service as possible for every service user. We now have an opportunity to address our common desire to ensure mental health legislation is as fit for purpose as it can be and meets the highest international standards. </p>
          <p eId="para_502"> The Bill we are discussing reflects one of the clear priorities of the Government, but it is also a strong reminder that stakeholders in the mental health sector want to see progress in updating mental health legislation. I join other Senators who have acknowledged the presence of representatives of Mental Health Reform in the Visitors Gallery and thank them for their contribution for many years in improving services. That is what we are all focused on. We can split hairs on differences, but essentially we are here to improve services for the service user. I acknowledge the debt of gratitude the State owes to Mental Health Reform and the work Members have continued to do in the mental health sector. We can all agree that mental health legislation needs to be changed. However, we also need to ensure that when the changes are made, they will be made in the right manner and have the intended effect. </p>
          <p eId="para_503"> It is important to recall that in 2015 the review of an expect group of the Mental Health Act 2001 was published. This first significant review was informed by A Vision for Change and the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, both of which had been published since the 2001 Act was passed. The review provides a clear and complete roadmap for how we should amend mental health legislation for the better. The review, which contains 165 recommendations, is progressive in nature. First and foremost, it set out to promote and protect the rights of persons with a severe mental illness. This is in addition to promoting access to the most appropriate and highest achievable standard of care and support. One of the key recommendations which I welcome and which is referenced in Deputy Jame Browne's Bill is that we move from paternalism and best interest to providing a service that is guided by autonomy, self-determination and respect for a person's dignity, with a presumption that he or she is best placed to determine what promotes or constitutes his or her own dignity. </p>
          <p eId="para_504"> The previous Government agreed with the broad thrust of the recommendations made in the expert group's review and approved the preparation of the general scheme of a Bill to reflect the changes in revised legislation. That work is under way at official level and expected to be progressed by the end of 2017. This Private Members' Bill, the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2017, which is sponsored by Deputy James Browne and which was published on 23 February 2017, has three main goals, the first of which is to seek to amend the existing definition of "voluntary patient" in the Mental Health Act 2001 to include the need for the patient to consent to admission. It also seeks to replace the existing consideration of best interest with a number of principles, including, <i>inter alia, </i>the highest attainable standard in mental health, autonomy, dignity and due respect for the person's own understanding of his or her mental health.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">Finally, the Bill seeks to link the issue of consent more closely with the provisions under section 3 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which deal with a person's capacity to be construed functionally.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> The last two changes, relating to best interests and consent, closely mirror recommendations of the expert group review of the 2001 Act. They represent a move away from the often paternalistic interpretation of the existing legislation, best identified by the inclusion of the principal consideration of best interests, which is both necessary and welcome. We all want a situation where, in so far as is possible, individuals have the final say in what is in their best interests and where they receive the best possible quality of service to help them to reach the highest standard of mental health. These changes will effectively move away from paternalism and place greater autonomy in the hands of the individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> On the issue of consent, while the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was not in place when the expert group reported, what Deputy Browne is proposing is broadly in line with what the group proposed in regard to consent and capacity. The first change, relating to the need specifically to include consent in the definition of "voluntary patient", was fully accepted by the expert group and is my top priority change at this time. Moreover, it is required in order to comply with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. While what is proposed is absolutely necessary, there is one significant issue which I bring to the attention of Senators. If we change the definition of "voluntary patient" as proposed, then persons without capacity who need inpatient mental health treatment but who do not have a mental disorder will not be able gain admission to a psychiatric hospital because they cannot personally consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> A new definition of "voluntary patient" which includes the need for consent must commence only when other changes are introduced to allow patients without capacity to access treatment. In this regard, my Department is in discussions with the Department of Justice and Equality on introducing new legislative provisions relating to deprivation of liberty. This is a complex piece of new legislation which will cover anyone who lacks capacity and requires admission to a nursing home or facility for persons with disabilities or mental illness. Subject to the agreement of the Department of Justice and Equality, the draft provisions form part of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the changes, when agreed, will be introduced on Committee Stage of the Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which has already completed Second Stage in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> The expert group initially recommended that persons who lack the capacity to consent to voluntary admission, often described as "compliant incapacitated", should be placed in a new patient category under the 2001 Act to be known as "intermediate". The idea was that such patients would also have available to them all the safeguards currently available to involuntary patients under the Act. Since then, however, it has become clear that all persons going into residential care who cannot, due to lack of capacity, consent to such admission must have safeguards in place. This is to ensure their rights are protected and their will and preferences, to the greatest degree possible, are respected as set out under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. With the new deprivation of liberty safeguards now being framed, there is the opportunity to devise a better and more consistent route to deal with "compliant incapacitated" patients seeking treatment in a psychiatric hospital or unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> While the proposed changes, particularly the priority amendment relating to changing the definition of "voluntary patient", can be amended by the Oireachtas in the short term, any such change cannot be commenced until the decision support service, DSS, to be established under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is operational. This is because the draft safeguards currently being worked on at official level use the framework set out in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and envisage a role for the decision support service. Therefore, before such provisions can be operationalised, the Act must be commenced and the DSS must be in place. A steering group of officials from the Department of Health, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Mental Health Commission and the Office of the General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court, which is chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality, is working on the establishment of the decision support service. The first director of the service took up her post on 2 October. There is no doubt, however, that the establishment and operation of this service will be a complex undertaking requiring significant preparation.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> I once again thank Deputy Browne for introducing his Bill in the Dáil. We are in agreement that the changes he is proposing need to be made. As I stated during the passage of the Bill through the Lower House, my officials will need time to revisit some of the text to ensure it is fit for purpose and does not have any inaccuracies. My officials plan to discuss the wording of the Bill with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and get a legal sign-off before introducing necessary changes on Committee Stage. I ask that my Department be afforded the time to get this right before the Bill is returned to the floor of the House. Members can be assured that my officials and I will review all the comments made here today and will bear them in mind as work progresses on the wording of the Bill. The Government does not intend to oppose the legislation.</p>

          <from>Senator Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_512">I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply. The issue of consent is a complex one and it is important we get it right. There has been a great deal of reform in the mental health services in the past 20 years and it is important that those reforms continue. On the broader issue of the health services in general, I am concerned that there is a view being given out, including in this debate, that the 100,000 staff in the public health sector are sitting around and doing nothing all day. There were 3.2 million outpatient attendances in hospitals last year and 1.2 million patients attended accident and emergency departments. On a weekly basis, that works out at 63,000 people attending outpatient departments, 23,000 presenting at emergency departments and another 16,000 undergoing day care procedures. It is wrong that an impression should be given that the health service is doing nothing for anyone. In fact, people in this country are living longer than ever before and a comprehensive service is being provided in a range of areas. There are difficulties in certain areas that must be dealt with, including in emergency departments and mental health services, but improvements continue to be made. The false impression must not be allowed to go out that dedicated and committed staff are sitting around and doing nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> I travelled recently to the United Kingdom as part of a delegation to look at how health services are being delivered there. At the location we visited, the staff were very pleased that the average waiting time for securing a GP appointment had been reduced from 15 days to eight. We have not reached that situation in this country and I hope we never will. In all areas of our health service, staff work to provide care to patients in the quickest possible time. Many improvements have been made in mental health services, for example, as I have seen in my home city. Staff there are working in teams and seeking to reduce the level of hospital admissions by engaging with the community. That system is working well in the southern region and it is important that further progress is made in other areas. We must recognise the work that is being done. Mental health is a complex area, presenting difficulties both for staff and for the families who are trying to support a loved one facing issues. It is important that we continue to provide the back-up support to those families and to acknowledge the professionals who are providing that support.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> I appreciate the detailed response the Minister of State has provided today. The report of the expert group contained some 165 recommendations and it is essential that we proceed to implement them in a timely manner. The report must not be put on a shelf for further consideration in five or ten years. We must set a clear agenda and clear targets and we must move ahead with meeting them. We should not focus only on the here and now when it comes to health services but also plan for the long term. That is especially the case in regard to mental health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">The one area on which we need to focus in terms of nurses and medical staff is how we retain in the service the people we train in this country so that they can continue to work here. We should also try to bring back those who have gone away. We are making progress on this area and it is important that it would continue and that the implementation of the recommendations that were published in 2015 is not delayed any further. The Department and the various interest groups are working on drafting further legislation and it is important as well that that is brought forward at an early date. I thank the Minister of State for dealing with this matter in a comprehensive way.</p>

          <from>Senator Frances Black<recordedTime time="2017-10-11T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_516">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, back to the Chamber. I am very happy to speak in favour of this Bill. I commend Deputy James Browne for his work on it. It is great that the Bill has progressed through the Oireachtas very quickly, which goes to show the strong cross-party support for it. That is fantastic.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> I also congratulate Mental Health Reform whose representatives are present today. In particular I pay tribute to Dr. Shari McDaid and Kate Mitchell for the extensive input they made to the Bill, and their wider advocacy. We have definitely made big strides in Ireland on how we think about mental health, how prominent the issue is and how comfortable we are talking about it. It is brilliant that in the past five to ten years there has been a definite change. Although we still have some way to go it is good to see progress on this issue, and this Bill is another example of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> The core aim of this legislation is about respecting people and their right to make their own decisions about their care and the services they access. One does not need to look far for stories about how people have been mistreated in mental health services in this country or about the coercion or domineering attitudes they have had to face, so this shift is much needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> There is a changed understanding here in what we consider the best interests of a person seeking mental health care. We are moving away from a situation where the views of a doctor are given too much primacy over the views of the person who needs support. It empowers people to be more active decision-makers in the care they receive, and that approach is more consistent with human dignity and respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> It may seem technical, but the new definition of a "voluntary patient" is an important change that will provide better protection for people accessing mental health services. It better caters for people who have the capacity to make their own decisions and give consent on admission to a facility. Importantly, it also ensures that people without the capacity to consent are not considered voluntary patients by default, as has happened in the past. That will give such patients greater access to external review and oversight protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> I am also pleased to see that consent is central to the Bill. It ensures that voluntary patients cannot be given treatment without their consent, and that involuntary patients must similarly give consent except in some circumstances. Again, that brings in a much stronger role for the individual, and a much greater respect for his or her own capacity, desires, dignity and rights. It is a change in our attitude towards people seeking mental health support.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> Overall, while I am happy to support the Bill progressing to the next Stage, I think we can also be honest and say that it is quite a modest Bill. The Mental Health Act 2001, which it reforms, is still out of date in many ways. I accept the Minister of State has addressed the issue. I would like to show support for Mental Health Reform's call for progress on the recommendations of the expert group report on the review of the Act. The Minister of State referred to the 165 recommendations made but, according to Mental Health Reform, only one has been implemented to date. Again, that shows there is so much more to do before we have adequate mental health services in Ireland. That is especially important as, in line with improved attitudes toward mental health care, demand for services is rising. As my colleague mentioned earlier, that is particularly true for children, many of whom still cannot access the support they need. Since 2014, demand for mental health services has gone up almost 30%. However, as of July 2017, almost 2,500 children and young people are still on waiting lists, and many have been waiting for over a year. While we need gradual improvements in care, as outlined in the Bill, we also need significant resource investment in proper public services. That must be a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> Last week I was happy to speak in support of Senator Joan Freeman's motion on 24-hour mental health services and I reiterate that now. I beg the Minister of State's forgiveness for repeating myself but I know from my experience working in the field of addiction that problems do not arise solely in working hours. We would not accept accident and emergency departments that did not offer 24-hour access, and we should take a similar approach to mental health support. It is often out-of-hours or on weekends when people really need urgent help.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> I again stress the major importance of dual diagnosis, which is when a person suffers from both a substance misuse problem and a mental health issue such as depression or an anxiety disorder. The reality is that if we do not treat both conditions together, we cannot overcome either one.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> Senator Colm Burke talked about families. I again highlight the impact on family members who are living with someone who has either a mental health issue or an addiction. It can really impact them in the long term. Therefore, while I welcome the Bill and I am happy to see progress being made, I think we should also see it as an opportunity to refocus, push on and demand further improvements.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> It is great to see that the Minister of State is so passionate about this issue and that he is taking such an interest in it. I really get that energy from him. I am pleased he is offering us an open door. I will certainly take the opportunity to call on him.</p>
