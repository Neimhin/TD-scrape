            <p eId="para_17">It is a pleasure to welcome the Minister to the Chamber. I wish to discuss the condition of the Timoleague Garda station. Timoleague is a lovely village in the heart of west Cork. It is a tourism area, but the indigenous population needs to be supported. A key factor in that is the services it receives, be they the post office, shops or the Garda station. A garda lives in the station. It is an important part of the community and we hope that it can be upgraded. We must have such institutions down south, given that they promote those elements that are important for rural communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> There is a significant tourism element to this Garda station. Courtmacsherry, a prominent tourism town that does well in that regard, is literally down the road. Considerable amenities also attach to the village, for example, long walkways and the abbey. We hope that the Department will consider this station as part of a national redevelopment and invest money in it so that it can be upgraded. It is a key part of the physical and social infrastructure of the area. If we can improve such elements, we can improve the quality of life for people on the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> I hope to get a suitable response from the Minister so that I can assure those from Timoleague with whom I have been speaking that their Garda station will be developed.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Richard Bruton)<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_21">I am answering on behalf of the Tánaiste, who cannot be present.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> I thank the Senator for raising this issue. He will appreciate that the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation. This includes identifying and progressing any necessary new build and any remedial or refurbishment work required at individual stations. The Tánaiste has no role in these matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> I am informed that the opening hours for Timoleague Garda station, which forms part of the Bandon district, are 10 a.m. to 12 noon, Monday to Sunday, with calls diverted automatically to Bandon Garda station outside of these hours. I understand that the strength of the Bandon district is 103 members, three Garda reservists and 11 civilian staff. The Garda authorities have informed me that there are no plans at present to undertake significant works at the station.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> The Senator will be aware of the significant current investment in the Garda estate. For example, the 2016-21 Garda station building and refurbishment programme, which was announced in October 2015 by the Tánaiste and the Minister of State at the OPW, is based on agreed priorities established by the Garda. More than 30 locations around the country will benefit from the programme, which includes major refurbishment of stations and facilities, for example, facilities for meeting victims of crime, essential remedial works to existing stations, development of large-scale property and exhibit management stores, the upgrade of cells and the provision of improved custody management facilities. The programme is being delivered by the Garda authorities in co-operation with the OPW, which has responsibility for capital expenditure in this area. Under the programme, new Garda stations will also be provided in Glanmire, County Cork, and Bailieborough, County Cavan, through direct Exchequer funding and a further three new Garda stations will be provided in Sligo, Macroom and Clonmel by means of public-private partnerships.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> In addition to the programme, more than €100 million has been provided for new divisional headquarters in Kevin Street, Dublin, and Wexford as well as for a new regional headquarters in Galway. These projects are under way and are expected to be completed in 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> These measures cannot be viewed in isolation from the Government's overarching commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. In furtherance of this, the Senator will be aware that, in July 2016, the Government approved the Tánaiste's proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 gardaí. 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In addition, the Government's Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 provides some €205 million for investment in Garda ICT infrastructure and €46 million for investment in the Garda fleet. Taken together, the Tánaiste believes that these measures reinforce the Government's commitment to enabling significant reform in An Garda Síochána and to providing a high-profile and visible policing service for our communities.</p>

            <from>Senator Tim Lombard<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_28">I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to come in again. I will be very brief.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> I thank the Minister for his response. The Government's investment in An Garda Síochána and related services is greatly welcomed. The Minister mentioned major developments in Macroom and Cavan, but we also need to look at smaller Garda stations. Garda stations in small towns and villages must not be allowed to fall into disrepair, resulting in an infrastructural deficit. The Department of Education and Skills is a great example of how the State can do a fantastic job in reacting. I hope, therefore, something similar can be done in this regard. We should consider upgrading Garda stations throughout the country. New stations are being built, including in Glanmire, but we also need to examine the nuts and bolts of planned infrastructure. Garda stations in small towns and villages will be important in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality has set out her plans within the confines of the existing budget. We are entering into a mid-term review of capital expenditure programmes and a public consultation process is under way. One of the key themes of the plan will be how to deliver sustainable regional and rural development. We will have to examine closely priority areas where we could make investments in regional and rural networks. I cannot decide whether investing in rural Garda stations is the priority, or whether there are other investments that could boost regional and rural development. As regards my own Department, building education networks in the regions will be vital to achieving our ambitions to have strong and vibrant rural communities. I am sure each Minister will be examining these matters in the context of the challenge to embed regional development as we approach the mid-term review, but in any capital plan resources will be scarce. I will, however, convey the Senator's views to the Tánaiste.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">I thank the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, for attending to address this matter which is extremely important to Monaleen national school, Castletroy. I live in Monaleen where my four children went to school. There has, however, been an ongoing problem with overcrowding in Monaleen national school which has over 850 students and the enrolment is growing. It will probably reach 900 next year and be capped at that level. There are 31 classrooms, of which 13 are in prefabs. Three are in the original old school building, while a further 15 are in the newer school building. That number will increase to 16 next year, bringing the total to 32.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> Following my discussions with the Minister, I am glad that his Department is considering providing a brand new 32 classroom school on the site. Effectively, that will involve knocking down and replacing the existing buildings. While that is to be welcomed, I would like to deal with the logistics. I understand a brief formulation report is being completed by the Department, but I am asking for it to be fast-tracked in order that we can proceed to the architectural planning and design phase of the new school building. Does the Minister expect the Department to examine the project in order that the school can apply for planning permission and put a contractor in place? I understand the process will take about 18 months to complete, but the new school building is urgently needed. It is welcome that the project is being prioritised for examination by the Department, but I want it to be fast-tracked in order that the brief formulation report can be issued. It will provide the roadmap for how the new school building will be constructed, including the appointment of design consultants as quickly as possible. The school could then proceed to the planning phase, followed by the appointment of contractors. Parents and pupils in the fast growing greater Monaleen-Castletroy area will then have a school that is fit for purpose. It is a great school in terms of its teaching methods, but the buildings are old and need to be replaced. In addition, there are 13 prefabs which are not fit for purpose in the modern era. The Minister may wish to give me an indication of the logistics involved and indicate how quickly we can expect to have the new school building up and running.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_33">I thank the Senator for raising this matter. He knows the backdrop to the schools building programme. There are serious demand pressures exerted by a growing population such that we must provide approximately 15,000 extra places every year to meet increasing enrolments. On top of this, we replace about 5,000 places per annum, which absorbs virtually all of our budget. We are working hard to keep up with demographic growth pressures, not least in County Limerick, as recognised in the six-year construction programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> Monaleen national school is a co-educational, Catholic primary school which caters for boys and girls from junior infants to sixth class. In recent years the school has experienced rapid growth in enrolments, increasing from 565 pupils in 2009 to 865 in 2016, an increase of 300. As a result, it has required considerable rented accommodation to meet demand. It is projected to grow to a 32-classroom school. I can confirm that it submitted an application to the Department to meet its accommodation needs. The application sought to replace the significant temporary accommodation, in addition to providing further accommodation to meet the increase in pupil enrolments.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> To progress the project for the school, approval was granted in March 2015 for the provision of eight mainstream classrooms in the first phase, together with ancillary accommodation. Responsibility for delivery of the project was devolved to the school authority. The school was advised that the provision of further additional accommodation required to meet its needs would be progressed as phase 2 of the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> The project for the school is contained in the Department’s six-year construction programme, 2016 to 2021. In the course of 2016 it emerged that there were significant complexities and constraints, as the Senator has described, presented mainly by the school site and the location of existing school buildings, as well as infrastructural deficiencies in existing accommodation. Accordingly, taking into account the need to keep the school in operation during the construction phases, it was considered to be more cost-effective to proceed with a single construction project in two phases, with a 16 classroom development being provided in each phase. The approach which is also likely to achieve economies of scale was advised and has been welcomed by the school authority. My Department will continue to liaise with the school concerning the project development and is committed to progressing the project as quickly as possible into the architectural planning process.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> I again thank the Senator for raising the matter. As I said, the first phase involves the construction of a two-storey, 16 classroom school. Pupils will then be transferred into the new block from the 1977 building which will subsequently be demolished. A new two-story extension to phase 1 will then be constructed, creating a new 32-classroom school. The prefab accommodation will be demolished to enable external works to be completed. There is, therefore, a good programme of work which the Department is fully committed to progressing.</p>

As there are many families with young children in the area, it is welcome that the brief formulation report is being completed. In addition, the Minister is seeking to expedite the project to architectural planning phase as quickly possible. The project is being prioritised by the Department. I thank the Minister and his Department for taking an interest in the project which will yield enormous benefits. The new school is urgently required in the greater Monaleen and Castletroy area.</p>

            <from>Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_40">I welcome the Minister of State. This is the third time I have raised this on the Commencement and he has responded on two occasions.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> In 2005, Tir na nÓg opened with ten children to meet the demand for respite care in Carlow and the surrounding area. Eleven years later, 42 children were using the weekend respite service with a waiting list of more than 30 children. The centre was located in a house on a private estate in Carlow town, which was funded by the HSE. In December 2015, this facility closed because the house was too small. Prior to that, the doors had to be widened and a hoist installed but the house was still not big enough for what was needed. Given the new rules and regulations, HIQA came in and that was why it closed.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> In March 2016, to fulfil the desperate need for a respite centre, an alternative day respite service was set up. On Friday, between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m., and on Saturdays and Sundays between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., children are picked up and brought to the Delta Centre. The core issue is no emergency or overnight respite service is available in Carlow or Kilkenny. Only ten children use the emergency facility established by the Minister of State. An overnight respite service is needed most. A total of 42 children were using the weekend respite service with a waiting list of more than 30 children and this continues to increase. Originally, a businessman from Carlow town donated a site to Tir na nÓg. The centre set up a fundraising committee for a new building. A price of €350,000 was quoted at the time and we forwarded this to the Department. That is a not a significant amount to provide a service for the most vulnerable in our community but the new build did not happen. All we have now is the weekend service.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> I brought this issue to the attention of the HSE south east through Councillor Arthur McDonald who work with me three times over the past six months. The centre has been closed for 14 months but we keep being told it was being looked at and that nothing had been signed. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, who replied on the last occasion I raised this matter, said the funding was in place but no lease had been signed. That is not acceptable. Yesterday in the House, I raised a recent survey on vacant properties in Carlow. The county has one of the highest vacancy rates in the country, along with Dublin, Galway and Waterford. The HSE says it cannot find a suitable vacant property in Carlow town. Officials are considering a property in Bagenalstown. They are saying they do not know if it is suitable and no lease has been signed. There has been no update. This is 14 months later and the overnight respite service remains closed.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Finian McGrath)<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_45">I thank the Senator for raising this issue and I accept her frustration regarding respite services. I welcome the opportunity to outline the current position. Holy Angels Day Care Centre is a disability agency providing services, including a preschool service, for children with disabilities in Carlow. The facility is funded on an annual basis by the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act and it received funding of approximately €720,000 in 2015. Respite services for the parents of children in Carlow were previously provided by Holy Angels Tir na nÓg in Carlow. Since 2013, the services delivered by Tir na nÓg have been under the remit of the independent regulatory body, HIQA, in respect of the standards of care being delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> In December 2015, the Holy Angels Day Care Centre advised HIQA and the HSE of the decision of the board of management to close the centre from January 2016 after they received notice from the landlord. On 16 December 2015, the HSE disability services manager wrote to the care centre requesting the development of a plan regarding an alternative approach to respite service provision to be completed in consultation with families, notifying them of the discontinuation of the existing respite service. Families were invited to meetings in January 2016 regarding respite services. To address current respite provision requirements, in March 2016 an alternative respire provision was set up in partnership with the HSE and Holy Angels. In 2016, €140,000 was allocated for the provision of respite services by Holy Angels. This is currently being provided by Holy Angels in the Delta Centre as an interim arrangement. This service is ongoing and the HSE is liaising with Holy Angels in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> The matter of providing overnight respite services to families of Carlow and Kilkenny is of key importance to the HSE and to the Senator and myself. I understand that a venue for respite service delivery has now been agreed and is being finalised on a two-year lease. A tender process for service provision was completed on 27 January 2017. The tender evaluation for the provision of respite services in Carlow-Kilkenny is ongoing and has almost been concluded. It is anticipated that a recommendation to proceed on the basis of the evaluation process will be issued to the head of procurement, and thereafter to the budget holder, this week. The successful agency will then have to seek HIQA registration and this process can take up to six months. I also share the Senator's frustration in this regard. The HSE, via the successful agency, will request that HIQA fast-tracks the registration process which would be approximately four months. It is hoped, therefore, that services will commence to provide overnight respite services in July 2017 at the earliest, depending on the HIQA process.</p>

            <p eId="para_48">I am so disappointed by this reply. We are 14 months on. This has gone to tender but the HSE will not say where the site is. The least officials could do is tell the people of Carlow-Kilkenny where it is. Everything is top secret, which is unacceptable. The Holy Angels accommodation is in prefabs. A new school was promised five years ago with a €5 million contract. The reason €140,000 was allocated last year was to fix leaks in the roof and because it was unfit for purpose. This is unacceptable. No respite service is available and we still do not know where the centre will be located. We are still waiting on the tender. The HSE and the Department have a duty to tell those who avail of the service where it will be provided. July is another five months away, which means it will be 18 months since the centre closed. The tender will come back to the Minister of State and the health board over the next two weeks. Parents should be told where the tender is for. We have been told the tender has been going on for six months. Will the Minister of State clarify where the tender is for?</p>

            <p eId="para_49">I share the Senator's frustration regarding delays over the past few months and I take her point regarding the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_50">There have been three positive developments in terms of respite care. First, the matter will go to the head of procurement and thereafter to the budget holder this week. Second, I understand the Senator's frustration about possible delays with HIQA, but I must observe certain standards as Minister of State. I will ask HIQA to fast-track the registration process. Third, I will talk to the HSE about the valid points raised by the Senator about the tender process and other issues relating to respite. They must be acted on. There is no point in having a service plan and budget of €1.688 billion for disability services in 2017 if a group of parents cannot get respite in Carlow-Kilkenny. I will take the Senator's point to the HSE and push it strongly.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">I raised the issue of the national children's hospital in the Seanad last week and caused a division in the House by calling on the Minister for Health to attend to address why the hospital has not been progressing. I urge the Leader to use his power and political skills to urge the Minister to take a renewed look at the national children's hospital to ensure he brings a new focus to it and that the project goes ahead. The lapse we have seen has caused campaigners for alternative sites to increase their very aggressive lobbying of many Members of this House. It is not acceptable that these delays have caused a massive increase in this aggressive lobbying. It has taken away from the project. The excavation works have taken place at the St. James's Hospital site, the plans have been written up and the land has been flattened. This project is ready to go but, unfortunately, there are many lobbying groups out there looking for different sites. If the hospital goes to another site, what other site will be suggested after that? It has already been at the Mater hospital and the St. James's Hospital sites. The St. James's Hospital site is the right site and Fianna Fáil is 110% behind it. I urge the Leader to ask the Minister to take a fresh look at this today and progress this matter as a matter of urgency for the children of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> The second issue I wish to raise concerns waiting times for paediatric occupational therapy in Dublin city. A total of 158 children are on waiting lists for occupational therapy in Dublin South-Central alone, which is just one small part of the city. I urge the Minister for Health to look at this. These waiting times are unacceptable so more resources need to be allocated to early intervention. I ask that the Minister to look at this to ensure that funds are put in place. We are talking about children. It is not fair that they must wait so long. </p>

          <p eId="para_56">I think everyone knows that National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire is meant to be the national centre of excellence for rehabilitation. A Senator from across the floor spoke about it last week and I have raised it on numerous occasions since I entered the Seanad. One concern is that the new hospital that has been planned for years is simply not happening. There are issues relating to the land itself, funding, planning, procurement and tendering. I know these processes are slow but there are problems. The hospital authorities have confirmed that they have cut 12 beds since Christmas. I received a statement from and have had communication with them and I told them that I would raise the issue here today. The HSE says it cannot fund 12 beds. It has been unable to fund 12 beds since Christmas but it is meant to be building a hospital with 120 beds next year or the year after. There is a crisis at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in respect of its future development, its development plan and its resourcing. At a time when we are making improvements in health, the hospital authorities are actively and openly engaging with and asking people to lobby the Minister for Health to intervene and get the HSE to cough up funding to reinstate 12 beds. We are only talking about 12 beds. Over 800 people are waiting to access national rehabilitation services and many of them are lying in acute beds in hospitals around this country at a time when we have a crisis in our general hospitals. I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to come to the House with a detailed plan. What is actually happening in the National Rehabilitation Hospital complex? What will happen in the short term? If possible, we want to hear about the 12 beds in the next week.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">I rise to discuss the imminent, all-out bus strike and the impact it will have on people. I do this in the context of an earlier meeting relating to the national spatial strategy and talk that we will lose the Athlone to Westport route. There are many questions around that, including taking services, including vital transport services, away from rural Ireland. In any survey, people say that transport is one of the biggest barriers to accessing vital services like health. Millions have been spent on developing and marketing the Wild Atlantic Way. We must be clear about this. It is a political decision. In 2015 when cuts to transport services and bus routes were first mooted, An Taoiseach said that buses could not be driving around boreens. When we get that kind of response, it is any wonder we are on the verge of an all-out strike?</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> I want to put this in the context of the economic and financial decisions that are made in this country. Bus Éireann has projected that it will lose €9.4 million this year. Let us consider that figure in the context of the €350 million given to vulture funds on the back of the section 110 loopholes. That means were the decision made to close the loophole to facilitate foreign vulture funds we could run Bus Éireann for 37 years even with the losses cited by the organisation. This is the type of political decision-making that we are getting, which impacts on rural Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_59"> With regard to the threat of 120 job losses in Bus Éireann, the cost to the Exchequer, never mind the impact on the lives of those workers and that of their families, is intolerable. I ask that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sports gets involved, even at this late stage, to prevent an all out strike. I hope he realises that he cannot expect the workers of Bus Éireann to pay for ten new buses or vital rural transport that connects the east and west of the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health to the House for a debate on the accident and emergency services. I say debate but I would prefer a discussion. We need a constructive discussion on such services and people being left on trolleys.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> The Opposition parties and, indeed, Mr. Liam Doran, constantly highlight the problems in the HSE but never offer a solution, a bit like the housing crisis. I would like a discussion here with the Minister. I was encouraged to call for a discussion today because a person came to me yesterday who had attended MIDOC, which is an out-of-hours medical service in the midlands. Last Friday night she went to MIDOC with a pain in her leg and paid €50. She was told that her ailment was probably more serious than what MIDOC should deal with and was advised to attend the accidence and emergency unit in a local hospital, which she duly did. She arrived at the unit at 11 p.m. and was seen by a triage nurse. She was told to sit on the chairs in the waiting room at 11 p.m. and that is where she sat until 6 a.m. the following morning when she was moved on to a trolley. She waited on the trolley for two hours and a doctor tended to her at 8.10 a.m. She did not see a doctor in the unit all through the night. Five other people were also in the waiting room and none of them saw a doctor either.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> The following questions must be answered. Was there a doctor in attendance? Was there no doctor until 8 o'clock in the morning? If so, why was the lady not sent home and told to return at 8 o'clock? If there is no doctor on duty then why does MIDOC refer people to accident and emergency units? Statistics on the number of people on trolleys are continually collected. Is this lady simply a statistic? We need a constructive discussion on this matter but we should not simply list our issues with the system. Instead we should encourage the Minister to listen to our suggestions in terms of ways to solve the problem. I call on the Leader to please arrange a discussion.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">I join with Senator Rose Conway-Walsh by discussing the Bus Éireann issue. It is very serious for the entire country, particularly for rural Ireland. It is estimated that Bus Éireann carries approximately 110,000 passengers per day, which is a startling statistic. It is mind boggling to consider the huge social impact a strike would have on the citizens of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> As part of the cost cutting exercise it is proposed to do away with the three routes of Dublin to Clonmel, Athlone to Westport and Dublin to Derry. I am familiar with the Dublin to Derry route because it passes through County Monaghan and Ardee in County Louth. The bus stops in Monaghan town, Castleblayney, Carrickmacross and also in Ardee. It is a vital service for the people who live in the region. There is another bus that travels direct from Letterkenny to Dublin. It stops in Monaghan town but not in the other towns in County Monaghan or in Ardee. The loss of these routes will have serious repercussions for rural Ireland. At a time when there is a renewed focus on developing rural Ireland this proposal will take away a vital link to the region. </p>
          <p eId="para_65"> I understood up to this point the reluctance of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to get involved in the dispute but this matter has become too serious. I plead with him to bring all of the parties together in a round table discussion with a view to finding a compromise. Ultimately every dispute is settled. The only way the dispute can be settled is through talks. I plead with him to bring all of the parties together to find a solution for the benefit of all of the citizens of this country.</p>

In fairness, the Government has recognised that this is a huge issue and initiated an investigation. It has been estimated that 27,600 self-employed people work in the construction industry. These people are forced to operate as sole traders by unscrupulous employers and, as a result, lose out on sick pay, holiday pay and protection provided by employment legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> I raise this issue today because tomorrow a right of access Bill will be debated in the Dáil. The legislation would support the right of trade union officials to access construction sites, and not just construction sites. The legislation would be the most effective way to tackle this scourge and afford protection to these workers in the industry. </p>
          <p eId="para_68"> I am disappointed but not surprised to hear that Fine Gael will oppose the Bill. It is a reasonable demand for trade union officials to have the right to access sites in agreement and consultation with employers. I am more disappointed to hear that Fianna Fáil will also oppose the Bill. I have heard that construction employers have lobbied Fianna Fáil. Traditionally, there has always been strong links between construction employers and Fianna Fáil. As a result, disappointingly----- </p>

There is a certain cull needed of old and infirm deer, particularly red deer. No one wants the population of native red deer to be greatly reduced. However, old and inform animals must be removed from the deer population, and maybe a few hinds. As far as I am concerned, the population of Japanese Sika deer can be wiped out. They are more difficult because they are smaller animals and thus are better at hiding in the woods.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">Their number is down. With more rangers, management of that will improve. Please God, that will happen. I ask that the Minister be brought to the House in early course to discuss these issues. Did Senator Conway-Walsh mention another national park?</p>

          <p eId="para_91">I wish to raise the inequities thrown up by the higher education funding scheme, particularly for the squeezed middle. A recent and very interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, by Brian Mooney, discusses the social divide and heavy dependency on higher education grants, especially in the institutes of technology. Some 61% attending institutes of technology have higher education grants and 41% of students attending universities have them. I am concerned about those caught in the middle, namely, students or potential students whose parents are PAYE workers on low to middle incomes and who do not qualify for a grant. These parents are challenged in sending their children to college. This is partly attributable to the fact that gross income is assessed. A considerable mortgage repayment on the family home is not allowed as a deduction. The cost of putting other children through third level is not taken into account, other than through an allowance given for dependent children.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> Yesterday, we all rightly advocated the merits and benefits of higher education. It is no burden on anyone. A man who came into my clinic recently has three children, one of whom is doing the leaving certificate this year and the other two of whom are in college. His wife works with the HSE, although not on a very high income. The children do not qualify for a higher education grant. The man has to take out a loan each year for the two in third level. He is now at a point where he cannot afford to send his third child to college. This is the conversation he will be having over the mid-term break. None of the children qualifies for a grant. The man has taken out a loan to put two through college but there is no deduction for that. The family has a mortgage. It is paying for everything and getting nothing from the State. The third child may not go to college because he is caught between two stools. I would like this matter to be taken up with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton. I believe legislative change is required. We are always talking about encouraging people to work and not making work unattractive. The hard-pressed people are the people who have to pay all round and who are not getting supports from the State. Ironically, if they were in receipt of social welfare payments, there would be a disallowance or a deduction based on any income received, thus making them qualify. This is a serious issue that affects a significant cohort. I ask that serious attention be paid to this.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">I wish to add my voice to the expressions of support in both Houses of the Oireachtas yesterday for the family of Pat Finucane. The murder of Pat Finucane is one of the starkest examples of collusion between British state forces and loyalist paramilitaries. Pat Finucane was a human rights solicitor and he fought for truth and justice. Yesterday's decision in the Court of Appeal in Belfast is yet another example of an attempt to deny the Finucane family, including Geraldine, access to the truth about the murder of Pat Finucane. The family has campaigned long and hard in a dignified manner despite obstacles placed before it continually. The British Government has agreed to hold a public inquiry into the murder and has reneged on that commitment. I hope these Houses will continue to support the Finucane family in its campaign for justice.</p>

There are two in different parts of the county and one based in Limerick city. The news is very welcome. The proposal is to have no fees for some radio stations and to reduce fees by 50% for others, depending on the size. Small radio stations are struggling to keep going.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">Today I want to raise the ongoing issues concerning Bus Éireann. Yesterday afternoon, the talks between the unions and company at the Workplace Relations Commission broke down. Imminent strike action is now a possibility. This results in great uncertainty for those who rely on Bus Éireann services, particularly those rural Expressway services that are under threat at present. One of these services, the Athlone-Westport service, services many towns, villages and facilities in Roscommon, such as Kiltoom, Knockcroghery, Ballymurray, Roscommon hospital, Roscommon town, Ballymoe, Castlerea and, in the west of the county, Ballinlough.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> The uncertainty is of serious concern for those who rely on the service as their primary means of transport. The service connects to local services and helps people to reach their destination of choice. Many of the journeys made are to access critical health care and other essential services. As Fine Gael spokesperson in the Seanad on regional and rural development, I am really frustrated. We need to ensure we have a fair service in rural areas. It is not good enough that the people who use the services are being told these routes could potentially be closed and that the services could be cut. The Athlone-Westport service is very necessary for the people who rely on it. We need answers. We need the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, to address the Seanad to outline clearly the steps he and his Department are taking to ensure the services are protected in rural areas. I am aware that the Athlone-Westport train services many of the larger towns along the route in question but the bus services small towns and villages where the train does not stop. It is vital to the people in these areas. Moving between larger towns and smaller ones, such as Ballymoe and Ballinlough, will be extremely difficult if the service is axed.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> We absolutely need a new roadmap for public service obligation routes across the country. The National Transport Authority has said that if any service is cut, it will ensure no rural area is left behind. What does this mean? Is it now possible to make the route in question a public service obligation route due to the necessary stops and connections it makes? We need leadership from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, on this issue. We also need leadership from the National Transport Authority to ensure that these services are protected and that rural areas will be serviced properly.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">Over recent weeks, the appalling condition of Ireland's health system, particularly the unacceptable waiting lists, has been to the fore. The Euro Health Consumer Index has ranked Ireland's health care system 21st out of 35 countries. Ahead of Ireland are countries with much lower incomes, such as Macedonia and Slovenia. Our accident and emergency unit waiting times are the worst in Europe. The report expresses surprise, which I imagine is tinged with disgust, over the low ambition of the HSE to have a target of no more than 18 months for a specialist appointment. We learned from the report that even if and when the target is reached, we will still have the worst waiting time in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> I implore the Minister for Health to examine the Macedonian system, in which, through an uncomplicated e-booking system, a general practitioner can book an appointment with any specialist or any heavy diagnostic equipment in the country in real time while the patient sits in the room with him. The general practitioner has access to the diaries of consultants and can see where in the country a consultant has an opening. He can advise the patient based on need. In Macedonia, this system eradicated waiting lists in less than six months after start-up. In one year, the Macedonian rating in the Euro Health Consumer Index jumped from 27th to 16th. We could aspire to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">Experts have testified that Ireland would be a perfect candidate for a system such as this. Coupled with the Fianna Fáil Party health policy proposal that all hospitals have 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. consultation times enforced and diagnostic scans available in public hospitals seven days a week, we could eradicate waiting lists here too.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> I am well aware that the implementation of electronic systems in this country does not have a good track record. There will be plenty of people reminiscing on electronic voting and the Eircode system, but we need to realise that key targets on waiting lists were missed in 2014. The targets were widened in 2015 and still missed, and likewise in 2016. The current system is not working. We need a concerted commonsense effort, such as the Macedonian system, and I will be bringing this to the attention of the Chairman, Deputy Michael Harty, in the Joint Committee on Health, for consideration.</p>

          <p eId="para_102">This morning, at the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, the ISPCC attended and gave an informative presentation. It was as frightening as it was informative as to the range of difficulties being experienced when it comes to cyberbullying. Cyberbullying encompasses all sorts of activities such as stalking online, grooming, bullying and targeting by companies and individuals of young and vulnerable children. I appreciate that in many instances children are way ahead of adults when it comes to technology but we as legislators and policy-makers need to regulate app companies. The reality is that Facebook, Twitter and the like get the difficulty here, they are much more in tune with it and they have policies, but it is the smaller operators who target children for their own gain that we need to get on top of. They recommended the Office for Internet Safety be set up with a digital safety commissioner, which needs to be done without delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> At the end of the day, we cannot be negative about the Internet, it is a fantastic tool. It has advanced education and everything else, probably in many instances beyond where we would like it to be. It is a phenomenon that we are happier with than without. We need to legislate to make it very difficult for these app companies and companies in general to be able to target children in this way. The software that exists to target them should be actively used to avoid them in many instances. I would welcome a debate on this important issue with the Minister in the near future.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">Before I raise an important issue, I want to make reference to a growing trend I have noted in this Chamber over recent days and weeks. When this side of the House, in particular, these benches, raise the chaos and the shambles in the Government, particularly manifested in transportation links in Bus Éireann, we are dismissed as opportunists, cynical, reckless and negative, but when Fine Gael Senators lament the Government's chaotic decisions I wonder will they be characterised with the same brush.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> Today, at 1 p.m., representatives of the McGurk's bombing families will provide a briefing for Oireachtas Members and their support staff in the AV Room. I am sure many are familiar with the McGurk's case. It was a bomb planted at McGurk's bar on North Queen Street in 1971. It killed 15 people. Immediately after that tragedy, the British state moved, as it transpires, incorrectly, to blame the IRA for the bomb, citing it as being an own goal. It is several decades ago now but the families have not lost their commitment or determination for justice. It has got to the point where grandchildren and great-grandchildren are having to carry the flame in that campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> I would hope to have a Commencement debate on this, given the Government's responsibilities around the outstanding legacy issues. I will approach the issue with all of the respect and courtesy, and hopefully, the support of all Members, that it deserves. It would be a useful opportunity, given the new evidence that has come to light which has been exposed by the families themselves working diligently to expose the lies inflicted upon them. As a House, as institutions and as individual Senators, we should support their justifiable and understandable call for an inquest into the murder of 15 of their relatives and loved ones.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">I wish to raise the issue of the increase in staff in the HSE and in the health services. It is a welcome development. From 2014 to the end of 2016, the number of staff in an overall context has gone up to 107,085, which is an increase of 7,758. However, I have this concern about it. The number of staff in management and administration has gone from 15,120 to 16,767, that is, an increase of 1,647. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health to the House to address this issue and to appoint an independent authority to look at the administrative structure in the HSE, how management is focused and why there is an increase in administration and management of 1,647.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> I welcome the increase in care assistants by 2,142. If one looks at other areas, such as that of public health nurses, their number has gone up by only 39 in that two-year time period. In fact, in the past 12 months, their number has decreased by two. We need to look at where are the priorities in the health service. One would imagine that public health nursing is a key area in the sense that it is at the coalface, where we need staff to ensure we keep the maximum number of people out of hospitals and accident and emergency units.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> We need to appoint an independent authority to look at the management structure and to see how the HSE is performing as regards value for money. We are the second highest spender on health care in the OECD. Clearly, we are not getting value for money and this is now the only way of dealing with this matter. I would ask the Leader to bring it to the attention of the Minister for Health, to have a debate here and that we would take decisive action on it. I will raise it at the Joint Committee on Health later today but it is an important issue that we cannot leave go on the way has over the past years.</p>

          <p eId="para_111"> The Bus Éireann dispute is a serious matter. I join with colleagues who have raised it here this morning. It is a vital piece of infrastructure for rural areas, particularly those which have no rail network. I would appeal to the Leader to impress upon the Minister, Deputy Ross, the importance of this service to the nation. I stress that it is the opinion of not only the unions and the management of Bus Éireann but the wider public that savings need to be made. However, the management needs to engage with the unions so as this situation can be brought to a successful conclusion and that its public service obligation, PSO, should be properly funded.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> Through the Leader, I wish the Taoiseach well this evening at his parliamentary party meeting. I extend him genuine best wishes. I would encourage him not to be bullied or intimidated out of office. At this time, whether we agree with his policies or not, this country needs his experience at European level, not egos and so-called interpreters and commentators sitting around a table negotiating on behalf of the country.

          <p eId="para_115">I had better begin with Senator Wilson's final remark. I share his views that the Taoiseach is and has been a strong, prolific leader of our people across the world stage. As Senator Wilson well knows, being in government is a difficult task and some Members of the House need to understand that one cannot say yes or no all the time. One has to have a bit of steel and a bit of bottle. The Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, has been a tremendous Taoiseach. I hope-----</p>

It is a very important and serious matter that has given much concern to many people in the country who depend on Bus Éireann for transport. Members correctly identified some of the reasons people travel which include for hospital appointments, to go into the local village or to travel to visit loved ones. It is important that the talks resume. It is only through engagement that we will find a resolution to the matter. There is no hope of a resolution or a solution to the impasse unless people sit around a table and talk. Both management and unions must engage in a meaningful manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">There must be meaningful engagement by all sides in the resolution of this impasse. The Government has increased the PSO. It has increased funding to Bus Éireann. It is now a matter for the management and the unions to sit down and engage in the process. We must ensure there is connectivity and public transport links. We must also examine how we can deliver a better service for the people who require it.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> Senators Boyhan, McFadden, Colm Burke and Swanick raised the issue of health. Senator Boyhan rightly raised the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire, which Senator Hopkins raised last week on the Order of Business. It is unacceptable that beds are being closed at a time when the previous Government and this Government are committed to a progressive examination of how the National Rehabilitation Hospital can be developed and deliver its model of care to people who are probably most of all in need of care in the health system. The response from the Health Service Executive on the matter is unacceptable. I have seen a general blanket statement in response to the matters raised by Senator Boyhan this morning. It is important that we again have engagement. It is incumbent upon the HSE to sit down with hospital management and the Department or with local public representatives. I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House regarding the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> Senator Conway-Walsh spoke about vulture funds and money but it is Voodoo economics and I ask her to re-evaluate how she wants the country to fund services. We must look at who pays for everything, how we pay for it-----</p>

          <p eId="para_159">There is an issue in terms of access by trade union officials to building sites, shop floors and other places. As somebody who was involved in a union I recognise the importance of having a union in a school. We must understand the importance of unions to protect the rights of workers. I am sure an accommodation can be reached on the Bill but as the Cathaoirleach said, it is a matter for the other House, not for us here today. It is important that we do not allow the rights of workers to be trampled upon because we have spent a long time fighting for their rights. In a changing world in terms of employment it is important that we stand firm about conditions and rights. We can have a different roadmap for getting there but it is important that we stand up for workers rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> Senator Coghlan raised the condition of the national park in Killarney, in particular rhododendrons and deer. I pay tribute to him for his work concerning Killarney National Park where he is a director. He has been a very strong champion of the importance of upgrading Killarney National Park and he has been instrumental in its revitalisation. He has been a wonderful ambassador for the park. He raised issues about rangers, the deer population and rhododendrons and I expect he can get a satisfactory answer from the Minister or if he raises a Commencement matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> Senator Mulherin raised the matter of inequality in higher education in terms of funding and the squeezed middle. I share her view on the matter. We had the Minister in the House yesterday but Senator Mulherin could raise the issue on the Commencement.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> Senators Warfield and Wilson raised the issue regarding the family of Pat Finucane. The matter was also raised yesterday. My position remains the same as then, namely, I personally stand for the right and the need of the family to get justice. Geraldine Finucane and her family have been very dignified in trying to have the truth established. It is important that we do all we can. Senator Ó Donnghaile raised the briefing in the AV room today on the McGurk bar bombings. It is important that we allow for truth and reconciliation for people on all sides of the divide in the North. It is not a case of one-size-fits-all or one side or the other. It is about all people. In the case of Pat Finucane it is important that we continue to make every effort in order to establish the truth in that case. I speak personally in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> Senator Maria Byrne raised the issue of community radio and the reduction in fees for independent broadcasters by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">Speaking as someone who volunteered on hospital radio in Cork University Hospital and who appeared on Cork City Community Radio last week, the importance of community radio should never be undervalued and we should at all times promote it as an alternative to the commercial stations and RTE. In the main, it is driven by volunteers who give of their Saturdays, Fridays and nights, raise funds and man radio stations in the interests of providing connectivity for people who have no access. I commend Senator Byrne for raising this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> Senator Swanick spoke about Macedonia and the Joint Committee on Health.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Andrew Doyle)<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_195">I apologise; my voice is a little bit groggy and I hope I manage to stay audible for my opening statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> I welcome the opportunity to make a statement to Seanad Éireann on the organic sector, for which I have special responsibility within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. For the information of the Members of the House, I propose to give an overview of the organic sector in Ireland, the supports that are available, the market situation and the challenges and potential opportunities that exist. I look forward to the contribution of Members on this important matter. I will put the sector into context. While the organic sector in Ireland is still relatively small in regard to agriculture as a whole, it is experiencing considerable growth. There are currently 2,127 organic operators in Ireland, of whom over 1,700 are farmers. The area of land under organic production has expanded dramatically under the current rural development programme, thanks to a suite of supports that have been put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> The latest figures indicate that there are now 72,000 ha under organic production, an increase of nearly 50% since the start of the programme in 2014. The growth of the sector has been specifically fostered through the new organic farming scheme, in particular, which was introduced as part of the rural development programme, along with dedicated capital investment schemes and better synergies with other schemes such as GLAS.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> The new organic farming scheme was launched in April 2015, with a budget of €56 million over the lifetime of the rural development programme. It has been very successful since its launch, attracting 942 applications in its first tranche and 322 in the second. To put this in context, the highest number of applications received previously was 380 in 2010. I also want to draw attention to the fact that over 500 of the organic focus scheme applications received in 2015 were from farmers converting to organic farming for the first time. The upsurge in interest represents the first real expansion of the production sector for many years and is very encouraging.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> By way of comparison, the highest number of new entrants to organic farming heretofore was 158 in 2009. The new scheme has three times that number. When combined with organic farmers participating in the old or existing organic farming schemes, this means that we now have 1,740 organic farmers in the system. This is a major step forward by any standards. The new scheme is a major success and we have already met our targets for the entire RDP period. One of these targets was to convert some 16,000 ha of new land to organic production. Following the first two tranches of the scheme, we now have 26,000 ha in conversion, a 60% increase on the original target.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> We have not forgotten those farmers operating under the old organic farming scheme. Following extensive negotiations, the Commission agreed to extend the benefits of the higher OFS payments under the new scheme to the old scheme participants. Furthermore, the Commission has agreed that we can extend the contracts of people operating under the old scheme so that all participants can now be confident of a secure system of supports right up to the end of RDP period. We have effectively managed to synchronise all our various contracts of support for the next five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> For the first time, this allows us to plan ahead with confidence in terms of supplying and developing an organic food market. In planning ahead for the current RDP period, we were very conscious that organic farmers have very special requirements in terms of on-farm equipment and facilities. Under TAMS II, therefore, a dedicated capital investment scheme has been put in place for the sole benefit of organic farmers, providing support for the widest range of equipment and structures of any TAMS scheme. Such investments are eligible for 40% grant assistance, with 60% grant assistance for qualifying young farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> We have also put in place a ring-fenced and very flexible investment scheme for organic processors. The scheme is wholly State funded and offered grant aid to €500,000 for individual projects. The scheme recognises the importance of innovation and keeping abreast of technological developments. It directs financial assistance towards projects which facilitate the adoption and application of new technologies. While the financial supports are essential, other support mechanisms are also critical to future development. The importance of providing education and training for those considering organic options and existing organic farmers cannot be underestimated. Since 2010, the inclusion of an organic training course as an essential prerequisite to joining the organic farming scheme has provided farmers with a good understanding of the regulatory requirements but, above all, enabled farmers to make informed decisions regarding their organic options.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> One of the most successful initiatives in raising awareness of the organic sector for other farmers and the general public has been the demonstration farm programme. It is run by Teagasc and funded by my Department, and continues to go from strength to strength. For young farmers, and even successful established producers, there is plenty to learn and new ideas to help improve various enterprises. I would like to commend Teagasc, especially the organic advisory staff and the participating farmers, on the time and effort they put in to making the programme a success. The Organic Growers of Ireland internship programme has also been a successful initiative which has provided practical guidance and training for young farmers who are considering organic horticulture. </p>
          <p eId="para_204"> From an organic farming perspective, the market situation, challenges and opportunities are largely dictated by the demographics of our organic farming sector. The majority of organic farmers are engaged in beef and-or sheep production, with relatively low numbers engaged in tillage and dairy. Increased participation in the organic farming scheme means that when these operators have completed their conversion period, there will be an increased volume of organic beef and sheep available for sale. Research shows that market opportunities exist for Irish organic beef. The market for organic lamb is, however, more challenging. The most important challenge for us now is to ensure that we develop the market for organic product in tandem with the growth in production. This will be the keystone of long-term sustainable growth. </p>
          <p eId="para_205"> Mindful of these challenges, my Department is working closely with Bord Bia - its officials are meeting me today - to develop organic markets for our organic produce, especially sheep meat. Bord Bia undertook a detailed analysis of the organic sheep meat sector in 2016 to gauge quantities of organic product coming to the market in 2017, with a view to identifying markets for this produce. This work will continue. I would like to acknowledge the work Bord Bia continues to do to raise the profile of organic food among consumers at home and abroad. </p>
          <p eId="para_206"> Ireland has developed a strong reputation internationally for its organic farmed salmon, and is the biggest producer of organic farmed salmon in the European Union. Demand for Irish organic salmon has grown by 11% since 2012, with the estimated value of the export market in 2015 reaching €64 million. There is clear potential for growth in this sector. </p>
          <p eId="para_207"> While there are undoubtedly real challenges in terms of developing markets, there are also promising and encouraging signs for the future. Bord Bia has indicated that there has been a rise of 23% year-on-year in the sales of organic food in major multiple outlets, increasing the market share to €142 million. This is a very positive reflection on organic farming in Ireland and mirrors a growing trend right across Europe. Demand for organic food products has continued to rise over recent years, with the global market for organic agricultural products up by 355% from 2000 to 2015, climbing from €16.8 billion to €76.7 billion, according to a report presented at the BIOFACH world organic trade fair in Nuremberg last week. </p>
          <p eId="para_208"> We need to focus on how we can further grow our share of that market, by exploring opportunities such as increasing our overseas presence. Ireland has maintained a strong presence at the BIOFACH trade fair for several years now and this has been proven to generate new export opportunities for the Irish producers involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Back at home, research suggests that over 90% of Irish shoppers now buy organic at least once a week, which is clear evidence of the growing public awareness of the organic brand. We have an opportunity to capitalise on this. This includes replacing imported organic products with Irish goods wherever possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> I cannot conclude without mentioning Brexit. Brexit is a recognised challenge for the Irish organic sector. In the first place, the UK is a very important market for our organic produce. However, currently both countries are producing organic food to harmonised EU regulatory standards. Any deviation from these harmonised standards could lead to a disruption in trade in the short term with potential increased bureaucracy and costs to exporters. This is an area we will continue to monitor closely as the process for negotiating Brexit begins. </p>
          <p eId="para_211"> I have concentrated on informing Members of the House about the current state of the organic sector in Ireland referring both to its challenges and opportunities. While challenges do exist, opportunities are available to those who have the vision to tap into a sector which is seeing unprecedented growth. Going forward, I would like to see existing markets consolidated. The evidence suggests that there is further potential in the sector but in order to grow sustainably, it must be market driven. As Minister of State with responsibility for the organic sector, I am committed to the sustainable development of the organic sector and I hope that Members, as public representatives, will assist me in this objective through the encouragement of those considering the organic option, the maintenance of existing organic producers and the development of the sector generally. </p>
          <p eId="para_212"> Bord na gCon is the statutory body which is responsible for the following: the control, promotion and operation of greyhound racing; the overall control of coursing; the promotion of greyhound exports; the operation of totalisator betting; the regulation of public sales of greyhounds; the making of grants for prize money; the allocation of grants to improve amenities at tracks; the licensing of greyhound tracks and their officials; the authorisation of bookmakers to conduct business at tracks; and the collection of levies on course bets. In that context, it runs commercial operations in a number or greyhound stadia. In total, there are 17 greyhound tracks licensed by Bord na gCon, with Bord na gCon currently owning Shelbourne Park, Harold's Cross, Cork, Tralee, Waterford, Youghal, Limerick and Galway. It also has a 51% share in the Mullingar track.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> In an economic report by Jim Power in 2010, it was estimated that the greyhound racing industry is responsible for sustaining in excess of 10,000 full and part-time jobs directly and indirectly, many of them in rural communities, and that it injects an estimated €500 million into local economies. The greyhound breeding industry is also very export oriented with over 75% of greyhounds now running in the UK being Irish bred. Greyhound racing attracts thousands of tourists to Ireland from many countries, particularly France, Germany and the UK, and it works closely with Tourism Ireland, Fáilte Ireland and the various tour operators. Ireland is regarded as a world-class player in greyhound breeding and there is considerable potential for further development in this area. The Irish Greyhound Derby, which is run in Shelbourne Park, is one of the richest greyhound races in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> The 2015 audited accounts of Bord na gCon have being submitted to my Department and were submitted to Government yesterday for noting. The accounts show some positive metrics for Bord na gCon but it remains the case that the financial position of the board is extremely challenging and would be considerably worse without the additional subvention from the horse and greyhound fund in 2015. This was an additional €2.8 million - up to €13.6 million. In overall terms, the turnover from racing activities increased by 12.5% from €25.02 million in 2014, to €28.16 million in 2015 due mainly to the introduction of its new food and beverage business. While on-course wagering experienced a decline, which was also a feature of horse racing, the impact on tote turnover has been reduced through the introduction of numerous international co-mingling customers and the growth of online wagering on the tote following the introduction of the Barking Buzz app. </p>
          <p eId="para_215"> Having said all this, Bord na gCon has been operating in a very difficult financial environment for a number of years, in particular since 2011 when it took on considerable debt as a result of the development of the Limerick stadium. In 2014, against the background of reducing income for the organisation through the recession and the significant debt burden, my Department commissioned an independent report into certain matters relating to Bord na gCon, including its financial performance and prospects. That report, known as the Indecon report, provided a roadmap for the sustainable development of the greyhound sector and in that context, recommended a number of asset disposals, including Harold's Cross, in order to reduce the debt burden. The first asset disposed of was the former Bord na gCon headquarters in Henry Street in 2015 for approximately €700,000 with the proceeds being offset against Bord na gCon's debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> Bord na gCon is continuing to work very closely with its banking partners to manage issues arising from legacy debt of €12.5 million relating to the Limerick stadium, which continues to hang over the industry and inhibit its development. The board also operates a term loan facility of €6 million which is subject to fixed annual repayments. The balance of this facility was reduced to €3.9 million as of 31 December 2016. In addition, the board has an approved overdraft facility of €6.25 million. Currently, net group debt stands at €20.3 million down from €21.6 million in 2015 so the debt is moving in the right direction but at a slow rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> One of the key risks to the future of the industry is the scale of the debt that still remains. I understand that having considered the matter and having regard to the recommendations in the Indecon report, Bord na gCon has decided to cease racing at Harold's Cross with a view to putting the stadium on the market in order to reduce its debt levels and increase its capacity to provide support and assistance to the industry. While this is very regrettable, its view is that there is no other option if the burden of debt on the organisation is to be reduced in any meaningful way. I understand that its intention is to transfer the Harold's Cross racing schedule to Shelbourne Park and that all 12 staff at Harold's Cross will be offered redeployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> It should be noted that any sale of Harold's Cross will require the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Ministers will consider any specific proposal for its sale, having regard to the Indecon recommendations, the value obtainable, the need to avoid any further burden on the taxpayer and the need to reduce the significant burden of debt so that resources can be better deployed towards the development of the sector rather than the servicing of the debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> There has already been significant Government commitment to this sector in recent years with the contribution of the taxpayer through the horse and greyhound fund having increased from €10.8 million in 2014 to €16 million in 2017. The Government remains committed to continuing to support this vitally important sector. However, it is clear that if it is to have a sustainable future, the burden of debt on Bord na gCon must be reduced. In this regard, the board has its own responsibilities to discharge which involves some very difficult decisions. It cannot be the case that the entire burden of resolving the sector's difficulties always falls on the taxpayer. This may involve some very difficult decisions. </p>
          <p eId="para_220"> I intend to bring the heads of a greyhound industry Bill to Cabinet next week followed shortly afterwards by pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">The Bill seeks to address in general terms issues relating to the governance and regulation of the greyhound racing sector. The heads reflect recommendations for legislative change made in the Indecon report, commissioned by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in 2014, in the greyhound report of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine published in 2015, and in the Morris review of anti-doping and medication in Ireland, commissioned by Bord na nGon and published in 2016. They address governance issues in Bord na gCon, provide a robust legal basis for strengthened regulatory controls in the industry, modernise sanctions, improve integrity and include the welfare of greyhounds as one of the statutory functions of Bord na gCon. In addition, it provides Bord na gCon with powers to make regulations in regard to substances that may be used or given to a greyhound, prohibiting the use of certain substances and setting thresholds in relation to others.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> I very much look forward to engaging with colleagues in a positive and constructive way on the development of this Bill. It is clear that the development of the sector depends entirely on its reputation, and a robust and modern legislative framework is a critical part of that dynamic.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulDaly" eId="spk_124">
          <from>Senator Paul Daly<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_223">I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber. At the outset, I would like to put on record my annoyance at the fact that these two sectors were coupled together. They are both very important sectors within the agriculture brief and they are well deserving of their own slot. It smacks of getting them over with. By coupling them, it limits the amount of time we have to converse on both of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> I will deal with the organic sector first. I welcome the Minister of State's briefing. I may differ somewhat on the numbers, but I think that the difference in our numbers probably has to do with dropouts. While a good picture of new recruits to the organic sector was painted, it is a five year cycle and the number of people who stay in the sector after the five year cycle is completed was not mentioned. There is a large dropout rate and people revert to the conventional farming after five years. That is a very clear indicator that there are issues within the sector and people are struggling to maintain the standards required of them and survive on the funding available. Some 1,721 farmers on 52,390 ha out of the total of 140,000 Irish family farms, while commendable, is very low. It is below 2%. The EU average is between 5% and 6%. In other parts of the world - Australia being a prime example - it goes up to 15%. We have to ask why we are below the European average and so far behind the world leaders. At a time when it is proven that the sales of organically produced produce and food is up by 23% in 2016 we have to import between 75% and 78% of fruits and vegetables that are sold here as organic. There is huge potential in this area, with the proper supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> As a first-time Member of this House and as a new member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I was shocked to realise that as late as December 2015, the previous joint committee did a lot of work on this and put a comprehensive report together, which was forwarded to the Department. Unfortunately, to date not one of the issues highlighted concerning the organic sector has been addressed by the Department. One of the major issues highlighted was same year payments, and there is still a major issue here where people are still not receiving the payments due to them within the same calendar year. This is a problem across the entire farming sector, not just organics, and we hear that the reason is that there is an IT problem. In a sector like this, which is subsidy driven, it is vitally important for the survival of these farmers that they get their payments within one calendar year.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> Another major issue highlighted by the joint committee was that the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and organic sector funding be looked at. The double funding rule is an inhibitor in some cases, in particular for the smaller organic farmers when they take up organic status because they lose out on GLAS payments. The joint committee recommended that a front-loading system be put in place where €315 per hectacre for the first 20 ha be introduced. Again, there has been no feedback from the Department on this, or no action on same.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> It was also recommended by the joint committee that the stocking density for hill sheep or hill farmers be reduced from 0.5 livestock units per hectacre to 0.15. The mountainous and hilly areas of this country lend themselves ideally to an organic system, but we are inhibiting through stocking densities. It is a non-monetary change and it will not cost anybody anything to change those figures and make it a more viable proposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> The main issue that needs to be addressed is the fact that we do not market or promote our organic products nationally to a sufficient extent. The majority of what is being produced organically is going for export, and I think that we need to be promoting Irish produced organic produce for the home market and take down the barriers where local processors such as local butchers can be allowed to process beef and lamb and sell it locally. A number of individuals within the sector are really progressing by taking the bull by the horns and using systems like the local farm markets to sell their produce. This has proven to be successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> Another issue raised by the joint committee was the duplication of inspection. Where people are Bord Bia compliant and organic compliant they are having double inspections. Could this be looked at with a view to avoiding double inspections and introducing inspections only where there are perceived problems as opposed to an annual inspection? Irrespective of how compliant one is with one's previous inspection, one still has the onerous task of preparing for another inspection the following year.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> There was also a request for payment for forage production, which would be a big help to the organic sector. It would be a feasible proposition for organic farmers to produce their own feed. The biggest cost on most organic farms - beef and sheep, in particular - is that when they have to be fed organic food the organic food is not available and has to be imported. That is a major expense.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> Moving on to the greyhound industry, it employs 10,300 people with an economic output of €500 million. Since 2002 there has been 10 million visitors. These are brilliant figures for an industry that unfortunately is receiving much bad press and in the eyes of the public is not functional. We, in Fianna Fáil, support the fact that it receives 20%, some €16 million, of the horse and greyhound racing fund, but I would put an addendum there that under the current circumstances, and given the frightening figures the Minister has provided on the debt associated with the sector, this money should be used more like it is in horse racing. Some 63% of the money received by the horse racing industry is allocated towards prize funds. This is not happening in the greyhound racing sector. The prize funds are minimal. It is like the old adage that if there is no carrot at the end of the stick, one will not move forward. Sales of greyhounds have suffered because of this. The Minister in handing over this money should add an addendum to it that it will apply a similar system and that a mandatory amount of the money it receives should go towards prize money, which would help to bring the industry back to where it was in days of old.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> Unfortunately, I have to return to the joint committee which produced a report in 2016 that was forwarded to the Department. If one chooses any subject across the political spectrum in this country and comes across report after report after report, there is a problem. The Minister cited the Indecon, the Morris and the Jim Power reports, and I would like to include in that the all-party joint committee report of 2016. I welcome the fact the Minister of State has said he is bringing it to Cabinet next week, but it is too late at this stage. We have seen what is going on and the state the industry is in while we have been waiting for the promised Greyhound Industry Bill. It is a pity it has not happen sooner.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">From the Minister of State's report, it is evident how necessary this new Bill is.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> Along with that, there must be serious governance issues in the greyhound sector. On the Harold's Cross issue, which the Minister of State mentioned and which I do not have time to go into in detail, when in financial difficulty one most likely has to sell an asset and if one is going to sell an asset, one will sell one's best asset. Harold's Cross is the best asset. However, what concerns me is the manner in which that process was carried out. If one is working, as Bord na gCon is, with owners, trainers, breeders, bookies, caterers and staff, one has negotiations and some method of informing people of what is coming down the line, and one does not go in on a Monday morning and put a chain and locks on the gates. The way it has been handled has given the sector even worse press that it is probably deserving of. They did not do themselves any favours and as a result, now we have a strike in Dublin with owners and trainers. Other owners and trainers are put in the precarious position where they will be unable to pass the picket in Shelbourne Park. Already, in Shelbourne Park, we have lost the two semi-finals of the gold cup. If this threatened strike extends to the tracks in rural areas, many of them will not open following the strike because of the figures so well mentioned by the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> There needs to be a strong look taken at Bord na gCon's governance and management. This would be necessary of any organisation or individual who would carry out a procedure the way they carried out the procedure of closing down Harold's Cross. If that is how they do their business, it shows why they are in such a position.</p>

          <from>Senator Victor Boyhan<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_236">I warmly welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, here. I am conscious that he has particular responsibilities for food, forestry and horticulture within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I thank him for his comprehensive statement on this sector. It is to be welcomed. It is comprehensive and covers a lot of the areas in which I would have an interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> Looking at the word "organic", I spoke to a few people here this morning who asked what were we talking about and what is "organics" all about. It is worth saying, not for us but for those who listen in here, that organic farming is a method of crop and livestock production that involves much more than choosing not to use pesticides, fertilisers, genetically modified organisms, antibiotics and growth hormones. It is a far more complex issue. It is about being kind to the environment, kind to nature, adapting other alternatives in an organic, proper and sustainable way for the land. It need not always be farmers <i>per se</i>. Particularly in Wicklow, Meath and around the fringes of Dublin, and especially in north county Dublin, there are smallholdings of ten, 15 and 20 acres running a sustainable business in organics. There is a model for that too, but it also comes in with the agriculture. There are small growers now all around this country trying to get into organics.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> The previous Senator set it out and I agree with him. We have issues, in terms of field crops, fruit crops and vegetable crops. From Bord Bia we are aware of the enormous potential for exports. People are now very interested in the source and origin of food. Equally, they are interested in the integrity and the validation process that certifies organic foods because there are questions about what is and is not clearly organic. Therefore, we must instill in the purchaser confidence in the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> There is significant potential for developing exports. Bord Bia is doing a very good job. The Minister of State was in here only last week and we talked about that. Bord Bia's marketing strategy is an excellent one. It is very professional. It is an agency that we can be proud of in the State, in terms of its marketing and strategy and in trying to develop new markets, particularly in the organic sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Organic production, by its nature, can be small but it can be very big too. There are issues around soil and water management, pest and disease control. How can we have successful and good organic food that embraces the issues around pest control and disease control but that is done in an organic way? What permitted substances are allowed to be used? I refer to the certification and integrity surrounding that. We need to instill confidence in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> The previous Senator spoke about the home market. We see the growth of artisan food markets and the markets for all of that. That is very encouraging. I see these markets all around the country. People are coming to them. They are choosing to buy organic food, but also food that they can be sure, in many cases, by meeting the growers and is sourced locally. There are enormous challenges. I would particularly like at some stage if the Minister of State would take up with his officials and advisers the area of certification, the Origin Green brand and how we can constantly reinforce this Irish brand of good, sustainable organic food, and all the issues relating to the source of integrity.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> It struck me talking to a number of people that one of the big deficits in this area of organics, which the Minister of State touched on, is education and training and how young farmers and young growers can get involved. This morning I spoke to someone who works here who used to work in Teagasc, who is a small farmer in the west and who wants to go into organics, but whose problem is a lack of knowledge. How do such small farmers divest from dry stock into organics and where do they get advice, whether free or professional? How can they tap into training? I note Teagasc does good work in that area. The Minister of State talked about the farm visits and the farm internships and the partnerships. Those all are excellent but the greatest deficit in this area is education, further education and training, and good advice on animal husbandry, horticultural aspects to organics, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> The Minister of State mentioned three words - challenges, potential and opportunities. There are major challenges. There is a certain reluctance, but it is not because people do not want to take up and meet the challenges. It is that they need education and support in regard to organics.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> There are enormous opportunities for soft fruit production, the cider sector in terms of apples, etc., and organic vegetables. These have enormous potential. I would appeal to the Minister of State to look again at how we can assist and incentivise those both in the farming sector and outsiders who want to come in at some level in a small way to organics, and how we can do that in training.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> It would be remiss of me if I did not raise the green low-carbon agri-environment, GLAS, payments. I do not expect the Minister of State to give me an answer but I would appeal to him to use his good offices to push to give a commitment to honour the debt that is owed to many farmers under GLAS. They are waiting. They want to be paid. They are constantly in touch with many Members, in both this House and the other House, about their payments being honoured under GLAS. I would ask the Minister of State to use his good offices within the Department to push for the payments for those farmers who are due that money.</p>

          <p eId="para_246">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his presentation setting out the position on both the greyhound sector and the organic farming sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> In regard to the greyhound sector, at this point I will be deferring to my colleague here, Senator Ray Butler, who has personal experience of and passion for greyhounds over the years.</p>

        <speech by="#MichelleMulherin" eId="spk_128">
          <from>Senator Michelle Mulherin<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_249">I am not sharing time. I am merely alluding to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> Briefly, on the issue of greyhounds, greyhound racing and the raising and breeding of greyhounds goes back centuries. It is part of our history and heritage. It gives great joy to those who are involved. When the statistic of 10 million people having greyhound racing meetings since 2002 is laid before one, it shows the significant impact greyhound racing has on the economy and tourism. The Jim Power report in 2010 showed that at the time there were 10,000 full and part-time jobs, directly and indirectly, associated with the sector, with all the benefit to local economies. The point is it is spread throughout the country. There is also the breeding side, where 75% of greyhounds now running in the UK are Irish bred.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> The depth of the passion for greyhounds and the greyhound sector is shown by the recent development at Harold's Cross. This matter will be debated further. On the issue of the greyhound sector governance and regulation, I welcome the fact that the Minister of State is bringing the greyhound industry Bill to Cabinet and before the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, of which I am a member. We will have a chance to debate it further.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">I have no doubt we will be back here considering the up-to-date position on it. I acknowledge the significant funding the Government puts into the industry in recognition of its importance to the people and the entire economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> I wish to move on to the area of organic farming. Senator Boyhan did justice to our objectives in setting out the context. Organic farming is good for the environment and is sustainable, and it is good for our health. While it is open to debate, I believe a good piece of organic chicken or beef or an organic vegetable has a taste that non-organic products do not have. Therefore, there is doubtlessly a lot to commend organic farming.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> Organic farmers face many more impediments than other farmers. Organic farming is less intensive and requires different farming methods. Insecticides and pesticides are not used in the same way as in traditional farming. This all adds to the cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> There has been a great uptake and a lot of interest in the organic farming sector. The Minister of State outlined how the sector is growing. There are now 2,127 organic operators. No doubt, this growth has been stimulated by the organic farming scheme. The value of the organic market in Ireland grew by 24% in 2016 to €142 million. The growth is in both the domestic and export markets. Irish consumers spent €31 <i>per capita</i> on organic produce in 2015, which is up 23% on the previous year. In Switzerland, however, the comparable figure for the same year is approximately €220 <i>per capita</i>. Therefore, this is an area where there could be considerable growth in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> Organic farming fits in very well with our international image of green and clean. This is very much promoted by Bord Bia through the Origin Green initiative. I welcome the fact that Bord Bia had a strong presence in Munich recently at a food fair that is one of the biggest showcases of organic food. As in all areas of farming, we are anxious to find new markets and build up our trade outside the country. Bord Bia plays an essential, commendable and successful role in this regard. This is evident not only in the organic sector but also in the agrifood sector. There has been significant annual growth in our exports in the past seven years. For this to continue, we must keep finding new markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> It costs farmers more to engage in organic farming given the associated practicalities. I agree with Senator Paul Daly that an issue arises in regard to sheep and beef production in that farmers are not able to source organic feed here. This is an impediment and it requires farmers to grow their own feed, if they can. That is a considerable ask. It makes quite a demand on land and land use and it is a challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> Now that the organic farming scheme is closed to new applicants, how can we encourage more people to become involved and step across to organic farming? What will bridge the gap for those who have missed out? All the money under the rural development programme has been committed at this juncture. Commendably, the target of bringing 16,000 ha of new land into organic production has been well exceeded, as the Minister of State has outlined. There are actually 46,000 ha of converted land. What practical steps can be taken to support farmers in this regard? I welcome the funding made available through the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, which has assisted farmers. Is Bord Bia our main means of marketing our products?</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> I wish to raise an issue on which I have been in communication with the Minister, Deputy Creed. It relates to organic farming but is bigger than that. I refer to the matter of the insecticide flupyradifurone, which is being developed by Bayer. The company was seeking permission to license, distribute and sell the product in this country. A number of concerns have been expressed in regard to its impact on food production and biodiversity. It has been stated it poses a particular threat to the honeybee. If this insecticide were banned, it would not be the first. I point in particular to DDT, which was very harmful, as we learned after it was banned. What is the State's view on this? I acknowledge there are many differing views but there is a body of scientific data expressing concern over the use of flupyradifurone. What is the State's intention regarding its use?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PadraigMacLochlainn" eId="spk_129">
          <from>Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_260">As Senator Paul Daly implied, we engaged on the issue of organic farming previously. The Minister of State was the Chairman of the agriculture committee during the previous Dáil and his report was published with a range of recommendations. Apparently, quite a few remain to be implemented. Obviously, concerns were expressed to the Minister of State over the scheme. In 2015, a number of organisations appeared before the committee, including the Department, Bord Bia and some of the organic farming bodies, and the report was published in late 2015. The current agriculture committee has learned that there are considerable issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> I wish to highlight a number of the recommendations and what we understand to be the state of play in regard to them. First, the joint committee recommended that the Department should ensure no payments would be delayed in 2015 as they were in 2014. We understand there are still problems in regard to payments being made on time. On foot of circumstances concerning GLAS payments, we had a considerable session with officials from the Minister of State's Department recently and went through the IT systems and some of the circumstances that have obtained. We have been given assurances that the problems will not be repeated. I would like a sense of what is happening in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> The second of the recommendations, which total 17, was that the Department should investigate whether it would be more efficient to have one streamlined body granting organic status, preferably Bord Bia, and that the registration fee should be reduced. Again, we are advised this has not been implemented. I would like the Minister of State's view on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> The fourth of the 17 recommendations expressed the joint committee's concern that smaller farmers are not benefitting adequately from the organic farming scheme while farmers with larger holdings are benefitting disproportionately. It was recommended that payment on the first 20 hectares would be front-loaded, amounting to €315 per hectare, in view of the fact that small farmers cannot avail of the organic payments and also claim for low-income pastures or traditional hay meadows under GLAS. Again, we are advised this recommendation has not been implemented. We want to know why.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> The next recommendation that was brought to our attention was No. 11. The joint committee recommended that the Department employ a risk-based inspection regime when inspecting premises engaged in organic farming. That has not been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> Recommendation No. 12 was that the Department should attempt to reduce the duplication of inspections by making Bord Bia the certification body. The committee has been advised that this recommendation has not been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> The Minister of State was Chairman of the committee that published the report. I commend him and the then committee for what appears to have been an excellent piece of work, but he will agree that one of the frustrations in Leinster House is that, whenever committees put a lot of work into matters, hold hearings and produce reports, they end up down the back of a radiator, as a comedian famously alludes to every week. That is not acceptable. If Members are to have credibility, reports must be analysed. I commend the current Chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Deering, who was Vice Chairman when the report was published for revisiting these issues and seeking to hold people to account. I appreciate that the Minister of State probably cannot give a full response, but will he issue me, Senator Paul Daly, other Senators who are interested and the committee with a detailed response on why the recommendations are not being implemented? Sometimes, there are good reasons, but the Minister of State should tell us why.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> As the Minister of State knows, there has been a great deal of controversy about the greyhound industry in recent years. Apparently, 10,300 people are employed in it. I would love to know where they work and the basis for the claim that the industry contributes €500 million to the economy. My party opposed the decision to allocate in the recent budget €80 million to the greyhound and horse racing industries. We called votes on it in the Dáil and the Seanad. According to Horse Racing Ireland, the horse racing industry employs 14,000 people and contributes €1.1 billion to the economy. People were concerned that half of the €80 million - not even that much; €14 million - could have been used to ensure a place on a school bus for every child in the State who wished to have one. That is the kind of choice that must be made in government. Do we allocate money to an industry, certainly the horse racing end, that many argue involves wealthy people?</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> There have been serious questions for quite a while about corporate governance within the greyhound board. The resignation of Ms Geraldine Larkin late last year was a symptom of the crisis in the greyhound industry, which is well known and has been reflected in the findings of the many reports produced in recent years. The Government needs to take decisive action to re-establish confidence in the industry. The time has come to stand down the board and reorganise structures with the clear objective of implementing the recommendations made in the Morris report on the misuse of drugs and the recommendations of the Oireachtas agriculture committee on corporate governance. The industry is a mess that must be cleaned up, with serious issues of mismanagement and doping undermining its credibility and integrity. Such is the mistrust of the dog testing system that the Irish Greyhound Board recently issued the directive that no Irish dog should be allowed to run in Britain without first being tested and being found to be clear of drugs by the British authorities. The disregard shown for the rules and basic controls expected in any semi-State body has alarmed and frustrated dog breeders and owners across the country. Last year we voted against the decision of the Government to allocate €16 million to the Irish Greyhound Board. We made the point that these organisations needed to step up to the plate and that we would still be discussing the significant inadequacies therein when we reached the budget for next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> I wish to address the issue of the sale of the Harold's Cross stadium which has been operating since 1927 and is a much loved track among smaller owners. The Minister of State probably heard them on the news saying they could not afford to compete at other venues. Harold's Cross has been a popular track among generations of punters and the greyhound racing fraternity is upset about its closure.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> The horse and greyhound racing fund will be before the Houses again. We will engage on it and may table amendments, but before the Minister of State comes to us in the next year looking for more money for the board, he must ensure the industry will have cleaned up its act.</p>

          <from>Senator Paudie Coffey<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_271">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, to the Seanad for this debate on the organic and greyhound sectors, two indigenous industries that, unfortunately, have different outlooks. The organic sector is growing and people see that it has strong potential, whereas the greyhound industry is in decline because of a number of legacy issues that need to be addressed. However, it could have strong potential were it to be managed properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> I recognise the support given to the organic sector by the Minister of State and his Department. In many communities around the country new enterprises are growing thanks to the various incentives and support provided by the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> My main reason for contributing is to outline my concerns about the future of the greyhound industry. I will speak briefly about its value to the economy which has been outlined. </p>
          <p eId="para_274"> I was amazed to hear the Sinn Féin representative ask where the more than 10,000 people who made a living from the industry worked. I know many hundreds in my community who make a living from it - this is replicated around the country - including trainers and breeders. If the Senator was to attend the various racetracks around the country and if Sinn Féin supported the industry, they would see the many people who maintain the tracks and ensure they are fit for purpose, the many drivers, the veterinarians who ensure greyhounds are kept in top order, the catering and bar staff and the stewards. Sinn Féin is not willing to recognise these workers, given the statements made in the Chamber. If it does not recognise the industry's value to the economy, it is no surprise that it opposes the funding provided for the horse racing and greyhound industries. These are indigenous, rural industries that I want to see maintained and supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> Recently, I met owners, breeders, trainers and patrons who were very concerned about the current state of the industry. They are frustrated and angry and want action. I support them in that regard. There has been a loss of confidence across the sector and the issue needs to be restored. That can only be done by reviewing and reforming the sector from the top down with the Minister of State who is new to his role at the helm. That includes the board, management at tracks and governance structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> Recently, the Minister of State met a group of Fine Gael Oireachtas Members that included my colleague, Senator Ray Butler, as well as Deputy Joe Carey and many others who were supportive of the greyhound industry. We outlined our concerns because we wanted the Minister of State and his officials to listen. He has inherited many legacy issues, but they need to be tackled now. They might have resulted from poor governance in recent years. I mean no disrespect to the officials sitting behind the Minister of State, but officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine were <i>in situ</i> when many of these issues arose. There is a need for accountability throughout the system from the Minister to senior departmental and IGB officials. It is not good enough that the industry is being put at risk by bad management and poor governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> We have an opportunity. I add my voice in support of the new legislation the Minister of State is due to publish soon. Colleagues and I want to support him because we see that this indigenous industry has strong potential but changes are necessary. We must attack the doping controversies and take on the legacy issues and debt problems. We must urgently review the issue of track viability and find ways to attract patrons back to racetracks to enjoy a night's entertainment. Kilcohan Park in Waterford is a famous stadium, not only in Ireland. It hosts many famous racing and soccer days, but it is only open one night a week, which is a crying shame. Reform of how we incentivise trainers and breeders to enter dogs in races could increase numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I acknowledge there are good people in the industry and good people managing our tracks but there needs to be a review in order that there will be more racing nights and that tracks can become more viable. A controversial "Prime Time" programme is due to be broadcast the week after next and that might be a good thing. Let us uncover the problems and tackle them. I will support the Minister of State in that endeavour, as I am sure will other Senators.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">I welcome the Minister of State and his officials for this important debate. I will confine my remarks to the greyhound industry. The Minister of State has listened to industry stakeholders, particularly when he was Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> I agree with everything Senator Coffey said. He hit the nail on the head when he said the industry is in turmoil. The Minister of State referred to the 2015 audited accounts which are due to go to Government before being laid before the Oireachtas. Unfortunately, they make for grim reading. The accounts were published on the IGB website briefly before being removed and I had an opportunity to view them. If the same accounts are presented to both Houses, they will highlight that the IGB is totally incompetent when it comes to running the industry. For example, taxpayer funding increased by 25% in 2015 but the legal and professional fees associated with running the IGB increased by 245% in one year. Media and other income was down by 70% to only €100,000. Without taxpayer intervention, the organisation would be insolvent.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> Alarm bells need to ring quickly in Agriculture House about this organisation, otherwise a major national scandal is only weeks away. Ordinary punters, owners and breeders are not being listened to by the body with statutory responsibility for administering the sector, which is wrong. They were outside these Houses protesting last week and I met some of them while I spoke to others over the phone last weekend. I appeal to the Minister of State not to allow this organisation to run the industry into the ground. To address its managerial incompetence and lack of transparency and accountability, the answer is to sell the Harold's Cross facility. Protests will continue outside Shelbourne Park at every race night because greyhound owners and breeders are not being listened to. Their only option is to highlight their concerns outside Shelbourne Park. The industry is at an impasse and I appeal to the Minister of State to intervene.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> I agree with Senator Coffey that the current board of the IGB is not fit for purpose and needs to be replaced. Stakeholder accountability and transparency need to be applied to the sector. The issue is urgent. The organisation is in receipt of a State subsidy of €285,000 a week this year. From a financial management perspective in the context of the public finances, this organisation does not meet the standards set down following good work by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I say that as someone with a financial background.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> The agriculture committee made 13 recommendations dating back to January 2016. If implemented, they would solve some of the problems. I welcome the legislation that will be brought forward and I appreciate the Minister of State's efforts in this regard because he is working hard on it. Unfortunately, by the time the legislation passes through both Houses, it may be too late. An urgent intervention is required. It is not for me to suggest what should happen but the Minister of State needs to intervene. Will he use his good offices in conjunction with his officials to ensure that intervention happens within days rather than weeks because this could rocket out of control if something does not happen quickly?</p>

          <p eId="para_284">I welcome the Minister of State. I have been involved in the greyhound industry all my life. I have bred, raced and trained greyhounds and my family history can be traced back in the industry to winning major competitions. This industry is the best in the world. We are noted for breeding the best greyhounds in the world. The industry employs between 10,000 and 10,500 people. Unfortunately, there are legacy issues. I do not blame any political party but the chief executive officer, CEO, of the IGB was on €300,000 under the previous Administration. The Taoiseach was not even in receipt of the same wage. It was a disgrace. The CEO was told not to proceed with a project in Limerick by solicitors and architects but she went ahead and ploughed €1 million into a hole in the ground with clay to fill in before she even started building the greyhound stadium, which became a white elephant. We have a new CEO - Ms Geraldine Larkin is gone-----</p>

          <p eId="para_286">The previous CEO is gone and a new CEO is in place. I hope the rumour the previous CEO was paid to leave is not true. The new CEO has been brutal in coming to town. There are ways and means to deal with people but closing Harolds Cross stadium will not solve the problems. Between €6 million and €7 million will be raised. The problems will be solved through a betting levy online of 1%. A total of €1 million was raised last year and that amount will increase because the volume of online betting is going through the roof. The levy could raise €2 million next year. Why can that money not be used to pay off the IGB's debt while leaving the money the Government is putting in to run the industry to be used as prize money? The banks will have to sit down and deal with us because, at the end of the day, it will not be good public relations to close greyhound tracks in rural Ireland. They will have to be brought in and we can deal with them when the time comes. The pensions deficit is a huge problem for the IGB in Limerick. I believe the figure is €8 million. Nine or ten people employed in the Limerick office are earning €100,000 a year, which is ludicrous.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> Sinn Féin opposed the funding allocated to the industry in this year's budget, yet the party has no problem fundraising at greyhound tracks such as Dundalk and Shelbourne Park.</p>

I know that the ordinary person who has the grading dog from A5 down is not too unhappy about €300 first prize money or a little bit more. It is the bigger stakes where we need the better dogs to come into competition where we need the funding. The derby prize money has been cut, the Cesarewitch had been cut and all the classics money have been cut so we have to look at better funding in to the better racing and we will get the better results because better racing brings out the people. </p>

          <p eId="para_297">On the first question from Senator Paul Daly, the issue of leakage came up and was identified in the value for money review, so the increased maintenance payment of 60% now in operation means that most people are opting to stay and there is agreement from the Commission to extend their contract. What I was saying earlier is that we have all the various participants into the one stream, so by the end of this rural development programme, everyone will be coming out. It is 26,000 ha extra rather than 46,000. The aim was 16,000 ha. The budget for the scheme has been increased and extended and it has been a success so that is a good indicator. What I would love to be able to say is that in the next programme we will be able to extend it further but until we know the level of funding that will come through it is impossible to be honestly able to say that. That would be the target. </p>
          <p eId="para_298"> I would refer back to my first term in the Dáil, 2007-2011, when then Minister of State with responsibility for food and horticulture, former Deputy Trevor Sargent, said that we were at 1% and if we could get to 2% over the next five to ten years, we would have done a really good job. We have done that. I have to acknowledge that he was one of the first people to advocate and champion the value of the organic sector. It can be seen in the figures. There are specific issues as one goes through the report of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the organic farming scheme. Rather than go through them all today, what I propose to do is outline a number of the recommendations that have been agreed and implemented.<b>
						</b> If Senators wish, I can try to go through some of them. Delays in payments is unfortunately a symptom. I think 75% of all the 1,740 have been paid. GLAS is an overhang, as people may be aware. I have not been paid myself and I have been told that it is an IT issue. There is a dedicated team of officials on the sixth floor of Agriculture House going through these cases one by one to get them through. There are individual issues with organic applications, there are 300-odd left, where they are trying to iron out and pay different partial identifications. It is not in the Department's interest to hold on to anybody's money because they have to explain further down the line to both the European Commission and the Court of Auditors that have targets to hit regarding their payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> On adopting a flexible approach and front-loading, the question of front-loading was brought to the Commission but the basic principle of cost incurred and income forgone comes into play here. The cost incurred and income forgone varies from hectare to hectare and it was decided not to push any further at this time because it does not seem as though it will be favoured by the Commission. </p>
          <p eId="para_300"> Senator Mac Lochlainn raised the recommendations in the joint committee's report on the organic farming scheme which have been agreed. The eighth recommendation was agreed that farmers and factories should ensure that organically produced meat is packaged and sold as such to attract a premium price, and not merely sold as an ordinary meat. <b>
						</b>There are a number of factors behind the problem, with the increase in sheep meat in particular, geography and the unavailablity of processing on the western half of the country. With the availability of reasonable value organic feed and the competitive price that conventional lamb trade makes, this year may be slightly different. In general terms lamb prices have gone up significantly in the most expensive time to feed and farmers take an economic decision and might say that it is not worth their while pursuing it. <b>
						</b>That is something they might have to check up on.</p>

          <p eId="para_302">I can make sure that everyone gets a response on this, certainly with regard to all 17 recommendations in the report, because I was chair of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine at the time. Each and every one of these has a response and a reason if they are not agreed or if they are agreed. A graduated penalty points system has been agreed and is now fully in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> I will now move to greyhounds, and thank the contributors. I do not disagree with a lot of what has been said. This is a legacy issue. People call for new governance and the dissolution of the board, but it is worth making the point that there is only one board member predating that period. I have refrained from appointing anybody for two reasons, first their term has not expired and second, I am only in this office since May. I have been trying to get this legislation agreed and we finally have it; it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the work that has been done in trying to draft it, to try to tailor it to suit the needs of the greyhound sector. I want to reassure everybody that I am committed to it. I found it a learning curve when I got the job and I thought that I knew a considerable amount because I had gone to hearings but when I got into it I realised how complex the various different sectors are. </p>
          <p eId="para_304"> I insisted on meeting members of the Dublin Greyhound Owners and Breeders Association, and indeed the wider federation, over two consecutive days, in order to hear from them. I really admire these people. Everybody, including the members of the board, would rather not be faced with the conflict that is selling Harold's Cross and would prefer to come up with an alternative option. I take on board everything that has been said about the manner and method by which this has been carried out and will convey Senators' views. There is an opportunity here. An additional two members are proposed in the new draft legislation, and there are provisions on governance integrity and sanctions; the independence of the control committee and the appeals committee; and the period and number of terms that members can serve. There is an opportunity to make sure that there is a wider-ranging representation. </p>
          <p eId="para_305"> The members that have been filled over the last couple of years have been filled based on the expertise deficit identified in the Indecon report and, as I understand, went through the Public Appointments Service. They predate my time, but when one looks at their expertise, there is one individual who is a vet and a barrister and a solicitor who was once a State solicitor for Cork city. Among others, there is another person who is a managing director of Bank of Ireland finance and has executive risk-management experience. Those are the people who were employed. There would appear to be a need to put in the stakeholders. I attended the forum back in October to brief everybody. They were all invited and I spent three and a half hours with a member of the legal section of the Department to try to hear their views and listen and present the outline of the legislation that I thought we would have out before Christmas, to be honest. I think that structure is good but it needs to have more connectivity so that the recommendations that come through that get onto the board table and the people at board level representing the best interests of the industry take on board suggestions.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">It needs to have more connectivity so that the recommendations that come through that get onto the board table and the people at board level representing the best interests of the industry take suggestions on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> Senator Burke made a tangible suggestion. He referred to how to increase revenue and perhaps use that to pay down legacy debt and release funds. When we say we should ring-fence Exchequer funding to increase prize money and the offering, that is true but if one is compromised by a debt that one has to service one is very limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> I understand the extra expenditure relates to the franchise being taken back and extra people employed. I stand to be corrected, but I have been told that there was a net benefit to the revenue stream. I am also advised that the resignation of the CEO was in accordance with the terms of the contract, and legal advice was taken. I have no more detail on that, but if I get it I will send it to the Senator.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> When a Bill goes through pre-legislative scrutiny, if the schedule of the House permits I would hope to have it fully enacted by the summer recess.</p>

        <speech by="#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_146">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy)<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_311">I am pleased to address the House today and to have the opportunity to discuss the outcome of the symphysiotomy <i>ex gratia </i>payment scheme and the report of Judge Maureen Harding Clark, assessor to the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> We have all been touched by the stories of the women who underwent symphysiotomy, and the Government's aim was to take a person-centred and as dignified an approach as possible to help bring closure for as many of these women as possible. I believe the scheme has helped to bring that closure to a large number of women, and I welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> Following examination of two earlier independent reports, which were commissioned by the Department of Health, it was agreed by Government in July 2014 to establish an <i>ex gratia</i> scheme for women who underwent a surgical symphysiotomy. The surgical symphysiotomy payment scheme was established in November 2014 following engagement by the then Minister for Health with the three patient advocacy groups that support women who underwent the procedure. It is important to note in our discussions here today that two of those advocacy groups strongly welcomed the Government approved scheme. One of those groups has said that their clients were happy to have been vindicated and had their suffering acknowledged. This support group also indicated that it had very positive feedback concerning the scheme from the women and their families, and it stressed the importance of providing redress for the women, given the older age group to which many of the women belong. This group has indicated that it supported in excess of 250 of the women in 2015. One of the groups rejected the scheme and continued to advocate for court settlements for the women. It indicated that it represented around 350 women.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> The scheme provided an alternative, non-adversarial and person-centred option for women, many of whom were elderly and did not wish to pursue their cases through the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> In regard to research into symphysiotomy, the first independent report commissioned by the Department was undertaken by Professor Oonagh Walsh. Professor Walsh is a renowned medico-social historian with a special interest in female medical history. Professor Walsh outlined the history of symphysiotomy in Ireland and recommended that an <i>ex gratia </i>scheme be established. Importantly, Professor Walsh's research also included a national public consultation process with the women themselves and with other interested bodies. Professor Walsh undertook a number of public meetings, individual meetings and also received written submissions by post and by e-mail. It was an important aspect of the research to hear views from the women directly. The Walsh report noted that symphysiotomy was an exceptional and rare intervention in obstetric practice in Ireland. The procedure was used in mild to moderate disproportion and in obstructed labour. It occurred in less than 0.05% of deliveries between 1940 and 1985. The report estimated that approximately 1,500 symphysiotomy procedures were undertaken in Irish hospitals and that there were around 350 women still living who underwent the procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> The second report was prepared by Judge Yvonne Murphy who was commissioned by Government in 2013 to undertake a further independent review on the legal aspects of symphysiotomy in Ireland. Judge Murphy advised Government on the merits and costs of proceeding with an <i>ex gratia </i>scheme relative to taking no action and allowing the court process to proceed. Judge Murphy also placed advertisements in national and local newspapers seeking the views of women and what would bring closure for them. There was a very positive response to this advertisement. Judge Murphy met in person with all those who wished to meet, had telephone conversations with those who were too frail to travel and also received letters from other women with their views as to closure. Judge Murphy also recommended that an <i>ex gratia </i>payment scheme be established.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> Judge Harding Clark provided a comprehensive report on the surgical symphysiotomy payment scheme in October last year and we now have available a very thorough overview of the historical and medical context of symphysiotomy. The report also included a number of appendices, with documentary evidence from the annual clinical reports of the major maternity hospitals between 1940 and 1960 on the indications for use of this rare procedure. They also included extracts from the Transactions of the Royal Academy of Medicine between the 1940s and 1960s on this topic. Contrary to some reports in the media, the information in these appendices clearly shows that symphysiotomy was not a secret or illegal procedure but its use was reviewed and discussed by obstetricians at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> The total cost of the symphysiotomy payment scheme was just under €34 million, and payments of €50,000, €100,000 or €150,000 were made to 399 women who met the criteria for an award.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">All the women have received their respective payments, totalling €29.85 million. The majority of claimants were aged over 75 years. Payments were made to women between the ages of 51 and 96 years of age. The scheme was designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial, and to offer the women an alternative to pursuing their case through the courts, if they wished. The women were not expected to give oral testimonies as they might do in a court setting. Although the scheme was non-adversarial, it took into account that women may have wished to consult a solicitor, and take legal advice and assistance in submitting their applications to the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> In the interests of accountability, the scheme required each applicant to prove that she had a surgical symphysiotomy or a pubiotomy in order to be considered for an assessment of an award. The level of proof required to qualify for an award was clearly set out in the terms of the scheme. It is important to note that the proof required was considerably lower than the burden of proof required by the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> Judge Harding Clark worked with each woman or her legal representative to locate medical records. She met some of the women in different parts of the country, where she considered this was necessary. Where claims could not be reconciled with established facts, women were examined by relevant medical experts. Judge Harding Clark encouraged women who believed they had a symphysiotomy to apply to the scheme, advising them that they would not be giving up their right to pursue their case through the courts. It was only on accepting an award under the scheme that a woman had to discontinue her legal proceedings. The vast majority of women opted to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> The scheme was administered to the highest standard, in line with its terms of reference. At the end of the scheme, all applications and supporting documents were returned to the applicants or were confidentially shredded in line with each applicant’s wishes. The scheme did not hold any original medical records. In order to undertake her role under her terms of reference in an informed manner, Judge Harding Clark drew on the professional expertise of certain medical specialists. These clinicians specialised in the areas of obstetrics, radiology, orthopaedic surgery and pelvic injury, urology and urogynaecology, and advised the scheme throughout the process. This ensured an effective, fair and well-informed method of assessment of the applicants by means of a comprehensive clinical case review in line with best practice whenever this was required.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> Many hundreds of hours were spent examining the applicants’ medical records. Each application received an individual, careful assessment. Medical evidence was sought to explain delivery records. When claims could not be reconciled with established facts, the applicant was examined by relevant clinical experts. Some applicants were examined by several experts. When all efforts to obtain records failed, the scheme moved to seeking secondary proof of symphysiotomy, by evidence of a scar, and radiology evidence. Out of almost 600 applicants, 185 women were unable to establish that they had a surgical symphysiotomy. The report states that all these applicants were assisted by members of the team in trying to establish their claims, and the scheme’s resources were applied in rigorous investigations before a claim was declared ineligible for the scheme. Some 23 women experienced a spontaneous symphysiotomy during birth. While this condition is not particularly common, it is well-recognised. These women did not quality for an award under the terms of the scheme because they did not have a surgical symphysiotomy.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> Pubiotomy is a distinctly different and outmoded procedure to symphysiotomy. It was also included in the scope of the scheme, at the request of the support groups. Pubiotomy was frequently claimed by applicants but was established in only one case. Significant disability was established in this case. In regard to international research, the authoritative Cochrane review is considered internationally as the gold standard of best practice in medicine. It gives an explanation of the procedure:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_325">Symphysiotomy is an operation to enlarge the capacity of the mother's pelvis by partially cutting the fibres joining the pubic bones at the front of the pelvis. Usually, when the baby is too big to pass through the pelvis, a caesarean section is performed. If a caesarean section is not available, or the mother is too ill for or refuses caesarean section, or if there is insufficient time to perform caesarean section (for example when the baby's body has been born feet first, and the head is stuck) symphysiotomy may be performed.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Contrary to many reports in the media, symphysiotomy does not involve breaking the pelvis, or sawing through bone but, as described in the Cochrane review, the procedure involves cutting the fibrous cartilage of the pubic joint.</p>

        <heading>Symphysiotomy Payment Scheme: Statements (Resumed)<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T15:10:00+00:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_148">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy)<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_328">A systematic review and meta-analysis study published in the <i>British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology </i>as recently as April 2016 concluded that there was no difference in key outcomes of maternal and perinatal mortality with symphysiotomy when compared with caesarean section. One of the principal reasons for use of symphysiotomy in rare circumstances was the dangers associated with caesarean section, which were very real in the 1950s and 1960s. This is supported by data from Irish hospitals which shows the rates of maternal and infant mortality were higher for caesarean section than for symphysiotomy.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> In summary, it is important to note that Irish and international studies indicate that symphysiotomy is not a banned procedure but has a place in obstetrics in certain limited circumstances. For example, it may still be used in the western world in the delivery of a trapped head in breech delivery, or in emergency obstetric situations. The health of women affected by symphysiotomy has continued to be a priority. Medical services, including medical cards, are facilitated for the women by HSE-nominated symphysiotomy liaison officers based around the country, whether or not a woman has availed of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> In regard to human rights issues, one of the advocacy groups made representations to the UN Committee on Human Rights concerning symphysiotomy in July 2014. This year, submissions were also made to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. Ireland takes its membership of international organisations extremely seriously and is committed to human rights, which is why we always engage with these processes in a meaningful way, through providing information and updates, responding to recommendations and attending reviews held by these organisations. While the Government notes the comments made in 2014 by the UN Committee on Human Rights on symphysiotomy, the Government believes that there has been a comprehensive response to symphysiotomy with the provision of the following: the independent <i>ex gratia</i> scheme; the comprehensive independent reports on symphysiotomy, which included national consultation with the women; and the ongoing provision of medical services by the HSE. </p>
          <p eId="para_331"> I would urge anyone who wishes to get a fair and balanced view on the issue of symphysiotomy to read Judge Harding Clark's report. She was unfettered by Government in completing her work. She used her judicial skills and experience, and the skills of her clinical team, to examine all aspects of symphysiotomy and review the evidence collected during the two years of her work.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> In conclusion, the brief given to Judge Harding Clark in November 2014 was not an easy one. At that time the advice to the Department of Health was that many women would face an uphill struggle in proving their claims in the courts. Each woman would face an uncertain outcome, as each case would be adjudicated by the courts on its individual merits. We now know that this is true. For example, in one of the small number of cases that have gone through the courts, the judge in that case found that even though the woman had a symphysiotomy 12 days before her baby was born in 1963, this procedure was not a practice without justification at that time. In her independent report, Judge Harding Clark has set out in detail how assessments were made and confirms that she personally reviewed and assessed every woman’s case. Judge Clark has also provided a comprehensive overview of the historical and medical context of symphysiotomy.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The Government hopes the scheme has helped to bring closure to women who underwent surgical symphysiotomy and their families.</p>

          <from>Senator Keith Swanick<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_335">I will start with the words of one survivor of symphysiotomy:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_336">They gave me gas and air and an injection, and took me to another room, where they tied my legs up on each side. There were two nurses on each side of me. I saw this doctor at the end of my bed with a big, long silver thing. They made a hole in your private parts, and he inserted this silver thing up and cut the pubic bone and pushed it over to widen your pelvis for you to deliver your baby yourself.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Petrified and in agony, the woman in question had just been subjected to a symphysiotomy. For the five days following the procedure, the new mother was ordered to lie completely flat with a corset around her hips to give her pelvis a chance to heal. For days, she was unable to see her daughter in the special care unit because there was no lift. To use her words again:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_338">I have arthritis in my hip and in the bottom of my spine. I walk with a limp. No one can help – there’s no way back. I wear pads the whole time, and have been since the age of 23.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">Symphysiotomy, which was seldom used in the rest of Europe after the mid-20th century, was carried out on an estimated 1,500 women in Ireland between the 1940s and 1980s. Ireland was the only country in the world where these childbirth operations were carried out in preference to caesarean section. Many attribute this to religious ideology and doctors who believed in child bearing without limitation. Whatever the reasoning, the outcome for women has been lifelong disability, chronic pain, mental suffering and in some cases family breakdown.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> In 2014, the United Nations Human Rights Committee found the following in respect of Ireland:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_341">The State party should initiate a prompt, independent and thorough investigation into cases of symphysiotomy, prosecute and punish the perpetrators, including medical personnel, and provide an effective remedy to the survivors of symphysiotomy for the damage sustained, including fair and adequate compensation and rehabilitation, on an individualized basis. It should facilitate access to judicial remedies by victims opting for the ex-gratia scheme, including allowing a challenge to the sums offered to them under the scheme. </p>
          <p eId="para_342">In that context, we have done some of what the committee asked and I hope the publication of Judge Maureen Harding Clark's report on the surgical symphysiotomy <i>ex gratia</i> payment scheme will bring some type of closure to the women who have been so badly affected by symphysiotomy. The historical indifference shown to survivors of symphysiotomy has meant some women still do not know exactly what procedures were performed on them without consent, resulting in some cases in them spending their entire adult lives in pain.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> As a general practitioner, I swore the hippocratic oath. Historically taken by physicians, the oath is one of the most widely known of Greek medical texts. In its original form, it requires a new physician to swear by a number of healing gods to uphold specific ethical standards. It is considered a rite of passage for practitioners of medicine in many countries. While various modernised versions are often used nowadays, the message delivered is still the same - above all, do no harm. The medical practitioners who conducted the symphysiotomy procedure took the same oath but did not abide by it. I am glad this procedure plays no part in medicine in the 21st century.</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> The Fianna Fáil Party believes the scheme was a genuine attempt to bring a resolution to this matter. Many of the findings of the report make for very distressing reading. The practice of symphysiotomy had stopped in other countries many years before it ceased in Ireland. When it went wrong it caused many debilitating physical, psychological and emotional side effects and many women experienced medical problems for decades. I hope they will be able to access the treatment and supports they badly need. Unfortunately, four of the women affected passed away before the final report was published.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> Thankfully, symphysiotomy is no longer an accepted practice in obstetrics. It is crucial that the medical profession learns lessons from the past. I sincerely hope the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists will study the report in detail.</p>

          <p eId="para_351">Probably. Symphysiotomy, a word I have difficulty pronouncing, is a barbaric and medieval practice, which was carried out for many years in this State. It is a procedure that women were advised to undergo without knowledge of what it involved. Symphysiotomy is similar to the spatchcock cooking technique used in the preparation of birds. It involves the use of a chainsaw and was often practised without the consent of the women in question. Certainly, the women did not make informed decisions. While the procedure was abandoned by the rest of the western world before the turn of the 20th century, hundreds of cases were recorded in Ireland in the 20th century. I was not surprised to read that the latest recorded case took place as late as 2005, in other words, in the 21st century.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> Survivors of symphysiotomy demanded a truth commission and their demand was eventually granted in the form of the review carried out by Judge Maureen Harding Clark. The judge delivered her opinion as judicial assessor on the surgical symphysiotomy payment scheme in November 2016. Judge Harding Clark was tasked with determining the legitimacy of claims made as best as the women's testimony and records available would allow and evaluating the extent of disability and discomfort inflicted by the procedure. She described the payment scheme as an <i>ex gratia</i> non-adversarial scheme under which survivors would be treated in a compassionate and generous manner. For many of the women, who are now elderly, frail and exhausted by the ongoing fight for truth and justice, Judge Harding Clark's report swept aside and demeaned their ongoing experience of ill health and disability. They correctly believed the report was a deliberate whitewash. </p>
          <p eId="para_353"> We have all been witness to the harrowing accounts given by the women affected by symphysiotomy over the years and the debilitating effects the procedure had throughout their lives. Senator Swanick cited the words of Annie, a woman in her late 60s who recalled vividly her account of the procedure which was carried out without her knowledge and consent. She recalled having her legs in the air, being taken to a different room and not knowing what was happening to her. She saw a "silver thing", colloquially referred to as "the chainsaw", which was inserted in and destroyed her body. Annie lives with the agony of the procedure which persists to this day. </p>
          <p eId="para_354"> In her report, Judge Harding Clark stated that 142 of the 183 women who were awarded higher payments were assessed as having suffered significant disability. However, she also stated that the majority of applicants made a good recovery. The Minister should tell this to Annie and her fellow survivors.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> Judge Harding Clark's report was welcomed by the handful of obstetricians who hold steadfast to their practice and continue to defend the procedure. We must also remember that the hospital system was overseen by senior figures in the Catholic Church, who would have considered symphysiotomy a better outcome than an unholy caesarean section or the possibility that the woman would no longer be able to procreate.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> Judge Harding Clark, who did not speak to all of the women concerned, further stated that symphysiotomy did not inevitably lead to lifelong pain or disability and patients did not age in a manner which was different from women who did not experience the procedure. How would a body respond to the trauma of symphysiotomy, a procedure in which a chainsaw is used and cartilage and ligaments split? It involves splitting open the woman and flattening her out almost in the manner of poultry being prepared for roasting. A body cannot heal or knit together uniformly after such a procedure. Such an out-of-kilter body would produce pain and other disability conditions throughout life, which would add to the emotional trauma the women in question continue to suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">The United Nations and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties called the use of this operation an assault. It was yet another assault on Irish women, another scandal perpetrated against women and girls, joining the revelations about the Magdalen Laundries, the deaths of children at mother and baby homes, sex abuse within the Catholic Church and the case of Savita Halappanavar who bled to death in hospital watched over by a medical team four years ago. A son of one of the survivors wrote recently to Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin about Judge Harding Clark's report. He wrote that a one-sided report that attempted to whitewash over this shameful episode in Irish medical history had compounded the traumatic stress of the women involved, rather than seeking the truth, which might have gone some way to helping his mother and the other women involved to come to terms with the consequences of their experiences. Judge Harding Clark has aggravated the butchering of the women concerned and undermined their experiences and trauma. Shame on her.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> Contrary to the Minister's positive statement, the international community is dismayed by the report and our general approach to historical human rights violations. The Government ignored the United Nations Human Rights Committee's recommendations in 2014 relating to this scheme and ensuring there would be a proper inquiry. It has now been criticised by another UN body, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, which recently examined the issue and will be giving a judgment in the coming weeks. We do not seem to have learned from the past litany of horror and cruelty. The State continues to punish, harass, criticise and humiliate women for its failure in its duty of care to them and its own severe lack of compassion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" eId="spk_157">
          <from>Senator James Reilly<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_359">The Minister of State has outlined what symphysiotomy is and the differences between it and pubiotomy where a saw is used to cut through bone. One case was identified and can be shown to have occurred. Symphysiotomy involves cutting through the cartilage that joins the two bones and was a recognised procedure in the 1940s and 1950s. By the 1960s caesarean section had become a safer alternative. It is very upsetting to think the use of symphysiotomy was continued when there were safer alternatives which would not have led to many of the lifelong disabilities from which many of the women concerned - citizens - suffered. There is no question but that they did suffer, from urinary incontinence, pain while walking, bowel function disorder and their ability to undertake day-to-day duties and look after their families. Sometimes it led to marital disharmony and family break-up.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> I am pleased that 399 women availed of the scheme. There was advice that they take the legal route and, as Minister at the time, I was concerned that many of them would find it difficult to find documentary evidence to present. I was concerned that they would find that notes had gone missing and that the clinicians who had carried out the procedure were no longer alive and that they would spend the last years of their lives building up legal bills without having a resolution. The scheme was developed to avoid this and ensure speedy compensation for those who had suffered throughout their lives and that they would not have to endure further worry and anxiety. One lady, whom I know but whose name I will not mention, openly told us that she had an open and shut case. Of all the times the operation could have been performed, it is incredible that it was performed after a baby had been born, but that was what happened and she and her legal team believed they had a clear case. The decision was appealed, however, and she woke up one night and realised she might lose her house. Thereafter she became a great supporter of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> There was a lot of misinformation. It was stated a person who did not like the award under the scheme had already waived her legal rights, but that was not he case. The legal route was always available to those who felt it was preferable. As the Minister said, a number of legal cases were taken and failed. No scheme is perfect, but I thank Professor Oonagh Walsh and Judge Yvonne Murphy for their work on it, as well as the patient folk who represented the women involved and the women themselves, many of whom I met. It is difficult for them to have closure, but I hope the scheme has brought some closure for them. I know that there is still criticism of it and that no amount of compensation can bring back the years in which they might otherwise have enjoyed full health, but I hope it vindicates them and makes them feel the State recognises that a wrong was done.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> There is a time when a procedure is all that is available and one might call the removal of a leg "barbaric", but if it is the only surgical option, people understand it has to be done. The situation in this instance was different. The world had moved on, meaning that there were much safer ways of dealing with the issue, but certain clinicians, perhaps for religious reasons as other Senators have suggested, proceeded with this procedure rather than safer, more modern procedures. In my view, it was professional negligence, but I am glad that the Government developed the scheme and very proud to have been associated with it. I hope we have brought some sense of closure and recompense to console those who suffered in their later years.</p>

          <from>Senator Gerald Nash<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_363">I recognise the compassion the former Minister for Health, Senator Reilly, has consistently shown in this regard and the eloquent case he has made in defence of the redress scheme. I was involved in the design of the scheme on behalf of constituents of mine, with the Minister of State, Deputy Regina Doherty, and others. Senator Reilly has been a consistent supporter of the rights of the women involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> I am no stranger to the issue of symphysiotomy with which I have been dealing for nigh on 15 years. I recall the very first meeting I attended in 2002, with former Deputy Arthur Morgan who had also expressed a huge interest in the issue, to educate myself about symphysiotomy and how it affected women. The meeting was hosted by the nascent survivors of symphysiotomy group which became known as SOS Limited and was supported by the excellent Patient Focus, with which the then Minister, now Senator Reilly, worked very closely on a range of initiatives to deal with this scar on our recent history. I was absolutely stunned and horrified by the testimony of women such as Olivia Kearney from County Louth who had been a victim of this mediaeval procedure and who, like hundreds of other women, had lived for decades with its consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Olivia Kearney and our colleagues in Patient Focus and others have fought a dignified and respectful battle, often in hostile circumstances over the years, to deliver a scheme that works. I commend them for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> I beg the Cathaoirleach's indulgence to pay tribute to a lady who passed away just over a week ago, Ms Elizabeth Moran, a survivor of the procedure. Her husband, Mr. Tommy Moran, at one point chaired the Survivors of Symphysiotomy Limited, SOS, group and worked very closely with me and others in the House and Members of the other House to try to address some of the wrongs that were done to his wife and to other women across the country. It is a deeply personal issue for me because while the procedure was discontinued in many hospitals across the State decades ago, and it was discontinued across the developed world decades ago, there still are records to prove that the procedure had taken place very recently in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, my home town hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> I have friends and neighbours, family friends and people who I care about, who have been affected by this procedure, so I took a deep personal interest in it. The previous Government, as Senator Reilly said, and as the Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, has said, took a deep personal interest. Not to make too political a point, we have had successive Ministers for Health, going back to Deputy Micheál Martin, former Deputy Mary Harney and others who have effectively ignored this issue. We attempted to challenge this head-on. When I was elected to the Dáil in 2011, I set myself the objective, through working closely with Senator Reilly and colleagues across the north east region, of having a full and detailed examination in the first instance of the reality of the practice of symphysiotomy in this country. We would then use that evidence base to work out a way whereby we could assist the hundreds of women who have survived that procedure and are affected by it, to take some kind of practical action that would acknowledge the hurt and pain that they experienced. We did all that. We commissioned the Walsh review. We commissioned the Judge Yvonne Murphy report, a comprehensive report into the practice, and ultimately we designed the Surgical Symphysiotomy Ex Gratia Payment Scheme that was expertly administered by the extremely well-respected and independently-minded judge, Judge Maureen Harding Clark.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> Remarkably, practically at every turn, the respective judges, the Government, experts involved and in some cases we as individual public representatives were excoriated and were subjected to bizarre allegations of being responsible for a whitewash, a charge that was repeated in this House today. To quote a headline and very informed piece by Mr. Paul Cullen when he was writing in <i>The Irish Times</i> about symphysiotomy recently, the headline said it was the whitewash that never was. There was voluble and sometimes very hostile criticism of public representatives and NGOs, which wanted at all times to put the interests of the women affected first. When others in these Houses preferred to, as Senator Reilly suggested, encourage survivors to take their chances through an adversarial judicial system that in some cases had objectively very little chance of delivering for them, this was most unfortunate. </p>
          <p eId="para_369"> Objectively, the scheme has been a success. We all worked hard to develop a scheme that worked. It will not heal all of the hurt that has been experienced by the women involved and their families. There are still physical and emotional scars that people are living with to this day. I hope that the scheme that has provided payments to approximately 400 women has helped to some degree to right the wrong that the women have experienced. I am proud to call many of those women friends.</p>

          <p eId="para_370">This island has many dark histories. The scandal of symphysiotomy has been a brutal and inhumane procedure and reality for some time for some women.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> With respect, I think the Minister of State missed a certain 2012 study in her contribution that found that many of the victims and survivors of symphysiotomy said that the Catholic Church encouraged, if not insisted upon symphysiotomies. Other speakers have mentioned that was the case due to the preference of the church for symphysiotomy over caesarean sections and the moral diktat of the day gave women no bodily autonomy and saw them as mere vessels, regardless of the mutilation, health issues and unbearable pain that caused.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> Senator Nash brought forward a Bill where we spoke about the exoneration and apology to gay men who were victims of criminalisation. I took the opportunity to talk about the impact of criminalisation for certain sections of society. I hope the reality of today's abortion laws, that similarly condemn women to sometimes devastating health problems, is not lost on the decision-makers here in both Houses. Women and the LGBT community share the most unfortunate commonality, the contemporary and historical criminalisation of their body and of their lives. The misogyny and deeply ingrained sense of prejudice faced by women since the foundation of this State will lead older women to a place where they will actively campaign and have been campaigning for bodily autonomy and a repeal of the eighth amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> After years of campaigning, in November 2012, the Surgical Symphysiotomy Payments Scheme was established and Judge Harding Clark, who set out the terms of reference for that scheme, has been said by survivor advocacy groups to be lacking in empathy in the application of the scheme. There can be little objection to what the State owes to these women. It should endeavour to do all it can to provide these women with comfort. Senator Reilly said in his contribution that his concern while Minister was that women who would pursue a legal route would not have access to certain documents. My understanding is that Judge Harding Clark requires records going back over 50 years as proof of significant disability. The difficulty of obtaining such records is obvious to even a lay person. It was an impossible ask to have such records over such a long period of time. A weakness of the scheme is that younger applicants whose records are more likely to be preserved and whose doctors are more likely to be in a better position to confirm that the applicant has had a symphysiotomy would be more likely to benefit from the scheme and to receive redress. For many women, Judge Harding Clark's dismissal of these claims was based on the lack of a document trail spanning many decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> Judge Harding Clark fails to hold hospitals and medics responsible for keeping that documentation. Those who were unsuccessful in that application had no right of appeal. Not every woman sought redress through the scheme. Some sought compensation through legal action against the State. Their reasoning was clear. It was the State that effectively promoted symphysiotomy as a preferred option to a caesarean section, even when other jurisdictions prohibited that procedure. For some women, it makes sense to sue the State. Taking on the State has its own stresses, of course. It is difficult at the best of times for people to engage in legal proceedings. It is even more difficult if one has been traumatised to engage in such proceedings. It is more difficult depending on one's age and the stress and trauma involved. Women have suffered all their lives with the consequence of symphysiotomy. Some have this impact all of their lives, on their families and on their physical and mental health. I do not think this report has healed old wounds, and in some cases it has opened new ones. In many cases, these women deserve better.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy)<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_375">I thank Senators for the contributions. I acknowledge Senator Reilly's role in establishing the scheme in his time as Minister for Health. The aim of the Government was to put in place a person-centred scheme for those who had a surgical symphysiotomy, to help bring closure for as many women as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">I believe the scheme has helped to bring that closure to a large number of women, and I welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> The surgical symphysiotomy payment scheme was established in November 2014 following engagement by the then Minister for Health with the three patient advocacy groups that support women who underwent the procedure; and following consideration of two independent reports, the first from Professor Oonagh Walsh and the second from Judge Yvonne Murphy. Both of these expert reports recommended redress for the women who had undergone this procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> Two of the support groups welcomed the scheme and stressed the importance of providing redress for the women, given the older age group to which many of the women belong. One of the groups rejected the scheme. The scheme provided an alternative, non- adversarial and person-centred option for women, many of whom were elderly, and did not wish to pursue their cases through the courts. It was important that the women themselves had an opportunity to express their views regarding what might bring closure and Professor Walsh's research included a national public consultation process, with the women themselves and with other interested bodies. The report prepared by Judge Murphy also included direct meetings with the women regarding what would bring closure for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> Judge Harding Clark also provided a comprehensive report on the surgical symphysiotomy payment scheme in October last year and we now have available a thorough overview of the historical and medical context of symphysiotomy, including published material from the annual clinical reports of the major maternity hospitals between 1940 and 1960 and extracts from the transactions of the Royal Academy of Medicine between the 1940s and the 1960s. This shows that symphysiotomy was not a secret procedure or an illegal procedure, but its rare use was reviewed and discussed by obstetricians at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> The total cost of the symphysiotomy payment scheme was just under €34 million and payments of €50,000, €100,000 or €150,000 were made to 399 women, who met the criteria for an award, the majority of whom were aged over 75 years. Although the scheme was non-adversarial, it provided for women to have their own independent legal advice and assistance in submitting their applications to the scheme. In the interests of accountability, the scheme required each applicant to prove that she had a surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy in order to be considered for the assessment of an award. All assistance possible was given to the women by Judge Harding Clark and her team in establishing this proof, which was considerably lower than the burden of proof required by the courts. It was only on accepting an award under the scheme that a woman had to discontinue her legal proceedings. The vast majority of women opted to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> The scheme was administered to the highest standards in line with its terms of reference. Many hundreds of hours were spent examining the applicants' medical records and each application received an individual, careful and fair assessment. The scheme did not hold any original medical records and at the end of the scheme, all applications and supporting documents were returned to the applicants or were confidentially shredded in line with each applicant's wishes. Regarding those women who were unable to establish that they had a surgical symphysiotomy, the report states that all of these applicants were assisted by members of the team in trying to establish their claims and the scheme's resources were applied in rigorous investigations before a claim was declared ineligible for the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> Symphysiotomy is cited in several modern obstetric textbooks and has its place in obstetrics in limited circumstances, for example, it may still be used in the western world in the delivery of a trapped head in breech delivery or in emergency obstetric situations. It is not a banned procedure. One of the principal reasons for use of symphysiotomy in rare circumstances historically was the danger associated with caesarean section which was very real in Ireland in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> On the question of consent, based on the evidence available to the Department of Health, it would appear that in a number of cases the procedure was carried out with a woman's knowledge or consent. However, this was not the case in all hospitals. Hospital records in some instances showed that it was an elective procedure. The symphysiotomies in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, include a high number of elective procedures which would have been carried out with patient consent. Some 20% of respondents to Professor Walsh during her research were private patients. As I referred to earlier, the outmoded procedure of pubiotomy was only found to have been performed in one case and significant disability was established in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> The health of women affected by symphysiotomy has continued to be a priority. Medical services, including medical cards, are facilitated for the women by HSE nominated symphysiotomy liaison officers based around the country. These services are available whether or not a woman has availed of the scheme. Judge Harding Clark noted in her report that very detailed and forensic examination of available contemporaneous medical records failed to find evidence of religious as opposed to obstetric reasons why a symphysiotomy operation was performed. She also noted that the medical indications for symphysiotomy was always provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> The Government hopes that the payments made to women under the surgical symphysiotomy payment scheme have helped to bring closure to women who underwent surgical symphysiotomy and to their families.</p>

        <speech by="#MarieLouiseODonnell" eId="spk_162">
          <from>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_387">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> I thank the Minister of State for his presence. If people are charged with and convicted of murder in Ireland they will serve the ludicrous term called life imprisonment. It is absurd and ludicrous because it is not life imprisonment. It is a minimum seven-year sentence. There is every likelihood that the murderers will get out at somewhere between 13 and 17 years and some will serve even less. Reasons for mitigation are numerous and enumerated. We tend to hear about mitigating factors but never about aggravating. None seems to exist on the other side of the criminal justice system or on the side of the seriousness of the crime, murder, the taking of life. The word "proportionality" is only applied to the offender, it is rarely applied to the victim. My Bill, the Minimum Custodial Periods upon Conviction for Murder Bill 2017, sets out to address this problem and certain other issues pursuant to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> I stand here today as a Senator but also as a patron of AdVIC, Advocates for the Victims of Homicide. AdVIC has been my greatest teacher. Let us not forget that this Bill is about murder. The Bill is concerned with, and only with, the length of sentences served by those convicted of murder in this jurisdiction. It is concerned with the profound seriousness of the offence. There is nothing more serious than murder. It is my belief that we must start with minimum tariffs for murder. The mandatory life sentence as it stands today must now be abandoned. This is the central premise of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> The Bill provides for minimum tariffs for murder, similar to the English and Welsh model, to be introduced in Ireland. What does that mean? It means that the Bill provides a mechanism whereby the court can, upon passing sentence for murder, determine the amount of time the offender will spend in prison before he or she may be deemed eligible for release. The Bill cannot imply the abandonment of judicial discretion when sentencing for murder, because there currently is no discretion. There is a mandatory life sentence but that does not mean life under the Irish system of justice. It means a myriad of different levels of sentences. These myriad level of sentencing cause shock, horror and downright disbelief in the public. What has it caused the families of the victims in the Public Gallery? That is the question. That is the question of real justice. It has caused days, weeks and years of abject despair, breakdowns, illness, break-ups and depression because of justice not serving the victims of the savage murders of their loved ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">The examples are numerous and they fill our daily papers. Minimal custodial sentences for murder can, at the very least, go somewhere towards changing that landscape. Minimum custodial sentences for murder, as this Bill proposes, have a specified number of years attached to them. A sentence of life in the Irish criminal justice system does not. A sentence of life does not mean life; it means a minimum term of imprisonment of seven years. That is all it is. After seven years, a murderer's release becomes a possibility. A minimum custodial sentence would now allow for judicial discretion to become available for the first time in cases of murder. This is a most important point. At no place in this Bill is the Judiciary undermined. It is quite the contrary.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> Minimum tariffs or sentences are critical if we are to achieve justice for the victims and their families in the Public Gallery and the wider community. Society must evidence a minimum level of disapproval when it comes to murder, regardless of individual case circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> Mr. John O'Keeffe, a director of Advocates for the Victims of Homicide, has argued for this change for years. I am delighted he is present this afternoon together with members of his organisation and others who have been so profoundly affected. I am humbled to have the privilege to be the voice for Annie Mulvaney, whose son Brian's life was taken from him on the streets of Dublin, for Joan Deane, whose son Russell's life was taken from him in a most brutal manner in his own home, and for Gerard Guinee, whose daughter Karen's life was taken in a most savage way in her first week as a newly qualified doctor. These are but three people in the Gallery filled with despair. It is unconscionable that such murder and slaughter would not be met on conviction with minimum custodial sentencing.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> Giving life as a sentence means little; it is just a rubber stamp. Once a verdict of murder comes in, a judge's role is merely to rubber-stamp the available punishment. Life does not mean life in Ireland. It falls to a collection of civil servants and political appointees who make up the parole board and operate behind closed doors to decide whether murderers will re-enter society. Under the current system, a prisoner with a life sentence must serve seven years before being considered for release by the parole board. After seven years, the board reviews the prisoner's file every few years and makes a recommendation to the Minister for Justice and Equality. According to Dr. Diarmuid Griffin, a criminologist who specialises in the area, the average sentence for taking a human life is hovering around 17.5 years while the final decision rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality. Dr. Griffin found in his research that, in the vast majority of cases, the Minister will go with the decision of the Parole Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> Let me refute some of the arguments against and objections to this Bill that are likely to be articulated. It will be said there is no need for this Bill on the grounds that prisoners are now serving 17.5 years for murder whereas, in the 1970s and 1980s, the average term for a convicted murderer was 7.5 years. It will be said the term has increased but this is a false dawn for a variety of reasons, reasons that this Bill will alter again for a variety of reasons. The trend is currently upward but there is no reason to believe it will not shortly go back downward. The trend is an average. Indeed, a trend is a trend. Many convicted murderers still serve far less than the aforementioned term. It should be stated very clearly that no one serves a true life sentence in Ireland. In reality, the minimum sentence may be reviewed after seven years and the prisoner may be released.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> There is no certainty with a life sentence as matters stand. Some will be released after 15 years, some after 20 years, some in fewer than ten years, and some after 30 years. What is the reason one prisoner serves ten years for murder while another serves 30? This indicates zero transparency when it comes to time served for murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> Let there be no doubt in this Chamber today that there is zero certainty for families. After seven years, they must run the gauntlet of questioning whether the prisoner will be released. The only people to get a true life sentence are the families before us today in the Public Gallery. This is the kernel of the problem. The Bill can change that in an achievable way. The current life sentence lulls the public and even the Judiciary into a false sense of security. On what basis was all this decided? There was no basis. This Bill will alter that. Importantly, even the normally reserved Law Reform Commission published a report on sentencing in 2013 recommending that the courts should at least be able to recommend a minimum term that a murderer should serve. This Bill is merely a natural progression of that report.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> Another objection that is well articulated is that this Bill will fetter judicial discretion, which is at the heart of our legal system. It is argued that judges will not have any power and no discretion. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Judiciary has no discretion currently when a person is convicted of murder. It must be a life sentence. What this Bill does is grant judicial discretion where it has never before resided. Once this Bill is enacted, an Irish judge may exercise his or her discretion for the first time when it comes to murder. The judge will simply land on a suitable tariff – be it 25, 30, or 40 years – depending on the severity of the crime and then decide whether the sentence should rise or fall, depending on a range of approved criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> What about the argument that mandatory sentences do not work? This is rubbish. Possession of drugs with a value greater than €13,000 provides for a minimum sentence of ten years. Firearms offences carry a minimum sentence following conviction on indictment. Ireland is replete with maximum sentences for offences that are rarely ever met. What societies and families of murdered loved ones want is sentencing that reflects their minimum disapproval of the crime of murder, regardless of the nature of the specific murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> It is argued this Bill is unconstitutional. If in doubt, bring the Constitution out. The Constitution is not a golden wand. Minimum sentences in other contexts have been deemed unconstitutional and there have been plenty of Bills that have passed through this House and the Lower House in respect of which this somewhat tired charge has been made. The constitutionality of this Bill, if enacted, will be tested by the courts in due course, as has always been the case. It is my contention that it does pass constitutional muster. Just because it is brave does not mean it is unconstitutional.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> To be forgotten is to die twice. That is how the families of murdered loved ones feel. They have lost a family member violently and savagely and they are then subjected to an indifferent criminal justice system, which, indeed, we could call callous. It is called the criminal justice system because it is for criminals. That is where the justice lies. There is no balance. It is not about the victim. Justice is certainly not evenly distributed. Even distribution is exactly what I am trying to argue for today. It is not vengeance that I seek, and it is not retribution. Not one of the families, including the mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters, of the murdered in the Gallery this evening has ever spoken to me about punishment or revenge. What they have spoken about is keeping murderers off the streets. It is a question of parity of esteem and cognitive closure reflecting that the lives of their beloved had significance. Surely our greatest significance is our life. It is our most valuable resource. It is our only resource - being alive, being alive, being alive. </p>
          <p eId="para_402"> Language and communication take second, if not third, place to the fist or the knife. We even witness brawls on Parliament floors on our televisions. It is astounding we are now at a stage when nobody takes violent crime seriously anymore. It is regarded as an acceptable method of communication in film, video, games, some sports and news. We understand the language of violence better than the language of reconciliation and, may I go so far as to say, the language of harmony. It is our very best communicator. Kick out, stab out, hit out, shoot out: we are appalled but only for a minute. This Bill cannot alter or transform that but it can ensure that those who perpetrate the foul and heinous crime of murder and are convicted will receive significant minimum custodial sentences with the exercise of judicial discretion for the first time in this State and that those who are left behind do not have to question why justice was not done or seen to be done. I am leaving this in the hands of the Minister of State and I await his decision on what we should do now.</p>

        <speech by="#GerardPCraughwell" eId="spk_163">
          <from>Senator Gerard P. Craughwell<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_403">I congratulate my colleague, Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, on the introduction of the Minimum Custodial Periods upon Conviction for Murder Bill 2017. This is the work of the Seanad. The Seanad is about righting legislation that is wrong or in some way flawed. I am happy and proud to support my colleague Senator O'Donnell. </p>
          <p eId="para_404"> I welcome the clarity this Bill offers the Judiciary in making sentencing decisions and the reassurance that it will offer families bereaved by murder. I welcome the members of AdVIC who are in the Visitors Gallery today. I know how important this legislation is to them. We all know that a conviction for murder carries with it a life sentence, but a life sentence does not mean the person convicted will spend the rest of his or her life in prison. In fact, life sentenced prisoners can have their cases reviewed by a parole board after seven years. In 2013, the Law Reform Commission recommended by a majority that the mandatory life sentence for murder should be retained. It also recommended, unanimously, that legislation be enacted to permit a judge who imposed a life sentence for murder to recommend a minimum period which the person should serve in custody. This Bill offers a framework for judges by suggesting minimum custodial sentences of 25, 30 and 40 years, depending on the seriousness of the murder upon conviction. </p>
          <p eId="para_405"> The Bill is explicit in its categorisation of murders and if enacted will ensure that those convicted will be given sentences appropriate to the nature of the crime committed. We all know that murder is a heinous crime and this Bill introduces within the concept of murder the categories of "most serious upon conviction", "serious upon conviction" and "other cases upon conviction". In determining the category of seriousness, judges are offered detailed guidelines such as whether or not violence was used, whether the murderer had previous convictions and other aggravating factors. Mitigating factors, such as the age of the murderer, will also be taken into consideration by the sentencing judge. The Bill leaves it up to the court to determine the weight to be applied to any category, and contrary to what some commentators believe, it does adhere to the concept of judicial independence and discretion to impose sentences in line with the severity of the offence within specific guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> One of the most important aspects of this Bill is the opportunity it provides for the court to consider, where appropriate, victim impact statements. The value of human life, the unimaginable loss to families and communities should always remain central to the seriousness of murder. This Bill, while giving full discretion to the court to decide on whether victim impact statements should be considered also allows them to form part of the reason for imposition of a specific minimum custodial sentence. I welcome this aspect of the Bill. I do not see it in any way taking away from the rights of the offender. As stated by my colleague, there has been a slow evolution from mandatory life sentence for murder in the 1960 Criminal Justice Act to the commonplace early release of prisoners serving life sentences. While I am a great supporter of rehabilitative justice and the outstanding work done by the State probation service, I also believe in justice for victims and the value of an appropriate sentencing system as a solid deterrent against further crimes of murder. I agree that this Bill needs some refinement but I would strongly urge the Minister of State to accept it today and to amend it as necessary on Committee Stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_407"> We have spoken in this House a number of times about members of An Garda Síochána and young adults who go at night never to return home, taken in the most violent manner from the people who loved them most, leaving families with no opportunity to say good-bye. We cannot allow the system to continue as is. This Bill, while a simple Bill, is an important Bill because it takes away the uncertainty. It gives back to the victims, the people left behind, some semblance of justice. Murder is vicious. Murder takes from the family. It takes the lives of those they loved. We must keep the crime of murder in our focus. The son of one of my dearest friends was murdered on a night out. His parents had no chance to say good-bye to him and no opportunity to understand what happened. They had no further contact with a son they watched grow up and achieve at the highest level in university. He was beaten to death with a concrete block. He was murdered. The parents of that young man had no opportunity to say good-bye while their son's murderer will be out of prison in a few years and walking the streets again. We must see this Bill through to enactment. Whatever amendments the Minister of State of his officials believe are necessary I am sure my colleague, Senator O'Donnell, will be open to them, provided they are realistic. We must support her and this Bill. I am proud to do so today. I hope that when we leave here this evening it will have been agreed to allow this Bill to progress to the next Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichelleMulherin" eId="spk_164">
          <from>Senator Michelle Mulherin<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_408">I welcome this debate, which is long overdue debate. I welcome the Minister of State and the families in the Visitors Gallery whose children were murdered. </p>
          <p eId="para_409"> I believe that murder sentencing in this country is not fit for purpose. Change is long overdue. There are many serious categories of indictable crimes such as rape, murder and so on but none are treated in the same manner as murder. Once a person is found guilty of murder the judge has no choice but to impose a life sentence. He or she does not have the discretion to consider issues such as whether the murder was pre-mediated or the circumstances surrounding it and so his or her hands are tied. I commend Senator O'Donnell on what she is trying to do in terms of broadening that out. However, the reality is that after seven years the parole process comes into play. A person given a life sentence for murder could be released as early as 12 years. The average sentence served for murder is 18.5 years. What does this mean? I know that the parole board takes into account many different things but to my mind all it does is commence the charting of a pathway to freedom for somebody who has taken the life of another person. I do not think that is right. As I said, once a judge has handed down a sentence the matter is out of his or her hands and the case is then taken up by the parole board after seven years. A parole board meets in private, considers a case and makes a recommendation to the Minister. We should demand a higher standard from our criminal justice system and ensure that decision-making around the minimum sentence that a person convicted of murder might serve is done in public in a court of law. Anybody can go into a court and listen to a case and the judgment of a judge. We may all have different views on judgments but there is transparency around them. We want and respect this process but that process is not carried through to parole boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> I have previously raised concerns about the following issue. The Law Reform Commission reported in 2013 that it takes issue with the manner in which life sentences are handed down. In terms of recommendations, it takes the view that the judge should have the discretion to impose a minimum sentence that must be served. As things stand, judges cannot do this and that is not right. If the Law Reform Commission, AdVIC and other stakeholders are suggesting this then we need to pay heed to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Other stakeholders are also suggesting this and we have to pay heed. I do not understand why nothing has been done about it. I agree with Senator Craughwell. A progressive approach which is seen to be meting out punishment is equivalent to rehabilitation. We can go too far with that. While we would like to rehabilitate criminals, we have to be careful. When a person crosses a line and commits a serious crime, a guillotine should come down. There has to be a severe punishment and an offender must pay a significant price. If he or she takes a life, a sentence of 18.5 years should be imposed. A murder conviction relates to the wilful taking of a life, not an accident or manslaughter. This situation offends our own innate sense of justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> I received a great deal of feedback on one case prior to Christmas. Everybody has a case and it relates to a loved one. Christmas day was the eighth anniversary of the murders of Sharon Whelan and her daughters, Zara and Nadia. Brian Hennessy, who carried out the murders, was considered for parole after seven years of his sentence, but, worse than that, he was initially given three life sentences to run consecutively before the Court of Criminal Appeal decided they should run concurrently. That is crazy and I do not know how we can stand over that. If someone commits a crime and then does so a second or a third time, unless there are extenuating circumstances, he or she should serve consecutive sentences. I again make the distinction between indictable offences and summary offences, which are minor. I refer to the most serious crimes, which offend us all and which we all want to guard against. We are not just talking about a deterrent or rehabilitation; we are talking about a severe punishment for people who cross that line. The public should be satisfied that there is a sentence to match the severity of the crime that has been committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> I acknowledge good inroads have been made on tougher sentencing but there must be a closer examination of what constitutes a life sentence. A great deal of good work has been done on law reform, especially in strengthening the law in respect of repeat offenders and those out on bail. It is nonsensical what some offenders have got away with engaging in criminal activity. We should pursue this debate until the law is amended. Judges should set out the terms of a minimum life sentence, bearing all the circumstances in mind. This would give solace to the families of some victims in the knowledge that the perpetrators of these heinous acts would go to prison for a long time. The Government is strengthening the right of victims of crime and their families thorough the implementation of the EU victims directive and providing for a right to access to information and protection for victims, which is important. Crime victims and their families often feel alienated by the criminal justice system. In view of the consequences of being convicted of a crime are serious and justice must be blind and administered that way, it is even more necessary to keep victims abreast of what is going on in order that they can experience a sense of justice and they are not alienated. While victims are witnesses, the greater good is served when offenders are tried for serious crimes. However, victims need to be made more aware of what is happening. I welcome the steps that will be taken in this regard but we have to persevere and do all we can to keep violent offenders off the streets, and make sure they are properly punished and their sentences serve as a deterrent to others.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> I would appreciate it if the Minister of State in his reply would, in particular, address why the LRC report has not been acted on to the date. I commend those who have brought this legislation before the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_416">I thank Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell for bringing this legislation to the House. The lack of consistency of sentencing, in general, and not just for murder, is a serious issue. I welcome the victims of crime and their families who are in the Visitors Gallery and the representatives of AdVIC because this is a difficult debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> I concur with fellow Senators regarding the LRC recommendation that judges should be permitted to proposed a minimum mandatory sentence, which would then be used as a guide for the parole board. Fianna Fáil has a Bill before the Dáil, which is awaiting Committee Stage, based on that recommendation. It proposes that the minimum sentence recommended by the judge should be used as a guide by the parole board and that the board be put on a statutory footing. This would remove the authority to decide if an offender should be released by a certain date. Currently, responsibility for granting parole lies with the Minister, ultimately. The parole system that operates at the moment is entirely at the discretion of the Minister and it is not fit for purpose. It is not on a statutory footing and it has eroded the separation of powers, which is a fundamental of the rule of law in our country and many modern democracies. Fianna Fáil believes that a body that performs functions as important as the parole board such as advising whether convicted killers or rapists should be released should be clearly defined and organised in statute. The failure to place the board on a statutory footing means its important functions are denied the force of law and merely constitute a form of advice provided to the Minister. This is particularly problematic since prisoners who believe they have an entitlement to parole can avail of the courts to achieve this entitlement. More fundamental, there is something incoherent about having a member of the Cabinet making decisions on matters that were initially decided by the Judiciary. This practice offends the principle of the separation of powers and politicians should be kept away from making decisions that should be in the hands of the court. The sentencing of convicted prisoners is an integral part of our criminal justice system. It constitutes very much an injustice for victims of serious crime. The<i> ad hoc</i> basis for granting parole, which is ultimately at the discretion of a politician, is outdated and it should be amended to properly reflect a modern judicial system.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> We will not support the legislation because the Fianna Fáil Bill before the Dáil adequately addresses this matter. It gives the Judiciary, which has full knowledge of cases and mitigating factors relating to the accused, the power to recommend a minimum sentence that can then be proffered to the parole board, which will be put on a statutory footing. Its members will be independent of politicians. They can use the guideline the judge has given them for release dates.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> Some of the Bill's provisions are antiquated.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">It would make our laws one of the most stringent in Europe. There may be, as mentioned, constitutional and human rights issues with the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_422"> I welcome the opportunity to speak on Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's Bill. We acknowledge the real significance of the intent and the sincere and honest desire to see a change in the law in this regard. While there will be a divergence of opinion on this Bill and some of the nuances concerning it, given that some of the victims and the organisations that represent them are in the Visitors Gallery, as has been reflected thus far it is important that Members of the Seanad have approached the debate in a very respectful frame of mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> Like my Fianna Fáil colleague, we will be opposing the Bill. That is not to take away from the Senator's passionate contribution. I appreciate fully why she wants to see this Bill advanced, but let me outline some of the reasons Sinn Féin will be opposing it on this Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> This Private Members' Bill is designed to provide a mechanism whereby the court, on passing a sentence for murder, can determine the amount of time an offender will spend in prison before he or she may be deemed eligible for remission, parole or early release and introduces minimum custodial periods of sentencing depending on the category of the type and nature of the offence of murder. Currently a conviction for murder receives a mandatory minimum life sentence but the actual length of time which an offender will serve in prison depends on the circumstances of the case. Under this Bill the person convicted will serve a minimum of 25, 30 or more years, depending on the circumstances. There is a provision to give judicial discretion but with the caveat that an offence cannot have a sentence lower than the 30 years or 25 years as set out in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> Our party's approach to justice matters is that policy should be developed on a clear and evidential basis. While I recognise that the proposed provisions of the Bill are not quite mandatory sentencing, given there is some very limited judicial discretion in it, the manner in which it is constructed is certainly akin to a mandatory sentencing regime, depending on the nature and type of murder for which a defendant is convicted.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> Sinn Féin is opposed to the use of mandatory sentencing. While advocates of mandatory sentencing argue that it makes sentencing more consistent and judges more accountable for their decisions, its use holds the potential for miscarriages of justice. By applying an identical sentence to all offenders who have committed similar but not identical crimes, it is in our view an overly blunt sentencing tool. It is our belief that the Bill, in spite of the range of items that a judge may take into consideration, will prevent the Judiciary considering the nuances of the situation, including offender intent and degree of social harm. We believe there is more than what is contained in the Bill that must be taken together in order to form a complete picture of the seriousness of the offence and the appropriateness of a given sentence. This, of course, could create the potential for an injustice. We are not convinced either that this would have any deterrent factor on those at whom it is aimed. </p>
          <p eId="para_427"> Sinn Féin believes, indeed agrees with the drafters of the Bill, that sentencing must be proportionate to each crime committed, but judicial discretion is essential when determining the sentence to be administered by the court. This allows the judge to factor in the circumstances in which the offence occurred, whether there were aggravating factors, particularly violent behaviour, as well as the character, age and previous criminal record of the defendant. It allows the judge to consider alternatives to custody such as rehabilitative programmes where they may be appropriate. I accept and acknowledge fully also that there will be occasions where that is not appropriate. It is our view, and this applies to all offences across the board, that the introduction of non-statutory sentencing guidelines should include setting out the principles that should underpin sentencing, including the principle of imprisonment as a last resort, community safety imperatives and the principle of proportionality between the severity of the sentence and the seriousness of an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> I recognise the particular issues pertaining to the mandatory life sentence for murder in Ireland but it is our view that a sentencing guidelines council should be established to monitor sentencing guidelines and their effectiveness. The Law Reform Commission that has been mentioned has also called for a similar body to be introduced. The effect of this Bill is to introduce a sentencing regime that is tantamount to mandatory sentencing regimes. While we acknowledge there is scope for some judicial discretion, the introduction of minimum custodial periods of detention effectively amounts to a presumptive sentencing regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> While we support the idea of judges taking into account degrees of planning and premeditation, other offences and mitigating factors such as a lack of premeditation, or whether the offender was provoked through domestic violence or acted in self defence and co-operated with the Garda Síochána, we believe the objective would be better achieved through the introduction of a sentencing guidelines council that would effectively guide the Judiciary in its task. The Law Reform Commission has repeatedly called for the establishment of a body that is empowered to develop and publish non-statutory sentencing guidelines, reflecting the general aims of the criminal sanctions. These could set out the principles that should underpin sentencing, including the principle of imprisonment as a last resort and the principle of proportionality between the severity of the sentence and the seriousness of the offence. It is our view that this would be a more appropriate approach to take for all offences. We further believe that sentencing judges should provide written explanation of any custodial sentences imposed, including the mitigating and aggravating factors considered. It would also be helpful if plans were established at the outset of all sentences for the convicted person regarding his or her imprisonment and engagement with rehabilitation services. </p>
          <p eId="para_430"> I commend the Senator's wish to examine this issue but believe that the offence of murder should not be dealt with in isolation and that non-statutory sentencing guidelines would be a much more appropriate approach to take at this stage. As I said at the outset, I appreciate fully the intent of Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell. I hope to work on this issue with the proposer and seconder and other colleagues on this much-needed review of our criminal justice system and our sentencing laws. </p>
          <p eId="para_431"> In the spirit of honesty and genuine aspiration to change the law, we do not think this Bill does what is necessary.</p>

          <from>Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_432">I acknowledge and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and his officials who I know well and also those in the Visitors Gallery who have been affected so personally by this issue of murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> The contribution of Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell was very impressive. I congratulate her for introducing this Bill because it allows us to discuss the issue of murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> In fairness, as I stand here in opposition to the Bill, I do so in an attempt to give a nuanced point of view, which does not in any way mean that I or people who have a similar point of view, as has been articulated already, are in any way not aware of the effects of murder, that it is a life sentence for the families of the victims of murder, and that nobody wants to send a message to society that murder should not be punished. However, we have to deal with realities. </p>
          <p eId="para_435"> Ireland currently has a mandatory life sentence for murder. Just ten EU member states have mandatory life sentences for murder, others have minimum sentences ranging from ten years. A life sentence always lasts for life although the portion of the sentence served in prison can vary. If released from prison, the person remains under licence and can be recalled at any time for breach of conditions. This Bill seeks to introduce minimum custodial periods that must be served in prison before release on parole can be considered. There are benefits to bringing clarity and certainty to the portion of the life sentence that a prisoner can be expected to spend in prison. There is a life sentence already. What is at issue and what we are discussing is the portion of that life sentence which is spent in prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> The basis for the starting point of 25, 30 and 40 years in the Bill is unclear. These starting points would put Ireland at the more punitive end of the range in Europe, as has been said by my colleague in the Fianna Fáil Party, and more in line with Russia, Poland, Estonia and Moldova than western European jurisdictions such as Denmark. Minimum sentences are not averages. A sentence of 25 years is one of the highest minimum periods that would be enforced in Europe. In Ireland, life sentence prisoners can apply for parole at seven years but would have no realistic prospect of release until at least 15 years have been served.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The average time currently served, as the proposer of the Bill has pointed out, is 17.5 years. If we are talking about trying to deter people from committing a murder, if somebody expects to serve 17.5 years or 25 years, I am not sure that factor will be considered by somebody intent on committing this crime. </p>
          <p eId="para_438"> Average time served by people sentenced to life imprisonment increased from 11 years in 2002 to a peak of 22 years in 2012 and 17.5 years in 2015. The length of time served is increasing. However, due to the low number - between one and six - of life sentence prisoners who are released every year, the average length of time does not give a clear picture. For example, in 2012 a prisoner died in hospital having served 36 years of a life sentence. In 2013 a life sentence prisoner was released having served 13 years. The circumstances were very different in those two cases. There are approximately 355 people in prison in Ireland serving life sentences, not all for murder. Some 12 of these are female. </p>
          <p eId="para_439"> This is probably not a very popular point but it is one that is important to put on the record of the House. The impact of this Bill on prison and justice resources, indirectly and unintentionally, would be immense. My view is that it would be far better to invest resources in crime prevention than punishment. I often make the point that in New York, planning for prison spaces required in 15 years time involves looking at the literacy rates of 11 year olds. In circumstances were people are grieving for lost loved ones because of murder, the circumstances or the conditions of a life that lead a person to commit a murder is the least of their concerns, but in the overall sense it is an important point which needs to be made in this debate, which is only happening because of the Bill that was put forward by my colleague. </p>
          <p eId="para_440"> Life sentence prisoners are a huge drain on prison resources due to particular needs over a longer time. If one gets a life sentence, it is a life sentence. What we are debating here is the period of time of that life sentence that is spent in prison. </p>
          <p eId="para_441"> Proposals that should be considered instead of this Bill, which are backed by the Irish Council of Civil Liberties, are that delayed proposed changes to presumptive minimum custodial periods under conviction for murder should take place within the context of parole reform as per commitments by successive Ministers for Justice. In 2014 the cross-agency Department of Justice and Equality's strategic review on penal policy, which included victim representative groups, recommended that a minimum term before parole can be considered should be set out in statute that more accurately reflects the expectations of offender and society. The review group expected that this would be achieved within legislation establishing a parole board on a statutory basis. </p>
          <p eId="para_442"> I commend the proposer of the Bill for her passion in bringing forward this debate to the House. Those of us with a nuanced view of this issue are not in any way trying to suggest that we are soft on crime or soft on murder, but we want to deal with the realities of the situation. Opponents of the Bill are not in any way trying to diminish the suffering or the pain that has been felt and experienced by those in the Visitors Gallery today and throughout Ireland who have been victims of murder. Most people in this House would have been to the funerals of murder victims, as I have been myself. We have to deal with this in the round and speak honestly. We have to speak as legislators. While congratulating the Senator on bringing this Bill to the House, because we would not be having this debate if it was not for her initiative, I and my party will be opposing the Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#GraceOSullivan" eId="spk_169">
          <from>Senator Grace O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2017-02-22T17:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_443">I welcome the Minister. I have consulted my Civil Engagement colleague, Frances Black, who is a member of the Joint Committee for Justice and Equality. At present in Ireland a murder conviction carries a mandatory life sentence. However, the length of time served in a prison can vary greatly depending on a range of factors, including the circumstances of the case and the operation of executive mechanisms that regulate the custodial process. This tends to create a sense of uncertainty around sentencing in murder cases, and it is not clear how long a person will actually spend in prison. In 2013 the issue of murder sentencing and the duration of custodial periods following murder convictions were examined by the Law Reform Commission and it recommended that legislation should be introduced to allow the court to recommend a minimum term to be served by an offender upon conviction of murder. The Minimum Custodial Period upon Conviction For Murder Bill 2017 seeks to rectify the current situation and create certainty around murder sentencing. The Bill provides a framework for the court to determine the length of time a person convicted of murder will serve in prison before being considered for remission, parole or early release. The introduction of suggested minimum custodial periods of sentencing will categorise a murder offence dependent on its severity. The court will use its discretion to decide a minimum custodial sentence to be served within the framework of categorisation contained within the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> I do not recognise that the Bill sets out a clear enough framework for the categorisation of the nature of the offences committed. However, it does require that the court outlines clearly the reasons for the categorisation of such offences. This will serve to underline the seriousness of the offence of murder in the eyes of the public. It will also create greater certainty around murder sentencing. </p>
          <p eId="para_445"> There are a number of aspects of the Bill that may be a cause for concern. While the minimum custodial periods set out in the Bill in section 5, the most serious category upon conviction, and section 6, serious category upon conviction, will certainly be applicable in some cases, the general trend in the Bill towards longer custodial sentences seems to go against the general recommendations of the Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, which recommends a reduction in the emphasis on prison time. The IPRT is resolutely against mandatory sentencing up to and including the life sentence for murder, and believe it should be repealed. Mandatory sentencing is a blunt instrument which always results in unequal justice. There is scant evidence, nationally or internationally, that mandatory sentencing is effective in reducing crime. Also, a recommended minimum custodial period of 25 years for those convicted of offences falling within section 7 - other cases of murder upon conviction - seems to be severe. While I accept that there does not seem to be a limit placed by the Bill on the court's discretion in such cases, 25 years in prison is above the average amount of time that those given life sentences currently serve in prison, which is 20 years. My worry would be that the unintended consequences of the Bill would be an increase in the prison population or a sharp increase in convictions for manslaughter as a result of guilty pleas in order to avoid minimum custodial periods. The case for mandatory sentencing for manslaughter will be put forth, and the IPRT has also expressed its opposition to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> Another concerning aspect is that as the framework sets out to determine the length of time a person convicted of a murder will serve in prison before being considered for remission, parole or early release, this goes against the possibility of prisoner rehabilitation or the prisoner having the opportunity to make positive change in their life. The IPRT states that the emphasis in the courts should instead be on non-custodial sanctions, including community service, restorative justice, community drugs courts, intensive mentoring and bail supports which are more cost effective and less damaging to families and communities, with lowering re-offending rates. Although at present those serving time in prison for murder do not take up a sizeable proportion of the prison population, another concern of mine would be that the Bill would serve as a precedent and that minimal custodial periods would be made applicable upon conviction for other crimes, as is the case in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The introduction of minimum custodial sentences in the US for relatively minor crimes has led to a sharp rise in the prison population. The handing down of longer custodial sentences has been identified as a primary contributor to the rise in the US prison population. This would have the effect of increasing the prison population which has been proven to be negative for society in the long term. Therefore, I would prefer to see the minimum custodial periods in sections 6 and 7 set lower with the court given extended scope to increase the custodial periods up to ten years.</p>

          <p eId="para_448">I welcome the Minister of State. I particularly welcome the people in the Gallery and thank them for coming here and for giving their time because it is a very important part of the process. I value their attendance, as do my colleagues. I would particularly like to acknowledge the enormous amount of work my colleague, Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, put into this Bill, as did the seconder of it. Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell spoke passionately about it because she fundamentally believes in it. I am only here a few months but I know she is not one to be jumping up and down on every issue but she is passionate about this and she believes in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> From time to time, legislation requires amendment. People are entitled to bring about change but to suggest it is all rubbish and all bad news is taking it a bit far. This is a process. We have Committee Stage where we can amend legislation. I would appeal to the Minister of State to be open. I would not like to think he came here with the intention of closing this legislative work down. I would be extremely disappointed in the Government and the Minister of State if that was his intention. I am not going to pre-empt or prejudge; I am going to listen to what the Minister of State has to say after he has listened to what we have to say and, hopefully, from that dialogue something may emerge. That is an important point to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> This Minimum Custodial Periods upon Conviction for Murder Bill 2017 is being proposed by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell. According to the explanatory memorandum, it provides for a mechanism whereby a court can, upon passing sentence for murder, determine the amount of time that the offender will spend in prison before that person may be deemed eligible for such considerations as remission of sentence, parole or early release. Let us look at the current law on the release of prisoners who receive a life sentence. Under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1990, there is a mandatory life sentence for murder. This means that a court must impose a life sentence in every case without exception where a person is convicted of murder. A life sentence does not necessarily mean that the person will spend the remainder of their life in prison. In fact, the Law Reform Commission has noted that a person convicted of murder may expect to be released before his or her life sentence expires because the Executive has at its disposal two mechanisms by which it may grant early release to a prisoner serving a mandatory life sentence. The first mechanism available to the Executive for the release of a life sentenced prisoner is the power of special remission. This power stems from Article 13.6 of the Constitution and section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act 1951. Special remission means that an offender is no longer subject to punishment for the offence in respect of which he or she was serving a sentence. This power could be described as a modern version of the royal prerogative of mercy. It is rarely used in practice. That is an interesting point. The most frequently used mechanism used for the relief of life sentenced prisoners is temporary release. This power is based on section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960. It is a discretionary power, thus prisoners have no automatic entitlement to it. It was originally intended to be used for the temporary release of prisoners on compassionate grounds or to help integrate prisoners into the community before release. However, it is not always involved in the primary mechanism for early release for all those serving a life sentence. That is really important. For a breach of any condition of release, a prisoner can expect to be recalled into prison. </p>
          <p eId="para_451"> In 2016, only four life sentenced prisoners were recalled to prison from the community. To substantiate that, I read a response to a parliamentary question on 24 January 2017, where the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality advised that in 2016, a total of seven life sentenced prisoners were released and the average length of sentence they had served was approximately 22 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> I note the Law Reform Commission's recommendations, which are important. In 2013, it recommended by a majority that a mandatory life sentence for murder should be retained. It also recommended unanimously that legislation be introduced which would permit a judge, that is, the judge imposing the life sentence for murder, to recommend a minimum period which the person should serve in custody.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> I took the time to look at a number of other jurisdictions, and this relates to the Law Reform Commission's recommendations. In England and Wales, where a court imposes a life sentence, it must make an order for a minimum term to be served before the offender may be considered for release by the parole board. In Scotland, a sentencing court must specify a punishment part to be served by the offender to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. This period may be any number of years or months even if it is likely for the period to exceed a life sentence. In Canada, the criminal code sets out the periods of those sentenced for life imprisonment and it states that prisoners must serve the period before they are eligible for parole depending on all circumstances, and a minimum 25 year period. In New Zealand, offenders serving life sentence are eligible for parole once ten years of imprisonment have been served without exception.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> People have different views but the Minister of State should not close the door. Allow this Bill to go to the next Stage and allow the Members, if they are opposed to it, or have genuine alternatives, to put them forward. Let us tease them out, debate them and vote on them. I thank the Minister of State for his time.</p>

          <p eId="para_455">I welcome the Minister of the State to the House. When Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell came to me with this legislation, I was totally opposed to it. Having listened to the debate and the proposals she has made and having looked at the Bill, I do not think I want to close the door on it now. I would agree with other Senators that it is a matter that should be considered. I am not saying I agree with it but it is important that we have a debate on the matter. We have fairly good checks and balances in this country in the area of sentencing and how we deal with criminal prosecutions. The courts and the appeals process have been used very effectively. It is not so many years since the Director of Public Prosecutions did not have a right of appeal in regard to sentences imposed. However, that has changed, which is welcome. There is a right of appeal on both sides on the severity or the leniency of sentences and that ensures there is a level playing field for everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> The Bill sets out various ways on how a decision is arrived at, that is, making the final decision about what sentence is appropriate. However, despite all the variations and the options in the Bill, it still sets out in stone certain aspects. It removes the role of the courts in doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">In this country we have a clear separation of powers which has worked very well. We should examine the various roles of the different arms of the State and we should not always have the view that because we have done something for the past 50 years we should do the same for the next 50 years, because that may not necessarily be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> I welcome the Bill. It is appropriate that we have such a debate. Some of its aspects should be given consideration. We should not close the door fully on the matter. I thank Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell and all of those involved in bringing forward the Bill. We must remember that we are here to deal with legislation. It is only right that legislation is not the sole preserve of Government Departments or Ministers. We all have a part to play in enacting legislation. I welcome the debate and this issue needs to be examined further over the next few months.</p>

          <p eId="para_459">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I will be brief. I thank Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell for bringing forward the Bill. I was in my office working on something else and listened very carefully to what she and the Fine Gael spokesperson said about the Bill. While I accept that my party is not in a position to support it, I am conscious of the fact that there is a parole Bill in the Lower House which has been awaiting Committee Stage since 2014. There is a lot of merit in what is contained in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> As we are all aware, if somebody is charged with causing a death, the charge is either manslaughter or murder. We should first consider the definition of manslaughter and then consider a harder definition of murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> There has been some reference to relatives of the victims of murder, who are in the Gallery. I would like to join colleagues in welcoming them to the House. While we are debating whether somebody should serve a minimum sentence of seven years or between 25 and 40 years, the victim of murder is serving a sentence of eternity, something we should not forget. I understand that the majority of people are not in favour of the Bill, but there is very little disagreement other than on the minimum sentencing proposal which is the main thrust of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> Perhaps we could be given an opportunity to examine the matter and possibly amend the Bill, incorporating into it, with Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's permission, the definition of manslaughter. There is a significant difference between the sentence for manslaughter and that for murder. If we can reclassify manslaughter and harden the definition of murder, there would be a better case to be made for minimum sentences suggested in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_463">I am representing the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who cannot be here. On my behalf and that of the Minister, I would like to thank Senators Marie-Louise O'Donnell, Craughwell and Humphreys who are co-sponsors of the Bill. I also want to recognise those in the Gallery whose relatives have been the victims of murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> Murder is the taking of a life in violent circumstances involving a brutal loss of life and tragic lifelong consequences for the family and friends of the victim. Rightly, therefore, murder is regarded under our law as the most serious criminal offence, attracting a mandatory life sentence on conviction. Where a person is convicted of a murder, a court must and does impose a sentence of life imprisonment. A mandatory life sentence lasts for the duration of the offender's life, although offenders are currently eligible for temporary release at the discretion of the Minister for Justice and Equality and on recommendation from the Parole Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> What the court does not do, but which the Bill purports to do, is determine and impose a minimum period of custody to be served before release can be considered. The minimum periods of custody set down in this Bill are very high, with starting points of 40, 30 and 25 years. Similar provisions in the UK are 30, 25 and 15 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> There is a perception that persons convicted of murder serve relatively short periods in prison and this was true in the past. However, today a person convicted of murder in Ireland serves an average of 18 years in prison. By way of comparison, in the UK it is 17 years. The current 18 year average in this State compares with an average of just over 7.5 years for releases between 1975 and 1984, just under 12 years for the period between 1984 to 1994, and just under 14 years for the period from 1995 to 2004, since when the average has been steadily climbing. </p>
          <p eId="para_467"> While a life sentence prisoner might anticipate release from detention at some stage, he or she is likely to serve a lengthy sentence before that occurs. Moreover, and crucially, a person convicted of murder will remain subject to recall at any stage of his or her natural life should he or she commit a further offence or breach a condition of his or her release. </p>
          <p eId="para_468"> The management of custodial sentences is key in the successful rehabilitation and reintegration of an offender. It can, however, be a challenge to incentivise life sentence prisoners to participate in certain rehabilitative programmes where release is many years away. The substantial increase in the periods of custody proposed in the Bill, together with the disapplication of any form of remission or temporary release under section 1 is, therefore, a matter of concern with respect to the rehabilitation of offenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> There are also other difficulties with this Bill. The Bill effectively creates a hierarchy of murder, with section 5 concerned with what is termed the most serious category, including murders where the victim was abducted or the victim was subjected to sexual, sadistic, humiliating or degrading conduct. Also covered are persons who hire someone else or are hired to commit murder. The section will also apply to murders with more than one victim and which involve an act of arson, although the Bill is silent as to multiple victims arising from other acts. </p>
          <p eId="para_470"> The minimum custodial period if convicted for an offence which the court considers to fall under section 5 is 40 years. While there is some judicial discretion to lower or raise the penalty, there is a limit, under section 8 of the Bill, on lowering the minimum period of custody from 40 to 30 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> Section 6 provides for minimum periods of custody of 30 years where the offence involves the use of a weapon and the court is satisfied that the fear, pain and suffering occasioned on the victim was of a significant, serious and prolonged nature. This section will also apply to the murder of one person by way of arson. Section 8 limits judicial discretion in lowering the penalty to a minimum of 25 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> There are evidential aspects to sections 5 and 6 which raise concern. For instance, for a particular offence to fall under section 6, the court would have to be satisfied that the fear, pain and suffering occasioned on the victim by the offender was of a significant, serious and prolonged nature. I accept that these sections are simply for the purpose of determining sentence. However, after a jury returns a verdict of guilty of murder, the court must, under this Bill, then begin the exercise of hearing evidence as to the precise nature of the offence and the degree of fear, pain and suffering and whether it was of a significant, serious and prolonged nature. This is not necessarily evidence which would arise or be necessary in trial, the obvious instance being those cases where an offender pleads guilty which does arise, albeit rarely.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> How the significance and prolonged nature of the victim’s fear, pain and suffering could be proven is difficult to envisage in all cases. I have similar concerns regarding the reference to humiliating or degrading conduct under section 5. The last thing anyone wants is for decisions on those factors to become a basis for judicial review or appeal. I very much believe that these aspects of the Bill should, at a minimum, be reviewed by practitioners, including the Judiciary.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> A further difficulty with the Bill is that it creates an anomaly with respect to the existing offence of murder under section 3 of the Criminal Justice Act 1990, formerly known as capital murder. Under that Act, the murder of a member of An Garda Síochána or a prison officer is subject to a minimum period of imprisonment of 40 years to which remission for good conduct of one quarter applies, effectively creating a minimum sentence of 30 years. As I mentioned, this Bill would appear to specifically exclude the application of remission to the minimum periods of custody. </p>
          <p eId="para_475"> In effect, this may result in greater penalties being served under the Bill than would be served for the murder of a member of the Garda or prison officer. Given that the latter have been given special provision under statute, it is arguable that the proposed mandatory minimums proposed under the Bill are disproportionate and could be subject to challenge on that ground. This anomaly between the penalties for murder under the Bill with those under the 1990 Act is confirmed by the provision in section 5(6) of the Bill which confirms that its provisions do not replace or supersede the 1990 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">Section 7 deals with other cases of murder which do not fall within sections 5 or 6 and sets a minimum period of custody of 25 years, and while judicial discretion to reduce this penalty is not restricted, as it is for sections 5 and 6, the proposed minimum period of custody is nonetheless considerably higher than current periods spent in prison on a life sentence. Over a period of time, that would significantly increase the number of prisoners in prisons and inevitably lead to increased costs. That is not a major issue but it is something our colleagues have raised. However, the more immediate concern is the negative impact that such an extended period of imprisonment would have on the rehabilitation and reintegration of prisoners who would be less incentivised to participate in rehabilitative programmes and more vulnerable to institutionalisation. The successful rehabilitation and reintegration of a prisoner following release from prison must be a central aim of sentencing and penal policy. This Bill does not support that aim. Experience from other jurisdictions also shows that extremely long prison sentences with little prospect of release can lead to more extreme and volatile behaviour in prison, including violence against other prisoners and staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> I know the sponsors of this Bill have cited the position of the Law Reform Commission, LRC, in support of the provisions in the Bill and that the LRC also recommended that judges may recommend a minimum period to be served in custody prior to consideration for temporary release. While the LRC saw benefit in allowing a court to judge on relative culpability of an offender as a useful guidance for a subsequent decision on the release of an offender, the LRC did not recommend a prescriptive legislative model as proposed in the Bill. Moreover, the LRC recommendation was that a judge may recommend a minimum period of custody but that there would be no obligation to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> There are also questions as to the impact of the Bill on the role of the parole board. Currently, a judge imposes a life sentence on a person convicted of murder without specifying a period to be served, the parole board is then responsible for reviewing that sentence and making recommendations as to release and will do so having regard to the nature and gravity of the offence. However, under the Bill the court is required, in determining the period to be served, to consider the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the offender as well as any relevant aggravating or mitigating factors. This is established sentencing practice and in circumstances where a court determines that sentence, taking into account those factors, it is unclear how a period of detention beyond that sentence could be supported and therefore what role, if any, would exist for the parole board, either in its current non-statutory form or as a statutory body as is proposed in a Bill currently before the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> I also have questions regarding other aspects of the Bill - for instance if section 1 is intended to prohibit any form of remission, it could be interpreted as an inappropriate fettering of the discretion in the President, under Article 13.6 of the Constitution, to pardon or remit any punishment imposed by a court. By way of contrast, when it comes to capital murder under the 1990 Act, that Act only disapplies the remission of sentence provision contained in section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act 1951. In addition to the concerns already outlined, the Bill does not reflect the recommendations arising from more recent reviews such as the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Penal Reform in 2013 and the strategic review of penal policy in 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> Of course the Bill also needs to represent the views of a number of stakeholders - in particular the Judiciary, criminal practitioners and those who work with offenders. Great care must be taken in addressing this area of law and consideration should also be given to existing legislative proposals such as those to establish the parole board on a statutory basis. Such a hugely significant change to criminal law should first be the subject of extensive consultation. As I said, murder is the most serious of offences. The impact and consequences are lifelong, as is the effect of the mandatory life sentence which means offenders are subject to recall to prison for the duration of their life. I fully appreciate what the Senators who have sponsored this Bill are seeking to achieve. The family and loved ones of the victim of murder must and do live with the consequences of that horrific crime for the rest of their lives. Current sentence management focuses on the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders as the most effective means of maintaining safe communities. However, in the Government's view the Bill as its currently stands is excessively punitive and does not accommodate our responsibility to ensure that an offender can, to the greatest extent possible, be safely released into the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> I have listened carefully to what everyone has said here. I note the passion, integrity and seriousness with which the issue is taken. As you know, a Chathaoirligh, I served for five years as Chair of the justice committee and one of the things we did there was to have a process of legislative scrutiny whereby topics such as this which are so important, detailed and serious were scrutinised carefully by the committee. Members of the public and other interested experts, individuals and bodies could have an input into proposed changes in policy, such as the one before the House. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Bill as a Private Members' Bill, it was not possible to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny, for example, which is a pity in many ways. With all humility and respect I ask if the House would consider adjourning the debate and inviting the Oireachtas committee to further examine this topic in great detail, taking on board many of the points made by Senators. That would mean the entire policy area could be examined, not just amendments that would arise on Committee Stage. Senator Boyhan made such a point when he asked that the Bill would be examined. I am willing to facilitate that, as is the Government, if colleagues here are supportive of that. I acknowledge that the Oireachtas committee is independent and we can only ask it to carry out the work, but I am sure the members of the committee would be most anxious to take on board the suggestions, ideas and proposals and invite members of the public and others to submit to the committee so that the issues could be examined and the committee could report back to the Houses and the debate could be picked up at a later Stage. In effect, it would just be adjourned today. That is my suggestion at this time, a Chathaoirligh. I am in your hands as to how you wish to proceed.</p>
